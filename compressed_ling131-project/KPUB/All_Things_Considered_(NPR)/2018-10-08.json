situation you know there are eighty eight percent of the countries around the world that do not recognize same sex marriage but you're you're not allowing that person who is a great representative for

ask you about that South Carolina case is that an outlier some of the data suggests that actually most on duty police officer deaths happened because of car accidents and not shootings so is this kind

will she is a police officer in meditation and we're looking at an investigative activity um whether they're handling you know persons with mental illness so it's not the topic violations ... and ... no longer be\nThe most frequent reasons I'm for this\nI mean you're saying that they're premeditated by what kind of of ... as it as it were\nNot people who for simple police officers and I'm of the government which of course they are and then motivated by the political beliefs that you know the police out though to oppress the police are biased racist and and um with Senate things the last two years\nIn general the climate on in the last few years is that on the police and United States so when when you put the two together the propensity towards violent behavior as an outcome of mental illness plus that triggering event then you have the the cut us off the outcome\nSo some days looking get let's take yesterday events and in the sea and the steps of the Supreme Court you think police officer is pushing back to demonstrate to us so somebody looking at police officers\nIdentify them as part of this ... this thought that the government that are demonstrating against so it doesn't

she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people don't really look up to her so there's a lot of support there's also of course\nKind of his movement that has always thought maybe she was secretly a conservative just because she never said\nAnything so they kind of had to read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is some disappointment on that side today well you\nTell us with did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now so does have a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left leaning political positions now I think it did\nIn some ways because when she made the break from Nashville and kind of declared herself going to the pop world she didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drives so much of the country music industry now her songs are being played on pop radio and\nShe'd have this broader audience I feel like it may have trapped her a little bit in the way that because she still has this country than she did still want you to appeal to them\nBut I think she probably didn't feel more free overall to share opinions\nYou know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure reading her image so what do you think why jumped into politics now what'd you think is going on with her\nThis is what

concert she doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that so she\nPosted her message after this she kind of alluded in her statement to events that have happened to her in the last couple of years and that's why she was speaking out\nAnd like she didn't say with those were um I think a big one that's impacted her the most was her sexual assault trial when a country music DJ sued her after he lost his job because she said he groped her and I meet and greet line\nAnd she counters sued him for assault and battery and she ended up winning and I think that experience really really

Philadelphia [noise]\nIt's time now for all tech considered\n[noise]\nThis month we're looking at our bodies the way technology sees them here in the U.S we're gradually getting used to facial recognition technology it's in our phones in some airport security systems on social media\nBut how good and and how secure is this technology\nTo answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she's a facial recognition expert at the University of Texas at Dallas welcome thank you now I feel like I'm seeing facial recognition\nPop up a lot more recently not just on smartphones but in airport security systems for example law enforcement has also experimented with it\nWas there some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed wider use of this software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system whereas older technology would do really quite well with well controlled facial images when elimination is good and the viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize I die\nYou point is frontal this new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that\nYou know change in age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better at the task\nYou know one recurring issue though we keep seeing is\nFacial recognition technology that miss identifies people of color much more frequently than it miss identifies white people uh there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as guerrillas\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistakes like that happen\n[noise] yeah this is a really excellent point\nThe current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically many many images of a particular person and an accurate label and so you get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different races\nSo you're saying there just a lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right so how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make the Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color\nYes oh the answer to the question technologically is quite simple if you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race bias that's a harder question\nSo even when facial recognition software does work when it is accurate there are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could use it\nIt is accurate there are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could uses technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters as someone who really understands where this\nScience is today how do you think about this um is face recognition technology abused um that's certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse whether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility\nIs something that has to be decided by societies and carefully looking at how it works and making decisions about what the right ways to use the technology are\nAlice O'Toole is head of the face perception research lab at the University of

right away\nAnd doesn't that sound like the most logical response so look you've ... you've poison people let's get that out of the food supply\nThe the food industry had been\nOrganizing itself to fight regulation probably at the point that widely starts these experiments in Nineteen oh to he had been advocating advocating advocating and working with congressman to try to get some kind of basic consumer protection ... regulations out there\nAnd if nothing else labeling and\nAs he does these experiments and as they catch the national attention which they did they were a front page news there were songs and you know musical numbers about them every one is suddenly realizing that there is a lot of bad ... stuffing their food is just a lot of bad stuff in their food and\nSo there was this in media pushback\nRight in which suddenly congressmen or on the side of food business or getting offered more money and the food industry actually organizes\nThey create a food Manufacturers Association and and and coalesce against making sure this doesn't happen and they were phenomenally effective\nAnd yet despite these long fought fights it spans decades today there isn't lead and formaldehyde in arsenic in food the way that there was a hundred years ago progress really was made\nYes once this first food safety law\nWas a hundred years ago progress really was made\n[noise] yes once this\nFirst
