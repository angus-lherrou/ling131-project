well you each first just tell me why you think this year has attracted a record number of algae BP to people to run for office\nYou know I think what we're seeing is that is we have broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican are states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone\nAmerican society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run Amelia ... what do you\nThink yeah this is Gina I think are finally I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu and I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an allergy ... woman being a first generation American being uh\nAnd I say that as a Republican or states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone American society is is

table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an allergy ... woman being a first generation American being a veteran\nI think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people were going to carry on water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this race wants to try and get under our skin wants to try and play my games at the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time\nMontanans are definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of government um we actually had a ballot initiative on our primary ballots that would've uh regulated where trans individual could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYou know the three of you not only represent different parties in different parts of the United states you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty five dreaming you're thirty seven Amelia you're twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades in the way it relates to algae to Q. people do think that shapes your experience\nThis is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell I remember that in\nTrans individuals could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities um and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYet the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty five dreaming you're thirty seven Amelia you're twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades in the way it relates to algae to Q. people do think that shapes your experience\nYeah this is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that and I've got some wonderful fellows in and turns on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I said don't ask don't tell us so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so and so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan pave the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world looked like Thirty years ago for someone that's my agent to uh [laughter]\nAnd I I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable but as a young person I recognize how much ground has been made altogether for folks my age\nThis is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance\nAnd we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but when you consider where we were back then and\nFull but as a young person I recognize how much ground has been made altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance\nAnd we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but when you consider where we were back then\nAnd how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long term process\nThe Trump Administration has rolled back algae beat Duke he writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group do you think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican than it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans\nHe's asked for advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nTime I mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. T. Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties\nThere are certainly in both parties folks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again we're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae beauty acute candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there\nUm were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially a trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we use of all the overall national landscape for future LTV tiki candidates as well do you know\nYeah I mean I can tell you a you won't believe it I Know but there are some folks in Washington and Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what Amelia discussed which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nYou know one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just\nUm you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nYeah one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just want to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having on young people is more significant and deeper\nThan we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure gene and Amelia do as well to those young people that are falling behind us [noise] I Want to thank all three\nOf you for joining us today Dan in is is running for

you pleasure pleasure to speak with all of you as well [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\nI'm skeptical of whether that's going to be elevated as a major issue up throughout this campaign for both governor and US Senate\nOr despite all the problems we've had here with red tide and the algae and sea level rise environmental issues are not polling nearly as importantly as health care and education and the economy what a hurricane does to alter the dynamics of politics and campaigning is it reinforces\nTo people that without government you have nothing in in an emergency you know everyone's asking

heritage action says that could happen during the lame duck session even of Republicans lose in November\nMany Republicans won the ability to finish the job they've campaigned on this for over eight years\nNo matter which party controls Congress next year Anderson says the Trump Administration will likely keep trying to chip away that Obamacare for example the administration has already relax

Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there\nUm were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially a trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we have all the overall national landscape for future algae B.

bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity

stopped by or email and say I just want to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing

under President Obama and is now with Brookings she says Trump is following through on a position he took more than a year ago\nOn his first foreign trip when he went to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia he said explicitly we're not here to lecture we're not here to tell other people how to live what to do who to be or how to worship\nAnd that statement sets aside decades' worth of bipartisan American commitments as well as the commitment of a range of western democracies to international human rights law\nBeyond Saudi Arabia or do you see a link between President Trump's America First transaction based approach to international affairs and the actions of dictators overseas\nI think if I were a dictator especially one with a decent relationship with Washington a cooperative partnership with Washington and I heard the American president say that he's not here to lecture me I Would certainly take that as an understanding that no matter what I might do at home I shouldn't expect\nAny direct consequences in my relationship with Washington\nIf you take for example Philippine president ... uh who has picked up President Trump's phrase allergy about fake news and it's also engaged in a raft of extrajudicial killings of political opponents as well as a drug dealers\nThere's a lot of reason to be concerned that when President Trump goes on TV and is asked about a ... attempted murder of journalists and says well we kill people to that that's going to lead someone like president to ... to think that he can get away with doing the same thing there\nWere lots of instances during the

News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Ari Shapiro women in prison are far more likely than men to get punished for lesser violations of prison rolls NPR's investigative team has been digging into this disparity this week\nToday NPR's Joseph Shapiro takes us to a state that is rewriting the rules for discipline and women's prisons here's this sound we associate with prison [noise]\nHeavy steel doors bang shot [noise]\nThese are the doors at the entrance to the Iowa correctional institution for women but once visitors like us walk through these doors and get inside the prison that's it\nThere are no more heavy steel doors for the women and that's not a somebody here [noise]\nWalk through these doors and get inside the prison that's it\nThere are no more heavy steel doors for the women that's not a family here\nBecause this prison is new and it's different\nInside the razor wire this place cooks kind of like a college campus with red brick buildings there knew just a few years old connected by concrete pathways lots of open space and landscape gardens with flowers and picnic benches for the inmates\nThey set out here from John and tell them to ask depending on what level there and that's the warden showed dom showing us around and do what we do that and the community of right now are for outside and our yard with ... and I guess it's still a prison\nThe Warren is the first to point that out and prisons are still harsh places in some ways women's prisons are especially harsh because across the country women get disciplined at higher rates than men for smaller violations of prison rules\nThey're often two to three times more likely to get in trouble for things like insolence disobedience talking back to a corrections officer\nMatch with NPR and middle school of journalism at Northwestern university found when we collected data from women's and men's prisons in Fifteen states even small infraction can have big consequences women get time at it to the President's Day go to solitary confinement or lose visitation or phone privileges\nThat matters because more than half of women in prison or the mothers of children Eighteen or younger\nThis prison than I what is notable it's trying to make change but it's not easy partly because there are so many rules\nEven today it could get tickets about wearing their sweat shirt inside out and we're like why is that a security issue that's really not a security issue maybe she had to ... I have one\nWe're like why is that a security issue that's really not a security issue maybe she had a copy stain I have one\nThat's the word and show dom in two thousand sixteen our data found women at this prison compared to men of other presidents were three times more likely to get punished for the violation of being disruptive\nNow Don ... corrections officers to give out fewer tickets for breaking the rules that are prisoners can alter their uniform\nIt was written for men's prison were assured inside out her sleeves rolled up might signaling gang affiliation\nThat this isn't gang related it's just women\nWant to have some control over how they look about how they present themselves\nNominate putting in place of practice called gender response of corrections it's the idea that there are important differences between men and women in prison\nEvery corrections officers being trained that women take different pass the prison they're less likely than men to commit violent crimes in prison are less likely to be violent and that women do better when prison is less punitive\nSo Thomas changing rules especially about clothing and tone corrections officers to listen to the women more and to demand compliance last [noise]\nTell me about a battle over there\n[laughter]\nOn the mental health ward Stacey runner is in charge of Bella a therapy dog a towering great Dane with

conduct credits those are days taken off her sentence for good behavior and she lost privileges she couldn't buy things from the commissary\nWonder is serving time per second degree murder now she says the change in the way women are treated here helped regrow she works on the mental health ward as a mentor to the other women\nI'm trying to contribute as much they can't institution so I'm not so shame [noise] you know and it has helped me with my own my own shame them I don't regret the\nPsychiatric unit and the newly built prison was designed to be different women are free to walk about large common room with ... therapy animals there are large TV's a carton and lots of natural light there are still solitary confinement cells although fewer women end up in them now\nDr Jerome Greenfield has come to help show us around too so\nThey're forced to live here and then\nHe runs health services for all of Iowa's prisons several years ago he quit a psychiatry practice to work at this prison\nThrough the years in my practice I thought I was a seasoned psychiatrist I thought I'd seen it all\nBut he wasn't prepared for the level of trauma and the women who come to prison\nI mean I saw patients that had been chained for months at a time in a basement\nSold his property\nVictims of satanic rituals\nBut it goes even beyond that\nBecause then in their homes many of them were beaten to the point of having traumatic brain injuries\nIn prison have long histories of being victims of violence too but research in gender response of corrections\nBrain injuries men in prison that long histories of being victims of violence too but research in gender response of corrections finds that women before they get the prison with the victims of even more trauma Seventy find the Ninety percent were victims of sexual or physical violence\nSo one thing that's changed here the end of the usual strip search now women can take off one piece of clothing at a time and then put it back on show dumb the warden\nLately the correctional officer and really it's a Human Services worker it's a customer service\nSome presidents that welcome the change in discipline policies others say there are bigger problems here like not having enough corrections officers I talked to one staffer who didn't want to go on tape or fear of getting in trouble she complained about the warns new approach meant that in her words the inmates are running the prison\nThe war has heard that before recently from a newly hired corrections officer\nAnd she brought for which some concerns and what she said is you know worried and there are some people saying that the inmates are running the prison and I'm like well they do there is one of you to Ninety six women so let's talk about how that looks and how do we get a Ninety six cannot cash problems\nTom wanted to show me one of their place in the prison the old mental health ward is the one building from the old prison that wasn't torn down

very ... NPR's Jackie Northam\nSaudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has developed a close relationship with Jared Kushner President Trump's close advisor and son in law during ... time at the White House that relationship now faces more scrutiny after ... disappearance\nNPR White house reporter Ayesha Rascoe is here to tell us more about Cushing has role in shaping U.S foreign policy including port Saudi Arabia Ayesha hello so what can you tell us about Jared Kushner's relationship with Mohammed bin Salman\nWe know that they've had at least five meetings in person since Trump took office their first meeting at the White House was in March twenty Seventeen and they seem to have hit it off they're both in their thirties and there I was obviously and both both in very powerful positions it was Christian or who reportedly convince Trump\nTo go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first\nForeign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to ah Canada or Mexico first\nA cushion he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech to celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really ...\nMany leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to be the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\nIt it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this but President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide uh this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on ... uh and that continued as president\nAnd so a big part of prisoners portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east and coming up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that\nA U.S ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley was in the oval office recently and she talked about ... rolling working on that peace plan and other trade deals\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared of August there is such a\nGenius that no one understand\nSo Haley had nice things to say about ... and about Trump\nOr but there have been reports that former secretary of state former secretary of state Rex Tillerson was not happy with questionnaires a influence on foreign policy and both ... and ... they really approach international relations in a different way they focus on personal chemistry personality pretty much above all\nTo now with this controversy where the White House was getting daily questions about it and for secretary of state of flown to Saudi Arabia where things stand today with Christian or on the crowd press\nWe don't really know it's not clear at this moment a cushion or was one of the White House officials who was reaching out to uh Mohammed bin some on a after could show gee went missing Mitt went missing the White House said he and other officials\nOut to uh Mohammed bin some on a\nAfter ... showed gee went missing ... went missing the White House said he and other officials are pressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation is open and transparent a but right now the crown prince is denying knowledge of this disappearance uh one of the criticisms of cushion there has been\nFrom an experienced diplomat is that because he lacks experience that it may be easy to manipulate him a and for foreign leaders to manipulate him I talked to Brett brewing who was a director of global engagement for the Obama White house\nAnd he said he worries that Christian or could act as a back channel ah to Trump for kind of outside leaders and go outside the national security chain\nAnd then there's the question of financial ties between the Christian or family Trump and the Saudis\nYes and a lot of that is not clear because we don't have a President Trump's tax returns and some of that is not clear at some of these dealings are are not transparent up\nBut we do know that President Trump said on the campaign trail that he liked the Saudis because they had bought forty and fifty million dollars and apartments from him and there have been reports uh that cushion or a cushion or a backed are associated of firms may have been trying to get money from Saudi backed a fun\nNPR's Ayesha Rascoe thanks a lot\nThank you [laughter] you're listening to

the house but when you've got a real different set of circumstances than doesn't seem so\nSo strange to do and it kills people from two thousand five to twenty Seventeen Seventy one people died from carbon monoxide poisoning after a hurricane or tropical storm the most common reason for these kinds of debts is that people put the generator in their homework garage so ... says don't do that\nMake

about this political editor\nSo what would a hard Brexit means for British and European economies\nGeorge Parker has written about this piece of political editor at the Financial Times joining us from Brussels where he is following the negotiations welcome back to the program hello if there were to be no deal at all what immediate changes would take effect on march twenty ninth when the u._k. leaves the\nWell they could be quite severe it all depends on what kind of no deal we actually end up with if it was a totally chaotic an acrimonious no deal where\nEverybody ended up throwing plates and each other in person left to you in very bad Dutch and indeed then you could see some very serious impacts of the border so you would have\nA immediate you'd have to check some old goods coming in and out to the u._k. which doesn't happen at the moment that will quickly to huge queues the ports coming into person and very quickly the companies in person which rely on seamless flow of goods across the borders in Europe they would run out parts factories were closed down\nOn the bank of England is focused this could be actually a very chaotic and damaging ... for the British economy which could last for months there's all sorts of contingency planning guy on the u._k. in case this happens to cook stockpiling of medicines\nThere's the fresh food wrote could run out very quickly there are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool it will be quite bad and the pursuit company will take a very big ...\nSo you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been a some sort of stockpiling some certain types of medicines\nOnce you introduce border checks the place where there are ... you can have she's running for miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile cues things just wouldn't be coming through so so there are concerns that they will be shortages set in the in more distant from the poor so\nPretty serious sets us in our ears are being considered by ministers when you look at the longer term you can\nThey will be shortages set in the in more distant parts from the port so pretty serious sets us in our series of being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasury has made an estimate of what was happening in the medium term if Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock it cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy in red tape at the borders and that without to business costs\nYou will make it ... percent less attractive place to invest because of a you have less access to the European market to potential fatalities as well\nSo the Treasury's estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about eight percent smaller than it otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big\nHits it's bit akin to sort of an aircraft gradually losing hide she wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but over time person will be a poor place and otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe if UK leaves with how to deal\nWith the rest of your this has always been something that the euro skeptics in person of clung to the idea that Europe wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because person as a major destination for European expos so they were the ... effect on all manner of European produces whether it's a new one produces in France cop she says in Germany\nOr you name it they ... they will be effective because UK off to breaks it will become the biggest single export destination for all the all the European Union countries but the point is is an asymmetric shock waltz it's true that the other European countries would suffer as a result of new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from the deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing\nLate rides there's about five percent chance that you never come back to where again\nAnd the question is how can we repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between ... and its rider we tested different kinds of apologies\nAnd we found the right kind of apology could basically increased revenues by one to two percent of the wrong kind of apology could decreased revenue that went to two percent which we tested apologies and involved sort of commitments to do better or or not what we saw was that a commitment to do better in the future it's it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we'd shock these writers for three months after the apology\nAnd we found that basically two or three months later these commitments have you been in the future\nActually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to the future and then the ... and do better because then maybe maybe for some of them had another bad experience and that as a result the those people punished but more than than the control group that got no apology at all\nDid they ever had a good effect I'm\nNot in our data um [noise] so [laughter]\nI think they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect ... or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet it seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability\nI think part of it is that our brains sort of works on script singer sticks and so you know when we enter in a relationship with a company we sort of like the same sort of scripts and risks triggering our brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from my company\nSo what were the what would the apologies that really worked for ... like what was that magic\nThe magic was money [laughter]\nYeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um\nWe tested apologies with or without a coupon and we we which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones that sort of increased revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWe tested apologies with or without a coupon and which we which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones that sort of increased revenues was a just a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or with their certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out the the best language but we found that there is no statistical difference between the different languages is money it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that she might may ... ... it wasn't a message to sort of committed to be more in the future\nDo you think this like carries over into personal relationships that I'm so sorry that I like whatever was late meeting for ten years ten bucks [laughter]\nYou know here's a box of chocolates right or here's your editors and flowers oh eight\nFlowers and candy things always take on a whole new significance um did it has it changed the way like you apologize [laughter]\nWhen people don't always wanted to ask you this question of course they do I'm curious\nI think the main ways change with that because all my friends and my family and know that I study apologies than they would always be skeptical whenever I Apologize so I have to like go an extra mile to sort of sound like Ernest insincere morsel because people are

Canadians want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters\nWho had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint has smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use our our ground be found in the midst of all into the United states so yes that's possible\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same\nThat border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis we reached out to win Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use when founders welcome to the program thank you for having me on\nWho you listen to that whole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today to be crystal clear\nThe United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the matrix based upon that\nSo just to parse this out there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was legal there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that could be grounds for burning somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister true though he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister because right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the CBP is ...\nUndesirable you know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law at the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation of less chaotic going forward\nWell I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which has taken a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admit that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\n... he's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today in Canada and what problems that might cause at the U.S Canada border Mr ... thanks for your time thank you very much\nThe state of Florida has some of the nation's toughest building codes at least most of the state\nThe rules are less stringent in the panhandle that's where Mexico beach is and that's where hurricane Michael made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile an hour wins a week ago entire blocks were flattened NPR's Greg Allen reports many are now calling for revised stricter building codes on Florida's panhandle\nIn Mexico beach Lance Irwin is one of the lucky ones his house is still standing he rode out the storm in his home several blocks from the beach\nThe garage doors shaking it was like somebody's trying to get in and the inside door was shaking I knew the rough had gone at that point because

former head of FEMA and a long time urgency management official in Florida he points to one reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach in other communities in the panhandle\nIn many cases it's old construction that predates the building code\nAnd this is a part of Florida that's what I called the ... floor on a bunch of high rises is not a lot of construction\nThis is all generational of Florida families any of them or just said that Trump folks that fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade in Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring storm shutters and reinforced concrete block construction for all buildings structures must be able to withstand winds up to one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour\nSeveral years later Florida revised it's state wide building code John history no structural engineer in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on probability of storms in the past and all of that is sort of a goes down as you go further north and Florida\nThere have been fewer intense hurricanes in the panhandle but elsewhere in the state and some north Florida communities new construction you'd only withstand wind speeds one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less far below the one hundred and fifty five miles per hour winds scene in hurricane Michael\nIn the aftermath of the storm as local state and federal officials assess the damage a consensus is emerging that building codes along Florida's\nSeen in hurricane Michael in the aftermath of the storm as local state and federal officials assess the damage a consensus is emerging that building codes along Florida's panhandle need to be stricter David provide is a professor of civil engineering at the University of Florida he's part of a team that's

damaged houses that were well engineered\nFormer FEMA ahead Craig view gate has long believed the wind speed standards along Florida's panhandle were too low he says when policymakers develop them

Cruz declined to participate so we're war will answer the voters' questions himself Wade Goodwyn NPR News\nIs defending its admissions policy in uh Boston courtroom this week the question is whether the school discriminates against Asian American applicants\nHarvard is defending its admissions policy in uh Boston courtroom this week the question is whether the school discriminates against Asian American applicants the case could go to the Supreme Court with broad implications for affirmative action and schools\nYesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race ... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she's a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered great thanks for having me why do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race nearly treats and illusion of diversity and I'd love to see admissions policies change not to have racing it\nNow Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from a list of factors that Harvard is considering when it assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to it raises sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but oftentimes the factory that decision is based on\nI think Harvard is saying that they don't do that but what ... missions has been showing in court the past few days and has really brought to light is that oftentimes it is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents filtered missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of did this with Jewish applicants as well\nAnd sort of use the personal rating to artificially keep their numbers lower although there is going higher and everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case have alleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost as a front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups and that at the end of the day this loss\nUsing Asian Americans almost as a front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups and that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think about argument\nI don't think that that's true at all clearly affirmative action has failed and at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how affirmative action policies are impacting different communities\n[noise] I'd like you to respond to something that Harvard senior Sally ... said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial he was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead\nMerit means nothing without context what do you think of that idea\n[noise] so I think that a lot of admissions processes should be based on just married\nBut I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important\nBut I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at met in the context of race but again like I said married in the context of economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that all of us sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus\nThings includes race or not yeah I Would agree with that I Would say that\nAll of us sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever the sort of benefits that are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to ... admissions 'em and instead focus on something like poverty\nBecause when we focus on something like race I think it creates a sort of division in sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race\nWon't tell me about ... thank you so much for talking
