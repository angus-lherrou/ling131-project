considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Audie Cornish we're spending a few days looking at a striking disparity in prisons across the United states women are disciplined more frequently and often more harshly than men that's the finding of an investigation by NPR and the middle school of journalism at Northwestern university\nNPR's Joseph Shapiro and reporter Jessica papa that found that women are punished disproportionately for minor infractions those violations can have major repercussions like the loss of good conduct credits or solitary confinement here's Joe\nWe collected data on prison discipline from Fifteen states in all but two women get discipline to higher rates than men [noise] what's most striking is that women get punished far more for minor violations of prison rules at rates we estimated often two to three times higher for what prisons classify\nA smaller fraction petty stuff\nYou can get written up for a not closing your doors and get written up for jumping on the phone without permission\nOr if you just want to just picture room up nice in just takes inflated die you appeal the case you get written up for that that's the story of Williams and it made up the central California women's facility in show show a California you get written up for going out of bounds in somebody else's room\nAre out of bounds in the hallway\nPrison rules at rates we estimated often two to three times higher for what prisons classify as smaller infractions\nPetty stuff you can get written up for a night closing doors you get written up for jumping on the phone

California women's facility in show show a California\nDid you get written up for going out of bounds in somebody else's room\nAre out of bounds in the hallway [noise] it's just basically everything you get written up for\nOur numbers show that in California women compared to men get twice the disciplinary tickets for disobeying in order\nAnd more than twice as many for what's called disrespect in Vermont we found women are more than three times as likely to get in trouble for making what's called derogatory comments in Rhode Island they get more than three times the tickets for disobedience\nThose tickets have consequences women lose good conduct credits that kind of time at it to their stay in prison or lose bone in visitation privileges or go to solitary confinement in Rhode Island women were more than three times as likely as men to end up in solitary confinement for disobedience\n[noise] prisons were built for men and the rules for discipline were set up to

small but\nAlmost five times more likely to get in trouble for a lesser offense called minor insolence\nAnd they also really if they seen injustice with another woman in a prison or something that happened they want to fix it like they want to be the mom that's going to come in and mediate between people and fix the problem\n... told us she likes it that women prisoners are this way but she

Ayesha Rascoe here to tell us more about Cushing has role in shaping U.S foreign policy including toward Saudi Arabia Ayesha hello so what can you tell us about Jared Kushner's relationship with my ...\nWe know that they've had at least five meetings in person since Trump took office their first meeting at the White House was in March twenty Seventeen and they seem to have hit it off they're both in their thirties and there I was obviously and both\nBoth in very powerful positions it was Christian or who reportedly convince Trump to go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first foreign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to\nAh Canada or Mexico first a cushion he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech to celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to be the point person\nThe other the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to be the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\nIt it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this but President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide uh this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on ... uh and that continued as president\nAnd so a big part of prisoners portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east and coming up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that\nA U.S ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley was in the oval office recently and she talked about Christmas rolling working on that peace plan and other trade deals\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared Nevada there is such a genius that no one understand\nSo Haley had nice things to say about ... and about Trump\nOr but there have been reports that former secretary of state former secretary of state Rex Tillerson was not happy with questionnaires ah influence on foreign policy and both ... and ... they really approach international relations in a different way they focus on personal chemistry and personality pretty much above all\nTo now with this controversy where the White House was getting daily questions about it and for secretary of state of flown to Saudi Arabia where things stand today with Christian or on the crowd press\nWe don't really know it's not clear at this moment a cushion there was one of the White House officials who was reaching out to uh Mohammed bin so I'm On a\nAfter ... showed gee went missing Mitt went missing the White House said he and other officials oppressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation is open and transparent a but right now the crown prince has denied any knowledge of this disappearance uh one of the criticisms of pushing her head\nInvestigation is open and transparent a but right now the crown prince is denying knowledge of this disappearance uh one of the criticisms of cushion there has been\nFrom an experienced diplomat is that because he lacks experience\nThat it may be easy to manipulate him a and for foreign leaders to manipulate him I talked to Brett brewing who was a director of global engagement for the Obama White house and he said he worries that Christian or could act as a back channel\nAh to Trump for kind of outside leaders and go outside the national security change\nAnd then there's the question of financial ties between the Christian or family Trump and the Saudis\nYes and a lot of that is not clear because we don't have a President Trump's tax returns and some of that is not clear at\nSome of these dealings are are not transparent\nUp but we do know that President Trump said on the campaign trail that he liked the Saudis because they had bought forty and fifty million dollars and apartments from him and there have been reports are that cushion or a Christian or a backed or associate it a firms may have been trying to get money from Saudi backed a fun\nNPR's Ayesha Rascoe thanks a lot\nThank you you're listening to all things considered from
