bit about that\nThey're making their way to Mexico in hopes of reaching the U.S border I'm now President Trump has suggested that they're not just a family's looking for a better life what is he saying instead\nThe president tweeted this week without offering any evidence that quote criminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in with this caravan\nHe was pressed on that in the oval office today and conceded there's no proof to that claim but he continues to insist the caravan an illegal immigration more generally pose a serious threat to the country certainly you have people\nComing up through the southern border from the middle east and other places that are not appropriate for our country and Tom not letting them and\nNow it's not unheard of for people from the middle east to try to cross the border illegally from Mexico but it is extremely rare already\nOut of more than three hundred thousand people who are apprehended along the southern border last year only about eighty word for word from countries in the middle east and reporters who've been traveling with the caravan say they have not seen any middle Easterners in that group\nOr there's no evidence then of Middle Eastern infiltration the president has not presented any why is he talking\nAt least earners in that group ah there's no evidence then of Middle Eastern infiltration the president has not presented any why is he talking about it\nThe illegal immigration and the threat of terrorism have been potent rhetorical weapons for Donald Trump since he first launched his White House campaign more than three years ago\nHe believes and there is some polling data to support this that illegal immigration is an important issue for Republicans he has been very clear on his plans to harp on hot button issues like immigration and the Supreme Court in the home stretch of the midterm campaign\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nAnd the third on that Leslie was that tax cuts which I think

in elections project I asked her about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nOur country has a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but what we saw in\nRight after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty ten\nAlright so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations closed polling locations and move them we see states imposing strict photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of id in order to be able to cast a ballot that will count we're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling

of removing voters from the rolls um some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nUm what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting purged from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are\nOn the role some cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person hasn't voted and two and three cycles or look we're not sure if this person's still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\nEffort [noise] um we want\nElection and administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls\nThe problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late a critically we're also seeing that purging is happening\nIn states that used to be required under the voting rights act to be able to demonstrate that there are election process as we're not going to be discriminatory and we're saying that those areas are having an even higher increase in the number of people that are being perch from the rolls\n[noise] um even calling ms voter suppression um do the courts agree with\nSo many laws in place it seems like maybe there is an open door to all these kinds of laws around voting\nUp many of the strict\nSeems like maybe there is an open door to all these kinds of laws around
