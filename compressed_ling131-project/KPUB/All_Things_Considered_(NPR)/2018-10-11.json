losses for the S. and P. five hundred\nA rising interest rates make stocks less valuable and there's concern in the market about just how high rates will go the Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually and it has suggested it will stop praising benchmark rage between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go to get\nThere so the way I understand

five hundred a rising interest rates make stocks less valuable and there's concern in the market about just how high rates will go\nThe Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually and it has suggested it was stopped rising benchmark rates between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go to get\nThere so the understand said usually raises rates to stave off inflation right right or their ears and inflation right now well\nFederal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said recently he doesn't see inflation accelerating however the economy is clearly very strong and the unemployment rate is at a fifty year low so\nThere's concern in the markets that wages will begin to rise more rapidly and that could create inflation pressures so you're saying the economy remains strong ... good for the stock market economy is strong in the U.S and most commentators are are saying today sell off is not the end of the bull market in stocks here but while the U.S economy\nRemains strong Europe has cooled a bit as\nHave emerging markets in the IMF\nGave a less than glowing assessment of the global economy this week or less going than it did just a few

particular area is that the market that had been hurt by a sell off\nFor virtually all sectors of the markets sold off today a wiping out all the stock gain since mid summer but the tech sector has been hit the hardest and it's been one of the foundations of this bull market in fact uh the tech heavy NASDAQ index lost four percent of its value today\nAnd that's and the five hundred which also

said the selling toward the end of the day which took the Dow down from around five hundred points to eight hundred and thirty points down\nWas due to a machine trading driven by algorithms that reached levels that call for selling\nA given the strength of the U.S economy and the likelihood of continued high levels of profits in American businesses it's difficult to believe the market will

about tourism in Egypt for example\nIt was again sort of a broad based initiative but she and that was her undertaking this awkward\nBecause her husband is known for his America First agenda for wanting to slash foreign aid and their shoes on a trip highlighting all the good that American foreign aid does was that awkward\nIt's that strange sort of juxtaposition between the first lady and

what kind of conversations are going to have to happen to figure out how to move forward the\nFirst thing we need to do is find out what went wrong what failed in this rocket there's a lot of information people be able to sift through video of it but also the sensors on board then we need to see how can we fix it was it a design problem a manufacturing problem who knows\nThat and once you know that you can fix it then you can set a timeline if that in three months from now than no big deal but if it's going to take a year or two years\nAnd then we need other plants bowling is building a rocket that can take people to the space station or ... or a spaceship SpaceX is building a ship that can take people to the space station maybe they could be accelerated maybe they could fly before the Russians are going to be ready to fly again and when do we bring the crew back from the space station all of those questions need to be analyzed\nThe land and they were expecting to return home and now that return could be delayed correct\nThey flew up in a different so he was ... to the space station it's sort of like a lifeboat or their their their ride home it's there they can come home anytime they want but if they on dark and come home\nThey are basically abandoning ship the space station would be empty and it's a big enough and complicated enough shift that after a little wild things start to go wrong and there'd be nobody there to fix them so it really causes a lot of risk for the space station to leave it on man\nSo people will be looking really hard at all of the limits

after a group of senators sent him a letter requiring him to consider sanctions against Saudi Arabia Senator Chris Murphy is also calling on Trump to dump supporting the Saudi military campaign in Yemen\nThat bombing campaign in our participation in it is predicated on our belief that the Saudis are telling the truth but they are not intentionally trying to kill civilians given the fact that it is likely they are not telling the truth about what happened to Jamal 'cause show you why would we believe them that they are not intentionally hitting civilians inside Yemen\nJordan the former

Michele ... NPR News the state department\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nScientists think they have answered a critical question about how our eyes develop the ability to see colors\nInvolved the process that usually takes place in the womb and out of sight but as NPR's Jon Hamilton reports researchers got around that optical by growing human retinas unit dish\nA human retina requires a lot of patients it takes between seven months in a year your Eldridge should know she's a graduate student in a lab at Johns Hopkins university and for the past few years it's been her job to keep dishes of immature retinal cells alive so for the first week of their lives\nCity and for the past few years it's been her job to keep dishes of immature retinal cells alive\nFor the first week of their life I take care of them every day and then after about Fifteen days I can change the media on them every other day and so there's a little bit more independent\nElders boss Bob Johnston says these clusters of cells develop into a three D. structure known as a written oh org annoyed it\nReally looks and acts like a developing retina that you would see in a baby\nSo it's able to detect both light and color Johnston is an assistant professor in the biology department and until a few years ago his lab had been studying vision in flies but Johnson an elder written saw a chance to try something much more ambitious\nWe discuss this crazy idea of could we use the human retinal org annoyed to study how we get the different colors and things sell in our eyes\nJohnston says using human cells was key because you can't study human color vision and I'll fly or even a mouse\nMice don't fence read they don't have these red detecting cells and so we really have to study this in developing human tissue to get any insight into how it works\nJohnston ... knew that in a human fetus cells that detect blue light up here first then comes cells that respond to red and green light and research on animals suggested that fibroid hormone was involved in the development of these colors and things so called home so he had Eldridge do an experiment\nI added thyroid harm on to the dish during their development and we got more red green ... developing I'm In Oregon and and so we got really excited\nIt would take years and many more experiments to confirm that thyroid hormone was actually triggering the emergence of color vision and the teams still hasn't figured out what causes some cones to go on to become even more specialized by detecting only read or only green\nBeijing and the teams still hasn't figured out what causes some cones to go on to become even more specialized by detecting only read or only green but Johnson says his lab is ready to take on two new goals\nOne is to restore color vision to people that are color blind but perhaps just as important there is a disorder called macular degeneration that is the leading cause of vision loss\nMacular degeneration affects the macular an area of the retina that provides high resolution vision\nThat condition it's been hard to study though because mice don't have a macular\nSo Johnston hopes to learn more by having his lab create macular Oregon writes Steven backer of the national eye Institute says studies like the one at Johns Hopkins are helping to resolve doubts about whether retinas grown in a dish can truly mimic those in the human eye these\nStudies show that the similarity is quite high\nAnd Becker says the eye Institute is trying to encourage the creation of more retinal org annoyed by sponsoring a scientific competition with a million dollars in prize money\nIt's important that we understand how nature controls the development of the retina so that we can understand better why things go wrong and\nDisease and how to develop better treatments the new research appears in the journal science Jon Hamilton NPR News [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nYou're listening to
