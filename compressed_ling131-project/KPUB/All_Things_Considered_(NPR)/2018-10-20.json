Phoenix, Arizona President Trump is campaigning here tonight Arizona is a state where the G O P dominates politics right now both of US Senators the governor most state lawmakers they are all Republican\nBut that could change because waves of Latino will become eligible to vote in the coming years and they tend to vote democratic which means Arizona could flip from red to blue\nUnless the Republican Party can win over the growing number of Latino voters in this state and to get a sense of that challenge I traveled to a town just west of Phoenix called ... it's about eighty percent Latino [noise]\n\nI'm In a restaurant serving port those out got as and tacos and I bumped into a guy who could uh give the Republicans some hope\nSo we we handle our home especially in Hispanic community is the way Trump wants to run the U.S [noise]\nRamon Baron owns a small business repairing floors he's a registered Republican and he says he appreciates the values Trump stands\nFor security order you know you need certain order and in your home\nYou know the issues that came with the wall\nYou know building a wall doesn't get any of it is a good idea because I just installed not even two weeks ago a security door and my door already have a door but I Would have better door when you're a ... year old son he's fourteen years old and it's funny that he told me somehow the door makes me feel safer\nIt made me think you know that you know it doesn't make sense more more metal barricades\nHe told me somehow that door makes me feel safer\nIt made me think you know that you know it doesn't make sense more more metal their keeps\nThe worst people out you know\nStep outside and within seconds you'll run into people who vehemently just agree with the ... like evil Hernandez a truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker the reason most Latinos will never vote Republican\nYou heard of the news or coming up with all these laws that make it more difficult for people for any country in the world to a ... status you've seen the kid's been separated from the families of the water I think all that reflects pretty bad on the Republican Party if you ask me I mean who's ordering all that you know Trump and his agenda\nThere is reason Hernandez has view may not be worrying Republicans right now\nRepublicans are banking on two things\nJuices Garcia hits the Latino public policy center at Arizona State university\nAre banking on that there's enough white voters to win the election today and their banking that there's going to be short memory for Latino voters tomorrow\nBut Garcia says data don't lie Latinos will turn Arizona majority minority by twenty thirty and a whole lot of them are going to be us citizens\nTwenty Eighteen could be the last election that Republicans can win without also winning the Latino vote\nSo the question for Republicans is how will they persuade those Latino voters to join their teeth [noise]\nI'm not a baseball diamond in a small park in northern feeding and the district of state representative Tony Rivera\nHas any of your friends or or any other members of the Latino community giving you a hard time for becoming a Republican\nI'm people have given me a hard time like well what do they say well they'll say um how could you be uh\nThe Latino community giving you a hard time for becoming a Republican\nI'm people have given me a hard time like well what do they say well they'll say um how could you be a Republican and when the Republicans don't support\n'em Hispanics they don't support immigration reform\nAnd his response to them is take a look at all of the other values of the Republican Party they mesh perfectly with Latinos face the traditional family small business entrepreneurship\nIt's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district as he knocked on doors [noise]\nI'm only going to take some time I was telling you they're almost the Republican running for realize I'm I'm here answering the questions they may have topics including our budget education immigration is a hot topic\nOf the show that people focus too much on the people coming from Mexicali\nSeparating families isn't the way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nWhen they know I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised here and the parents are from Mexico\nAnd um this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country and opportunity and I know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans are smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask ... if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security\nOne that legalize or people who are here who want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now this\nLike a different platform than the one the Trump Administration switching um\nAnd this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThis sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration is pushing I'm\nA I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is but I just mentioned\nIndependence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate like you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east\nStill I asked to see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection Doug do see on the ballot and its Doug ... agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters\nA guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry it was Diaz who approached do see for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support certain language doesn't support certain policies that the national Republican mood and may may call for he is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them we need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that no I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juice\nIf Republicans want to appeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric\nI Want to appeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way he does\nThey see what's going on to see how they treat us and\nSo my kids you got to vote you got to go to ... vote and they said that we were ready to go over there over\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be field for generations to come\nAs a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republicans to separate themselves from the broader party governor juicy will be appearing on stage at a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight with President Trump [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nNew is shouting ties we take a closer look the kingdom faces scrutiny over the alleged murder of ... was President Trump pitch the campaign trail and us mercenaries\nBut all indications from the administration or that they really do not want to break with the Saudis they're not ready to take on a the crown prince Mohammed bin so I'm On a because they seem to see him as an ally and Trump is suggested that he is a personal ow\nI Hope so it is not down only to the president or Congress has a role in this as President Trump has pointed out with Senator Lindsey Graham has weighed in Republican Senator Graham has weighed in tonight saying he's very skeptical\nOf the Saudi version of events Brea is you know there's been a drumbeat for sanctions there's been a drumbeat from Congress about taking a tougher line are you watching for that drew me to get louder\n[noise] yeah I mean that honest thing remains to be seen I think ultimately though that this incident doesn't necessarily mean that we should reorient our entire Middle East strategy I mean at the end of the day we have to remember that ... is not just a columnist for the Washington Post but he was also a personal friend of a summit\nWe have to remember that ... is not just a columnist for the Washington Post but he was also a personal friend of us I'm a bin Laden\nAnd was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood does as an individual you know\nWe have to take all of that into account and I also think that when you are dealing with who was operating as a journalist for the Washington Post and who is a U.S resident into it now appears was murdered I Know at the consulate I and of course we do have an interest in making sure that us permanent residents are protected as well that's something that we're interested in doing\nUm when you are talking about the middle east we are talking about a lot of bad\nActors here I mean if we don't if we're not willing to work with Saudi Arabia\nThe other options are not so great either right we have turkey which tells the highest number of journalists anywhere in the world we have\nIran we have a number of uh other countries that committed human rights atrocity is just on the regular so I think that we just really need to get all of our ducks in a row and we need to you know maybe not necessarily change in one fell swoop our entire Middle East strategy over this\nQuota joined it really disturbing to go back to his youth this person who has been a as close and the broader sense of the word liberal in terms of\nDemanding greater freedom in the middle east to go back to his youth and tore him as a young member of the Muslim Brotherhood I think this is\nThis is a form of propaganda that can be is being used to kind of justify us off one here people should read his final piece for the Washington Post\nWhich was really powerful call for freedom in the Arab world that was really a red white and blue short of column and that's who he has been and that is the man who was killed\nLet me ask you both to set aside for the moment questions about whether his past is relevant has passed before he became a journalist who came to the U. S. and focus on this question of does this represent a diplomatic crisis\nWeather has passed as relevant has passed before he became a journalist and came to the U.S and focus on this question of does this represent a diplomatic crisis for the United states with a Saudi Arabia which has been a strong ally for generations free\nI think that Saudi Arabia is aware that they really matched up here um you know they've\nArrested I think it was Fifteen people in the last hour they announced that they've arrested and dismiss five others\nSo I ... I hate to change if they made a statement from Saudi state TV yeah so I think it's clear that they're taking it seriously and they should be taking this seriously\nUm I think that they definitely need to you know rethink what they're doing and the way that they are going to treat American permanent residents that are living in our country [noise]\nEJ I'm lost tortillas thoughts on the where this leaves the U.S Saudi relationship going forward\nI think the relationship is in crisis I think the comments from some of the Republicans in Congress\nOr suggests that as well as a Democrat and I think it's fundamentally put to bed this notion that mom had been some some on NBS as he is known the crown prince so they don't really right is it an hour or ... or former [noise] uh I think this has really brought home the sides of his regime\nOr that all the pressure of his image will never be the same as it was when he started out and was getting a lot of remarkably good press and that this is a big problem for him going forward\n[noise] lots of outstanding questions lots more to discuss when we reconvene next week same time same place you into the Washington Post and the Brookings Institution thanks to you great to be with you and brief painting of the federal is thanks for coming in thank you so much for having me [noise]\nThis is all things considered from NPR News\nBuild it

Paul got to note Todd ball and has written a children's book due out next year called little libraries big heroes she joins me now from her home in Green Bay welcome thank you gave Todd Bowles this idea to build a little library and the first place\nWell Tut's mother passed away\nAnd his mother had been a schoolteacher and when he was growing up as a student who very much struggled his mother had always been encouraging so he built the first little free library as a one room schoolhouse to honor her and was it a hit right from the start\nActually know very little passed by\nThat he talked with his friend Rick Brooks and so they built a whole bunch of them sort of planting unlike seeds from Minneapolis to Madison to Chicago and it was only after that that it started to catch on\nWe had him on this program six years ago and he was talking about the effects of the little libraries once people did start catching on and start using them\nOf the things that always amazes me is how many people hugged them when we actually put the myth we constantly\nDid start catching on and start using them\nOne of the things that always amazes me to only people hugged them when we actually put them in we constantly get emails that I've met more people haven't Twenty years people are always happy my favorite thing to do is sit on my porch and read a book and watch people in the library\nWhat do you think it was about the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to\nTodd really looked at reading and sharing stories as a doorway to forming relationships usually when I spoke with Todd in person or on the phone he expressed how energized he was about projects especially those that had to do with the youth or people who didn't normally read getting reading\nTell me about some of the places where these libraries now our tuition to the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has been either violence or disaster these little free libraries has come up as sort of a little spring of hope\nAlong the U.S Mexico border there is a hundred and fifty of them on in prisons in Wisconsin and other states and they can while the refugee settlement in western Uganda at a hospital in Ireland near a schoolyard and South Sudan\nThese little free libraries have popped up and brought communities together\nPeople of course take books for the little libraries but you also get to leave them I have to see that's what I Love about it I Love if I've got a book and I really loved it\nSometimes going and sticking it in there and then I'll you know when I'm Out jogging ... the next day seeing if somebody's taking it and if they have I feel this little sense of pleasure that somebody else is going to get to read this book that I just love\nI Love that idea to I'm constantly having a few bucks in my car so that when I'm going somewhere if I see a little free library and I want to put a book in there you can share that love of reading with another community whether it's your own or somewhere else\nYou were in touch with Todd bowl when he was in ...\nBook in there you can share that lot of reading with another community whether it's your own or somewhere else\nYou were in touch with Todd bowl when he was in hospice does he feel like he'd done what he set out to

mentioned Eighteen Saudi nationals arrested and among them they also mentioned a general and a royal court advisor who've been sacked from their positions do we know who these people are are any details about them\nWell a major general Ahmed Asiri was first mentioned to my knowledge in a New York times report this morning that talked about\nHim as someone who might be being lined up to take the blame for this a lot of questions have been pointing of course at the royal family including a crown prince Mohammed bin some on as the man who was in pretty much total control of Saudi Arabia\nOf course at the royal family ah including a crown prince Mohammed bin some on as the man who was in pretty much total control of Saudi Arabia and of many folks have been saying that this probably could not have happened without his knowledge and possibly without his order\nA but at this point the Saudis are saying that this intelligence officer and advisor to some on ... has been sacked and also ... who's an advisor to the real\nCourt so possibly a strategy to to uh put some scapegoats out there and the questions were manned in terms of who was giving the orders for this operation let me ask you

all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly in Washington and I melted Chang in Phoenix, Arizona\nPresident Trump is campaigning here tonight Arizona is a state where the G O P dominates politics right now both US Senators the governor most state lawmakers they're all Republican\nBut that could change because waves of Latinos will become eligible to vote in the coming years and they tend to vote democratic which means Arizona could flip from red to blue\nUnless the Republican Party can win over the growing number of Latino voters in this state and to get a sense of that challenge I traveled to a town just west of Phoenix called policy it's about eighty percent Latino [noise]\n\nI'm In a restaurant serving port those out got as and tacos and I bumped into a guy who could give the Republicans some hope\nSo we we handle our home especially in Hispanic community is the way Trump wants to run the U.S [noise]\nRamon Baron owns a small business repairing floors he's a registered Republican and he says he appreciates the values Trump stand for\nSecurity order you know you need a certain order and in your home\nYou know the issues that came with the wall\nYou know building a wall it is a good idea\nBecause I just installed not even two weeks ago a security door on my door already have a door but I Would have better door if you're a ... year old son he's fourteen years old and it's funny that he told me somehow the door and makes me feel safer\nIt made me think you know that you know it does make sense more more metal their keeps\nThe worst people out\nBut step outside and within seconds you'll run into people who vehemently just agree with that\nThe worst people out you know\nStep outside and within seconds you'll run into people who vehemently disagree with parents like Abel Hernandez a truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker the reason most Latinos will never vote Republican\nYou heard of the news or coming up with all these laws that make it more difficult for people for any country in the world to a ... status you've seen the kid's been separated from the families of the water I think all that reflects pretty bad on the Republican Party if you ask me\nI mean who's solving all that you know Trump and his agenda\nThere is no reason Hernandez view may not be worrying Republicans right now\nRepublicans are banking on two things\nJust ... heads the Latino public policy center at Arizona State university\nAre banking on that there's enough white voters to win the election today and their banking that there's going to be short memory for Latino voters tomorrow\nBut Garcia says data don't lie Latinos will turn Arizona majority minority by twenty thirty and a whole lot of them are going to be us citizens\nTwenty Eighteen could be the last election that Republicans can win without also winning the Latino vote\nSo the question for Republicans is how will they persuade those Latino voters to join their teeth\nI'm not a baseball diamond in a small park in northern feeding and the district state representative Tony Rivera has any of your friends or or any other members of the Latino community giving you a hard time for becoming a Republican\nI'm people have given me a hard time like what what did they say well they'll say um how could you be a\nRepublican and when the Republicans don't support\nHispanics they don't support immigration reform and it's just wants to them is\nRepublican and when the Republicans don't support\nHispanics they don't support immigration reform\nAnd it's just wants to them is take a look at all of the other values of the Republican Party they mesh perfectly with Latinos face the traditional family small business entrepreneurship\nBut it's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district actually knock on doors [noise]\nI'm only going to take some time I was telling you they're almost the Republican running for reelection I'm I'm here to answer any questions they may have topics including our budget education immigration is a hot topic\nOf the show that people focus too much on the people coming from Mexicali\nSeparating families isn't the way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nWhen they know I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised in ... parents are from Mexico\nAnd this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country and opportunity and I know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans of smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask ... if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security\nOne that legalize or people who are here who want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThis sounds like a different platform than the one that Trump is ... I'm\nA I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is but I just mentioned\nIndependence from the White House is something you\nA I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is but I just mentioned\nIndependence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate like you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI asked you see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection aj Doug ... on the ballot and its Doug do she's agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters\nA guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry it was the as you approach do see for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support\nCertain language doesn't support certain policies that\nThe national Republican mood and may may call for the is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them when you to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that no I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juices\nIf Republicans want to appeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him the truck\nRhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way he does\nThey see what's going on they see how they treat us and\nSo my kids you got to vote you got to vote you got ... votes and they said that we were ready to go over there over\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be field for generations to come\nAs a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republicans to separate themselves from the broader party\nGovernor juicy will be appearing on stage at a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight with President Trump [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nNew is shouting ties we take a closer look there's the kingdom faces scrutiny over the alleged murder of ... was President Trump pitch the campaign trail and us mercenaries\nI think there is a lot of pressure on President Trump to take a harder line and he has hardened his wine a bit publicly said there should be a severe punishment then all of that but all indications from the administration or that they really do not want to break with the Saudis they're not\nReady to take on a the crown prince Mohammed bin so I'm On\nA because they seem to see him as an ally and Trump is suggested that he is a personal ow\nOw so it is not down only to the president Congress has a role in this as President Trump has pointed out with Senator Lindsey Graham has weighed in Republican Senator Graham has weighed in tonight saying he's very skeptical of the Saudi version of events a breeze you know there's been a drumbeat for sanctions there's been a drumbeat from Congress about taking a tougher line\nAre you watching for that drew me to get louder\nYeah I mean that honest thing remains to be seen I think ultimately though that this incident doesn't necessarily mean that we should reorient our entire Middle East strategy I mean at the end of the day we have to remember that ... is not just a columnist for the Washington Post but he was also a personal friend of us I'm a bin Laden and was a member of the Muslim\nThe day we have to remember that ... is not just a columnist for the Washington Post but he was also a personal friend of us I'm a bin Laden\nAnd was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood this is an individual you know\nWe we have to take all of that into account and I also think that when you are dealing with who was operating as a journalist for the Washington Post and who is a U.S resident into it now appears was murdered I Know the show to cancel it I and of course we do have an interest in making sure that us permanent residents are protected as well that's something that we're interested in doing\nUm when you are talking about the middle east we're talking about a lot of bad actors here I mean if we don't if we're not willing to work with Saudi Arabia\nThe other options are not so great either right we have turkey which tells the highest number of journalists anywhere in the world we have Iran\nWe have a number of uh other countries that committed human rights atrocity is just on the regular so I think that we just really need to get all of our ducks in a row and we need to you know maybe not necessarily change in one fell swoop our entire Middle East strategy over this\nCould find it really disturbing to go back to his youth this person who has been\nA as close the borders sense of the word liberal in terms of demanding greater freedom in the middle east to go back to his youth and tar him as a young member of the Muslim Brotherhood I think this is\nThis is a former propaganda that can be is being used to kind of justify us off one here\nPeople should read his final piece for the Washington Post which was really powerful call for freedom in the Arab world that was really a red white and blue short of column and that's what he has been and that is the man who was killed\nLet me ask you both to set aside for the moment questions about the weather has passed is relevant has passed before he became a journalist and came to the U. S. and focus on this question of does this represent a diplomatic ...\nAbout the weather has passed\nIs relevant has passed before he became a journalist and came to the U. S. and focus on this question of does this represent a diplomatic crisis for the United states with a Saudi Arabia which has been a strong ally for generations brewery\nI think that Saudi Arabia is aware that they really matched up here um you know they've\nArrested I think it was Fifteen people in the last hour they announced that they've arrested and dismiss five others so I have to change it said a statement from Saudi state TV yeah so I think it's clear that they're taking it seriously and they should be taking it seriously\nUm I think that they definitely need to you know rethink what they're doing and the way that they are going to treat American permanent residents that are living in their country [noise]\nEJ I'm lost tortillas thoughts on the were this leaves the U.S Saudi relationship going forward\nI think the relationship is in crisis I think the comments from some of the Republicans in Congress or suggest that as well as a Democrat and I think it's fundamentally put to bed this notion that mom had been some some on NBS as\nHe is known the crown prince is in an hour or ... or former [noise] uh I think this has really brought home the sides of his regime or that all the pressure of his image will never be the same as it was\nA when he started out and was getting\nA lot of remarkably good impression that this is a big problem for him going forward\n[noise]

today\nIt was a very chaotic scene but uh you know for him just try to summarize it as quickly as possible [noise]\nAh they were at the fence watching them from leaving Guatemala that got through the fence thousands of people started a walking across this bridge into Mexico Mexico hit close to a big metal gate to them it had dozens of federal police officers in riot gear rating for this caravan\nThen I wasn't close enough to see what happened but then the Mexican gate open briefly we heard shots that turned out mostly to be here or gas or that they were using it in some migrants and then the gate shut\nAgain um it was a really chaotic scene and let's hear from this father who was near the front of the caravan with his two young kids\nAs I said OK them up for what we don't want to [noise]\nAs I said OK them up for what we want to vote for [noise]\nSo what he said was that she went to the front with his children because they thought they were going to let families and children cross first then there's chaos broke out he had to pour water in his children's eyes they got here ... it was just really chaotic or there were several children who have lost their families it was it was a really rough seen\nSpeaking of the really chaotic scene I can hear a lot of noise behind you James where exactly are you\nSo I'm back on the Guatemalan side of the border but still writes here near the bridge\nAnd and several of the migrants a couple of hundred so far have drifted back into Guatemala I'm sitting right next to a couple of cops are from the Guatemalan Red Cross they're treating people mostly people who are really just\nHydrated I mean there's a young boy laying on the cop now he's probably four years old has a has a cold rag on his head so Guatemalan authorities are trying to treat people who said suffered a lot of heat stroke and dehydration as well as some people who actually suffered broken bones in the class with Mexican\nAnd as you talk to these people what did they say their next move is are they going to try again I mean it does not sound as though Mexico is inclined to let them cross the border and across this bridge\nA lot of people I talked to said we aren't going to leave this bridge what their requesting is from Mexico to let them in as asylum seekers and so they are many of them say we are not going to lead this bridge we're going to block the bridge into Mexico\nLactose and given the clashes today Mexico has totally closed the border or you know I tried to get back into Mexico and was not able to disclose to everyone a show it's it's really up in the air what they're going to do but everyone I talked to said no we're not turning around we're not going home\nThe seconds we have left teams I mentioned that President Trump is threatening to close the U.S border if this caravan does managed\nGoing on in the seconds we have left teams I mentioned that President Trump is threatening to close the U.S border if this caravan does manage to make it across Mexico and advance getting to the U.S is if the goal of these people are they aware of the president's position [noise]\nThey they are aware of the uh trumps of not wanting to let them into the country for what they say over and over again as we know that's his sense but we're asking we're pleading for help because you know whatever Trump puts in front of us what is back at home is worse than whatever Trump and put in front of us [noise]\nThank you that is James Frederick\nReporting from Guatemala Mexico border\n[noise] this is NPR News\n[noise] more than a
