she laid out her position and no links for speech has already said uh didn't appear to have been undecided anytime that recently I'm and she was from start to finish it was pretty clear how she was wanting to vote\nYet she basically used her speeches it kind of closing argument it was as much of that a closing argument for Kavanaugh as anything else\nUm she basically was saying that he is not the extreme partisan that Democrats have been saying he is\nAnd she walks through all of the ways that he's more moderate than he's been portrayed and that and she did that for more than forty minutes and she made a pretty tough case there she said that she didn't like that this had become what she called gutter level political campaign instead of a solemn confirmation process\nEarlier today she had lunch with I'm Senator Mitch McConnell and I was in the room there while she was making that speech and he sat in just a few seats away from her and turned his seat so he could walk her well she

from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Ari Shapiro in Chicago today a stunning verdict for the police officer who shot and killed a black teenager Jason Van Dyke was found guilty of second degree murder he shot the McDonald sixteen times\nIt was caught on camera and sparked an uproar in Chicago it also triggered the Justice Department to conduct an investigation into the police department finding a pattern of excessive force WB easiest Shannon Heffernan has been reporting on the trial for months and joins us now Hi Shannon hello this guilty verdict is a huge deal for the city of Chicago what is the reaction\nWell acted this I've been able to speak to so far has said that while they were hoping for a first degree murder charge they're satisfied with a second degree murder charge this is something we haven't seen happen in Chicago for decades so I think for those activists it's feeling like a moment of celebration\nWe've also heard from representative for police like the police union there of course I'm happy with this verdict and concern for what it will mean for policing going forward\nThe convicted police officer Jason Van Dyke actually took the stand this week in his defense during this trial what did he say\nWell he describe what climate Donald as somebody to be afraid of he described his face as a frightening describes his eyes blank\nUm he said that the that that was ... raised and life up to his shoulder um which is not something you can see looking at the dashcam video of this and said that so the prosecutors really push too hard on why his version of events didn't match with video\nWhat kind of an impact you expect this verdict to have on the relationship between the Chicago police department and the African American community\nWell I think that's hard to say that because I think that the tension here had been more about more than ...\nIn the Chicago police department and the African American community\nWell I think that's hard to say that because I think that\nThe tensions here had been more about more than just look one McDonald you'll have to remember that in addition to this trial there's another trial laid it to the shooting there are three officers charged with conspiracy for exaggerating the threat of aquatic Donald a present it that night and their reports and\nI think that there's this feeling that the shooting was a a problem that the community feels but also fast feeling that officers covered it up so I think\nWe'll be watching closely what happens in that trial and how the sea reacts to that\nAs we've reported on so many police involved shootings and in so many cases the officers are acquitted this conviction is a rare exception what do you think made a different\nWell I think the number of shot six moon made a big difference in this case I also think the fact that there were multiple other officers on that night who encountered the climate Donald and chose not to shoot I think that that was important to a lot of folks that that I noticed\nThe w._b. easy reporter Shannon Heffernan reporting on the trial and conviction of Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke so guilty today of second degree murder

November when Americans cash their balance also are Tom Bowman in Raqqa Syria and the story of a veteran trying to find a speech\nYes I'll be more pleased after it's done tomorrow now creating the likely that Brett Kavanaugh will be an associate justice Supreme Court and I'm very pleased about\nThe numbers are there I let you address some of the questions that have been raised that will continue to be raised in light of his testimony hum and questions about his temperament I'm more than twenty four hundred law professors from across the political spectrum have signed a letter arguing\nThat he demonstrated a lack of judicial temperament when he when he was testifying that there should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice\nWho we didn't last night and said he no longer believes Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nIs the thing that the road and they should have been in for a when he was nominated but I think that his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nJoe Malcolm so these are not he said she said questions that are being ...\nPerformance during the hearings cause me to change\nTo Americans so these are not he said she said questions that are being raised these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think sure well we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's a\nTemperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to bar who\nKnow him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week will testifying\nWell that that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught against him his reputation as family that he would have acted like an all time to time\nI had by the way he acted like in ...\nI think the response would have been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if he did and damned if he did it the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred up his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as the Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice\nForward sure one\nBrett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not basically ... based on any political or personal bullies and he is not about to sacrifice\nThat well deserved reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court I wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter Ginsburg had some harsh statements to say about this\nHaitian for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court I wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter Ginsburg had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the all you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut to that specific remarketing or he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question that he found the tactics\nOf some of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate but when it comes to rolling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker had his Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal and he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he and he said there are some things they shouldn't have said what thanks get what you do not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break you apologize to center ... ah for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the collar but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's strengths and facilitating gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said that\nYou know I think there is no question that the Democrats you know when you you'd be some of them engaged and the timing of this for maximum advantage and had a political tinge to it and I like not fault him for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota\nJohn Malcolm thank you good to be with your heritage foundation's John\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I think some of that is the tightening labor market\nAnd Baker says the super low unemployment rate is helping those at the bottom of the economic ladder finally get a toll hold on the first wrong\nWhen you start to get the unemployment rate down the slow the people who benefit are disproportionately those bottom so you're seeing people that historically not been able to get jobs are least recently not been able ... get jobs the markets opening up to them\nBlack teenagers are good example the black teen unemployment rate hit record low in September that's the good news bad news is that it's still above Nineteen percent\nAnd that's why ... believes the Federal Reserve should not panic and start raising interest rates more rapidly to keep the economy from overheating\nSo who should get the credit for engineering this low unemployment rate\nThe White House took some credit today touting president trumps policies on deregulation tax cuts and trade former President Obama also get some credit for reducing the unemployment rate buy more than half during his administration\nBaker who's senior economist ... the center for economic research and policy says both administrations have a case but\nThe fed is really the hero ...\nBasically says remember that just four years ago the consensus among fed policy makers was that once the unemployment rate fell below five and a half percent inflation pressures were built\nA lot of them wanted to raise interest rates that said you know look down and play ... getting too low you have a problem with inflation\nBut former fed chairman Janet yell and said let's wait and see what happens and that's what the fed did finally began raising rates gradually and has continued that pays under the feds current leader Jerome pile\nYou followed the view many people and the fed and many other economists they would start to slam on that breaks the unemployment rate got around five percent\nYou many people on the fed and many other economists they would have started to slam on the brakes the unemployment rate got around five percent\nOr they never would've allowed it to get this low\nAnd Baker says that would have meant millions of people might not have gotten the jobs they now have John Ydstie NPR News Washington [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nYou're listening to all things

guilty of second degree murder he shot the Koran McDonald sixteen times\nIt was caught on camera and sparked an uproar in Chicago it also triggered the Justice Department to conduct an investigation into the police department finding a pattern of excessive force WB easiest Shannon Heffernan has been reporting on the trial for months and joins us now Hi Shannon how this guilty verdict is a huge deal for the city of Chicago what does the reaction\nWell that that that's I've been able to speak to so far has said that while they were hoping for a first degree murder charge they're satisfied with a second degree murder charge this is something we haven't will happen in Chicago for decades so I think by those activists it feeling like a moment of celebration\nWe've also heard from

I think that response what had been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing\nThe DC circuit

and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as a Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right [laughter] they let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice rally foreign\nSure one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not basing release based on any political or personal beliefs and he is not about the sacrifice that well deserved reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court\nI wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter Ginsburg had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the all you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut to that specific remarketing or he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nPersonal beliefs and he is not about to sacrifice that wealth has a reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court I wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter Ginsburg had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the all you know became

political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question that he found the tactics\nOf some of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate is up but when it comes truly unconstitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker had his Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal um he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he and he said there's some things I shouldn't have said what things get what you do not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break he apologized to center ... ah for asking her whether she had a

S. unemployment rate reached an important milestone in September it dropped to its lowest level in nearly fifty years it's now three point seven percent according to the government's monthly employment report today's news is a big positive for many workers but a challenge for businesses NPR's John Ydstie has the story\nSarah houses senior economist at Wells Fargo says it's hard to overstate the significance of this super low unemployment rate I think it's a huge deal and houses the lowest unemployment rate in half a century has businesses scrambling\nThat top concern are

their ability to grow their companies and put a drag on the overall economy but how says that's historically low jobless rate is a positive for many workers\nIt off of course ... get implications for wages\nThere are signs that wage growth is finally picking up as employers are being forced to boost paid to attract and keep workers\nEconomist Dean Baker says low wage workers are among those benefiting partly because many cities and states have raised minimum wages to September jobs data showed average wages growing at just to point eight percent over the past year but lower income workers experienced much bigger gains\nFor twenty three percent over last year so some of the minimum wage was but I think some of that is the tightening labor market\nAnd Baker says the super low unemployment rate is helping those at the bottom of the economic ladder finally get a toehold in the first wrong\nWhen you start to get the unemployment rate down this load the people who benefited disproportionately those bottom so you're seeing people that historically not been able to get jobs at least recently not been able to get jobs the markets opening up to them\nBlack teenagers are a good example the black teen unemployment rate hit a record low in September that's the good news bad news is that it's still above Nineteen percent\nAnd that's why Baker believes the Federal Reserve should not panic and start raising interest rates more rapidly to keep the economy from overheating\nSo who should get the credit for engineering this low unemployment rate the White House took some credit today touting President Trump's policies on deregulation tax cuts and trade former President Obama also get some credit for\nExample the black teen unemployment rate hit a record low in September that's the good news bad news is that it's still above Nineteen percent and that's why Baker believes the Federal Reserve should not panic and start raising interest rates more rapidly to keep the economy from overheating\nSo who should get the credit for engineering this low unemployment rate\nThe White House took some credit today touting President Trump's policies on deregulation tax cuts in trade\nFormer President Obama also get some credit for reducing the unemployment rate by more than half during his administration Baker who's senior economist at the center for economic research and policy says both administrations have a case but\nThe fed is really a hero\nBaker says remember that just four years ago the consensus among fed policymakers was that once the unemployment rate fell below five and a half percent inflation pressures were built\nA lot of them wanted to raise interest rates are said you know look beyond plumber it's getting too low to have a problem with inflation\nBut former fed chair Janet Yellen said let's wait and see what happens and that's what the fed did finally it began raising rates gradually and has continued that pace under the Fed's current leader Jerome Powell\nIf you followed the view of many people on the fed and many other economists they would start to slam on the brakes the unemployment rate got around five percent and they never would've allowed it to get this low\nAnd Baker says that would have meant millions of people might not have gotten the jobs they now have John Ydstie NPR News
