night barring Internet service providers from blocking or slowing down traffic or charging for faster loading the law basically restores the net neutrality rules created under the Obama administration and repealed under President Trump\nThese are seen as the strongest net neutrality protections in the country\nAnd within hours the Justice Department sued to block the California law NPR's Alina Selyukh is here to walk us through what this means for Internet users like us Hayley not high remind us what net neutrality is and what impact this California law if implemented would have on ordinary people going online\nRight the over arching question of net neutrality is how much power your Internet providers should have over your Internet experience\nSo typically when people talk about net neutrality they mean regulations like\nNo blocking of whatever let's say you went to visit that Internet providers should not be able to slow down an app\nThat you're visiting other elements sometimes include things like zero rating which is a deal we have rising might give you streaming of Hulu that doesn't count toward your or a data restrictions but then count Netflix stored database restrictions and these are all rules that California put into place they they banned all these things\nThe Trump Administration repealed the net neutrality rules there was a really vocal campaign by activists trying to get the FCC not to take this step now that California has gone through what has the reaction\nInternet providers should not be able to slow down an app\nThat you're visiting other elements sometimes include things like zero rating which is a deal where rising might give you streaming of Hulu that doesn't count toward your a data restrictions but then count Netflix store data restrictions and these are all rules that California put into place they they banned all these things\nBefore the Trump Administration repealed neutrality rules there was a really vocal campaign by activists trying to get the FCC not to take this step now the California has gone through what has the reaction but\nWell California was indeed sort of reacting to the massive liberal wave of activism and online activism that prompted\nA the writing of these rules um you know the battle lines have been drawn for a while on the net neutrality debate and then there's still the same on the one hand you've got Internet companies especially the smaller ones like at sea or a video streaming video saying that these rules are critical for them to be able to compete against the bigger companies\nOn the other side you've got the telecom providers you're Eighteen to your arise in your Comcast\nThat have been pushing California to not putting that neutrality rules into place and are expected to sue California's well\nThen the Justice Department has already sued California explain why they're doing\nOn so many things actually so it's on a political level California is an interesting state it is the largest economy in the United states\nUm it has the power to sort of set the bar for a lot of regulations and they have used that power and they're currently in legal disputes with the department of justice over a variety of policies\nUm including immigration emission standards and often when California sets a standard many companies look around and and think to themselves that it is a lot

economic powerhouse the counters the politics of who's in the oval office and\nThe department of justice in this case did respond you know attorney general Jeff Sessions said exactly that essentially he's accusing California legislature of of ah attempting to frustrate federal policy as he put it\nSo what does this mean for consumers and companies will this fight plays out\nOr not much yet the rules were not isolated to go into effect in January at this point the Justice Department is seeking an injunction to not have those rules go into effect at all in the meantime on a federal level\nOr

attention like the department of commerce and the department of energy\nThe book is called the fifth risk Michael Lewis welcome back to all things considered thanks for having me in each part of the government that you look at you tell the story of what happened during the transition between election day and the inauguration\nAnd in each case the story is pretty much the same what happened\nWell what happened was before the election the Obama administration has spent the better part of a year and a thousand people's time\nCreating a especially the best course ever created on how the federal government works and what the problems are and you should these departments with the idea that the day after the election hundreds of people from the new administration would roll in\nAnd get the briefings and learn ... what the problem was were and how they dealt with them\nAnd the Trump Administration just didn't show I mean across the government a parking spaces were empty and\nNice little finger sandwiches that have been laid out went on eating and briefing books when an open to the point where when I roll in a few months later I'm the first person who's heard the briefing that the Trump Administration was supposed to get\nAnd when the Trump Administration ultimately did send some people or one person there was a pattern in the kinds of people who showed up\nWell the real pattern was everybody who showed up\nProblems were and how they dealt with them and the Trump Administration just didn't show I mean across the government a parking spaces were empty and nice little finger sandwiches that have been laid out went on eating and briefing books when an open to the point where when I roll in a few months later\nI'm the first person who's heard the briefing that the Trump Administration was supposed to get\nAnd when the Trump Administration ultimately did send some people or one person there was a pattern in the kinds of people who showed up well the real pattern\nWas everybody who showed up was a Trump loyalist and very few of them had any kind of qualifications for the jobs they were being sent into and the spirit with which they approach was a kind of vague hostility to the enterprise\nGive us an example of what happened when people eventually showed up at a place like the department of energy but you write about so the\nOf energy could just as easily be called the department of nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean the stockpile is overseen in the department of energy\nSo they're shocked there when the day after election noon shows up and they're shocked when the guy who's in charge of the nuclear weapons packs up his boxes and goes home and nobody says anything and there's nobody to replace him\nEventually kind of a month after the election\nThe Trump people send in one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kind of lobbyist who was they're mainly to root out any interest in the department of energy and climate change and in developing alternative energies but he comes for an hour listens politely and leaves\nAnd and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about ... how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then a little while later\nAn odd assortment of young people who are\nThe Trump people send in one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kind of lobbyist who was they're mainly to root out any interest in the department of energy and climate change and in developing alternative energies but he comes for an hour listens politely and leaves\nAnd and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about ... how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then\nA little while later an odd assortment of young people who are kind of personally connected to the trumps are friends of the Trump's sons for example start to turn up inside the department\nBut they the people the outgoing people generally had the impression that\nHey there's ... from ... didn't any idea what they did and be weren't terribly curious to know\nWhy should it matter to most Americans if an agency that they rarely think about is run by people who either have a benign disinterest in the agency or or an active opposition to what the agency was supposed to be doing\nI mean let's take an example uh inside of the department commerce there's the national weather service the national weather service has over the past few decades got extraordinarily good at predicting the weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better\nAnd it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane in tornado forecasts\nThe person that the Trump Administration has appointed to run this operation is the CEO of accuweather whose\nCampaign for the last couple of decades to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the American public so that accuweather can make more money doing it this is a catastrophe for anybody who is in the path\nOf dangerous weather\nSo it matters it matters a lot who's in these places and\nAnd it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane in tornado forecasts the person that the Trump Administration has appointed to run this operation is the CEO of accuweather whose\nCampaign for the last couple of decades to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the American public so that accuweather can make more money doing it this is a catastrophe for anybody who is in the path\nOf dangerous weather so it matters it matters a lot who's in these places and it's a problem when the person knows nothing it's an even bigger problem and the person as an incentive to screw it up\nAt one point in his book you right there is an upside to ignorance and a downside to knowledge ... what is that upside to ignorance\nSo if you want to do things like eliminate investment in alternative energy to generate short term benefits for the fossil fuel industry if you want to eliminate the national weather service ability to communicate with people to make profits for accuweather\nIt really helps not to think too much or know too much about the long term costs of what you're doing because you can just focus on the short term gains and I think\nThat's like a big theme in this administration and the way it's running the government that it's looking for lots of short term wins at the expense of the long term and assuming we all will just not pay very much attention to the long term\nAnd I think the deal they do with their conscience is easier to do because they just don't understand about the long term [noise]\nOr these problems that a new administration would be able to easily fix after four or eight years by putting experienced professionals in these jobs\nYou know we have an interesting problem right now because in the first year of the Trump Administration twenty percent of the senior civil service ...\nIt's looking for lots of short term wins at the expense of the long term and assuming we all will just not pay very much attention to the long term and I think the deal to do with their conscience is easier to do because they just don't understand about the long term\n[noise] or these problems that a new administration would be able to easily fix after four or eight years by putting experienced professionals in these jobs\nYou know we have an interesting problem right now because in the first year of the Trump Administration twenty percent of the senior civil service quit or\nSo and those are people who made a career out of ... people who really know really know\nThe jobs and the importance of the jobs and on top of that Trump's still hasn't filled half\nOf the top seven hundred jobs in his own government so there's been a draining of expertise out of the federal government and the question is how hard would it be to put back together I don't really know the answer a harder every day\nYou ended his book in ... City Oklahoma with a woman named ... Finley and she says for the last ten years I prayed for a tornado to come and take that bar and I didn't think it would take the house to explain why you ended on that note\nWell first let's explain why miss family wanted airborne gone ah her husband killed himself in Oregon and she imagined this active destruction would come and kind of ease or pain she wouldn't have to stare at the barn any longer\nAnd which he doesn't imagine is that with the same tornado that's going to come take her born is going to destroy your house and she didn't want that\nAnd I thought it was a kind of a lovely
