what you'd expect black kids raised in the area thirty some years ago now make about Seventeen thousand dollars a year same as their parents\nBut once you head across Dumont avenue everything changes

hard hit by a recession than the crack and HIV epidemics there was a part of Brownsville that was totally abandoned the other side of do mocked\nThe New York city government sold over sixteen square blocks of Brownsville to the east Brooklyn congregations for one dollar\nThose blocks were dilapidated run down the city agreed to build infrastructure and provide cash subsidies for over a thousand affordable homes they would start selling at thirty thousand dollars each they were called Nehemiah houses after the man in the Bible who rebuilt parts of Jerusalem\nThe family was growing and we needed something that was much better for the children\nWho is ... is our address mom she and her husband came to New York from Honduras and believes fleeing poverty they identify as both black and

surviving the day to day Brawley points out that those quaint thirty thousand dollar near my house is built on land once sold for a buck or now valued at as much as half a million\nWhat has happened is is that families now have wealth that they can pass down generationally\nAnd that's just what the ... did they pass their Nehemiah home on to one of their daughters\nAfter I leave the family I Walk just a few blocks to Dumont avenue according to the atlas it's the dividing line on the map it looks jarring but in person it's completely an spectacular people bustle on their way to work cars zoom by just another New York city street\n\nSo if they can get to the fifty one votes now it's very likely they'll be able to get to it wants to the final vote comes up\nAnd you know it it it well it is procedural it's really extremely rare for people to change their minds after procedural don't like this\nAnd you know just as a reminder there are fifty one votes Republicans had the right now and they can afford to lose one person and still approve Kavanaugh because vice president Mike Pence good step in and cast that tie breaker than a final vote comes about thirty hours later that means sometime maybe Saturday afternoon or early evening for a final though\nKelsey we reflect on the political consequences of this controversy were about a month out from the terms yesterday we heard about this NPR Marist Poll signed a Republican enthusiasm jumped over the last month perhaps because of Calvin all do you expect that this confirmation vote could have a real impact on congressional elections\nHonestly it depends on how you're looking at it for House Democrats it's great they're fighting or battleground in the suburbs and their eagerly courting women there and this has energized

from that Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nAnd yesterday Heidi Heitkamp said she was a no and this is what she said\nThe process has been bad but at the end of the day you have to make a decision and I've made that decision\nPolls are showing her down and this might be the thing that she needs to do to kind of remind people she is a Democrat and this is in the state of North Dakota right that's right and I mean from a lot of Democrats that they think Republican enthusiasm may said if Kavanaugh gets confirmed so we will see\nNPR's Kelsey Snell thanks I'm watching\nYou well as we just heard Kelsey no they're the FBI interviewed at nine people for its report not Ford or Kavanaugh or some of the others from the judges past who have step forward to share thoughts on his nomination ... went to Yale with Kavanaugh he says they used to drink together\nThat would Kevin I'll drink he got belligerent and aggressive\nThat he won ... Kevin I'll throw a drink in a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kevin ... may have lied under oath I\nAsked ... to ... did he offered this information to the FBI\nOr yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them by from the did than told me what exactly to do first and until the sending your request for the form to fill out and then I filled out the form interact with a former run this had been pre field but\nTogether that when Kavanaugh drank he got belligerent and aggressive that he wants to Kevin I'll throw a drink and a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kevin ... may have lied under oath I asked ... did he offered this information to the FBI\nOr yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them by phone they did then tell me what exactly to do first and that entailed sending a request for a form to fill out\nAnd then I filled out the form in fact when the former arrived it had been pre filled by the uh presumably the Asian I spoke to a with my testimony in it that took up most of the three thousand the character's basis that they allowed\nSo you felt that this form did you ever than sit down with are having a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nUh last I did not I was never called back I we're by my phone by my computer ah hoping to get an email that nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI why do they need to question yeah\nWell I think it's relevant because first of all I don't think one should lie in front of the Senate Judiciary committee or when it's taken an oath and one is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview to become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you're saying you thought he lied and testimony that's as in regard to the extent of his drinking\nIt is the basic lie was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black now I think ... may confuse that was passing out but the blackmailed phrase means doing things that you don't know you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of it\nAnd one is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you're saying you thought he lied and testimony this was in regard to the extent of his drinking\nYes it is the basic lie was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black you know I think ... may have confused that was passing out but the black out phrase means doing things that you don't know you you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of his intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to that condition how can one new\nLet me ask you this a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nNo I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened in the last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I can speak to what I Know about making eighty three eighty four eighty five at your college\nAnd then how that was spoken about in two thousand and Eighteen so I don't think they've done a very thorough job in that sense at all\n... classmate of Brett Kavanaugh says he's now an associate professor at North Carolina State University and you heard him here on all things considered from NPR\n\nOh [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nListening to all things considered from NPR News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsually we associate quitting your job with like being fed up you know you've had it up but actually if you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy it's a great sign when a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nAnd when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there\nActually a lot more uh in fact there are now more job openings than there are unemployed people this is the first year that that's been the case in the government started tracking these records back in the year two thousand\nAnd that doesn't mean that everyone who wants to work will just slide into those open jobs the jobs might be in different parts of the country from where the unemployed people are they might not be a perfect match in terms of the skill sets that are required versus the skills that people have but it does tell you that there is a lot of work out there if you're looking for it\nAnd is that across the border in certain sectors are the more job openings and others\nNo no it's it's consistent geographically across the U.S and it's also consistent across the entire US Economy are but there are some sectors that are more impressive than others and if you look at\nThe health care sector food and accommodations restaurants hotels and then there's this category called professional in business services those are like high end services things like design accounting law advertising and all of those sectors are you really see a lot of job opportunities\nIf employers have to compete so much for talent and why aren't wages going up faster than they are\nYou know this has been puzzling economist for quite some time uh but what could be the case is that\nThere are more people than economists realize who are willing to take work in part because a lot of the people who are taking jobs now said that they weren't even looking for jobs in the month before they actually took them and so what it suggests is that actually there were more people willing to take work and so companies are having to look for workers yeah but there are all\nAll of those sectors are you really see a lot of job opportunities\nIf employers have to compete so much for talent and why aren't wages going up faster than they are\nYou know this has been puzzling economist for quite some time uh but what could be the case is that there are more people than economists realize who are willing to take work in part because a lot of the people who are taking jobs now\nSaid that they weren't even looking for jobs in the month before they actually took them and so what it suggests is that actually there are more people willing to take work and so companies are having to look for workers yeah but they're also more workers available to be found\nWhat does all this mean for the economy as a whole\nYou know when the economy is more dynamic it tends to give people more bargaining power so wage growth that's been kind of sluggish in the last few years very disappointing it could be about to get better it also makes the economy a bit more efficient more productive because if people are finding jobs that are a good match for their skill set\nA it makes them better at their jobs and it also means that companies will be more likely to invest in the kinds of tools and equipment that will make them more efficient so it's good all the way around both for the workers and for the economy\nThat's Cardiff Garcia co host of our economic

information that you need\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's right and I mean from a lot of Democrats that they think Republican enthusiasm may fade if God had an gets confirmed so we will see\nNPR's Kelsey Snell thanks so much shame he'll well as we just heard Kelsey no they're the FBI interviewed at nine people for its report not Ford or Kavanaugh or some of the others from the judges past who have stepped forward to share thoughts on his nomination ... went to Yale with Kavanaugh he says they used to drink together\nThat would Kevin I'll drink he got belligerent and aggressive that he won ... Kevin I'll throw a drink in a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kevin ... may have lied under oath I asked ... did he offered this information to the FBI\nOr yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them by phone they did then tell me what exactly to do first and that entailed sending a request for a form to fill out\nAnd then I filled out the form in fact when the former arrived it had been pre filled by the uh presumably the Asian I spoke to a with my testimony in it that took up most of the three thousand a character spaces that they allowed\nSo you feel that this form did you ever than sit down with or have a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nUh last I did not I was never called back I we're by my phone by my computer ah hoping to get an email that nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI why do they need to question yeah\nWell I think it's relevant because first of all it was like one should learn front of the so usually a committee or what is taken an oath and one is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you were saying you thought he lied and testimony\nUsually a committee or when it's taken an oath and one is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview to become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you're saying you thought he lied and testimony that's as in regard to the extent of his drinking\nYes it is the basic lie was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black now I think ... may confuse that was passing out but the black man phrase means doing things that you don't know you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of his intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to the condition how can one no\nThey don't let me ask you this a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete a thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nNo I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened in the last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I speak to a what I Know about making eighty three eighty four eighty five at your college\nAnd then how that was spoken about in two thousand and Eighteen so I don't think they've done a very thorough job in that sense at all\nChat letting ... classmate of Brett Kavanaugh says

[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe Labor Department comes out with the latest jobs report tomorrow and economists expect to see more new jobs being created at a healthy pace\nBut there aren't just more jobs Cardiff Garcia of our planet money team says people are also changing jobs more often and he's here to tell us more about this Hi Curtis hey Ari what shows you that people are changing jobs moving around more\nWell my favorite indicator dynamism is probably the quit straight that's just the share of people who quit who voluntarily leave their jobs each month it's now its highest point in Seventeen years so it shows you that people are confident letting go of their place of work a and looking for something else\nSo you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a high rate that's actually a good sign economically\nI mean individually usually we associate quitting your job with like being fed up you know you've had it\nBut actually if you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy it's a great sign when a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nAnd when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there\nActually a lot more uh in fact there are now more job openings than there are unemployed people this is the first year that that's been the case in the government started tracking these records back in the year two thousand\nAnd that doesn't mean that everyone who once worked will just slide into those open jobs the jobs might be in different parts of the country from where the unemployed people are they might not be a perfect match in terms of the skill sets that are required versus the skills that people have but it does tell you that there is a lot of work out there if you're looking for it\nAnd is that across the border in ...\nSets that are required versus the skills that people have but it does tell you that there is a lot of work out there if you're looking for it\nAnd is that across the border in certain sectors are the more job openings and others\nNo no it's it's consistent geographically across the U.S and it's also consistent across the entire US Economy are but there are some sectors that are more impressive than others and if you look at\nThe health care sector food and accommodations restaurants hotels and then there's this category called professional and business services those are like high end services things like design accounting law advertising and all of those sectors are you really see a lot of job opportunities\nIf employers have to compete so much for talent and why aren't wages going up faster than they are\nYou know this has been puzzling economists for quite some time uh but what could be the case is that\nThere are more people than economists realize who are willing to take work in part because a lot of the people who are taking jobs now\nSaid that they weren't even looking for jobs in the month before they actually took them and so what it suggests is that actually there are more people willing to take work and so companies are having to look for workers yeah but there are also more workers available to be found\nWhat does all this mean for the economy as a whole\nYou know when the economy's more dynamic it tends to give people more bargaining power so wage growth has been kind of sluggish in the last few years very disappointing it could be about to get better it also makes the economy a bit more efficient more productive because if people are finding jobs that are a good match for their skill set a\nIt makes them better at their jobs and it also means that companies will be more likely to invest in the kinds of tools and equipment that will make them more efficient so it's good all the way around both for the workers and for the economy\nThat's Cardiff Garcia co host of our economic podcast the indicator from Planet Money they fought pleasure Ari

O. J. says its practice of naming and shaming does make a difference because it shows the hackers\nAmerica knows how to find them and describe what they did and sometimes other parts of the government impose sanctions on individual hackers or the people who fund them the assistant attorney general for national security John ... told reporters that Russia launched the cyber effort because it was embarrassed by allegations than it's athletes\nWere of eating drug test embarrassed by the truth Russia fought back by retaliating against the truth tellers and against the truth itself now\nMary

question along those lines for us\n... those activities and that this indictment\nTells the real story I was asking you earlier about the timing of these charges carry and I have another question along those lines the U.S announced these charges just hours after Britain and the other one's announced their own accusations against Russians is that coincidence or coordinated\nVery much coordinated the Justice Department actually think it's international law enforcement partners for their help\nAt the press conference here in D.C today they highlighted how the Dutch were actually able to disrupt the hacking plot in April where for Russian men carrying diplomatic passport traveled to the Hague and rented a car and then fill it with electronic equipment they parked that car next to the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons\nThe goal was to penetrate the wife fi networks there but the Dutch we're on to them so the men abandoned the car and left the country and this was at the same time this organization the O P cw was examining a substance use to poison a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter in the u._k. this year\n... exactly\nI mean here's here's my big question which is what to these charges tell us if anything about the ongoing effort to protect us elections I mean this is all you know something we're talking about still because of twenty sixteen and attacks against democratic servers and institutions\nAre we any closer to knowing about efforts to protect the upcoming midterms from further Russian interference\nVideotape wouldn't touch that question today but there is something worth pointing out here the new indictment does include three of the same people accused earlier this year of hacking the twenty sixteen presidential election which makes the question or they added again if so the U.S government is just single them out all over again\nAnd one unusual things stood out this morning the DOT actually had a warning for news media both here and around the world be careful they said about using material that comes from these hacks\nThis morning the DOT actually had a warning for news media both here and around the world be careful they said about using material that comes from these hacks it can be false are misleading or the hackers can have a sinister motive as the Russian

this is Steve Inskeep with NPR's MORNING EDITION our goal is to bring your news that matters to keep you in touch with information that you need to make sense of the world and what can seem like a senseless time\nSarah Stewart likes to think about what happens when planets collide she uses to actual cannons to simulate those massive impact here's one firing in her lab at UC Davis\nHer work earned her a spot in this year's class of MacArthur fellows many of us call it the genius grant for years experts of thought the earth's moon formed after a large coalition knocked off a bunch of rock Stewart told me her research suggests a different story\nDuring planet formation when two bodies collide there's so much energy released that most of these bodies are vaporized\nThat means that a rocky planet earth is mostly rock vapor what does rocket vapor and and what does it have to do with our moon rock paper is taking the rocks that we stand on end heating it up to the point where it becomes the gas\nAnd when that occurs the earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the earth today and we proposed that our moon grows within the rock paper of the earth after a giant impact\nSo the moon actually came from the earth\nThe moon grows within the rock paper of the earth and that kids the moon the same chemistry and see her\nHow much of a revelation was that I mean how different was that from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from\nSame chemistry as the earth\nHow much of a revelation was that I mean how different was that from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from\nIt was hard to imagine that things could be so different and it was a mental roadblock to realize that giant impacts transformed a planet into an entirely new type of object and that could explain one of the biggest mysteries in the solar system\nDid you have to overcome some mental road blocks of your own given what you would have been taught coming through academia\nAbsolutely and this is when we had a bona fide eureka moment to my graduate student and I are sitting in front of a computer looking at the calculations that we had done and realizing that all the assumptions are actually violated by what we're looking at\nI think in any field there's a degree to which people have to be taught to trust themselves and maybe women even more than men are taught not to trust themselves was it difficult for you to have confidence that yeah well I've demonstrated here actually\nIs real scientists are terrified of being wrong [laughter] of course I didn't want to put something out there that was really a crazy idea and so we did have to convince ourselves first\nHow long did that take you to convince yourself\nWell [laughter] from the eureka moment to the publisher paper with for years so I think we had a lot of internal debates are amongst the co authors and a lot of debates at conferences on the origin of the moon\nSo do you expect if ten years from now I pick up a high school textbook it's going to have the results of your research there in the chapter on our moon was formed\n[noise] I certainly hope so I Am very excited about this idea and I hope that it leads to test where we can prove whether or not the moon actually formed in the earth vapor\nWhy are these kinds of questions relevant to ordinary people\nChess where we can prove whether or not the moon actually formed in the earth vapor\nWhy are these kinds of questions relevant to ordinary people who are not scientists why does it matter where the moon came from for example\nThe creation of the men was the last major event and the creation of the earth and it was such a violent act it left the earth and the state very different from today\nUnderstanding how earth became the habitable planet that it is is directly linked to this final event and its creation\nYou're saying it's part of our story absolutely\nHow did you get interested in planetary collisions\nI wanted to study planet formation\nIn the process I learned that collisions were the major physical process to grow planets and I had the opportunity to study them in the lab and I've been doing it ever since\nWe've kind of kid who was always going in the backyard staring at the stars\n[noise] I had my nose in books imagining space travel I very much enjoyed science fiction\nSo for you is studying planet to fall back to actually traveling through space\nI might be too terrified to actually go up in space [laughter] exploration and our imagination and through the laws of physics has been exciting enough for me\n[noise] serious Stewart is a planetary scientist at the

of the questions that have been raised that will continue to be raised in light of his testimony hum and short civically questions about his temperament I'm more than twenty four hundred law professors from across the political spectrum have signed a letter arguing\nThat he demonstrated a lack of judicial temperament when he when he was testifying that there should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice\nWho we didn't last night and said he no longer believes Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nIs the thing that the rules and they should have been in for a when he was nominated but I think that his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nTo Americans so these are not he said she said questions that are being right these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think\nSure well we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to\nKnow him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week will testifying\nThat is

true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught against him and his reputation as family that he would have acted like an all time to time\nI had by the way he acted like an atomic time\nI think the response would have been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position\nWhere he was damned if he did and damned if he did it the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers and said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as the Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and

revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice\nForeign sure one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not basically ... based on any political or personal bullies and he is not about to sacrifice that well deserved reputation for integrity by throwing

questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut to that specific remarketing or he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated and orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question that he found the tactics\nOf some of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate but when it comes to rolling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker headed Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street

growth is finally picking up as employers are being forced to boost pay to attract and keep workers\nEconomist Dean Baker who says low wage workers are among those benefiting partly because many cities and states have raised minimum wages the September jobs data show ... average wages growing at just two point eight percent over the past year but lower income workers experienced much bigger gains\nFour point three percent over the last year so some of the minimum wage law but I think some of that is the tightening labor market\nAnd Baker says the super low unemployment rate is helping

didn't my partner Megan too and I we certainly felt the power of the story as we were reporting it and because of the times was doing bigger investigations of sexual harassment we knew that this was part of the system and it wasn't just about Harvey Weinstein we were reporting on Bill O'Reilly we were reporting on Fort factory workers\nBut you never know what's gonna happen to an investigation what it's when it's published and you know one of our editors I'm Matt party like to say as we were working on it he said Harvey Weinstein is not that famous and that is true aside from New York and LA and maybe D.C he really was not\nA household name 'em and and what we've seen happen is that not only did the me too movement which was founded years ago by trying to bark\nTakeoff globally but it just kept going and going\nAnd going there were so many times in the past year when I saw productions that this was going to burn out or you know the women were all than a simmered down or the news was finally going to stop and it never did and what's happening with judge Kavanaugh I think is representative of that there's a feeling that this reckoning only continues and grows bigger\nMe ask you

what this means for the me too movement and I think there are two contradictory answers both of which\nProbably have some validity I'll give you the pro and con the obvious one is that people will say this as a setback he was confirmed anyway uh these really serious allegations of sexual assault didn't matter um women were ... you know ignored yet again this is a replay of Anita Hill\nThe other argument however is that\nWhat especially what Dr Christine Blasey Ford did was really important uh that she spoke up in front of the entire country\nShe put high school on the table right she made a case that these things that that happened in our collective you do have a bearing on the presence and we also some moments like with um the two protesters and the alligator with Jeff Flake where they

country about what it means when women come forward a and how our institutions handle that information and and respond to it\nBut I Do have to press the question though if the judge Kavanaugh is confirmed even after this messy process will doctor for feel that she failed\nNo doctor Ford's goal here was never to impact the process to derail the nomination what she was trying to do was what she thought was the right thing to do as a citizen which is to provide the information\nTo the U.S Senate so they could make the most informed decision possible her goal was into to derail the nomination
