sequence which revealed Native American ancestry Warren says she took the test to prove that are families tale of having native ancestors had some basis in truth\nBut not everybody test for personal validation\nHouse majority leader Kevin McCarthy was in the news recently because Los Angeles times investigation revealed that since two thousand his brother in law William wages was awarded more than seven million dollars and no big government and other federal contracts\nThat were designed to go to disadvantage minorities he declined to test but from family lower wages claims to be one aids

minorities get transportation industry contracts\nTaylor according to the Seattle Times began describing himself as multi racial after taking a consumer ancestry test\nThe test indicated Taylor had four percent sub Saharan African ancestry and six percent indigenous American he says that's enough for him to qualify as a minority so what is a minority then\nThe question really you're asking is that the DNA test tell him what his identity as retell and yet what our identities are\nColumbia University sociologist Alondra Nelson is the author of the social life of DNA\nAnd what his identity as retell any of what our identities are\nColumbia University sociologist Alondra Nelson is the author of the social life of DNA in a recent op ed in the New York times Nelson said DNA markers can't tell us who we truly are because we're comparing apples and oranges genetic data is technical identity is social\nAnd social science we think about the identity as being how human groups or individuals are defined by themselves or and how others perceive them\nNielsen says home DNA test or find something to indulge your curiosity but consumers shouldn't think the results or definitive the companies didn't design them for that\nYou know the sort of gold standard genetic science is not exactly what they're after entirely right um they're also um profit making entity\nAnd she hopes the courts will be able to tell the difference so programs designed to level the playing field for people who have historically been shut out of these opportunities can continue to do that\nI Would hope that uh the court is able to take seriously on the fact that these sorts of programs were meant to start as a counterpoint to discrimination\nBecause the lived experience of minorities can be learned by swapping

World Service continues through the night beginning in about ten minutes [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nIf you live in North America tear it can often seem like exotic ambassadors from the far off the jungles of Brazil or the wilds of Australia especially since North America is once common native species the Carolina parakeet has been extinct since the early twentieth century [noise]\n\nBut more and more parents are making this continent their home since the Nineteen sixties at least ... parakeets have been free flying and reproducing in the U.S which is to say they have become naturalized amongst parakeet with lime green that\nGray and yellow under parts in deep blue wings is also known as the Quaker parrot\nAnd the native of southern South America\nTo gauge and move forward poking more and more potential holes in that story and making it look less and less tenable and now a very late at night the Saudis have come out with an official statement admitting yes he's dead we have these people under arrest and we'll just have to see where it goes from here\nAnd I know it's late where you are as well but at any reaction from turkey from Turkish officials to this Saudi announcement Turkish officials that of course been working with the Saudis this was kind of a joint investigation that they'd been pursuing\nNo reaction yet yes some eyebrows had been raised a when they decided to investigate this jointly with the Saudis they've been in on every search a but we'll have to wait and see what the reaction is\nAll right that is Peter Kenyon getting us up to speed from ... thank you very much Peter thanks very Lewis and we're going to hear now from someone who says this Saudi investigation is compromised with Saudi Arabia has in effect been investigating itself\nHis name is David Cay he is the United nations special ... on freedom of opinion and expression which means he's tasked with protecting those very rights around the world K. has been arguing that the UN should launch an independent international investigation and he's on the line now David Cay welcome\nThanks for having me\nNow that Saudi Arabia has come out and confirmed or the death of ... G and given a little tiny bit of detail on what happened do you still believe un investigation would be worthwhile would be necessary\n[noise] absolutely I mean I think we're in a position right now where we have all of these competing narratives right we have a the drip drip drip of leaks from the Turkish a law enforcement authorities that have given some really brutal detail of\nA of a of a ... show is killing and those same really ...\nIn some really brutal details\nOf uh of ... killing and\nThose seem really quite at odds with what are what the Saudis are announcing today the idea of a of a fistfight to em seems really um counter to what to do what the Turks have suggested so I think the only way right now to get to the bottom of this\nIs to have a credible investigation and that means something that would be authorized by by the un or the secretary general or some other international body\nWhat would that investigation look like how big are we talking how long would it take\nI think we're talking about something small you know we're talking about as in past cases like this\nMaybe five individuals could be led by a high profile former prosecutor investigators who have experience with international crimes and criminal investigation\nAnd um you know at the very minimum it can involve\nAnalyzing what the what the Turkish authorities have been giving to the news media over the last a week or two or it could involve on site visits a interviews of of officials and so forth but but I think it's something that could be done fairly quickly four to six weeks well once it's authorized\nUm who has to call for this I mean what what would it take to put this in motion Mm\n[noise] yeah I mean there's really a bunch of different models that would be available for something like this the Security Council has authorized investigations\nFor for heinous crimes are and comprehensive systematic crimes like crimes against humanity and genocide\nOr they did it in the context of dark for in Sudan several years ago and they've done it and many other places the human rights council could do it the human rights council benefit is that it's not subject to ah to the veto of any\nOf the five permanent members gonna okay so if the U.S decided\nBenefit is that it's not subject to ah to the veto of any of the five\nPermanent members gonna okay so if the U.S decided they didn't think this investigation was necessary that could block the Security Council investigation but not the human rights council\nAbsolutely ... and there's there's a third option to which uh several human rights organizations have been calling for and that's for the secretary general on his own to authorize a authorizes an investigation and set one up\n[noise] um what would happen once this investigation is complete it would it be binding in any way could the Saudis just decide we have our version of events we don't buy it\n[noise] yeah no this is a this would be something where it would be an investigation because of its credibility because it would be international lies it would be something that from you know from that point states could take a look at it and make a decision as to how to proceed and there would be any number of options available to them whether its\nDiplomatic penalties penalties and international organizations or or other kinds of outcomes but but there's nothing binding I'm not talking about how beautiful but we're talking about a credible international investigation that David Cay thank you\nThank you use the un special representative and

Paul got to know Todd ball and has written a children's book due out next year called little libraries big heroes she joins me now from her home in Green Bay welcome thank you gave Todd Bowles this idea to build a little library and the first place\nWell Tut's mother passed away and his mother had been a schoolteacher and when he was growing up as a student who very much struggled his mother had always been encouraging so he built the first little free library as a one room schoolhouse\nTo honor her and was it a hit right from the start\nActually know very little passed by\nThat he talked with his friend Rick Brooks and so they built a whole bunch of them sort of planting them like seeds from Minneapolis to Madison to Chicago and it was only after that that it started to catch on\nWe had him on this program six years ago and he was talking about the effects of the little libraries once people did start catching on and start using them\nOne of the things that always is amazes me is how many people hugged them when we actually put them in we constantly get emails that I've met more people have in Twenty years people are always happy my favorite thing to do is sit on my porch and read a book and watch people from the library\nWhat do you think it was about the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to\nTodd really looked at reading and sharing stories as a doorway conforming relationship usually when I spoke with Todd in person or on the phone he expressed how energized he was about projects especially those that had to do with the news for people who didn't normally read getting reading\nTell me but some of the places where these libraries in our tuition to the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has been either violence or disaster these\nThese libraries now our tuition to the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has been either violence or disaster these little free libraries have come up as sort of a little spring of hope\nAlong the U.S Mexico border there's a hundred and fifty of them in prisons in Wisconsin and other states and they can while the refugee settlement in western Uganda at a hospital in Ireland near a schoolyard and South Sudan these little free libraries have popped up and brought communities together\nPeople of course ... books for the little libraries but you also get to leave them I have to see that's what I Love about it I Love if I've got a book and I really loved it\nSometimes going and sticking it in there and then I'll you know when I'm Out jogging ... seeing if somebody's taken it and if they have I feel this little sense of pleasure that somebody else is going to get to read this book that I just love\nI Love that idea to I'm constantly having a few bucks in my car\nSo that when I'm going somewhere if I feel a little free library and I want to put a book in there you can share that love of reading with another community whether it's your own or somewhere else\nYou were in touch with Todd bowl when he was in hospice does he feel like he'd done what he set out to do\nWell I mean there's so much more to what he's doing than being a champion from books or for reading he was being a champion for communities new friendships new ideas new projects springing to life as a result of his idea that's what he wanted\nMiranda Paul thank you for talking to us thank you for having me she's author of the forthcoming

America for refuge in the United states have been mast and where today they broke through an immigration barrier and tried to enter Mexico from Guatemala\nMexican security forces appealed for order and then fired tear gas to drive the migrants back\nPresident Trump has already weighed in he's saying to Mexico for its efforts to stop these so called caravan he has also said he will close the U.S border\nTo these migrants well let's bring in reporter James Frederick who is there in Guatemala hide James\nAn earlier so just yesterday you were describing to me a relatively calm scene at the border a lot of security but migrants who were mashed a few minutes away from the border what what's happened today\nThis group of migrants as Mel grown to thousands we don't know exactly how many thousands of migrants so decided they were going to march to bridge that connects Guatemala and Mexico and they said this\nBut thousands of migrants now decided they were going to march to this bridge that connects Guatemala and Mexico and they said they were going to try to enter Mexico today it was a very chaotic scene but uh you know for him just try to summarize it as quickly as possible [noise]\nAh they were at the fence walking them from leaving Guatemala they got through that fence thousands of people started walking across this bridge into Mexico Mexico hits close to a big metal gate to them it had dozens of federal police officers in riot gear rating for this caravan\nThen I wasn't close enough to see what happened but then the Mexican gate open briefly we heard shots that turned out mostly to be here or gas or that they were using against the migrants and then the gate shut\nAgain um it was a really chaotic scene and let's hear from this father who was near the front of the caravan with his two young kids\nDon't see them up for it [noise]\nSo what he said was that she went to the front with his children because they thought they were going to let families and children cross first then there's chaos broke out she had to pour water in his children's eyes they got here ... it was just really chaotic or there were several children who have lost their families it was it was a really rough seen\nSpeaking of the really chaotic scene I can hear a lot of noise behind you James where exactly are you\nI'm back on the Guatemalan side of the border but still right here or near the bridge\nAnd in several of the migrants a couple of hundred so far have drifted back into Guatemala I'm sitting right next to a couple of cops are from the Guatemalan Red Cross they're treating people mostly people who are really just hydrated I mean there's a young boy laying on the cutting now he's probably four years old has a has a cold\nRag on his head so Guatemalan authorities are trying to treat\nTies rated I mean there's a young boy laying on the cutting now he's probably four years old has a has a cold rag on his head so Guatemala ... are trying to treat people who said suffered a lot of heat stroke a and B hydration as well as some people who actually suffered a broken bone in the clash with Mexican\nAnd as you talk to these people what did they say their next move is are they going to try again I mean it does not sound as though Mexico is inclined to let them cross the border and crossed this bridge [noise]\nA lot of people I talked to said we aren't going to leave this bridge what they are requesting is from Mexico to let them in as asylum seekers and so they are many of them say we are not going to lead the spread to are going to block the bridge into Mexico\nLactose and given the clashes today Mexico has totally closed this border or you know I tried to get back into Mexico and was not able to get close to everyone a show it it's really up in the air what they're going to do but everyone I talked to said no we're not turning around and we're not going home\nIn the seconds we have left teams I mentioned that President Trump is threatening to close the U.S border if this caravan does manage to make it across Mexico and advance getting to the U.S is if the goal of these people are they aware of the president's position [noise]\nThey they are aware of that a Trump does not want to let them into their country for what they say over and over again as we know that same stance but we're asking we are pleading for help because you know whatever Trump parts in front of us I mean what is back at home is worse than whatever Trump can put in front of us [noise]\nAll right thank you James\nThank you that is James Frederick reporting from
