go okay with you\nAnd they match up so it's it's also even though it's it's this historic\nMatch up it's something that in the modern day of two very big baseball teams somehow they missed each other when they both and in the world series it was never against each other so I Love the fact that it goes back historically but also it brings them to two thousand Eighteen\nSo was that was back in the world series after a pretty brutal last last year I mean how how does this team going to be different\nI got one word and its redemption I mean we've all had a little bit of that in life right you get your heart broken in this case the Dodgers got torn out\nAnd there is something about that World Series last year wasn't just the fact that when seven games but it went back and forth changing lanes extra innings I've met with the scene in spring training I was with them pretty much throughout the season and there is a fire\nTo get back in when the world series but really when you look at the field team is different because they wouldn't got many Machado I mean this is Ben they're offensive or eat or he's at shortstop they lost Corey seeker during the season so now they have a child and then really is there a case I Know it's not Clinton crushed shah\nIt's Walker dealer so adding Walker Mueller to be able to be honest they one of the best picture that we've seen in the national league they have this redemption that they've had all season long they want to get back and they want to when\nThey're burning to prove themselves now okay what about the red Sox what did they have going into this\nThey want a hundred and eight games I mean the pressure is on them and even though the Dodgers haven't won a World Series in Thirty years you know the red Sox have had definitely Boston is that a lottery\nHundred and eight games I mean the pressure is on them and even though the Dodgers haven't won a World Series in Thirty years you know the red Sox have had a really positive that a lot of reasons to celebrate between the patriots and the red Sox but this gene is arguably one of the best\nRegular season teams we have ever seen okay so they went and it was without a doubt they were the best thing that baseball so when you were the best team in baseball it's like okay well then when at all no one cares about hey you want to hide your mate game yeah you get an award you get a crowd\nYou don't get anything oh you get as you want a hundred and ... yeah they were in the ... they are so good outside but as we know in the postseason the vaccines and always when you got to go out and play [noise] All right I Want\nYour crystal ball Jessica how do you see the world series playing out who do you think is going to win\nGutters and that's going to shock a lot of people because the Boston Red Sox are the best team on paper there's nobody better what I Love about the postseason transcend all of that\nTalent pitching hitting I don't care for all the numbers out yeah is

analyzed by the American civil liberties union\nThe ACLU has been tracking these children and it was the ACLU lawsuit against the Trump Administration that led to a federal court order to reunite these families we're joined now by ACLU attorney leak learnt welcome thanks for having me\nSo we should first said that the vast majority\nFederal court order to reunite these families we're joined now by ACLU attorney leak learnt welcome thanks for having me so we should first said that the vast majority of these children who were separated at the border more than two thousand of them have been reunited with their families\nBut it has been for months since the court order why are two hundred and forty five children still in custody\nYeah that's the question right or you know obviously the should've never happened to begin with and it should never have taken this long for the reunification so\nI think one of the reasons is because the government deported hundreds of parents without their children and the reunification process for those parents didn't really even start 'til about six weeks after the court order\nAnd where these children being held right now these two hundred forty five children that are still in custody\nThey're being held in governor ... all across the country often thousands of miles from where the parents are ... I Would say over two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made\nThe agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life was over ... killed 'em killed and this was a father who seemed to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life\nShouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said to us was I cannot bring wild child back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite but right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents who have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points\nYou have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have set all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we're we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct DUIs\nAllegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we're talking about [noise] four year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\n[noise] the ACLU has reported that five children had parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government has no idea what happened to the parents we\nAre the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we are not giving up on the five we will find them one way or the other we believe\nLegal

week without offering any evidence that quote criminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in with this caravan\nHe was pressed on that in the oval office today and conceded there's no proof to

about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nOur country has a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but we saw in\nRight after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty ten\nAll right so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations closed polling locations and move them we see states imposing strict photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of id in order to be able to cast a ballot\nThat will count we're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling location near them or around them a twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue of and reading a lot about is this idea of purging what do these laws look like how are they justified\nPurging has a practice of removing voters from the rolls um some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business um what we have discovered is that in ...\nLaw but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nUm what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting perch from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are on the role\nSome cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person has and voted and two in three cycles or look we're not sure if this person still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\nEffort [noise] um we want\nElection and administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls the problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late um critically we're also seeing that purging is happening\nIn states that used to be required under the voting rights act and be able to demonstrate that there are election process as we're not going to be discriminatory and we're seeing that those areas are having an even higher increase in the number of people that are being perch from the rolls\n[noise] um even calling ms voter suppression um do the courts agree with so many laws in place it seems like maybe there is an open door to all these kinds of laws around voting\nUp many of the strictest laws have been a blunted by courts overtime to London but not overturned or an hour it's aren't seeing it as suppression yet I I think I Would push back a little bit on that I think we are talking about a matter of degree so for example the photo id law in Texas that\nWas a an acted in two thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law\nThat is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota so some courts\nTwo thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law that is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota so some courts are stepping in and saying some of these policies are are too much\nUm but they're not going all the way and saying that these policies can't exist in any form\nUm many Americans especially Americans that have traditionally had their rights to vote suppressed are very very resilient and very determined to overcome it but having said that these laws are going to depress turn out in a way that we wouldn't have seen if these laws hadn't existed in the first place\n... is head of NYU's
