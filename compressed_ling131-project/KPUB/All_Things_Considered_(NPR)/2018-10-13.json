nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday I took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nIt's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region\nIn this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's the section that runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns\nAnd it's been damaged in in several places and it will be some time before that role will be

expected to be in Washington by tomorrow President Trump told reporters this afternoon that Brunson will visit the White House likely tomorrow as well NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there\nHi Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly had been convicted up\nWell his pastor around a small church and is mere in western turkey for years and years a but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically\nHe's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for to Gulen turkey blames for that to attend\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses who were justified against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now\nWell in some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been ...\nTo uh justify it against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now\nWell in some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of this cleric for to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you a yours or this summer Trump spoke with her to one and reportedly Trump thought he had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThan the u._s. got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release a pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that's his that's his church that he was running and turkey\nAbsolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nThey now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering at thirty five fighter jets to turkey will lay re raise this issue of extra dieting the cleric for to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one series\nAnd it's very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that's his that's his church that he

attention at the moment\nThe ... case that we've been tracking all of us this week\nThe democracy Yogi case right and I think turkey will at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue\nOff the table thanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul\nWe can take the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ... reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine [noise]\nIt was about to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley he asked Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nAnd the trail started as Scott Horsley with at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freak does\nAnd I noticed that the bag or Fritos had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new prize of a buck and a half and I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me so our mystery why\nMoney and the trail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freaked does\nAnd I noticed that the bag or Fritos had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new prize of a buck and a half and I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why or corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one Fritos is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes ... in fact the vending machines got uses in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see\nThey would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know a well luckily there was a second clue a note left at the scene of the\nCrime to our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nTo offset increases we received in product costs for manufacturers so presumably the wholesale cost the Fritos has gone up and they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things in a free to there's there's corn\nHow naive to think that's all that's in a bag of Frida is Carolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies she says the price of a processed food like Fritos has almost nothing to do as well food prices is a much bigger part of the cost of the food like Fritos is and things like\nThe wholesale cost of the free does have gone up when they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things that are free to there's there's corn\nAnd salt whoa how\nNaive to think that's all that's in a bag or Fritos Carolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies she says the price of a processed food like Fritos\nHas almost nothing to do with well food prices counts as a much bigger part of the cost of the food like Fritos is and things like labor and rent and transportation because trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers\nTo keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks and the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWhich is the shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma demo capital markets amid analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he has another clue about why the price of Fritos might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about the soft drink companies are\nKnown them um because the parents have gone up as well\nBecause it might be a woman in in the hands yeah\nIf the U.S has not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer has to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers\nSo the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices about companies Mitt looked at coke and Pepsi or a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs see\nMaybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset this more expensive can but they can't really do that right now sales up so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what sex\nSees it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer have to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nAbove the company's Mitt looked at coke and Pepsi were a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs see maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset this more expensive can but they can't really do that right now is tails up so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what snacks\nBacking category unlike many of the other categories and bad allow companies that make back potentially more pricing power\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks at your best guess for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying\nIt's not as satisfying as the bag or Fritos I'm going to go get right now [laughter]\n[noise]\nThat was NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley speaking with safety Danny Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host

won't Clyde Frasier and to hear all about this come back we're going to go to ESPN's Nick DiPaolo who covers the athletics you industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey hey how's it going there good so why\nDon't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been what Twenty years since there last basketball shoe at him\nYeah so they had it for a in Ninety eight and it was very short lived they signed just one clear and been quarter\nAnd yoga broker after two years and so they put out the game for about Twenty years though when I think when you look at basketball basketball's always has\nIs elements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really has and so a coma that's a big part of the appeal\nWhat's happening in with the players are today that are young and trends setting and exciting and also it's a complex thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their basketball's really a big gateway in terms of being a global brand as well\nBut how much pull do they have now to get a big name behind him because I'm thinking like ...\nCarter and that deal that broken after two years and so they've been out the game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball basketball's always had these\nThese elements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really has and so a coma that's a big part of the appeal\nWith tapping in with the players of today that are young and trend setting and exciting and and also I think a big thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their basketball's really a big gateway in terms of being a global brand as well\nBut how do they have ... big name behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and it didn't they were able to attract people like Michael Jordan and LeBron jeans is ... even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdles for any new comer yeah\nUm you know I I did a lot of research last year Nike hat about sixty percent of the league wearing their shoes lassie oh okay step in and combat that it's pretty tough to find okay [laughter] yeah they\nDo have they do have a huge budget an allowance from corporate standpoint and they signed sixth of the top Fifteen draft picks this

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly today in Turkey a court ordered the release of an American pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made a pastor Brunson case a priority and Brunson is expected to be in Washington by tomorrow President Trump told reporters this afternoon that Brunson will visit the White House likely to moral as well NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there\nHi Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly had been convicted up\nHis best around a small church and is mere in western turkey for years and years a but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty six\nAround a small church and is mere in western turkey for years and years a but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically\nHe's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for to Gulen turkey blames for that coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses who were justified against him suddenly changing their earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now\nWell in some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of his clerk for to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you a yours or this summer Trump spoke with everyone and reportedly Trump thought he had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThan the u._s. got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or a good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement to the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical\nRelations it should be an improvement to the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue of the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that's his that's his church that he was running and turkey\nAbsolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nThey now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering it thirty five fighter jets to turkey will lay re raise this issue of extra dieting the cleric for to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia hearing his doubles taking up a lot of attention at the moment\nThe ... case that we've been tracking all of us this week\nThe democracy Yogi case right and I think turkey will at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue\nOff the table thanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul\nWe can take the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ... reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine [noise]\nIt was about to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley he asked Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nAnd a trail started as Scott Horsley with at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freak does and I noticed that the bag or Fritos had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new prize of a buck and a half and I had just written that corn for you\nI had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new prize of a buck and a half and I had just written but corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why or corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one free does is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes ... in fact the vending machine Scott uses in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see\nThey would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know a luckily there was a second clue a note left at the scene of the crime\nTo our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending\nMachine may be\nTo offset increases we received in product costs from manufacturers so presumably the wholesale cost the Fritos have gone up when they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things in a free to there's there's corn\nAnd salt whoa how naive to think that's all that sort of aggregated Carolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies she says the price of a process food like Fritos\nHas almost nothing to do as well food prices killed is a much bigger part of the cost of the food like Fritos is and things like labor and rent and transportation because trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers\nTo keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks in the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWhich means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies\nSo that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks in the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWe just shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma ... capital markets Mitt analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he gave us another clue about why the price of Fritos might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about a soft drink companies a lot of them um because of the parent has gone up as well\nSo because of like the aluminum cans yeah\nIf the U.S has not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer have to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nOf all the companies Mitt looked at coke and Pepsi were a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs see maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset this more expensive can but they can't really do that right now stale up so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what snacks\nBacking category unlike many of the other hand categories that allow\nCompanies that make back potentially more pricing power\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks at your best guess for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley set satisfying it's not as satisfying as the bag or Fritos I'm going to go get right now [laughter]\n[noise]\nThat was NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley\nThat was NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley meeting with Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host of the podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nFor Planet Money comes from the transfer wise [noise] a service that helps people send money internationally three million people and businesses use transfer wise to send or receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy countries\nMore transfer wise dot com or from their ...

new NBA season tips off next week a relative newcomer is going to be hitting the court not a player issue\nThat's right the athletic ran who is stepping back into the basketball shoe business with an

ESPN Nick DiPaolo\nThat was a shooting Disney theme is by New York Knicks great wall Clyde Frasier and to hear all about this come back we're going to go into ESPN Nick DiPaolo who covers the athletics you industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey hey how's it going there good so why\nDon't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been what Twenty years since there last basketball she wouldn't\nYeah so they had it for a night to Ninety eight and it was very short lived they had signed just one clear and been quarter and that deal that broken after two years and so they've been out the game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball basketball's always had these\nElements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really has and so a coma that's a big part of the appeal that's tapping in with the players of today that are young and trend setting and exciting and also\nI think a big thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their basketball's really a big gateway in terms of being a global brand as well\nBut how much do they have now to get a big name behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and Adidas they were able to attract people like Michael Jordan and LeBron James is ... even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdle for any newcomer yeah um you know I did a lot of research last year like you had about sixty percent of all week wearing their shoes less loud oh okay I step in and combat that is pretty tough but okay [laughter] yeah they do have they do have a huge budget an allowance for corporate standpoint and they signed\nSix of the top Fifteen draft

see the wild wild west is the more important in some ways how these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting she banned in what they do on the court\nYeah that's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the stats in terms of high school kids they're watching less and less of a full through our game and they're really kind of immersing more on what these guys are doing away from the game and and they're seeing snippets of highlights on Instagram and things like that but I looked it up the other day and out of the nine guys that pulled aside and\nThey have six and a half million combined followers on Instagram so that's a huge base as the brand of starting out you know I think the brand itself has only had a couple of hundred thousand followers and so\nThey're really leaning in on their players counts and ethical big part of their strategy with their shoes that they don't want shoes that look just like a standard basketball shoe they're trying to create stuff that maybe has a little more lifestyle to it that guys can be showcasing in different ways on their own pages and so that's going to be a huge push for sure\n... covers

station\nIt's all things considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I know that Chang early this morning there was news from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl\nWorld has been under tremendous pressure to resign since a report this summer detailed the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of mishandling several cases of abuse while at the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that skating horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro\nBirds state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm gonna ask you about your reaction to worlds resignation what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWhat cardinal worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse I actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church I think what's missing\nIt's a matter of cover up of child sexual abuse I actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church\nI think what's missing here though is an acknowledgement by the Vatican on the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop worlds role in it now I'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their preference but I I Do not think\nThat the people of Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up\nShould face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop we're all played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for a changing the current statute of limitations you you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living every single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nBut with respect to completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the case becomes to prove witnesses pass\nAccountable and I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on with the me too movement the Kavanaugh hearings and The Cosby trial is\nIs you're seeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and law enforcement plays a unique in critical role in that process that's what we're doing here in Pennsylvania and\nJoshua Shapiro is Pennsylvania state attorney general thank you very much for joining us\nThank you [noise] some of the last secrets from the Watergate scandal may soon be revealed\nA federal judge in Washington has ordered the national archives to review key documents and prepare for their release\nThe papers helped to advance the impeachment effort aimed at president Richard Nixon and scholars say they are relevant today as another special counsel investigating the current administration NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson reports\nA few years after the resignation of Richard Nixon the special prosecutor who investigated him recalled the critical moment in that probe\nMoron laws ... said it which was first in history to get the courts to promote the grand jury report to go to the house Judiciary Committee because the committee would have had real difficulty and doing its workers ... hadn't gotten all grow\nLeon Jaworski told an interviewer in Nineteen Seventy seven that document contained in detail list of the evidence the Watergate prosecution team had gathered\nWe called the road map at our office because it was just that\nFor forty four years that road map remained a secret under seal by the federal district court in Washington on orders of the judge who presided over the Watergate cases that secrecy persisted to protect the grand jury's work\nBut not for lack of trying in Nineteen Ninety seven Stephen ... was working for the independent counsel investigating President Bill Clinton Bates was looking for a precedent for house special process\nStephen ... was working for the independent counsel investigating President Bill Clinton Bates was looking for a precedent for how a special prosecutor might send an impeachment referral to Congress\nThe national archives let me see a lot of stuff from the water ... a year to that was very interesting what what I asked you to load math was added up to the house I they ... they said no\nBates tried again years later but the answer was the same no last month he and others petition the court to release the Watergate roadmap their lawyer is Larry ...\nIs relevant historians it's relevant to the intrinsic ongoing interest in Watergate that alone would be sufficient to justify releasing this material but there's real urgency in this instance to getting the road map on to the public\nRecord urgency because another special counsel is on the job now investigating the Trump campaign and one of the big questions about the end of Robert Mueller's investigation is whether he'll try to send to report to Congress or the public John sale worked on Watergate as a young lawyer\nFrom twenty first century variation of the Silk Road that something that the lower team story likely considered\nSales boss on the Watergate team was James corals who now serves as mothers deputy\nBut he says unlike Richard Nixon Donald Trump's legal team is likely to object to any such material going to Congress Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has already signaled he would fight in court to stop lawmakers from seeing that document\nMeanwhile the batter all over the Watergate roadmap could soon come to an end this week judge barrel how ordered

arms sales to Saudi Arabia although many analysts feel that those numbers were inflated but still it does represent jobs for American\nAnother facet of the fallout over the ... cars shaggy [noise] situation NPR's Jackie Northam thanks so much things matter with\nPresident Trump has stepped up his attacks on the Federal Reserve this week after stock prices plunge Trump ripped into the fed for raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years\nI think the fed is gone crazy I think the fed is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong\nAll right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked at the fed for forty years until twenty ten ... was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today thank you for having me here also\nSo how usual is it for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nIt's been very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush the president and its ministry shouldn't often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy but maybe didn't call the fed crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve on for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known private lead to the chair and other members other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nOkay so up until now fed officials had been defending the fed from the president's attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fad Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to\nPresidents attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fad Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes still does have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these right I\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing and a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself\nOr with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think then at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president and how sway the fed to slow down the rate hikes\nAre no I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident\nThat it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis using them for using the institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be sending or I think is very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up his attacks\nAnd others drawing him and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation\nSo I don't see an economic riskier\nWho the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing that it is a deliberate\nNonpartisan institution that's acting in their best interests but you're a little concerned that maybe Trump's rhetoric could be affecting that\nIt is a deliberate nonpartisan institution that's acting in their best interests but you're a little concerned that maybe Trump's rhetoric could be affecting that trust among the man I think it could overtime German power she says has worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill\nTrying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's\nOversight group why they're doing what they're doing and I think that's\nAs well as explaining to the American people and I think that's the basic insulation\nFor the Federal Reserve from political pressure is understanding that's Donald come the former vice
