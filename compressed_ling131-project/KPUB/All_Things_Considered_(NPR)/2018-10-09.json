know what's going to happen in the November midterms\nBe the first time he's a loser or not Mara Liasson NPR News\nWe may not know what's gonna happen in the November midterms but we do know one thing Taylor Swift is voting Democrat\nIn a lengthy social media post on Sunday the pop superstar explained why she would be supporting Democrats filled bread is in for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house she also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women's and el GB he writes\nAnd all this from an artist who has famously refused to talk politics in the past we reached Emily yard of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how earth shattering is is this the Taylor Swift make some political endorsement\nHonestly in an area where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore really a surprise tell me why the shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because ah for the last two years there has kind of been\nA steady drumbeat to get Taylor Swift to sort of say anything political anything about the current environment and she never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she drops his Instagram posted that really lengthy almost like scorched earth of post about how she really feels about the upcoming\nMid terms and I was just not expecting that what's the response than like from her fans [noise]\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people don't really look up to her so there's a lot of support there's also of course\nThere's kind of this movement that has always thought maybe she was secretly a conservative just because she never said anything so\nThey kind of had to read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is some disappointment on that side today well\nYou tell us with did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans\nSaid that there are some disappointment on that site today well\nYou tell us what did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now so does have a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left leaning political positions now I think it\nDid in some ways because when she made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world she didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drives so much of the country music industry now her songs are being played on pop radio and\nShe'd have this broader audience I feel like it may have trapped her a little bit in the way that because she still has his country than she did still want to appeal to them\nBut I think she probably didn't feel more free overall to share opinions\nYou know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure reading her image so what do you think why jumped into politics now what do you think is going on with her\nAnd this is what I've been trying as the mystery of the day and I always said I had her mind from Italy exactly Taylor Swift always seems to be like twenty steps ahead of everyone else no matter what she does everything kind of have like a double or triple meaning when you really look at it\nI think in this case the timing probably was pretty strategic she just wrapped up her stadium tour in the United states you know she's done with their concert she doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that so she\nPosted her message after this she kind of looted and her statement to events that have happened to her in the last couple of years and that's why she was speaking out\nAnd like she didn't say with those were um I think a big one that's impacted her the most was her sexual assault trial when a country music DJ sued her after he lost his job because she said he groped her and I meet and greet line\nAnd she counters sued him for assault and battery and she ended up winning and I think that experience really really\nHis job because she said he groped her and I meet and greet line and she counters sued him for assault and battery and she ended up

scorched earth of post about how she really feels about the upcoming\nMid terms and I was just not expecting that what's the response than like from her fans [noise]\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people don't really look up to her so there's a lot of support there's

had never even said that there is some disappointment on that side today well\nYou tell us with did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now so does have a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left leaning political positions now I think it\nIn some ways because when she made the break from Nashville and kind of declared herself going to the pop world she didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drives so much of the country music industry now her songs are being played on pop radio and\nShe'd have this broader audience I feel like it may have trapped her a little bit in the way that because she still has his country than she did still want to appeal to them\nA pop star now so

steps ahead of everyone else no matter what she does everything kind of have like a double or triple meaning when you really look at it\nI think in this case the timing probably was pretty strategic

shortages wildfires droughts rising sea levels poverty and massive destruction to coral reefs previous research predicted these effects if the earth warms by two degrees Celsius\nBut this report finds the consequences could actually come much sooner when the earthworms by one and a half degrees Celsius which is on track to happen in just about Twenty years\nThe un included data from over six thousand scientific studies\nAnd one of those studies came from the nonprofit think tank climate interactive where Andrew Jones is co founder welcome thank you thank you also someone just make this clear this report is predicting really the same consequences of climate change that previous reports have been predicting but this report says these consequences will happen sooner\nYeah that's the basic idea and when I read it for the first time I was struck with the urgency and they really laid out with such precision the hearing now element of this problem is not do it for the grandkids\nSo many of these affects you just mentioned sit around twenty forty also if you want to plan to be here around twenty I order in lido yeah so what this is a kind of hearing now impacts of the scientists were writing about\nSo what would it take to avert this I mean this report is saying we basically have a deadline coming up in about Twenty years are are real changes feasible within that timeframe\nLike this you hear some of those studies ... it makes you think gosh I just want to hide under the covers and watch them Netflix but if you think\nSo many of these effects that you just mentioned hit around twenty forty also I think you and I plan to be here around twenty I order in lido yeah so this is a kind of hearing now impacts the scientists were writing about\nSo what would it

those studies in it makes you think\nGosh I just want to hide under the covers and\nWatch them Netflix can hear you but if you think about it facing this kind of impossibility is really some extent what humans were made for and the report lays out really well if we're willing to take on the kind of efforts that we have in the past and\nHumans have done it also and in World War two\nFlying to the

considered\n[noise]\nThis month we're looking at our bodies the way technology sees them here in the U.S we're gradually getting used to facial recognition technology it's in our phones and some airport security systems on social media\nBut how good an in house a cue or is this technology to answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she's a facial recognition expert at the University of Texas at Dallas welcome thank you now I feel like I'm seeing facial recognition\nPop up a lot more recently not just on smartphones but in airport security systems for example law enforcement has also experimented with it was there some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed wider use of this software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system whereas older technology would do really quite well with well controlled facial images that when the elimination is good and\nThe viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that you know it\nUse of this software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system whereas older technology would do really quite well with well controlled facial images when elimination is good and the viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that\nYou know a change in age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better at the task\nYou know one recurring issue though we keep seeing is\nFacial recognition technology that miss identifies people of color much more frequently than it missed identifies white people uh there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as guerrillas\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistakes like that happen\nYeah this is a really excellent point\nThe current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically many many images of a particular person and an accurate label and so you get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different races\nSo you're saying there are just a lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right so how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make the Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color yes oh\nAnswer to the question technologically is quite simple if you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it\nYou get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different races so you're saying there just a lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right so how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make\nThe Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color\nYes oh the answer to the question technologically is quite simple\nIf you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race biased that's a harder question so easily win facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could use this technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAs someone who really understands where this science is today how do you think about this um is face recognition technology abused um that certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse\nWhether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility\nIs something that has to be decided by societies and carefully looking at how it works and making decisions about what the right ways to use the technology are\nAlice O'Toole is head of the face perception research lab at the University of Texas at Dallas thank you very much thank you [noise]\nFor for all tech considered comes from the

are testing\nSuspected toxic compounds on human volunteers was that he felt that was the only way he could deal with this you had\nThis rising tide of really dangerous food additives there was no safety regulation how do I make a case that perhaps this is not a good idea I'll just tested on people and so he did\nNo one surprise if you feed people formaldehyde arsenic or lead they will get sick and when you demonstrate that why does it still remains so difficult to outlaw formaldehyde arsenic or lead in food why wasn't just not an obvious thing that everybody got on board with right away\nAnd doesn't that sound like the most logical response so look you've ... you've poison people let's get that out of the food supply to the food industry\nHad been organizing itself to fight regulation probably at the point that widely starts these experiments in Nineteen oh to he had been advocating advocating advocating and working with Congress men to try to get some kind of basic

business or getting offered more money and the food industry actually organizes they create a food Manufacturers Association and and and coalesce against making sure this doesn't happen\nAnd they were phenomenally effective\nAnd yet despite these long fought fight to expand decades today there isn't lead and formaldehyde an arsenic in food the way that there was a hundred years ago progress really

really wanted to answer what did you want to find\nOut where this survey so I really wanted to find out is grief a predominant reaction initially or you know in combination with a depressive reactions are anxious reactions so no study that I've come across has made that distinction\nBoth are painful but grief tends to bring people together which is what my research has shown and a depression tends to isolate people so it really could have very different implications for how people cope\nAnd what types of help is best um after that experience\nSo you you designed study really quickly after the

this kind of work and uh we were given permission we had a sample of over four hundred a undergraduate students and that was collected very\nQuickly within I think five to ten days most of them within five days and grief was the predominant response not depression not there was some anxiety share people's uncertainty what does this mean in my safe I hear it and he you or\nI looked at the open ended responses and the number one response was shock um how can this happen here how can this happen to what we thought was a safe community so shattered\nOur assumption about what a safe unpredictable world is you\nKnow let's talk a little more about that so so based on your survey um what were some of the factors that were associated with a student having a much more acute reaction more distracting response\nSo people can very I mean there are studies that show over and over again really you know that the biggest predictor of sort of depressive reactions are passed mental health issues or other things that maybe don't have to do with the loss per se but it's the law says one of those situation that brings forth\nUm these kinds of reactions whereas the uh predictors of

important piece and I think is what I think people need to know that that's normal and it is tied to these things that are so positive they're they're tied because we actually do empathize with the individuals or we do identify with the individuals and that's a compassion\nRight feeling that there is no distinction or not much of a distinction between us and the people for whom tragedy hits right at home oh that's a compassionate reaction so I think that's what people really need to remember if they can\nWell ... thank you so much for all thinking with me today yeah you're so welcome I
