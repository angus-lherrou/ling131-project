support for the Jewish community and their time of need\nOur intent was to express our solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters to remember those who were killed ah to offer prayers um but as I mentioned in my my sermons also find our voice you know we often say that we offer our prayers and thoughts\nAnd that is fine but we must do more we must put those prayers into action we must give them all age and with our boys and with our actions we can ensure that this hatred is not the new American way cannot be\nDo you have a sense that there are some people who might have been afraid to come out today I guess there\nBecause we are an open and affirming congregation um some people are afraid to put to target on her back and\nI open and affirming you mean every once in a while because everyone is welcome to sexual right everyone is welcome and and knowing welcome but to be celebrated what was the attendance like today was it more than you expected we had a couple of\nAh folks from the Jewish community come at the beginning and to offer the words of Thanksgiving they did not state to worship but they did come and to say thank you for doing this you know it makes a difference

a tax on the synagogue where a baby naming ceremony was beef was being held in the presence of children hit very close to home\nWell this church has recently in kind of been coming up with plans what to do in case of the situation like that of course is the nursery attendant that has always been something that's been on my mind to start here because I'm responsible for eight or nine children at a time\nAnd how I Would evacuating and then from the building or hide them in a situation if it were to come down to it\nSo I just running through my head kind of plans that I've come up for years\nReally and is that what occurred to you yesterday when you heard about what happened were you thinking okay what would I Do in that situation\nI grew up post Columbine so as a child um even in first grade we had drills even back then of what to do if there was an active shooter in the school and my whole life I grew up in public school constantly hearing about stuff like that Sandy Hook

school or things like that just always kind of was in the back of my mind is kind of a shadow that I guess a lot of American Kids are growing up with these days\nI don't know whether to be happy or sad\nYou know that you have that somehow it hurts me to think that you have to think about that instead of thinking about what fun games to play\nYeah it's not it's not a plant anyone wants to have but it's become a reality that you to be in that situation not have thought of something or to be in that situation and to have you know you you are the last protection for those children and that's what you have to be thinking about\nWe also met a father and son oldest and Matthew ... who were in attendance at the special services today an owner said his own life experiences allow him to feel

E. essay in Pittsburgh and not far from here thousands are gathering to remember the eleven people who were shot to death at a local synagogue the Jewish community center is leading the community gathering held at soldiers and sailors memorial hall in Oakland, Pennsylvania\nThe eleven people who were shot to death and a local synagogue\nThe Jewish community center is leading the community gathering held at soldiers and sailors memorial hall and open Pennsylvania faith leaders and politicians from ... from throughout Pennsylvania and beyond have gathered in a packed auditorium\nNPR's Quil Lawrence has outside of the community service now and he's been talking to members of the Pittsburgh community ... welcome thank you so much for talking to us\nThank you it sounds like a huge gathering there today what is it like at this event\nThere was a beautiful hall and saw the auditorium and in the backdrop is a big ... Abraham Lincoln's entire Gettysburg Address\nUm I I just stepped away at the beginning there was a a Baptist choir and African American Baptist choir singing I mean this is an event hosted by the Jewish community but it was a clear symbol of the\nOf the whole Pittsburgh community standing in solidarity and the music was beautiful and really soothing to many in the crowd there were people weeping including reporters\nUm I'd say they're maybe three thousand people inside and as I left to come out and speak with you I had to pass through another three thousand people sitting outside in what's now very chilly rain listening to the same service over over speakers\n... some lovely now um you also spent some time in squirrel hill the neighborhood where this attack occurred what was the mood there\n[noise] yeah I mean people were out and scroll hill trying to kind of have their normal life in a way of farmers markets are people going to Sunday services and you can see the diversity of the community it's notably Jewish but it's really a bit of everything\nThey were trying to be normal but they're also trying to explain this I spoke to a woman coming out of the six president Presbyterian Church Brittany story and she's in eighth grade English teacher she just friday took her students to the Holocaust museum in Washington DC here's what she said\nI have to wait and patients and now says hey I think I'm going\nAnd I came today that\nWeight and patients and now that they I think I'm going to let them read the articles and these articles that I Want to sit and talk of the class and just giving them a space I have\nProcess a half and what they thought they were really moved by family the Holocaust or weak\nAnd people were saying that you know in the little town like this you never think can happen but in today's America they realize it can happen anywhere\nAnd and to that point this is a a a a smallish city and the victims of the shooting were identified this morning and people are probably just finding out that they may known someone who was affected how are people absorbing this\nYeah it's another wave of shocked to hear the names I ran into dance Franco he's the he's the state represented Pennsylvania state representative from this district he went to Hebrew school at the tree of life when he was eleven years old and he knew a two the two brothers who were killed David in Cecil Rosenthal he's what he said\nAnd they were really specials we learn\nA unknown so for many years and whenever I go to a tree of life for a bar mitzvah or a wedding or some kind of case and two of them are always see in the in the sanctuary\nHe talked about you know centuries of anti Semitism but more recently an object of hate speech in this country\n... and now finally Quil what what is next what what are people saying is next\nI felt like people were in the sorrow this sort of cycle of sorrow and then pride in the solidarity that community showing and then there's rage that a man could come here with an assault rifle and massacre eleven people in twenty minutes while they were praying most of these people were old enough to be grandparents but the community is trying to take action they say they want to do something\nEleven people in twenty minutes while they were praying most of these people were old enough to be grandparents the community is trying to take action they say they want to do something they said he talk about guns they talk about trying to tone down their rhetoric in this country and many of them talked about upcoming elections in wanting to be active\nThat is NPR's Quil Lawrence cool thank you\nThank you\nAnd as you just heard we've been talking quite a bit today about how people are mourning and how they're trying to make sense of this tragedy but it's not just adults who are trying to make sense of yesterday's shooting and tragedies like this\nThat are unfortunately all too common a lot of people are thinking about their children and how to talk to them about tragedies like this NPR's Sarah McCammon has been reporting on that story and she's back with us in the studio Sarah thanks so much for coming back and doing this sort of thing and I understand that you actually covered a lot of these shootings and this is something that is really on people's\nMinds and fortunately I've covered several of these now in my career as a journalist and you know anytime there isn't a senseless act of violence especially especially these mass shootings it's it's hard to explain it to children especially for people in the area and the community affected\nI it's impossible though for kids not to hear about it right in the news and their their friends and neighbors are talking about it even if they're not directly involved in a tragedy I found a lot of people struggle with how to talk to their children how to explain things and not terrified that\nSo you did we mentioned earlier that you went to the synagogue neighborhood outside the synagogue he also went to other places tell us about that\nActually went over to the children's museum here in Pittsburgh it's a pretty famous really really great one actually and\nUh they have opened it up to the public for free this week Monday through friday or they want a place for families to to go and feel safe and comfortable they say\nAnd today was a pretty normal busy day at the museum and and uh staffers were thinking about ways to to reach out to families today too I met a woman named Jesse live and she was hanging out with her family and she said something I've been hearing repeatedly and talking to people in Pittsburgh today just that you hear it happening everywhere\nJesse live and she was hanging out with her family and she said something I've been hearing repeatedly and talking to people in Pittsburgh today\nJust that you hear it happening everywhere but you never really think it's happening here\nShe says she's not sure how to broach the subject with her two kids ages four and six we're from Canada so\nSo it was very new to us living here for the last year to start seeing more prominently [noise]\nAcross the room Alisa Hoffman was also ensure what to tell her two kids ages six and three about what they're seeing in the news\nIt's hard to [noise]\nPut it into a contract where they understand um [noise]\nYou know so we haven't really talked about it yeah I have\nWe will Hoffman grew up in the Pittsburgh area and was back here to visit family and like so many here she has ties to\nSend a lot of my\nFriends had by a bar mitzvah that tree of life I\nAttendant Sunday school because my best friend growing up was Jewish and that's where she went so it was just really [noise]\nPricing upsetting you know disappointing that that\nPeople get these thoughts and their head and and do it [noise]\nYou know and I think that they [noise]\nDevon bill runs the make shop a plate and crafts area for the kids she says the museum staff has been grappling with how to help children and their parents during this scary time [noise]\nSo today it's hard to be at work\nHard to um know that we are the helpers here and we are the ones offering support for those families and children while we are also struggling with our own feelings\nBut the way that I'm looking at it is\nYou know we are part of a community together as a pool and that\nBut the way that I'm looking at it is\nYou know we are part of a community together at all and that I'm being\nWith the community right now feels are important and powerful for me to\nDid the current sort of political anger and conflict playing uh so I Know that investigators are going to be going through his computer finals are going to be going through his home they're going to be talking to folks who know him who might have worked with in family members friends\nI kind of thing but Julie ... of the New York times who's been reporting on the background of Robert Bowers the accused synagogue shooter thank you very much\nThank you President Trump will travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow at today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and set the hatred must stop\nCritics of the president said his campaign rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd pure as usual Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey there hello so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president and she's really going\nAnd you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media bears responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media\nUh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week oh what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent that's just who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the ... solar in chief or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy\nUh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using this belittling nickname for her\nJob [noise] I guess she doesn't have any of this was all she does and I have none\nAnd since that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling him with the with\nTwitter he's once again denouncing the price as the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling you must be without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics will argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're battling taxes or something like that is that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences be in the mid term what difference might the president's rhetoric mc\n... it's very hard to tell A People's views the Trump are as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so\nYou really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of course is that maybe some lukewarm vote supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents could get really fired up but

your smart speaker to play NPR or your station by name\nUm [noise]\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nIt's for forty four with and I'm secular with Arizona Public radio news from Flagstaff\nA report from the United nations Intergovernmental Panel on climate change says the planet has already warmed by one degree Celsius due to human activity since the industrial revolution\nAnd it's on track to get hotter thousands of experts contributed to the report which warns the world's carbon emissions need to reach net zero by the year twenty fifty to avoid catastrophic environmental changes\nK. and they use Melissa ... spoke with northern Arizona university scientists Christina she do about the findings\nWhat kind of changes are we seeing from climate change here in Arizona you match and if you have any more days in Phoenix for example the temperatures go adopt one hundred degree Fahrenheit\nAre we seeing from climate change here in Arizona\nYou imagine if we have many more days in Phoenix for example where temperatures go above one hundred degrees Fahrenheit and there will be even more when it goes up off one hundred Fifteen so we have this already now sometimes in the summer and it's not pleasant and if we have even more you have\nReally skyrocketing air conditioning costs for example\nAnd other aspect is that the water supply and Arizona is going to change drastically and it's going to become very unreliable every place we'll see some form of climate change it will not be the same in every location but there's literally no one who will not be affected by climate change\nSo we're talking about um things that affect our economy um things that affect tourism for example um but also some of these things are potentially life threatening things like heat waves\nYes he drew it can be very life threatening and the problem with that is that you can have your car air condition and you has air conditioned but it will cost you a lot more in the future and not everyone can afford that and I think that's a really important aspect of climate change as well there is this so called climate injustice\nWhich means which people can probably cope with it to some extent better than those that have their little money\nRight yeah the report really emphasize that not everybody is going to feel the effects of climate change equally\nThat is very true and say\nI also think it's important to say that here in Flagstaff we may not be affected so much by sea level rise but there are millions of people worldwide that are affected by sea level rise and they often are\nAmongst the poorest yeah the climate injustice topic is very difficult on there is a moral aspect to it I think\nThis issue has kind of a sense of urgency because of that do you think we can make the changes we need to make by twenty fifty\nYes we we can make the change\nAnd see because of that do you think we can make the changes we need to make by twenty fifty\nYes we we can make the changes\nWe have to make them soon\nHe needed late basically and I think what is important is to you know it's not a geophysical impossibility so we can still do it but it needs a joint effort of governments industry in society and we cannot rely on others to do something we have to do it ourselves\nWhat we're talking about these are really big processes and I think a lot of people when they are here about climate change it feels like it's too big of an issue like there's just nothing that can do how do how do you personally deal with that\nI sometimes feel despair as well and I'm sometimes also overwhelmed by the topic but then I also realize just\nBeing depressed about it is not going to change anything and there are things that every person can do that if we all do it it actually it really makes a big difference and so for example I tried to bike to work and ah I reduce my electricity consumption at home I eat less meat and things like this\nBut one thing that everyone can do is is a vote for someone who has an agenda that includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions and things like this so I think that that's actually a really important aspect that you can do\nBecause it just riding your bike to work is probably not enough Christina shadow like you so much for talking with me today You're welcome it was a
