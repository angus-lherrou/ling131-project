Brunson said that he wanted to pray for President Trump and he got down on his knees latest hands on the president and prayed that that President Trump be given supernatural wisdom\nWell what led up to this whole moment yet so pastor Brunson was arrested more than two years ago as part of a round up following a coup attempt on Turkish president\nRegimen type air to one uh he had been accused of espionage and aiding terrorists which the pastor denies to this day of course um there was a lot of lobbying from President Trump from all those members of Congress the state department\nAnd

governor\nActivists their ceiling can because about fifty three thousand voter registration applications has been put on hold a majority of those applications belong to a black residents we wanted to learn more about this that we call that mark nice the he's the government reporter for the Atlanta Journal constitution mark welcome to the program\nThanks for having me All right so why were these voter applications put on hold\nGeorgia passed a law last year that's known as the exact max law and if your name or voter registration information doesn't exactly match or pretty closely exactly match your driver's license or Social Security information your voter registration won't be\nCompleted until you verify that you are who you say you are and this delays these potential voters from becoming active registered voters in Georgia where did this law come from it was a policy of the secretary of state's office for several years\nTo um put voters on pending lists until they could be ... fully registered and then some of the same civil rights groups that are suing the state now sued them previously over this law\nResulted in a settlement in February of last year and very quickly after that settlement with the state the Georgia legislature passed it into a state law\nOf last year and very quickly after that settlement with the state the Georgia legislature passed it into a state law and so now we're in round two where these civil rights groups are suing the state of Georgia and secretary of state Brian Kemp\nAgain but this time they're suing over something that's already passed into state law now the secretary of state's office says other states have this\nKind of law including Florida and in Florida any way of federal court upheld the law\nAnd activists are saying that they fly disproportionately affecting minority voters how have they made that case deal\nWell it is true um if you look at the list of these fifty three thousand pending voters Seventy percent of them are African American if you add in other minority groups in particular which he knows and Asians you get up to about eighty percent minorities that are pending\nBrain can running for governor he's also the sitting secretary of state whose office overseas and voting system does she have a history of getting involved with this kind of issue\nIt depends which side you talk to ... be ... his opponents say that Brian ... is\nPart of this process as secretary of state he's in charge of elections and we have seen precincts close we have seen that there are these voters on pending lists\nAnd we have seen Georgia Pass a photo ID law before you can vote however in Georgia the way our elections work is the secretary of state while he is responsible for overseeing ...\nElections and enforcing state laws regarding the elections most of election processes are local decisions and so secretary of state Brian Kemp says look I'm doing everything\nMost of the election processes are local decisions and so secretary of state Brian Kemp says look I'm doing everything I can to make it easy to vote and follow Georgia's law\nAnd in fact this week we reported a Georgia has a record number of registered voters six point nine million including well over two hundred thousand new voters just in\nThe may primary election what's\nThe mood in Georgia right now so close to the election\nThere's a lot of interest in it and this particular case is motivating Democrats who feel that Republicans are cracking down on\nVoting rights and Republicans are saying that it's a manufactured controversy with I Believe the words that Brian Kemp use\nThat was mark ... of the Atlanta Journal constitution mark thanks so much\nFor thank thank you\nNow it's time for the barber shop that's where we talked to interesting people about what's in the news and what's on their minds and today we're going to talk about a couple of celebrities who got political this week\nYou know everyone but the calf hey I Would make me feel that the guy that he didn't get that all the time like a guy\nWas it was something about when I put his hat off it made me feel like Superman\nYou probably heard those comments from Kanye West in the oval office and the firestorm of reaction after ... Kanye wasn't the only celebrity catching heat this week Taylor Swift was to for her Instagram endorsement of two Democrats running for office in Tennessee her home state and we've got a few people joining us to talk about this\nTest is Stuart is politics reporter at Rolling Stone she's in Hudson New York\nJulie a craven of the half posted on them\nTo talk about this test is Stewart is a politics reporter at Rolling Stone she's in Hudson New York Julia ... of the Hubble posted on the line from Washington D. C. and last but not least Rodney Carmichael some NPR Music is joining us via Skype from Atlanta\nHave her body hey hey hey how's it going right now I'm going to start with you because I Know at some point you were a big ... fan maybe you still are um and we know he's always been provocative he's always been unpredictable but this was on another level and it was in the oval office\nWhat was your reaction to what went down on Thursday\nIt was so surreal is like um are taken out things from from get out or something I don't know I was a fan and once upon a time you noticed downward spiral economy has been happening for a couple of years so what happened this week especially after the past year was not that much of a surprise but\nAs easy as it is to kind of laugh about it and imagine it as some kind of entertaining\nThing I think we've got to take this seriously I think it's really dangerous the kind of rhetoric that he is spitting out and I I feel like in a lot of ways he is a reflection of Trump as a candidate and twenty states scene and it was really easy to laugh about 'em into election night you know\n... ... what do you think I mean is now the time to be taking ... seriously\nYes if you haven't been taking ... seriously you should start taking him seriously now um I agree with everything right and he just said this is not performance art he's not doing this to be provocative he's not doing this to sell albums\nIt's very clear at least to me that this is how he feels he even said that racism wasn't a deal breaker for him and as a former ... fan myself that's really sad coming from the guy who said that George Bush doesn't care about black people\nThe deal breaker for him and as a ... fan myself that's really sad coming from the guy who said that George Bush doesn't care about black people after the fallout from Hurricane Katrina so I completely ruined Rodney we need to take this seriously this is a man who has reach\nYet fans his fans follow him they're influenced by him and he is supporting a president that is arguably just blatantly races\nBecause I'm going to throw this next question to you Taylor Swift also got some heated reaction to her back in two Democrats in Tennessee up for people who haven't heard test that can you can you tell us what happened what she did on Sunday night she posted a photograph of\nHerself to Instagram and and the caption\nShe talked about the fact that she was coming out for the first time\nAnd vocalizing her political beliefs she endorsed two candidates in Tennessee\nPhil Bredesen who is a candidate for the Senate he's the former governor of Tennessee\nAnd Jim Cooper who's a sitting congressman up for re election in November but the main thrust of her Instagram post was about why she's not voting for Marsha Blackburn who's a female candidate in the race she said she likes to support women who are running for office\nBut she couldn't support Marsha Blackburn because a lot of the policies that black and has supported in Congress\nUm she said they're not hurt Tennessee values\nAnd the high profile Republicans were not happy with her right Mike Huckabee tweeted something about her fans being too young to vote so oh well so what but I mean there was a lot of like negative reaction from high profile Republicans\nWe're proud to be the highest rated to our live musical comedy variety show on

was male slots cold like they've called met\nThat Sarah Jones she's the Tony Award winning playwright and started the show sell by date and which he inhabits Nineteen different characters a sex worker from Trinidad a former pimp from South central LA and an elderly Jewish woman from flushing queens what do I think of ...\nAre you ... [noise] what are you about Twenty years old age the use of my God I think of candies in my purse [laughter]\nAnd Sarah Jones is with me in Studio welcome to the program\nThank you for having me and us [laughter] so we're on the air [laughter]\nI Know you don't want to give away too much but is there a character in this play that you identify most with\nAll of these characters have some element of me in them whether I'd like to admit that or not there's a pimp there a couple of ... types in here there are you know there's a a man who's object to find women who is a former cop\nWho admits to using you know prosecuted women or as he says never on the clock though you know never while I'm actually on the clock but yeah\nAnd you know to realize of course I'm looking at him he's objectify women I object to find myself and other women obviously it's on a continuum and it's a different\nConversation but every time I look at myself and think oh my body's not okay or my worst than value are determined by my parents and my marketability I'm kind of engaging in one form of this same narrative so ... writing this work has been really cathartic and humbling for me\nWhat is forced you to start looking at yourself and\nNarrative so writing this work has been really cathartic and humbling\nFor me what is forced you to start looking at yourself in relationship to this why are you beginning to do this now\nOne of the things I'm discovering in performing this piece in different places and in connecting with people one commonality is engaging after the show whether it's in Kew NA or with social media and I found myself\nBeing really you know open about my own me two experiences that predate the hashtags you know when I was in college I thought about\nStripping as kind of a you know it was sort of cool it was like oh this is my pre beyond say feminism like yes I have bell hooks on this side but I have these wild on this side and you know what does healthy sexuality look like as a woman at Bryn Mawr college where you have to you know kind of ... to serve earn more\nBut who also you know I Would go home from school from Philly to New York and party with rappers and you know what did it look like to trade on my appearance and being a woman in a context that was obviously just as sex us as the rest of the culture but in hip hop\nAnd there was definitely this space that I was trying to occupy as a feminist as well and so looking at all of that I'm On a continuum of women who are negotiating their relationship to sex and power in a male dominated culture\nMhm yeah I was wondering if people come up to you after the show\nTo talk about these characters that you and body whether they say to you oh my gosh I totally saw myself and that person or whether they say to you maybe you didn't get that quiet writer I'm not sure if I felt comfortable with you using this accent which is my accent which was my real accent\nCan you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show that may be comfortable and supportive and maybe not as comfortable\nCan you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show that may be comfortable and supportive and maybe not as comfortable\nYeah I Would say for whatever reason the gods goddesses and trans gods of the theater\nAnd of accents and you know kind of persona I really don't think of my of these characters as just having an accent you know there's a woman in the show\nShe's from Dominican Republic she's Puerto Rican Dominican all proud and it's very important to me that people understand that I have a direct connection to them and the republic myself through my family but also that I Want you to hear her accent and if you have a problem with our accent I Want you to hold up a miracle yourself\nBecause actually there's no indignities of having accented English actually just means I speak two languages or what you know so I Love\nKind of doing a deep dive into people's experience and then presenting it to those people first I always hang every character\nYou know I can remember hide that my name is probably more so in the show and us how to do is when do United Nation schools you also comes from a mixed cultural background so she was growing up with different people from different places on for so long\nBut then when she came to India she was kind of working on some of this material on during the different places are that are lots of conversations about sex work or prostitution or commercial sexual exploitation that we can have all over the world so she came to India and be said very good cracking good job\nOr she is a very nice woman a bit dog but other than that she didn't quite a bit so you know I really\nTry to set my material with people from those communities first and then try to engage directly in the conversation if someone says\nI feel like this isn't dignified why are you doing this all say well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified\n... what is it about how you were raised and how you were brought up that drew you to different people with the with different experiences and drew you to wanting to bring\nAnd how you were brought up that drew you to different people with the with different experiences and drew you to wanting to bring their stories to life\nYeah well I think like so many of us in today's culture I come from a mixed\nUpbringing experience my family was black and white him on my mom's side my grandmother was Irish American and German American and we have both Christians and Jews on that side of the family as my character Lorraine would say it's a long story filled with intrigued and interfaith guilt\n[laughter] but you know of you know my black relatives my white relatives the peoples who you meet in my shows are these amalgamated versions of people I really knew and I\nHad to learn to Code Switch as we call it now just to like get dinner [laughter] you know growing up it was very normal for me to identify with\nThe kind of the pluribus unum within me and to see that as very normal and it wasn't until I went out into the world where people were like what what is it which is in Utah white you this that and yeah I heard a lot of that\nAnd gradually I learned to stop fearing all of those many what felt like these different shards of myself and instead see it as one whole you know I Am I'm a mosaic of a person and\nThat's authentically who I Am\nThat's Sarah Jones talking about our place sell by date Sarah\nThanks so much thank
