that are three point seven billion years old a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Horowitz is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from the floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of the total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar mineral structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland where even more ancient two hundred million years older and they'd been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should follow up on that [laughter]\nHer wits and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures aren't really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our for lack of a better word they kind of look like ...\nAren't really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our swat them a better word that kind of look like ... bars they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would is an astrobiologist at NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they use the proto type of an instrument that NASA\nIs planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life she says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nIt to the point and it's all good pointing from the perspective of\nWhat it means a lot on non\nShe says if life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take hold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance\nNow the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis they still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils so far relatively few scientists have studied these rocks\nThat means it's a pretty sure bet that this won't be the last word Nell Greenfieldboyce NPR News [noise]\nAnd you're listening to NPR News partial sure are still so Sean hundreds of thousands of veterans who've received less than

hard Brexit means for British and European economies\nGeorge Parker has written about this she's a political editor of the Financial Times joining us from Brussels where he is following the negotiations will come back to the program polar if there were to be no deal at all what immediate changes would take effect on march twenty ninth when the u._k. leaves the\nWell that could be quite severe ... kind of no deal we actually end up with if it was a totally chaotic an acrimonious no deal with\nEverybody ended up throwing place with each other in person left to you in very bad dosage and indeed than you could see some very serious impacts to the border so you would have\nA and B you'd have to check some old goods coming in and also the u._k. which doesn't help of the moment that we could do to huge queues of the pools coming into person I'm very quickly the companies in person which rely on seamless flow of goods across borders in Europe they would run out of ... trees were closed\nVery quickly the companies in person which rely on seamless flow of goods across borders in Europe they would run out parts factories were closed down\nOn the bank of England is focused this could be actually a very detailed chicken damaging EPA say for the British economy which could last for months there's all sorts of contingency plan and getting on the u._k. in case this happens talk of stockpiling of medicines there's the fresh food wrote could run out very quickly\nThere are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool it will be quite bad and the pursuit calling me will take a very big ...\nSo you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been a some sort of stockpiling some certain types of medicines once you ... a place where there are ... for the moment you can have she's running for miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile cues things just wouldn't be coming through so\nSo there are concerns that they will be shortages certainly in more distant parts from the pool so\nPretty serious sets us in our series of being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasury has made an estimate says what would happen in the medium term if Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock could cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy and red tape out the borders and that without to business costs\nIt would make it ... percent less attractive place to invest because if you have less access to the European market the potential for terrorists as well so the u._k. treasuries estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about eight percent smaller than it otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big\nHit ... sort of an aircraft\nCrunchy losing height you wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but I have a time person will be a poor taste\nWould it be in the case which is a pretty big hit and spit out into sort of an aircraft crunchy losing height you wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but over time person will be a poor place and otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe if UK leaves with how to deal\nWith the rest of your this has always been something that the euro skeptics in person of clung to the idea that Europe wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because person as a major destination for European ... so they would be an effect on all manner of European produces whether it's um and they won produces in France cop she says in Germany\nAnd you name it they ... they will be effective because UK off the breaks it will become the biggest single export destinations for all the all the European Union countries but the point is is a symmetric shock waltz it's true that some other European countries with suffering as a result of new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from the deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's more the lesson to be honest I I mean we all quiet at the Y. yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides and not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere's another potential problem which is that if the reason why the British prime minister does a deal in Brussels she then has to sell it to have very divided policy back in London and I think actually negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be the positive then negotiating a deal with our European partners so\nAnything could happen but I think my base assumption still despite all the negative noises around as the common sense will prevail on that will be a deal at the end of the day\nParker is a political editor of the Financial Times thanks

...\n...\n... you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nWhen most people make a mistake they say\nI'm Sorry but what should accompany do when it makes a mistake a recent study looked at the economics of apologies Stacey Vanek Smith host of the podcast the indicator from Planet Money spoke with Benjamin whoa he's an economics professor at Vassar about why saying sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nYou know just like really really interesting study as a way to study apologies\nSo the study was partnered with Hoover so we look we focus on the Ninety five percent pile of lightness all the most extreme ... mostly rides there's about a five percent chance that you never come back to her again\nAnd the question is how can we repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between ... and its broader we tested different kinds of apologies\nAnd we found the right kind of apology could basically increase revenues by one to two percent of the wrong kind of apology could decreased revenue so I went to two percent which we tested apologies in of all sort of commitments to do better or or not what we saw is that a commitment to do better in the future it's it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology\nAnd we found that basically two or three months later these commitments have you been in the future actually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to do but in the future and then the ... he didn't do better because then maybe maybe for some of them they had another bad experience and that as a result the those people punished but more than than the control group that got no apology at all\nDid they ever have a good effect I'm\nIn our data I'm so [laughter] I think they they they they temporarily\nThan the control group that got no apology at all did they ever have a good effect I'm\nNot in our data so [laughter] I think they they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect or or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet still seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability\nI think part of it is that our brains sort of works on scripts interest X and so you know entering a relationship with a company we sort of like the same sort of scripts and risks triggering her brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company\nSo what were the what would the apologies that really worked for ... like what was the magic\nThe magic was money [laughter]\nYeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um\nThat we tested apologies with or without a coupon and we we which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones who sort of increased revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or was there are certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out the best language but we found that there was no statistical difference between the different languages his money it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that you might may not find a bit was a message to sort of committed to be more in the future\nDo you think this like carries over into personal relationships thing that I'm so sorry that I like whatever was late meeting for ten bucks [laughter]\nYou know she was a box of chocolates right or here's your letters and flowers flowers and candy and so it takes\nOn a whole new significance um does it hasn't changed the way like you apologize\n[laughter] people thought always wanted to ask you this question how they do I was curious I think the main ways change with that because all my friends and my family and know that I study apologies\nPeople thought always wanted to ask you this question how do I was curious I think the main ways change with that because all my friends and my family and do that I study apologies than they would always are might be skeptical whenever I Apologize though after like go an extra mile to sort of sound like Ernest insincere remorseful because

[noise]\nA couple of years ago scientists announced that they had found the oldest evidence of life in rocks that are three point seven billion years old a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell green\nA separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Horowitz is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from the floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of the total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar mineral structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland where even more ancient two hundred million years older and they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should fall ... [laughter]\nHer wits and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures aren't really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our lack of a better word that kind of look like ... bars they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would is an astrobiologist at NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they use the proto type of an instrument that NASA is planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life she says the chemistry of the Greenland\nShe says they used a proto type of an instrument that NASA is planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life she says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nIt pointing at at that point from the perspective of what it means a lot on non\nShe says if life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take hold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance\nNow the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis they still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils\nSo far relatively few scientists have studied these rocks that means it's a pretty sure bet that this won't be the last word\nNell Greenfieldboyce NPR News [noise]\nAnd you're listening to NPR News\nPartial Sean I still

twenty nine when the u._k. leaves the\nWell they could be quite severe it all depends on what kind of no deal we actually end up with if it was a totally chaotic an acrimonious no deal where\nEverybody ended up throwing places each other in person left to you in very but\nDon't you and indeed then you could see some very serious impacts of the border so you would have\nA immediately you'd have to check some old goods coming in and out of the u._k. which doesn't have the moment that will quickly to huge queues to the pool it's coming into person and very quickly the companies in person which rely on seamless flow of goods across borders in Europe they would run out of ... trees were closed down\nOn the bank of England is focused this could be actually a very detailed chicken

food wrote could run out very quickly there are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal\nFresh food wrote could run out very quickly there are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool it will be quite bad and the pursuit company will take a very big has\nSaid you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been some talk of stockpiling some certain types of medicines\nOnce you ... the place where there are ... you can have she's running for miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile cues things just wouldn't be coming through so so there are concerns that they will be shortages set in the in more distant parts from the port so pretty serious sets us in our ears are being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasury has made an estimate of what was happening in the medium term if Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock it cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy in red tape on the board is not without to business costs\nYou will make it ... percent less attractive place to invest because of a you have less access to the European market to potential for terrorists as well so the Treasury's estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about eight percent smaller than it otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big\nHits and spit out into sort of an aircraft\nCrunchy losing height you wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but over time person will be a poor place and otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe is the u._k. leaves with how to deal\nWith the rest of your this has always been something that the euro skeptics in person of clung to the idea that Europe wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because a person as a major destination for European ... so they would the U.S an effect on all manner of European produces whether it's ...\nIt's a major destination for European exposed so they will be an effect on all manner of European produces whether some and they won produces in France cop produces in Germany\nUm you name it they ... they will be effective because UK off to breaks it will become the biggest single export destinations for all the all the European Union countries but the point is is a symmetric shock waltz it's true that some other European countries would suffer as a result of new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from the deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's more of a lot to be honest I I mean we all ... at the Y. yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides are not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere was another potential problem which is that if the reason why the British prime minister doesn't deal in Brussels she then has to sell it to have very divided policy back in London and I think actually negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be the positive and negotiating a deal with our European partners so\nAnything could happen but I think my ... still despite all the negative noises around as the common sense will prevail on that will be a deal at the end of the day\nGeorge Parker is a political

it makes a mistake a recent study looked at the economics of apologies Stacey Vanek Smith host of the podcast the indicator from Planet Money spoke with Benjamin whoa he's an economics professor at Vassar about why saying sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nYou did this like really really interesting study as a way to study apologies\nSo the study was partnered with Hoover so we look we focus on the Ninety five percent pile of lightness all the most extreme ... mostly rides there's about a five percent chance that you never come back to where again\nAnd the question is how can we repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between ... and its rider we tested different kinds of apologies\nAnd we found that the right kind of apology could basically increase revenues by one to two percent of the wrong kind of apology could decrease the revenues that went to two percent which we tested apologies and involves sort of commitments to do better or or not what we saw was that a commitment to do better in the future it's it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology\nAnd we found that basically two or three months later these commitments to do better in the future\nActually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to do about the future and then the ... and do better cars than maybe it's maybe for some of them they had another bad experience and I as a result the those people punished you but more than than the control group that got no apology at all\nDid they ever have a good effect I'm\nNot in our data um [noise] so [laughter] I think they they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect or or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet still seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability\nRemorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet still seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability\nI think part of it is that our brains sort of works on script singer is six and so you know enter in a relationship with a company we sort of like the same sort of scripts and risks triggering her brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company\nSo what were the what would the apologies that really worked for ... like what was the magic\nThe magic was money [laughter]\nYeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um\nThat we tested apologies with or without a coupon and we we which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones who sort of increased revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or was there are certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out the the best language but we found that there was no statistical difference between the different languages his money it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that actually might may not find a bit was a message to sort of committed to be more in the future\nDo you think this like carries over into

flowers and candy and so it takes\nOn a whole new significance um does it hasn't changed the way like you apologize [laughter]\nWhen people thought always wanted to ask you this question how they do I was curious I think the main ways change with that because all my friends and my family and know that I study apologies than they would always it's awfully skeptical whenever I apologized so I have to

purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be a huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the matrix based upon that\nSo just to parse the SAT there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was legal there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that could be grounds for burning somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister because right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to\nBecause right now he has a diplomatic passport and be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law at the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation less chaotic going forward\nWell I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which is take a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admit that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\n... he's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today in Canada and what problems that might cause at the U.S Canada border Mr ...

Michael made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile an hour wins a week ago entire blocks were flattened NPR's Greg Allen reports many are now calling for revised stricter building codes on Florida's panhandle\nIn Mexico beach Lance Irwin is one of the lucky ones his house is still standing he rode out the storm in his home several blocks from the beach\nThat arrived or shake somebody's

washed houses on the beach off their foundations to the other side of the coastal road\nHigh winds lifted off roofs and knocked down walls quite few gate is the former head of FEMA and a long time urgency management official in Florida he points to one reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach in other communities in the panhandle in many cases it's old construction that predates the building code\nAnd this is a part of Florida that's what I call the Florida is not a bunch of high rises is not a lot of construction this is all the generational of Florida families any of them or just said that Trump folks that fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade in Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring storm shutters and reinforced concrete block construction for all buildings structures must be able to withstand winds up to one hundred and Seventy five miles per

later Florida revised it's state wide building code John ... to Reno a structural engineer in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on probability of storms in the past and all of that is sort of a goes down as you go further north in Florida\nHistorically there have been fewer intense hurricanes in the panhandle but elsewhere in the state in some north Florida communities new construction need only withstand when speeds one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less far below the one hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds scene in hurricane Michael\nIn the aftermath of the storm as local state and federal officials assess the damage a consensus is emerging that building codes along Florida's panhandle need to be stricter\nDavid provide is a professor of civil engineering at the University of Florida he's part of a team that's been the weekend on the panhandle gathering data on Michael's impact\nWhat we were damaged to pretty much all types of construction all types of materials and all types of what was not damaged houses that were well engineered\nFormer FEMA ahead Craig Fugate has long believed the wind speed standards along Florida's panhandle were too low he says when policymakers develop them they left out information about a powerful hurricanes that hit the area in the nineteenth century before accurate record keeping\nIt yeah that storm back in and out particularly yet Michael back in is

defending its admissions policy in uh Boston courtroom this week the question is whether the school discriminates against Asian American applicants the case could go to the Supreme Court with broad implications for affirmative action and schools\nYesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race Kelly ... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she is a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered\nKate thanks for having me why do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race nearly treats and illusion of diversity and I'd love to see and missions policies change not to have race it\nNow Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors and that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from the list of factors that Harvard is considering one at assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to that racist sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but oftentimes the factory that decision is based on I think Harvard as saying that they do that but let's see ... has been showing it\nNearly factor but often times the factory that a decision is based on I think Harvard is saying that they don't do that but what's in for fair admissions has been showing in court the past few days and has really brought to light is that oftentimes it is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents are missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of did this with Jewish applicants as well and sort of use the personal ratings artificially keep their numbers lower although there is going higher on everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case of allege that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost as a front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think about argument\nI don't think that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed in at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how formative action policies are impacting different communities\n[noise] I'd like you to respond to something the Harvard senior Sally ... said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial there was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of\nThe ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead merit means nothing without context what do you think of that idea so I think\nThat a lot of admissions processes should be based on just married but I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize\nSo I think that a lot of admissions processes should be based on just married\nBut I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important\nBut I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at married in the context of race but again like I said married in the context of economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that all of a sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever the sort of benefits of it are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to racial ... admissions 'em and instead focus on something like poverty because when we focus on something like race I think it\nCreates a sort of division in sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race\nWon't tell me about ... thank you so much for talking with us today Thanks so much for having me

social\nAnd social science we think about the identity as being how human groups or individuals are defined by themselves or an how others perceive them\nNielsen says home DNA tests or find something
