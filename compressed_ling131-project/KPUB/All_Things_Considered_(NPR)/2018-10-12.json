on a regular basis or because they are two of his highest profile African American supporters are\nAnd Trump claims that west coming out in support of them has boosted his standing in the African with the African American community\nAnd now Trump has an offered any real evidence of that but that's what he says\nAnd what Trump usually does at rallies and on Twitter is he will mention Kanye West or Jim Brown and then he will talk about how black unemployment is lower since he took office and these other economic indicators that are better for black people and he basically said that people like west and brown quote\nGet it and they see the benefits of backing him\nOkay so how about the conversation to even know what they talked about today\nI think we're supposed to talk about a lot of

solve other cold cases so young ... early kept the company my heritage wondered just how easy is it to use databases like his to find people\nWe wanted to quantify how powerful the technique to identify individual\nSo Ehrlich and his colleagues analyzed the DNA for more than one point two million people in this company's database and discovered something startling for more than sixty percent of people of European descent they could identify or relative as distant as a third cousin most of the people in this database or white\nEach person in these debates as a because that illuminate hundreds of these ... so it's enough to live with your third cousins or your second cousin once removed in the debate as to actually identify you\nThe same way that a GPS system you there's multiple satellites to find a location\nAnd when the researchers combined their data with other information like where a person probably lives and our old they are they could quickly zoom in on a suspect\nOf course you need the geological records you need to do that the war but you have enough power to to get very for them\nSomething to that debate as a because that illuminate hundreds of ... so it's

National Institutes of health research database raising questions about how ... the supposedly anonymous databases really are\nThese techniques doesn't only can get you criminals or you can catch criminals with these technique but you can also use these techniques for other purposes maybe purposes that could be either due to me it\nSo early says the findings raised questions about how genetic information could be misused\nThe police to covering the using these techniques to find it really like you know ... and\n... people but uh we okay we've using these techniques to identify people that I don't know in the political demonstration that lift do DNA behind a wheel K really he's foreign governments are going to exploit this technique\nTo identify us citizens for their own purposes so there are many scenarios that you can think about me you\nKnow many people defending the use of these techniques to help solve serious crimes\nExcited to see this demonstration that genetic genealogy

horrific in murders of children things like that it just [noise] things that need to be solved\nAnd grey tech says it's not nearly as easy as this new research may make it sound but others argue that the findings underscore the need to make sure people know what they're getting into when they agree to give up their genetic information Erin Murphy is a New York university law professor\nIf it comes out tomorrow that they can use genetic information for something that feels a little unsavory it's going to be virtually impossible to claw back the information that you've put out into the world and more importantly you've made a decision not just for yourself but for your siblings for your distant cousins for people you don't even know you're related to for your children for your children's

Rob Stein has the details\nPolice made headlines last spring when they finally nabbed a suspect first series of brutal rapes and murders in California from the Nineteen seventies and eighties\nHas the same killer finally the cash or California investigators and jet match dot com to name just has changed the Angelo at that fact and it was a website to try to identify the notorious Golden State killer\nAnd that was just the beginning police around the country of started doing the same sort of thing to solve other cold cases so young ... early kept the company my heritage wondered just how easy is it to use databases like his to find people\nWe wanted to quantify how powerful is used technique to identify individual\nSo Ehrlich and his colleagues analyzed the DNA for more than one point two million people in this company's database and discovered something startling for more than sixty percent of people of European descent they could identify or relative as distant as a third cousin most of the people in this database or white\nEach person in these debates as a because that illuminate hundreds of ... so it's enough to live with your third cousins or your second cousins once removed in these databases to actually identify you\nDrugs so Ehrlich and his colleagues analyzed the DNA from more than one point two million people in this company's data base and discovered something startling for more than six percent of people of European descent they could identify or relative as distant as a third cousin most of the people in this database or white\nEach person and you start the base as a beat Clinton that illuminates\nHundreds of these ... so it's enough to have your third cousins or your second cousins once removed in these databases to actually identify you the same way that a GPS system you there's multiple satellites to find a location\nAnd when the researchers combined their data with other information like where a person probably lives and how old they are they could quickly zoom in on a suspect\nOf course you need the geological records you need to do that the war but you have enough power to to get very for them\nAnd Ehrlich use the same techniques to identify it supposedly anonymous woman whose DNA was stored on a National Institutes of health research database raising questions about how would not miss the supposedly anonymous databases really are\nThese techniques doesn't only can get you ... you can catch criminals with these technique but you can also used this technique for other purposes maybe purposes that could be either due to MIT\nSo early says the findings raise questions about how genetic information could be misused\nThe police come into the using these techniques to find these really like you know ... and\n... people but uh we okay we've using these techniques to identify people that I don't know in the political demonstration that lift do DNA behind a wheel K really he's foreign governments are going to exploited these techniques\nTo identify us see things as for their own purposes so there are many scenarios that you can think about me even\nNow many people defending the use of these techniques to help solve serious crime\nQuestions about how genetic information could be misused\nThe police covering the using these techniques to find these really like you know ... and\n... people but uh we okay we've using these techniques to identify people that I don't know in the political demonstration that leftover DNA behind a wheel K relieved if foreign governments are going to exploited these techniques\nDo identify us citizens for their own purposes so that there are many scenarios that you can think about me you\nKnow many people defending use of these techniques to help solve serious crimes\nExcited to see this demonstration that genetic genealogy is so powerful\nEllen great tack works at ... which helps police solve crimes is way\nWe're working on these cases that you haven't been able to be solved for decades\nThey're all either homicide or sexual assault and and some of these are just I mean they're her effect you know murders of children things like that and

slash foreign aid and their shoes on a trip highlighting all the good the American foreign aid does was that awkward\nIt's that strange sort of juxtaposition between the first lady and what she does and the president and what he does write this is sort of like raised eyebrows and also just going to Africa that earlier this year he was accused of\nUm perhaps saying some derogatory comments about what she wanted to do is say here is what this organization is doing and in spite of budget cuts just you know the idea is to help these countries get off of the need for our aid so certainly didn't

he says the evidence from places such as Baltimore is that federal consent decrees can sometimes make crime worse by limiting the intensity of policing in the places where young men carry guns and shoot each other\nIf we're going to reduce murders we have to go to places where murders happen there's going to be racial disparity but that is separate from racial bias and racial bias has to be

be talking with you also\nSo this was going to the American they hate the first time into the the second for like the ocean and what kind of training would they had had to handle a situation like that\nBoth of them and training for decades Alexei as cosmonauts for quite a while as you say with space flight experience Nick prior to being an astronaut was\nA test pilot in the U.S air force so that's an extremely risky complex job so they've been getting ready for this for many many years and then specifically for this launched they would working together for a couple of years we wring out every last thing that could possibly go wrong\nAnd the way the crew behave there were so Chris and professional right on top of their game you would never know that the vehicle was behaving so badly if you listen to all Alexei ... which dealing with things bringing them both safely back to her\nWhen would be the next you know you could go on a mission like this again I mean I Can't imagine a psychological blow\nYeah you're you're right you know the crew at first will be super focused in professional and doing their job but afterwards they're just going to be cut them mad because they didn't get to go to the base today you know kind of\nLike gosh all that preparation you into that but neither of them got hurt and they're they're back in the game and they'll have a chance to fly again but I don't know who will fly next it's way too soon to tell it's going to be a a long time to figure out what went wrong and then we'll have to start thinking about who should fly next what's skill sets should we need one is that going to be\nPsychological blow\nYeah you're you're right you know the crew at first will be super focused in professional and doing their job but afterwards they're just going to be\nKind of mad because they didn't get to go to the base today you know kind of like\nGosh all that preparation that but neither of them got hurt and there are back in the game and they'll have a chance to fly again by and I don't know who\nWill fly next it's way too soon to tell it's going to be a a long time to figure out what went wrong and then we'll have to start thinking about who should fly next what's skill sets should we need one is that going to be all of the repercussions that come from an event like today\nTell me what it will take what kind of conversations are going to have to happen to figure out how to move forward the\nFirst thing we need to do is find out what went wrong what failed in this rocket there's a lot of information people be able to sift through video of it but also the sensors on board then we need to see how can we fix it was it a design problem of manufacturing problem who knows\nThat and once you know that you can fix it then you can set a timeline if that in three months from now than no big deal but if it's going to take a year or two years\nThen we need other plans bowling is building a rocket that can take people to the space station or ... or a spaceship SpaceX is building a ship that can take people to the space station maybe they could be accelerated maybe they could fly before the Russians are going to be ready to fly again and when do we bring the crew back from the space station all of those questions need to be analyzed\nThe way I understand they were expecting to return home and now that return could be delayed correct\nThey flew up and the different ... to the space station it's sort of like a lifeboat or their their their ride home if they're they can come home anytime they want but if they ... come home\nThan they are basically abandoning ship the space station would be empty and it's a big enough and complicated enough shift that after a little wild things start to go wrong and there'd be nobody there to fix them so it really causes a lot of risk\nThe crew back from the space station all of those questions need to be analyzed\nThe way I understand they were expecting to return home and now that return could be delayed correct\nThey flew up in a different ... to the space station and sort of like a lifeboat or their their their ride home if they're they can come home anytime they want but if they on talking to come home than they are basically abandoning ship the space station would be empty and it's a big enough and complicated enough ship\nThat after a little wild things start to go wrong and there'd be nobody there to fix them\nSo it really causes a lot of risk for the space station to leave it on man\nSo people will be looking really hard at all of the limits and have to decide what the right trade offs are we don't know the answers yet but it's going to be a really complicated decision making process coming up\nWagon to this is interesting because because a lot of journalists have written critically about Saudi Arabia and that the direction that Mohammed bin Salman is taking at what you're describing is why he might have been seen as a\nAs a

court so it's different you know if I criticize Saudi Arabia for something that's one thing but if Jim ... ah did that\nThen it's different because he's speaking from within the family does\nIt strike you as puzzling now I mean the reports are being stores to shows Turkish investigator saying that this team of Fifteen people flew in on private planes with the express purpose of targeting ... that just seems like a massive operation to take out one editor\nIt sounds so crazy that it's hard to get your head around it that Saudi Arabia would go this far to allegedly killed one of their

cells develop into a three D. structure known as a retinal org annoyed it\nReally looks and acts like a developing retina that you would see in a baby\nSo it's able to detect both light and color Johnston is an assistant professor in the biology department and until a few years ago his lab had been studying vision in flies but Johnson an Eldridge saw a chance to try something much more ambitious\nWe've discussed this crazy idea of could we use the human retinal org annoyed to study how we get the different colors and things sell in our eyes\nJohnston says using human cells was key because you can't study human color vision and fly or even a mouse\nMice don't fence read they don't have these red detecting cells and so we really have to study this in developing human tissue to get any insight into how it works\nJohnston ... knew that in a human fetus cells that detect blue light up here first and come sell to respond to red and green light and research on animals suggested

and many more experiments to confirm that thigh right hormone was actually triggering the emergence of color vision and the teams still hasn't figured out what causes some cones to go on to become even more specialized by detecting only read or only green but Johnston says his lab is ready to take on two new goal\nWanted to restore color vision to people that are colorblind but perhaps just as important there is a disorder called macular degeneration that is the leading cause of vision loss\nMacular degeneration affects the macular an area of the retina that provides high resolution vision

from Portland, Oregon hey hey how's it going there good so why\nDon't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been what Twenty years since there last basketball she wouldn't\nYeah so they had it for a night to Ninety eight and it was very short lived they had signed just one clear and been quarter\nAnd yoga broker after two years and so they've been out the game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball basketball's always had these\nThese elements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really has and so a coma that's a big part of the appeal what's happening in with the players of today that are young and trend setting and exciting and also I think a big\nThing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their basketball's really a big gateway in terms of being a global brand as well\nBut how much do they have now to get a big name behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and Adidas they were able to attract people like Michael Jordan and LeBron James is ... even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdle for any newcomer yeah um you know I I did a lot of research last year like you had about sixty percent of the week wearing their shoes last oh okay step in and combat that is pretty tough but okay [laughter] yeah they do have they do have a huge budget an allowance for corporate standpoint and they signed\nSix of the top Fifteen draft picks this year along with an old aren't into

detractors have been\nNot as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have\nIt's really tough to say how these guys will pan out there so many cases of guys that were drafted high that\nYou know we're bus that didn't pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media is she's gotten a chance to check out Pomona hoops on Instagram they are unlike any other brand and it's kind of wild wild west and they'll post whatever and it's very on corporate life but I think people if they could see that in mid may kind of fun\nYou see the wild wild west is it more important in some ways how these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting she banned in what they do on the court\nYeah that's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the stats in terms of high school kids they're watching less and less of a full through our game and they're really kind of immersing more on what these guys are doing away from the game and and they're seeing snippets of highlights on his ... and things like that but I looked it up the other day and out of the nine guys that pulled assigned\nThey have six and a half million combined followers on Instagram so that's a huge base as the brand just starting out you know I think the brand itself has only had a couple of hundred thousand followers and so\nThey're really lenient on their players counts and ethical big part of their strategy with their shoes that they don't want shoes that look just like a standard basketball shoe they're trying to create stuff that maybe has a little more lifestyle to it that guys can be showcasing in different ways on their own pages and so that's going to be a huge push for sure\n... covers the athletic she

the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl\nWorld has been under tremendous pressure to resign since a report this summer detailed the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of mishandling several cases of abuse well at the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that skating horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro\nBirds state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm going to ask you about your reaction to worlds resignation what went through your mind when you first heard the news today what cardinal ...\nWelcome to be with you thank you so I'm gonna ask you about your reaction to worlds resignation what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWhat cardinal worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse I actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church\nI think what's missing here though is an acknowledgement by the Vatican\nOn the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop ... role in it now I'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their parishioners but I I Do not think\nThat the people of Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up\nShould face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop world played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for a changing the current statute of limitations you you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living\nTwo of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living every single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nThat would have to completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the case becomes to prove witnesses pass away memories fade evidence grown stale does any of that concern you as a lawyer\nOf course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when the number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who were abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two fifty two and yet the law here in Pennsylvania says that we couldn't bring a criminal case

stock prices plunge Trump ripped into the fed for raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years I think the fed has gone crazy\nI think the fed is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong\nAll right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked at the fed for forty years until twenty ten ... was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today thank you for having me here also so how usual is it for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nBeen very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush the president and its ministry shouldn't often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy that maybe didn't call the fed crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve and for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known privately\nCountry not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known private lead to the chair and other members other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nOkay so up until now fed officials happened defending said from the president's attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fad Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes so does Evans have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these right I\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing and a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself\nOr with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think then at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president said how sway the fed to slow down the rate hikes\nUh no I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident that it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis information\nUsing the institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be sending or\nI think is very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up his attacks and others drawing him and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation\nSo I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the\nPolarized political situation so I don't see an economic riskier\nWho the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it is a deliberate\nNonpartisan institution that's acting in their best interests but you're a little concerned that maybe Trump's rhetoric could be affecting that trust among the marriage thinking could overtime German power ceases worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill\nTrying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's oversight group why they're doing what they're doing and I think that's\nAs well as explaining to the American people and I think that's the basic insulation\nFor the Federal Reserve from political pressure is understanding that Donald come the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve board of
