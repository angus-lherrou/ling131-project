just simply for partisan gang attorney Deborah Katz says she ran straight into it when she represented Kavanaugh's accuser Dr Christie bloody Ford we have\nThe president's deliberately muddying the

consensus among young people\nFewer of those under thirty five believed that me too has gone too far fewer say they would ever consider voting for a political candidate accused of sexual misconduct

be refocusing more and its roots back here in Europe\nNow the war games that they are staging right now has a NATO forces defending country that's been attacked by an unnamed invaders\nAnd what they're really trying to emphasize here is a pillar of NATO which is if one country has attacked it's seen as as an attack on all NATO members now a most assume is fictitious invader is Russia an earlier this fall Russia had massive war games in the east and and now it seems to be NATO's during\nThese huge military maneuvers by NATO and the Russians makes it sound like we're returning to something like the Cold War is there talk of that they're in Norway where you are\nAlready they're very careful to say this is not a new Cold War but they also admit you know the global landscape has

challenging NATO they need they frankly they need to think twice\nAnd of course President Trump has not been for about the U.S commitment to NATO as some of his predecessors I mean he's publicly berated some NATO member countries for not spending enough on defense is that tension playing out as these exercises unfold\nNo certainly not on the surface and there's a real emphasis on unity here in the United states heavy commitment we have Seventy five hundred Marines here I was talking to you and Stoltenberg he's the NATO secretary general he says there's a difference between the political rhetoric you here and actually the troops on the ground what we see is stunts\nOr the United states is increasing its presence military presence in Europe would more forces more exercises more pre
