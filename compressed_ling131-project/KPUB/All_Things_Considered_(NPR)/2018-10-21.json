California when police stopped him\nAccording to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy and then he was taser several times this Kobe later died at a hospital\nAnd it might have ended there without much public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella Coby is Facebook's public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story and she's with us now from London Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss thank you so much for having me\nNow I have to ask do you think that race was a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this it absolutely\nWas I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds and it fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think that it has been shown that police officers\nAre able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed I mean I think of the classic example is um Dylann Roof who who murdered and he went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to to arrest him without harming him\nWho murdered and who went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to to arrest him without harming him um it it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests for black men in particular versus arrest for white men that very clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he had been described as six foot three and three hundred pounds of sort of those ... those are factual details though aren't they I mean if you were to someone you wouldn't you describe those things\nYou might not so for example do you know how tall Dylann Roof is you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as other so as easily as Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\nMhm [noise] it's been reported that your brother's struggled with some mental health issues is that is that accurate\nYes that's absolutely accurate\nDo you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often just proportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police to to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that his mental health issues or a factor in this as well\nAnd I think here you see the impact of intersection Audi so he is at the intersection of being a person of color a black man at the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think statistics and I think I Know statistics show and Kevin between police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person has a black man so I definitely think mental health has something to do with and I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who's clearly no mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who is just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent I noticed\nSomeone who's clearly no mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who's just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the tech community has responded to this\nWhenever you have areas where the privilege in power intersect in the United states they do tend to be bubbles and they do tend to be bubbles that aren't as connected to issues of poverty that aren't as connected issued a mental health in certain areas and connected it she says race\nIn terms of how people reacted I have been overwhelmed with ... with support and even the fact that then I have the opportunity to talk about our story and tell her story is a direct result of colleagues at Facebook who thought this is an important story and who shouted other classes and story that needed to be told\nThat's about a a Kobe she's the sister of naidoo oh Kobe who died earlier this month after being chased by the San Mateo county sheriff's deputy um she's the public policy director of Africa at Facebook and we reached her in London thank you so much for talking with us and our sympathies to your family once again\nThank you so much for having me\nAs we said earlier police conduct toward civilians particularly when someone dies has become a flashpoint in American Life this happened in Texas last month when an off duty police officer shot and killed an unarmed man in his own home claiming she mistook it for her home and of course ... is that the officer is white and the deceased man was black\nBut according to research by the Washington Post that had been at least sixty eight police killings in Texas this year alone a Texas state center is trying to address this with education he drafted a law that just gone into effect requiring that high school students in the state watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police traffic stops\nMe you know\nStudents in the state watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police traffic stops\nMe you know I don't know [noise]\nWhy are you reading\nRice West is a state senator from Dallas who sponsored the legislation requiring the video and he is with us now senator west thank you so much for talking with us\nMy pleasure how did you come up with this idea frankly\nWe have an overt presentation of African Americans and Latinos that end up in volatile confrontations with law enforcement don't traffic stops and I guess for land do cats do is kind of the tip of iceberg for me\nIt's still end up kind of steel he's an African American man who was shot by police officer in Minnesota\nYes and I wanted to see whether I could do something about it in order to at least to find a baby\nOr expectations of citizens and police officers at what's lost here\nIs that people taking the legislation just focus on citizens well it doesn't and it doesn't just focus on our video a video camera fits stage for additional course content for both the citizen and also police and police academies\nWhat will be expected of the police officers at the academy what we've done is to find the objectives of a what we want police officers to get while they're in the academy and the fact that\nThe length of course is a minimum of two hours the video is just a part of it's sort of a primer\nThe video that we saw at least the video aimed at the students the text to what appeared to be two white teenage girls and they're pulled over by two African American police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking\nText to what appeared to be two white teenage girls and they're pulled over by two African American police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally about Seventy nine percent of police officers are white\nUh let me just say this the purpose\nOf the video is as a primer you know if we need to go back and mix mix it up that's fine we can do that but the purpose is to make certain we define behavior expectations police officers and citizens and the citizens know what their rights\nWhen you have a traffic stop if someone wants to get down and picket who was cast in the ...\nOr whatever they gave me why is that irrelevant when this very issue that used to spark your concern here is an African American man in an encounter with a person who doesn't look like him if that's the source of the tents and why would\nYou let let ... let me ask this question you can pick out and that's fine at because anything that I Do should\nBe able to withstand scrutiny and if I Need to improve on that I Will but the objective was to find a mechanism by which we could have ... behavior content\nFor everyone and I thought getting a driver's license was a perfect place to put their behavior expectations of citizens and make certain citizens know what their rights or I thought put it in schools and making it mandatory\nWas a great place to put it also also driver's license courses and also the police department of police academies and by doing that you have a great deal of repetition and hopefully that repetition will ultimately save lives\nYou know they say this country has more divided than ever but there's one thing we can all agree on other people just

courts as a candidate Donald Trump promised to do it as president it's been one of his most touted successes and why you've probably heard about the federalist society Israel and during that that's the conservative legal group who's lists of potential judicial nominees\nPost touted successes and why you've probably heard about the federalist society is role and doing that that's a conservative legal group who's lists of potential judicial nominees has produced two Supreme Court justices another group has also played a key role and the project\nAnd that groups tactics are now raising ethical questions we're talking about the Heritage Foundation that is a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC\nThis week the New York times wrote about a secret training program being launched by the group\nTargeting recent law school graduates who had secured clerk ships for federal judges\nIn exchange for participation and the all expense paid program these clerks which you keep the training secret and sign something of a loyalty oath\nNew York times reporter Adam ... wrote about this program earlier this week which the Heritage Foundation says it has now suspended after his piece was published Adam's with us now Adam thanks so much for joining us is going to be here so what was the stated purpose of this program how is it advertised\nTo the program was a three day kind of seminar they called it a training academy in which they would teach these potential law clerks about legal concepts seemingly tilted in a conservative direction\nBut you spoke with some legal scholars who said that this raised ethical concerns what were the concerns\nWell they said there may be nothing wrong with a seminar there may even be nothing wrong with an all expenses paid seminar\nBut there was something problematic about requiring the people who attended to keep what they learn secret probably even from the judges that they were going to serve in something deeply problematic about having to make a promise\nThat whatever they learn will be used for and they're going to quote now from their materials for any purpose contrary to the mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation\nAnd just dig into that of it like the the ethical concern here is what do you get to the ethical specific ethical question here\n... and just dig into that like the the ethical concern here is what do you get to the ethical specific ethical question here\nSo it it looks like in the words of some legal experts kind of indoctrination a law clerk is a an employee of the federal government and the judicial system the law clerks loyalties ought to run to the judicial system into their judges\nAnd not to a private organization that describes itself as a bastion of the American conservative legal movement\nThat it's a concern here that they were indoctrinated people into sort of placing an ideology above their commitment to do justice\nThere yeah that that that's exactly right so it it's probably an affirmative good things for law clerks and others to learn as much as they can about all different kinds of legal concepts including ones that come from a particular ideological direction\nBut not a good thing to promise to keep it secret and not a good thing to promise not to act in a direction different from what the Heritage Foundation wants them to act and\nSo there are all kinds of groups that exist to create fellowship among the like minded as well as to create pipeline for half of the purpose of think tanks in Washington DC is to create pipelines fraternities and sororities they all kind of create\nPipelines um Heritage Foundation has been particularly successful at that they've been particularly intentional at this\nUm creating a shadow government if you will and frightened people on the other side of the I'll do the same thing it does this represent kind of a new strategy for heritage\nI think it's a it's a next step in a program that's been very successful as you say in cultivating in identifying young conservative lawyers who can then be placed on the bench and heritage will say and there'll be right about this that they're counteracting the\nFinding young conservative lawyers who can then be placed on the bench\nAnd heritage will say and there'll be right about this that they're counteracting the American legal academy where the fancy law schools to professors and students are overwhelmingly liberal so they're trying to counteract that but legal experts say they may have taken a step too far\nIn trying to get into the world of law clerks who have obligations to the justice system and to judges and to not only expose them to ideas which is probably find\nBut also to make to make these pledges of secrecy and loyalty which legal experts say is\nNot fine and what does heritage say about this I Do know that when you're a piece published on online Thursday that heritage put out a statement said that they were actually suspending this program what else did they say\nThey had been very close mouthed about it a try them repeatedly before and after\nThe article was published they said it was a private program they didn't want to see who was paying for it\nYou know their materials say the generous donors were making a significant financial investment in each and every attendee they wouldn't say who their donors were they said sitting federal appeals court judges were among the faculty they wouldn't say who those judges where and when they decided to suspend the program which was supposed to happen in February\nThey just issued a brief blends statements saying they were reevaluating it\nWhich suggest that perhaps they might try to reconstitute it in a different form\nIt's entirely possible you know that's Adam attack he covers the Supreme Court and legal affairs for the New York times Adam ... thanks so much for talking to us it was great to be here\nFinally today we are going to head into the
