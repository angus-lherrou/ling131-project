write in this book that it can affect not just opinions and reputations but the course of war and you cite a fascinating example a new rapid communications medium\nTransforming a military offensive this was the German invasion of France what happened\nSo you had this new technology that are connected everything from tanks to airplanes or to the broader population was wireless communication and\nRadio proved to be the secret sauce so to speak for everything from the political changes or the rise of Nazi ism Gobel ... a said that it wouldn't have been possible what they did without the

intent of the Chinese Communist party that this will be a unitary score in place for every Chinese internet user of which there about eight hundred million by the year twenty twenty\nWell the other fascinating story you tell about China is they realize how commentary on social media can affect opinion and so they have ... and a large army of people whose job it is to comment favorably on the government policies right\nThat's right and it is a very large army I started out in the tens of thousands moved to the hundreds of thousands and now one estimate has it as high as three million of

and its battles with Hamas and you write that the Israeli military efforts were accompanied by a viral online marketing campaign and they were hip to the importance of this what did they do\nSo it was actually a the twenty twelve pillar of defense operation a eight days of Israeli airstrikes that drew Peter myself to this subject originally and got us researching it ever since [noise]\nUm [noise] this military campaign was accompanied by a remarkable online viral marketing campaign\nThe\nCampaign in twenty twelve opens with the assassination of a high level Amoss militant\nThat's not particularly unusual but is it what is unusual is that the drone strikes video was up within a few hours and the official Twitter account of the Israeli defense forces was broadcasting it out again and again\nIn time or a mosque Twitter proxies respond threatening war and how far\nAnd is the operation commenced as Israel would strike particular targets it would\nPut out information about what had been done about the the weapons caches that had been recovered then must would respond in a similarly taunting manner\nAnd what's important is that this wasn't just the social media operatives if these two sides but also millions and millions of Twitter messages exchanged back and forth by the proxies of one side or another ten million and all and the first twenty twelve conflict Ninety percent of which were outside the region\nAnd this was an example of a limited military campaign that nonetheless was a global war for public opinion and this set a model\nInformation about what have been done about the the weapons caches that had been recovered then Hamas would respond in a similarly taunting manner\nAnd what's important is that this wasn't just the social media operatives if these two sides but also millions and millions of Twitter messages exchanged back and forth by the the proxies of one side or another ten million and all and the first twenty twelve conflict Ninety percent of which were outside the region\nAnd this was an example of a limited military campaign that nonetheless was a global war for public opinion and this set a model that we're starting to see a in all future conflicts\nAnd two things stand out about it the first is that we could all participate it was people outside the region or deciding whose message went viral who's a side of the story was winning out\nBut importantly it was not just winning out on line when it was also affecting the real battlefield decisions when you go back and map out\nThe ah targeting by Israeli airstrikes and the pace of them\nEssentially they changed by almost half dependent on which side was winning out on line so it was happening is that the politicians and the generals were making battlefield decisions while watching what was playing out on their smartphones reflecting what you and I were clicking on\nYou know you make the point again that scale matters if you put put up a an effective post on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram that's one thing\nIf you have an army of people organized to re tweeted and magnify its effect that's all the more important ... did the Israelis anticipate this and have their own Qadri of social media users ready to to give their their message more residents\nOriginally the Israeli military is not ready for this whole space and they're quite\nOwns reflecting what you and I were clicking on\nYou make the point again that scale matters if you put put up a an effective post on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram that's one thing\nIf you have an army of people organized to re tweeted and magnify its effect that's all the more important ... did the Israelis anticipate this and have their own Qadri of social media users ready to to give their their message more residents\nSo originally the Israeli military is not ready for this whole space and they're quite taken aback by a how they're losing this bottle of narrative but with very real physical and political effects\nAnd like any other military they learn they've reorganized and they reorganized and everything from uh creating new military units\nAre in fact one of the fund a images that you can see a line is how they've changed their recruiting to let young Israelis know that you can do your military service by serving in one of these new units that tries to affect the online battle a instead of carrying a gun you can be using Internet means in the like\nBut it's also woven into the broader population for example they create a organizations within a Israeli universities where not only Israeli students but students from around the world\nCan participate in this battle a narrative to they have created apps that allow you and I to download them and serve the cost and you know gain badges and the like\nAnd in many ways what Israel is done has created a model for other militaries around the world that are looking at this and saying maybe we need to engage in this kind of reorganization too and you see it everywhere from ah Europe to some discussion within the U.S military\nSo so you can in enlist and an online army and get you know what badges promotions\nSame way that you can enlist in ...\nYou can participate in this battle a narrative to they have created apps that allow you and I to download them and serve the cost and you know gain badges and the like\nAnd in many ways what Israel is done has created a model for other militaries around the world that are looking at this and saying maybe we need to engage in this kind of reorganization too and you see it everywhere from ah Europe to some discussion within the U.S military\n... so you can in enlist in an online army and get you know what badges promotions\nThe same way that you can enlist in Taylor Swiss army of swift ease you can enlist in the Israeli defense forces on line army the uh cause may not be the same\nBut the tactics are and by contrast with the Israeli approach which is fairly centralized you know giving you a mission giving a set of messages to push\nThe Amoss one pulls from the world at a crowd sources so to speak\nAnd one of the other tools of the trade what are the tricks that used in these but also in political campaigns to marketing is basically to find out what's trending elsewhere and try and try and layer onto it\nSo for example or you had the ice bucket challenge a couple of years ago where we were all you know drawing attention to ourselves as a way to fundraise\nFor a disease research this was woven into the battlefield where people were doing the ice bucket challenge but using rubble after Israeli airstrikes\nYou would put rubble on your head\nYou would port rubble on your head and then the image would go viral and it was a way of kind of hijacking one discussion\nTo drive it to your own ends the same way that ISIS for example would hijacked discussion about a hash tag World Cup and jumped into it to the same way that Trump's online army would try and hijack discussion\nFor a disease research this was woven into the battlefield where people were doing the ice bucket challenge but using rubble after Israeli airstrikes\nYou would put rubble on your head you would port rubble on your head and then the image would go viral and it was a way of kind of hijacking one discussion\nTo drive it to your own ends the same way that ISIS for example would hijacked discussion about a ...

Relations also with us pi Wu singer strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\n[noise] you know I'm interested in your sense of how um social media wars affected opinions about the um Kavanaugh's confirmation controversy I mean this was a case where there were facts in dispute a lot of strongly held opinions do you have any sense of\nHim they must have been social media campaigns what kind of impact they had on how this was perceived and you know the enduring impact it'll have on our discourse\nIf you were watching your social media feeds during the Kavanaugh hearings in many ways it felt like a war going back and forth and uh it was in a certain way\nYou had both sides using the exact same tactics of you know what we call like war that military were using all around the world you could see everything from\nOpen source intelligence gathering campaigns where are they were enlisting the online crowd to find bits of information to bring it together\nAnd they wouldn't have previously been possible or so for example on one side you had a crowd sourced hunt using images from Washington National baseball games to try and figure out who sat next to Kavanaugh too I unpack this strange story of his two hundred thousand dollars in a baseball ticket that\nThen you add the other side this combination of a Google Earth images and Zillow real estate data to basically push this narrative or the ... or narrative that a doctor Ford or the claim was well she's not a liar but she\nPeople are so for example on one side you had a crowd sourced hunt using images from Washington National baseball games to try and figure out who sat next to Kavanaugh to a unpack this strange story of his two hundred thousand dollars in a baseball ticket that\nThen you add the other side of this combination of a Google Earth images and Zillow real estate data to basically push this narrative or the ... or narrative that a doctor Ford or the claim was well she's not a liar but she's confused about who it was\nNow that narrative that was pushed on line points to a second thing that played out\nThe spread of disinformation\nThe spread of alternative theories the idea of bearing the truth underneath a sea of law is it something that for example Russia's specialized again\nAnd again you saw both sides engaging in this in the cabinet debate pushing out all sorts of different false stories false persona as in the like and the battle to have their own narrative went out and the other side's narrative\nBe buried underneath this you even saw attempts to change not just your point of view\nBut history itself for at least the online place that we go to a stop Bush and learn about history with ...\nSo for example in the book where the story of how after the Russian shoot down an airliner over Ukraine Russian actors go on to a PDF very quickly to change the story to make it seemed like they weren't involved\nThe same thing played out during the Kavanaugh hearing where he used the term I'm In is a high school yearbook that was sexual term and during his hearing he says no no no it's not a sexual term it's about a drinking game\nThe problem for him is that there's literally no evidence on the entire Internet of that being a drinking game and\n... so for example in the book where the story of how after the rash and shoot down an airliner over Ukraine Russian um actors go on to ... very quickly to change the story to make it seemed like they weren't involved\nThe same thing played out during the ... hearing where I he used a term I'm In is a high school yearbook it was sexual term and during his hearing he says no no no no it's not a sexual term it's about drinking game\nThe problem for him is that there's literally no evidence on the entire Internet of that being a drinking game\nUntil someone within the house of representatives again everything is out in the open so we can geo located to that\nDuring the middle of the hearing someone in the house of representatives goes to create the evidence on week at the DEA to make it seem as if he is telling the truth so you have this back and forth back and forth\nAnd it's our contention that every single political debate moving forward is going to see these kinds of tactics utilized again because both sides not only use them but believe that they were the key to their effort including in winning\n[noise] you're right that the social media platforms\nAre private companies are and they're now coming to terms with the fact that they play like it or not a very powerful role in elections in the national discourse and have to take some responsibility for dealing with this content which is a huge challenge just because of the sheer volume\nBillions of posts a day and you know the subtle task of of figuring out what is acceptable and what is not um\nAnd that there is a developing tool called neural networks explain what they are what they can do\nNeural networks is part of this larger ah area of research that people talk about is essentially artificial intelligence

out what is acceptable and what is not um\nAnd that there is a developing tool called neural networks explain what they are what they can do\nNeural networks as part of this larger ah area of research that people talk about is essentially artificial intelligence\nOr using machines to not just mimic but maybe in some ways surpass I'm human intelligence and thinking and so neural networks can be used or like any other technology for both good and bad or so for example they can um\nCreate a wonderful imagery and scenes or images of a volcano that doesn't exist in the real world um and\nIt's very powerful and use of ... for example or the future of marketing a it's going to move into areas ah like customer service um the company see this also as a way to save money or for example if you're interacting with a machine rather than someone behind a help desk\nBut like everything else it's also going to be weaponized and so those very same I chat box for example that might be trying to persuade you to buy a product might be trying to persuade you to vote in a certain way or I'm a and convince someone to take a certain position on a war a certain way\nTo challenge also moves into visual imagery there was an area known as deep fakes these are hyper realistic images um videos for example of speeches that politicians never made it seems that never happened and so\nWith humans finding it harder and harder to figure out what is real or not\n... ... for example that might be trying to persuade you to buy a product might be trying to persuade you to vote in a certain way or

videos for example of speeches that politicians never made it seems that never happened and so\nWith humans finding it harder and harder to figure out what is real or not the companies and turn are looking to artificial intelligence to help find it to help police their networks and so you get this strange but yet I'm kind of a wonderfully appropriate outcome\nThe origin of social networks are online we're a bunch of scientists talking about science fiction that's where this all came from\nAnd now we have the science fiction like outcome emerging where you have to a a battling back and forth with us humans caught in the middle\nSo so so these neural networks like that could be good at subtly detecting water robotic Twitter account might be in a way that would be hard for humans but they can also produce the picture of you know name somebody Joe Biden honoring some you know profane of comment at something\nGet real world example of this there have already been creations of speeches that ah Brock Obama never gave or there's other ones where you can lay are real and\nFake imagery together where for example it can be your facial expressions but you're controlling an online image of everything from an example Arnold Schwarzenegger\nTo uh George W.

D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see off to set you look out the window you see space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had to kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors and for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know it was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to ah to give that sense then\nThen the audience is going to feel at the actors are gonna be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be real shaking will be real even some of the terrible the real the novelty rail and by extension the the the audience will really feel that\nKind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors in for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to ah to give that sense then\nThen the audience is gonna feel at the actors are gonna be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be real shaking will be real even some of the terror will be real the knowledge that will be real and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight so Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that\nLooks real answer that he's really experiencing all of the uh ... Haitian and just physical jostling of all of this\nYes you know we didn't literally a spin rind in\nThe capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to a Neal and and Dave Scott you know uh [laughter] but we a ride and I both wanted to try to make it as physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody throw lap and question [laughter] not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because he started to uh apparently started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone

arrest and ah you know have you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to Ryan that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting ...\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is the noise I mean you're hearing alarms go off you hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quite at all inside the space caps on a recent lessons and\nSaid can you talk a little bit about the sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about\nYeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was put in space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space I'm\nIn juxtaposition with or just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know this is a hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of ah making its way up there so something like a\nLike the spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we wanted to kind of a try to hit an emotional reality for that are in the sense that we sort of would augment the sounds you would actually here with with you know sounds

sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually remind audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks a little groans and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire just whenever possible remind them that this is\nThis is a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something that are just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight massive puts together\nA press state meant about the deaths of the men on a flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\n... um and so you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space hoping that land on the moon but if they don't just in case they download masses preparing you know basically a eulogy a press release eulogy um did get that actually happened\nYeah I mean you can find the uh you know you can search it on line in a van of moon disaster um and ah what sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy a and so the sheet of paper you see a you see a a\nOf the men on the flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\nMhm um and so you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space hoping that land on the moon but if they don't that's I guess they download masses preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release your edgy um didn't get that actually happened\nYeah yeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know you can search it on line in a van of moon disaster um and ah what sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy a and so the sheet of paper you see a you see a\nGear and Heinz who plays ... movie holding his is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh the actual sort of format in and paper um [noise] uh that you can uh again that you can find on line and and the wording as is word for word um and it's a really I mean it's it's a\nI actually really love that that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given\nBut in a wading caps elites in such a poetic beautiful way the willingness to sacrifice and and this kind of reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speech that says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the at the moon will know that there is some part of another world that is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what they intend to that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time this incredible kind of hope and this sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what these sort of a risky costly brave ventures a could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI was wondering if the astronaut Neil if Neil Armstrong knew that NASA was riding his obituary just in case\nYou know I I um I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues was just how\nReading that knowing what the intend to vet speech was but

conversation that's unique to test pilots are astronauts you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations that they sometimes a half to ... or any sort of service for country often involves you know at least that risk and it's it's something I think it's helpful to to remind people up\nI guess just ... he directed the new film first man and

almost like they're embarrassed at the achievement coming from America I think it's a terrible thing\nBecause when you think of Neil Armstrong when you think about the landing on the moon you think about the American flags and I understand they don't do it for that reason I wouldn't even want to watch the movie\nAnd then he's asked you think other people should go see the movie and Trump says that's up to them it really is that's up to them I don't want to get into the world of boycotts and then he goes on to talk about Colin Kaepernick and Nike\nOr the controversy about the flag material in the movie you know I think it was\nA pretty much exclusively among the people who hadn't seen the film and I have to say I understand very much the emotions of something like that or get aroused I think uh obviously the moon landing was an American achievement\nAnd an incredible one and the flag on the moon was a very important part of that which is why we we show it and we show it several times so to flex standing there on the moon on the lunar surface in terms of actually uh you know mapping out each beat of the mission and mapping out you know in showing\nThe you know the the physical sticking of the brought into the into the lunar soil and propping up at the flag\nA we made a choice entirely instead of choice not a political one to focus on\nAnd seeing the film and I have to say I understand very much the emotions that something like that a kid arouse think eh obviously the moon landing was an American achievement\nAnd an incredible one and the flag on the moon was a

choice not a political one to focus on\nMeals private moments on the moon ah during that time you know the the movies about the ten years leading up to the lunar landing um and so we only spent about eight minutes on the litter surface we really wanted to\nUh spend that time to look at things that people didn't see things people didn't know about so what himself would be seeing as he first kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras even gone down and then after his famous line or his an sort of plan to walk off to the little west greater during which point he is spent time alone\nAway from any cameras a and so that's a part of the moon walk that no one really knows about I didn't know about before researching this\nUm those are the things I think there were really important to us in terms of uh in terms of process of what we show 'em but certainly showcase you not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was a product of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers\nThat was something that was incredibly important for us to show and that I think we we we do show and do justice to throughout the movie\nAnd I

[noise]\nUh this is music he plays on the way to the moon or things would you refer and yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah okay so it's\nIt's a ... piece called lunar Rhapsody yup and what I find really interesting about this is that you know this comes under the category about of of a genre that's been described as exotic uh but you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way\nWith all due respect to Neil Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices Sarah man is incredibly like Florida piano\nIf it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty ... and having that kind of transcendent experience of like being on your plate of the moon and plane was like really corny [laughter]\nCorny version of what you know lunar might be it just strikes me as so it just so strange I I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you play music so how did it strike you\nKnow I was a I was fascinated by you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually within the Ryan himself it stumbled on a humans mentioned in Japan since book Neal liked was track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track is\nIt just strikes me as sell it just so strange I I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you play music so how did it strike you\nI was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I serve learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually in the rye and himself it stumbled on a you mentioned in Japan since book that Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a\nSo Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracts of music that uh that Neal and some of the other astronaut play during the course of their mission they played a piece from by divorce shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter tune or was something that was actually a ... a listens to together that they loved together when they were young and in love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nOr in space and as I learned someone who was you know or who was a having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kind of unexpectedly play distracted really no one\nListening knowing and Mitch control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know time

talking about which is called women or Rhapsody [noise]\n\nDo except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of I urge to the
