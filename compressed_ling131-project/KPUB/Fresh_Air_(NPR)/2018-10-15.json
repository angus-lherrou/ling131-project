air it is a pleasure to have you on our show so you started in comedy about eight years ago ten years they're near oh okay okay I Know what was the gender or race atmosphere in comedy clubs like for you then\nI think it's the same as it is now it's a lot of straight white guys some women and some people color few queer people you know it's a very white straight male dominated industry and um\n[noise] that can be\nExhausting I think is probably the most polite way to put it there is just the way that it seems like a lot of the white straight guys want comedy to be done and um if you don't do it that way if you don't do sort of hanging out that you do I think you can feel\nSort of lonely in a way that I Would say almost none of the other things I Do writing acting to to queens that that stuff doesn't feel lonely but a lot of time stand up those incredibly lonely for me\nYou know you're right that male comics talk all the time about their body functions and their manned parts but of women do it it's considered gross so what kind of reactions did you get when you were starting in comedy when you started to talk about a body issues and things like ... and a lot of you know men in the audience\nYou can feel sort of lonely in a way that I Would say almost none of the other things I Do writing acting to to queens that that stuff doesn't feel lonely but a lot of time stand up those incredibly lonely for me\nYou know you're right that male comics talk all the time about their body functions and their manned parts but of women do it it's considered gross so what kind of reactions did you get when you were starting in comedy when you started to talk about a body issues and things like ... and a lot of you know men and the audience [noise]\nThough was kind of like a a crummy student there I think I did learn a lot like it did work study there so I think from like a young age like fourteen Fifteen I always like was learning you have to earn your keep you have to like work hard to be able to be in a place that you're you're in\n[noise] so when you weigh the discomfort of being like the only black girl and you're graduating class with the fact that you probably did get a really good education ... um how does the balance come out [noise]\nI think and I think it was worth it I Will say it would have been nice if there was\nAnother black girl\nMy great I think there was a one black girl in my class and there was one Indian girl and one Asian girl and I'm sure will be you know not to be like it's nice to have like a matching set but it would it be nice if we can if each like you know\nAnd you're graduating class with the fact that you probably did get a really good education ... um how does the balance come out\n[noise] I think you know and I think it was worth it I Will say it would have been nice if there was\nAnother black girl\nAnd my great I think there was like one black girl in my class and there was one Indian girl and\nOne Asian girl and I'm sure will be you know and not to be like\nIt's nice to have like a matching sad but it would've been nice if we could have each like you\nKnow looked across you know during mass and saw someone else who look like us [noise]\nWhenever we talk about like representation like diversity I don't think sometimes people fully understand\nHow hard it is to not see yourself especially if you're living in society or culture where you are so reflected at every possible turn I think it's hard to like um\nImagine what it's like to not have that and so you know I I Do think that like if there was like a to do queens that would've been\nA game changer for me to just like here to black women like young black woman oh well I'm thirty four but I'm like\nHey young black women [laughter] but you know to hear to like young black women talking about oh this one\nTime I got my hair done at the salon and they did this to my hair and like totally like messed it up I couldn't talk about by black hair woes and high school with like Laura\nShe doesn't know she's a she's just wakes up and she has to be\nLike straight here like she didn't have to go through like what I had to go through and so I think in the end it worked out okay but I did have to do a lot of work on myself I did have to kind of like be OK with being outnumbered\nTo hear to like young black women talking about\nOh this one time I got my hair done at the salon and they did this to my hair and like totally like messed it up I couldn't talk about by black hair woes\nAnd high school with like Laura she doesn't know she doesn't she just wakes up and she has to be flawless like straight here like she didn't have to go through like what I had to go through and so\nI think in the end it worked out okay but I did have to do a lot of work on myself I did have to kind of like be OK\nWith being out numbered in a way and not letting that makes me so sad and then also I think I was very lucky to be a child in the nineties with like ... or\nYou know Martin Family Matters and girlfriends and all these sort of shows where you can still see you know like Tracy Ellis Ross or I could still see like queen ... and be like oh okay cool so I can kinda see what I could be like if I was you know an older black woman [noise] you're right about\nBody image in your book and you say yeah since you were fourteen your brain has been consumed with all the way as your body is like not good enough meaning not attractive to straight dudes and for failing to meet fashion industry standards and say even in age thirty four with a deeper understanding of how we've been conditioned to have unhealthy relationships with our bodies\nYou're still kind of fixated on it so how have you tried to overcome that 'cause it sounds like you're like intellectual knowledge of how women have been a expected to conform to certain bodies standards ... is at a different place\nThan you're just kind of visceral like I gained too much weight kind of feelings\nI think that everyone has that sort of battle inside themselves about something whether it's body or you know I'm a writer with no other an analogies great moving on [laughter]\nOn it so how have you tried to overcome that 'cause it sounds like you're like intellectual knowledge of how women have been a expected to conform to certain bodies standards ... is at a different place\nThan you are just kind of visceral like I gained too much weight kind of feelings\nI think that everyone has that sort of battle inside themselves about something whether it's body or you know I'm a writer was no other an analogies great moving on [laughter] but you know what I mean there's always that that thing that it's like that you know you mentally you know better but\nConditioning still makes that self dot com and so I think what I\nHave done is I have chosen to refocus that energy like I'm getting back into exercising but not like I don't have a skill in the house is not about a number if you're just going like I Need to make sure I'm strong enough to get through the day rather than\nI I Want to make sure I look in these pair of jeans\nI feel more powerful the little bit of experiences that have gotten with like styling and doing like these photo shoots and again these are champagne problems I just went up ...

this guy and then he just as like\nGives his verbal approval or whatever about me and\nIs like your your amazing and then that would make me realize I'm amazing and then we have this happy life together\nAnd so that was one of the biggest lessons was like not looking for this great relationship to sort of define me or make me realize that I'm lovable\nI just had to sort of figure that out for myself and be OK\nIf I don't date someone for two years or two and a half years or five years and if I had been like found my soul mate on my partner by then does that mean that I'm a terrible
