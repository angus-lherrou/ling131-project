adaptation of Nick ... novel Juliet, Naked which is currently in theaters\nHer new film private life opens in theaters and start streaming Netflix this Friday\nLet's start with a scene Catherine hon plays Rachel a writer married to Richard a theater director played by Paul Giamatti who makes a living with his gourmet pickled business they live on a limited budget in the East Village in Manhattan\nThe fertility treatments have already taken a lot out of them when the fertility doctor tells Rachel that her best bet is finding an egg donor that is not something she wants to do\nShe lets Richard no it as they walked down the street after leaving the fertility clinic\nNo way in hell on doing\nWhat we should think about it [noise]\nI'm not saying that we would do it\nFor a week of

the line at\nScience fiction it's not science fiction writer it's pretty primitive actually they do it with farm animals all the time\nOkay that example I'm Sorry oh my God you're like so long haul

that process is just so so different yeah\nIt it's pretty alienating in the body department I mean and then of course it's even taken to a new level when\nInstead of having your husband insemination you're you're lying in a you know kind of a stir ups and having a you know endocrinologist between your legs are with some strange catheter device saying okay let's get pregnant\nAnd uh it's not your husband it's the doctor [laughter] that's pretty strange too\nAnd you shoot those scenes in Mr ups [laughter] and the fertility\nClinic from the point of view Catherine ... so you're seeing the doctor you're seeing her legs on the steps through her point of view of the river views so many women have had so many times [laughter] [noise]\nUm yeah and um I actually have um the doctors don't come off very well on your movie was that your parents\nI actually had great doctors it's a very\nJob um I Love Dennis O'Hara who played Dr ... and uh he it's a weird job because there's a salesmanship I mean first of all you know it's not an end\nSo here who played Dr ... and uh he it's a weird job because there's a salesmanship I mean first of all you know it's not an indictment about fertility industry um because the fertility industry makes amazing things occur but it's not an easy fix\nWell that leads to another scene that I Want to play the Catherine ... character is a writer\nAnd she has a new book that's about to be published a novel that's called women's studies and her her agent calls her and said have you seen the cover\nAnd Catherine hon says no no no and so she runs to her email to open the PDF of the cover and she looks at the cover and she's horrified because the covers of you know Kevin has a feminist and the character and and in the novel\nA on the cover there's a woman and it's like white flowing dress in a field of like purple and green and\nIt's so quote feminine and like old fashioned feminine and so she's mortified and so here's the conversation she has with her husband afterwards or who's played by Paul Giamatti I should mention that as their talking she's finishing brushing her teeth\nAs ... for what\nThey call is sending its ideology ally that I'd have a

my guess timer Jenkins new movie which is called private life\nSo did you have this kind of conversation in your head [laughter] when you were trying to conceive in your early forties and wondering if it was just too late if you'd waited too long did you play both parts here in your own mind\nYeah you mean blaming myself yeah were you like the ... and Katherine my [laughter] and get her ... in your head having that argument with yourself yeah I think I was I think that that's fair a kind of um\nYou know how did I end up here I mean her blaming second wave feminism for her I mean it's such a demented thing to do but then I sort of understand what she said I remember my producer was\n... for her I mean it's such a\nDemand and thing to do but then I sort of understand what she said I remember my producer was trying to follow the the logic of the writing and she was like well I'm she's sort of a leaps to that and I said you know it's buttering this isn't like a rational this is a kind of\nUpsets buttering person then this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why she feels betrayed by some notion of like a\nYou know be independent and you don't need you know pursue your career and it's not like glorious time ever said that exactly you know she really can't be blamed but I Know what Catherine's character is talking about some sense of\nLike a license to pursue your\nOr to pursue the other part of your life not the wife part not the mother part but the other part and then suddenly\nShe feels like the rug has been pulled out from under her and this thing that she um delayed is now possibly not available to her I think for a lot of\nWomen when you're trying to reach a certain point in your career there never seems to be a great time to take time away from that\nTo you know get pregnant and and raise a child and take some time either a little are a lot of away from the work that you're pursuing from the career you're trying to establish\nWe really afraid you'd waited too long and that you know work had gotten in a way of of\nI mean it's also it's work and it's probably my own hesitation about taking that plunge and what it means and sort of maybe as you were getting at in our last interview ten years ago my own weird family\nPlunge and what it means and sort of maybe as you were getting at in our last interview ten years ago my own weird family also played an impact which isn't really you know that marriage and\nHaving babies didn't look so good from my childhood point of view [laughter] so maybe I wasn't rushing to do it anyway um but that combined with the\nYou know pursuing a career in being a writer I was a performance artist and then I I was an actor I was performance artist I was making theater I was you know then I decided that to go to graduate school and film and then trying to make films and it was all very\nConsuming and not conducive to

in films and in two thousand seven when we spoke after the savages and you were forty and talked about how you are trying at that point to have children with your husband you said so you know I guess I'll be an older\nAnd you are forty and talked about how you are trying at that point to have children with your husband\nYou said so you know I guess I'll be an older parent because you are already forty your father was Twenty years older than your mother so he was an older parent and he raised you part of the time as a single parent not a very good one maybe but [laughter]\nUm what was the experience for you like having a parent who is older than most of the other parents\n[noise] yeah I mean he was also an [noise] he was released their hair here yeah yeah he was from another time it was like having a Damon Runyon character is your dad I mean he was um he was old fashioned anyway\nUm and it but it was really different I remember people saying oh I remember being with my dad at a grocery store in Los Angeles and I think somebody said something about\nOh you know well you know oh honey you know well did you just give that to your grandfather and I started to correct the person uh I think it was you know a cashier and I said oh that's not my grandfather and I feel like my dad sort of shut me up\nLike he didn't want to get into it and I and and then it was sort of ... I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but and maybe the idea of having a mom that was Twenty years younger than your dad I don't know but yeah he he also felt like he was out of time he was sort of\nYou know he was a bubble and we lived in Los Angeles and everybody seems sort of modern and in the seventies and she just seemed like I said like smoking is Paul malls and his sued and and had a compulsive gambling he was really like a character so you made\nFeature films two of them are about being a daughter and her new one is about becoming a parent uh your first one slums in Beverly Hills is when you live with your father and he moved you and your brother\nIs about becoming a parent uh your first one slums in Beverly Hills is on\nYou live with your father and he moved you and your brother to Beverly Hills\nAnd he was broke basically [laughter] but he wanted you to go to good schools so we'd find like the cheapest places he could possibly find in Beverly Hills for you to stay so you'd have a good ZIP Code and can go to a good school there\nAnd it was just like a weird weird existence your second film the savages is based on what happened when your father had dementia and you had to move him to um a a a nursing home\nAnd he was not as usual he was not appreciative of what you were doing um\nIn part because of the dementia in part because he's just not\nYou didn't depict him as the appreciative type\n'em right and there isn't a strange men need between you know between the character and a father and also between the character and her brother so unusual coming together and of course the new movie is about you know a woman in her forties trying to to have a child through whatever means necessary [noise]\nUm and so no matter which way you kind of turn the camera what you've been looking at in your movies is um\nIs family and you know\nThe complications of having one and wanting to have one\nAnd I'm Wondering if you think having such a complicated childhood yourself because of living several years with your father and not being well parent and during that time has majors so focused you know on the idea of family\nYeah I mean I I must be I mean it's hard to know exactly what goes in to it but I guess I Am I mean our family was super fractured and there were multiple ... you know there was actually for\nExactly what goes in to it but I guess I Am I mean our family was super fractured and there were multiple said you know there was actually four children and\nUm we you know didn't live with her mother lived with her father than we lived with her mother a little bit then we moved to Cambridge and my big brother became my legal guardian he adopted us I mean we were pretty we we did a lot [laughter] what what is your mother arrangements\nUm when I was a teenager or at that point I had ... I was living with my dad for ten years and my dad\nUm ... we moved away from living with my dad plus he was old PS but anyway and I had a little brother and we moved to live with my mother and that was very unstable and kind of crazy and then my oldest brother who's ten years older than me um had been\nA living abroad and he returned he was living in ... he was living in Bali actually and he returned\nTo uh go to graduate school at Harvard\nAnd he came to see me and I was living with my mother and he was concerned about me I was a teenager I was pretty depressed and\nI was working at a dry cleaners in Philadelphia and going to lower Moran high school for a second and then um he was worried about me and he said that he was moving to Cambridge to to go to school and did I Want to\nMove with him\nHe's sort of save my life how did he said it because I he paid attention well then I didn't move in with him and then my little brother we all lived in Harvard housing and they um student housing at Harvard and he sort of ... became our parent\nHe paid attention to us like we had very narcissistic parents and we know we were just no one was paying attention and suddenly and it was very chaotic and crazy and then suddenly we were living with like little monks\nAnd if we know we were just no one was paying attention and suddenly and it was very chaotic and\nCrazy and then suddenly we were living with like little monks we're so happy my brother was\nYou know getting his PHD and uh and me and my little brother lived in this Harvard housing and we lived on food stamps and student loans to my brother took out and [noise] um\n... you know we our lives improved and we became much better students [laughter] school\nWhich was ironic because of course everybody from the outside thought oh they don't have any parents must be wild over there but we were the opposite we were really like monks we were so happy not to be in a chaotic place that we we weren't like the wild family we were like the we were trying to find sanity\nWhat's an example of a chaotic moment in your childhood\n... well you know the stuff in California would be my father's relationship to every landlord that we had in LA because we there was always some drama with the rent and having hostile relationships with our landlords\nBecause my dad although we didn't know why you know the landlords were nice to the kids but I mean now I'm like oh they didn't like it was because dad was probably late with the rent\n'em so there was that there was a kind of general dysfunction in any building we ever lived in\nUm um and then when we lived with my mother she was I guess she was on her second marriage and her second husband was an alcoholic and it was very chaotic and there was never food and the refrigerator but there were things like cocktail food like olives and\nThings that you would put in a ... Mary she know cherries and ah maybe some parmesan cheese but there was never food food it was very cocktail oriented and then um\n... marriage you know cherries and ah maybe some parmesan cheese but there was never food food it was very cocktail oriented and then um yeah there's a couple of examples so when you were living with your brother\nWas it was at Harvard and ... yeah it was Harvard housing it was not on the campus but I'm close to it yeah I was in between Harvard Square and Porter Square off mass of so was it helpful to you to be in an atmosphere where there were a lot of college students\nYeah it was really it was so different from our weird like LA Nineteen seventies world like living in the outskirts of Beverly Hills which is just specific and strange and\nUm and then go to you know wherever in Philadelphia which was my mom lived in the suburbs of the main line and ah yeah it was just a Cambridge itself just felt so I mean it was New England just had a very different feeling\nUm it was and there you know there was just so much focus in our house because my brother was doing so much and he was getting his you know he's taking care of two kids and getting a ... like twenty five was crazy I mean it was an amazing sacrifice and\nI'd just an amazing act of love and I mean I guess now that I'm Talking about it with you because you're so good at this you're pulling stuff out\nDr gross I'm [laughter] not that that said even in the wreckage there's this kind of makeshift family that gets put together by any means necessary and in a way all of these movies are sort of like that [noise]\nWhatever Jenkins it's great to have you back on our show thank you so much thank you timer Jenkins wrote and directed the new movie private life it opens in theaters and begin streaming Netflix this Friday she also co wrote the film adaptation of Nick ... novel Juliet, Naked which is currently in theaters\nIn theaters and begin streaming Netflix this Friday she also co wrote the film adaptation of Nick ... novel Juliet, Naked which is currently in theaters\nState Farm agent Richard Sanchez in Flagstaff insurance for home auto in life Richard Sanchez State Farm helping manage the risk of everyday life and recover from the unexpected seven seven four zero six five seven on line at Richard Sanchez dot net this\nWas Arizona Public radio cayenne AU Cape you be Ninety One point seven Flagstaff cayenne eighty Ninety One point seven page gay and AG Ninety point three Grand Canyon\nK N A cue eighty nine point three Prescott with translators K. to seven seven A.

Zuckerberg at his home at his office had numerous meetings a lot of access from a guy who was pretty careful about you know journalists getting connected to him how did you convince him to share so much time with you [noise]\nHe did it I should say reluctantly um this was a long process that started a year ago when I first approached them about the idea of this kind of story I said look I I\nWe do in the New Yorker these very long detailed profiles and I think initially Facebook's view was we do need to do this or a big powerful company um\nThis is fresh air and we're speaking with New Yorker staff writer Evan ... he has a piece in the magazine called ghost in the machine about ... and Facebook and its current controversies it's in a recent issue\nNow Facebook has done a lot of trouble these days because of data breaches it its role in elections but you're right that some form or Facebook executives are voicing doubts about the company's role for other things are exacerbating isolation outrage addictive behaviors you know give us an example\n[noise] this is a big change for Facebook traditionally it's former executives have been silent they leave the company and very often don't say much about it starting last year\nSean Parker who is Facebook's first president he's is sort of well known Silicon Valley figure um gave an interview in which he said that as he put it he's become a conscientious objector to social media you said God Knows what it's doing to our children's\nBrains and and then a few days later there was another very prominent former Facebook executive named ... who had been the head of growth and vice president of user growth which was an absolutely central position at the company for a number of years and he came out and said\nYou know in the back of our minds we all had a sense that something might be going wrong that our product the thing that we were building I'm paraphrasing here was as he put it contributing to the breakdown of social discourse the breakdown of society and he said\nThat our product the thing that we were building I'm paraphrasing here was as he put it contributing to the breakdown of social discourse the breakdown of society and he said he would never let his children use this kind of\nProduct I think because the public face of the company has been so on message about how they contribute in their minds to doing good in the world to have some very senior former executive come out and talk about what the public has come to believe which is that there are these very serious side effects\nTo the company's growth was a real wakeup call external and I think somewhat internally\nYes side effects in terms of increasing you know social tensions and in some cases violent political activity what about isolation addictive behaviors\nThere has been a growing body of research that shows a and it's been published in sort of the major scientific an academic journals that there is a correlation in some cases between heavy Facebook use and decreased sense of wellbeing a sense of connection people feel lonely\nThere is a lot that they are trying to figure out about this but it's gotten to the point where the data is Annette ... and the company has been done to acknowledge it hurt for the first time early this year\nThat Facebook said look we recognize that there are different ways that you can use this and if you're just using it passively if you're just sitting there scrolling would glazed dies hour after hour we recognize this is not good for you\nAnd so what they did is they said we're going to try to change it a bit so that people are more actively engaged so that they're you know talking to friends actively communicating with their family members and stuff like that but that was a key\nDifference from how they used to talk about it which was that if you didn't agree with the fundamental premise that Facebook was basically good than it was a kind of heresy and they wouldn't want to have the conversation they are now slowly acclimated to the idea that people just don't buy that anymore you\nTalk to ... a fair amount about this you know pushing the boundaries of privacy to grow\nDon't buy that anymore you know you talk to ... a fair amount about this you know pushing the boundaries of privacy to grow that as he regard this kind of experimentation\nWell he absorbed a central belief early on in his career and I think it's become just key to understanding why he's made choices that he hasn't in some of the mistakes that he has which is that he\nDecided early on that he was very often going to be criticized he said look this is just a fact of what we do as he said look we're not selling dog food here we're doing something in ... intensely inherently controversial it's at the intersection of psychology and technology and\nSo when people criticize Facebook for being [noise] um too casual about their privacy for allowing data or to be a uh to to get out into the world I'm\nVery often what he came to believe was that they would criticize him at the time but over time eventually they would accept that they would get used to it and they would keep signing on they would keep growing\nAnd that idea about criticism I'm\nReally hardened and became a central governing principle at Facebook the sense that they were\nLeaders they were pioneers they were forging ahead they had to push the public beyond its comfort zone when it came to being\nLess private because if they didn't do it then people wouldn't wouldn't go there but they were convinced that even in the cases of controversy when you had a civil libertarians or regulators or politicians ordinary member of the public complaining about Facebook that that was simply a sign that they were being\nBold and that idea continued really until until the present day\nYeah is it true that in two thousand ten he said privacy is no longer a social norm\nHe did and it caused a big uproar at the time or he said look this is a generational difference we don't feel\nPrivacy is no longer a social norm\nHe did and it caused a big uproar at the time or he said look this is a generational difference we don't feel the same way about privacy that our parents and grandparents did\nA and people said that's ... that's wild that's not right privacy is built into the very nature of the United states it's and it's really embedded in the bill of rights and um his belief was that it was as ... as it was often described an antique and that we needed to push people\nFurther there was in in the early days of Facebook there was a\nA ... a phrase that was bandied about called radical transparency the idea that you had to be aggressively transparent in order 'em\nTo be modern this the sense was as one person to put it um you know that in the future because of Facebook and other things like it that were exploding the boundaries of privacy that extramarital affairs would become impossible people couldn't hide things like that they could no longer hide\nTheir lives outside of work from their lives and work and they believe that to be a virtue the sense that there would be this fusion the union of our private solves in our public solves\nBut that put them at odds with the public and and the key fact I think was that over and over again Mark Zuckerberg believed\nThat being at odds with the public was not assigned you were doing something wrong it was a sign that you were doing something innovative and their their ... their motto of course became move fast and break things and that motto really captured the way that they see the world that\nAlmost like redefining what it is to be human and [noise]\nYeah they believed that this that this tool Facebook had that kind of power and and and they came to being at a time in Silicon Valley where were you had this almost messianic sense of ambition this belief that that you weren't just building computer applications you were actually building tools that were fundamentally reached\nWhere were you had this almost messianic sense of ambition this belief that that you weren't just building computer applications you were actually building tools that were fundamentally reshaping society and they embrace that wholeheartedly\n[noise] there was a recent data breach or Facebook where fifty million users information was taken by somebody how how serious a problem as this\nThis is a serious one this is the largest security breach in Facebook's history and what was unusual about this and what sets it apart from other cases like Cambridge Analytica was that this was outright fast this was a case of hackers or hacker we still don't know who it was I'm\nFinding [noise] essentially an an under protected door and walking through it and taking control of\nAt least fifty million Facebook user accounts or Facebook also I'm to be safe or took another forty million users and kick them off the force them to look back and so it may be as many as Ninety million or more that were affected by this and and in this case the hackers were able to get total control of\nThe accounts so are there they were able to get control of your privacy settings they could go into your messages they could post things on your behalf they at this point Facebook says they haven't found any evidence of these hackers\nDoing that so that only heightens the mystery they don't know why they did it they don't know if this was a foreign government or if this were individuals' if this was a criminal act\nUm but what's interesting about this particular case and why really leaps out to people who study history face what\nIs it a few years ago Facebook might not have gone public with this as fast as they did they would have they would have probably investigated it more internally but under the new rules that have been been imposed by the European Union um they were required to announce this very fast and as a result they had to talk about this\nPosed by the European Union um they were required to announce this very fast and as a result they had to talk about this breach I'm really before they know very much about it so it's it's raises many questions as its answered at this point\nWe're listening to the interview fresh air is Dave Davies recorded with Evan ... a staff writer for the New

the machine is in a recent issue of the magazine\nSo when word began to emerge about the spread with false information on Facebook or some of it by ... by Russian actors we now know about the Internet Research Agency in Russia um how did sucker bird respond to this\nInitially he rejected it he he said it just seems as he put it pretty ...\nHe said it just seems as he put it pretty crazy that the presence of fake news might've affected the outcome of the two thousand sixteen election he said that just a few days after the results were in [noise]\nSince then [noise] um [noise]\nInitially Facebook was really reluctant to embrace this idea that they played a meaningful role in the election with Mark Warner the senator from Virginia who's the ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee contacted Facebook shortly after the election and said he really wanted to talk about the role of of Russian interference\nOn Facebook and as he put it to me they were completely dismissive they they just didn't believe that they had a serious role to play here\nI'm over time they have come to understand that that simply not the case they\nInitially they estimated that about a fewer than ten million Facebook users might have been\nA might have been affected by Russian disinformation ... and they later had to revise that in preparation for testimony in Congress and they said actually as many as a maybe a hundred and fifty million\nFacebook users um were affected by Russian disinformation\nAnd what's remarkable about that is is how efficient it was actually as a as a conduit for information because the Russian Internet research agency which was reporting to the Kremlin had fewer than a hundred members of its staff on this project\nAnd yet they were able to reach a size a hundred and fifty million Facebook users that is extraordinary and it was a I I think to this day Facebook is struggling with that fundamental paradox which is that on the one hand their business and their success depends on their ability to tout\nTheir powers of persuasion they they are telling advertisers we can encourage users to listen to you to believe in you and to act on what you're telling them and yet at the same time they're trying to say that they have not\nHad this dispositive effect on our politics and that\nAnd you and to act on what you're telling them and yet at the same time they're trying to say that they have not had this dispositive effect on our politics and that is a contradiction\nRight um and then there was the Cambridge Analytica scandal in which you know it emerged that from working for the Trump campaign had acquired the personal data of what eighty seven million Facebook users that's right um so ... who was in big trouble ...\nWent before Congress carefully prep of course how did he do\nWell there was a lot riding on that appearance or you know in many ways a kind of felt like a trial here here he was on behalf of the company going in front of Congress and and it was growing calls for regulation and\nHe in some ways vastly exceeded expectations and that was because largely because Congress showed itself to be\nReally extraordinarily unprepared to deal with the complexity of Facebook they just simply didn't ask the kinds of questions that would have really gotten to the heart of Facebook's operations and how it makes choices\nSo much so that at one point or an ... senator from Utah said to Mark Zuckerberg ... if you don't charge customers then how do you make any money and\n... kind of 'em gave a little smile and said senator we run ads it was such an obvious fact anybody who's paid attention to technology that it really I think under scored the mismatch between the scale and investment and sophistication of these companies\nAnd Congress's inability to come up with the laws and the rules that can respond to them in real time\nMaybe you could just explain that a bit I mean Facebook makes a fortune by digital ads how does it work you know\nIn some ways Facebook is actually a little bit like a newspaper in the central\nI mean Facebook makes a fortune by digital ads how does it work you know\nIn some ways Facebook is actually a little bit like a newspaper in the sense that the way that it pays for itself is by running ads alongside the content that people post in and look for on there so [noise]\nOn any given moment when you go on Facebook you will find these highly targeted ads these are things that are chosen just for you based on your browsing behavior around the Internet based on the post that you clicked on the things that you look for\nUm they choose ads that you are much more likely to click on then you would if they were just sending the same out to everybody else and that formula that ability to micro target as it's known a adds to specific users has been this extraordinary geyser of\nBusiness success they they'd just stumbled on something that was\nI'm able to generate returns for companies that kept them coming back over and over again an advertising on Facebook\nAnd the company is taking steps certainly says it's taking steps to monitor the the content I'm that political players are using the platform for and that you know\nIs arguably critical as we approach the midterms it's also pretty tricky right I mean how do you distinguish spin from Faye career you know dangerous content from distasteful how's the company I'm doing this [noise]\nBecome this consuming effort or Facebook over the last year as they as a controversy has grown they've undertaken one initiative after another so when it comes to political election\nUh advertising for instance what they said was okay even though for years we argued that we shouldn't have to disclose the funding sources for political ad now we are going to not only do that but we are going to go farther than TV does we're going to\nLet users be able to click on an ad and then no not only paid for it but what other ads to those people pay for and and who were they targeting\nLet users be able to click on an ad and then no not only who paid for it but what other ads to those people pay for and and who were they targeting um they're also saying we're going to\nDo more to defend against the kind of disinformation campaigns what they call coordinated inauthentic behavior essentially\nUm misinformation it's distributed to try to shake elections not only the United states but in other countries and they've had to in in in many ways Dave it's almost like they've put gun to take on some of the qualities of a government you know they've had to hire people who actually worked in the U.S government on things like misinformation\nUm in order to try to ferret out efforts by Russian officials who are are in one case there was an Iranian campaign to try to spread misinformation but what we don't know and really won't know until after\nThe midterm elections in the U.S and and the elections that come to follow our whether or not that's that's working um and I think what's interesting is so Facebook on has become much more public these days in terms of talking about when it finds examples of disinformation will announce it will say we took down a group of\nRussian I'm In pastors who were seeking to affect American voting behavior for instance um\nBut that's either a sign that they're winning the battle or it's a sign that the battle has grown so much that they're going to continue to face this and and what I'm struck by is how much\nThe integrity and the credibility of elections now rests on the shoulders of individual employees inside a private company in California that's a very unusual situation for our democracy to the end\n'cause they can actually make distinctions about what what the public season would have doesn't\nYeah I mean they have to make very subtle choices ... take for example the you know misinformation what is the definition of misinformation when it's somebody being wrong by accident and when it's somebody being wrong on purpose when are they trying to deceive large numbers public ...\nTo make very subtle choices or take for example the you know misinformation what is the definition of misinformation when it's somebody being wrong by accident and when it's somebody being wrong on purpose when are they trying to deceive large numbers of
