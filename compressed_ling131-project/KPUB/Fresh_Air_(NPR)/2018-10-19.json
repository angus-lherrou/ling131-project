David Barstow congratulations on this extraordinary piece of reporting and welcome to fresh air it's such a pleasure to have you here give us a sense of Fred from Donald Trump's father's real estate empire when it was at its peak for\nWas a remarkable builder and in New York's history was\nState empire when it was at its peak\nFred Trump was a remarkable builder and in New York's history he was the guy who had built and sold his first home before he reach the age of twenty by the time he was in his mid thirties he was building hundreds of\nHomes here by the time he was in his mid forties he was really one of the biggest developers actually in the country and what he specialized in\nWas building middle class housing um his homes which he built in his apartment buildings which he built and\nAlmost entirely in Brooklyn and queens we're kind of these no frills\nTelling of his story the famous line that he's always said is that you started with a million dollar loan from his father\nHad to pay back with interest and then he parlay that million dollar loan into ten billion dollar empire that remained\nFor the most part the dominant narrative that she sold certainly you know to make themselves a celebrity and to gain a power and ultimately it's what he campaigned on very heavily\nTo win win the presidency and so this story really by sex that narrative and I think more than anything else offers readers now based on the actual facts um and based on actual documents an entirely new financial narrative the forty for president\nWell let me reintroduce you'd hear if you're just joining us my guess is Suzanne ... and David ... of the New York times who wrote a remarkable investigative piece on our President Trump's inherited money from his father the loans you got from his father the tax evasion schemes the family had\nAnd that was published a couple of weeks ago you can find it on line we're going to talk more about how Donald Trump engaged\nIn suspect tax

two of the three writers who reported just a couple of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches\nFrom his father and deconstruct the whole Donald Trump myth about how as a self\nMade millionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money Fred Trump Donald's father\nFunnel to him and his other siblings and how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax games we talked about um ... made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that you got a million dollar loan from his father and help parlay that antennas\nInto his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws\n[noise] ah we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans the one million I'm In today's dollars of course it's two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in direct welfare we saw\nTransferred to do what we what we also saw ... what is important also it was the images is um these were loans that were never repaired human who would take her out\nI think it's important also is that in many cases um these were loans that were never repaid him and he would take out [noise]\nUm we were looking at one particular year was like every month\nHe's going back to that and he's barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks and then a million dollars it was just like a monthly run to to Fred Trump to get more money and we saw especially that the flow of loans increase\nAs Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream that went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then off being off to the races\nThese were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father\nYeah he used the money for\nMany of his adventures he had Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support that it was used to support\nHis ventures in Atlantic City\nAnd elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars in debt and this is the time he not only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars\nUm he was in debt to his father was going to get his father these very crucial times\nFor more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and end up in debt and a lot of instances instead of making a fortune ...\nCould also see that when he fell you know when he would fall down the safety net\nIn a lot of instances instead of making a fortune ... it\nAlso see that when he so you know when he would fall down the safety net was there for Trump safety was there to catch them\nOne spooked just almost unbelievable moment in the store and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this is a time\nAnd the you know the backend of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of his companies are either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos that they're facing a debt payment\nAnd Fred Trump has a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino chips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money history and in a million dollars worth of it was ... and a half million dollars worth of casino trips\nAnd at this period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see\nAnd Donald Trump at this period has a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's will centrally and knew well and it was caught a soldier the wheel is taken to Fred Trump's house in December of Nineteen Ninety\nInfrared Trump immediately sees this caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire and potentially put at risk\nAnd Fred Trump immediately says no he freaks out and he makes a call to his daughter who is a federal judge in a lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months is drafted that removes Donnell is the sole executor for Trump's well inputs Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new well is dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life\nAfter all his father has done for him that he makes this move and it's a credit\nOften but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life after all his father has done for him but he makes this move to incredibly dramatic move and scoring to the family and what he did\nSo what you're saying I think is that at the end of ... life or toward the end of ... life\nDonald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump bail himself out and Fred Trump Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had helped with so much money over so many years\nWhat we know for sure is that Fred Trump perceived to this as an attempt by his um to gain complete control over his estate and potentially to use\nThe the the umpire for Trump doggedly and patiently built over many decades to use that empire as I'm potentially as collateral to help bail Donald Trump out of his own financial difficulties\nAnd I guess or New York times reporters David

David Barstow who along with Russ Buettner published a long investigative article this month but have Fred Trump use schemes to avoid paying taxes or transferring money from his real estate empire to Donald Trump\nMeasured in today's dollars Donald received about four hundred Thirteen million\nTaxes or transferring money from his real estate empire to Donald Trump measured in today's dollars Donald received about four hundred Thirteen million\nSo then after ... died Donald Trump took the lead and decided they should sell off everything that Fred Trump still own at the time of his death why to Donald Trump make that decision [noise]\nSo the interesting thing about that sale and it's something that we noticed again and again when we were doing our reporting was that\nFor a Trump very much wanted this empire to stay in the family um he had kept it together um through his whole life and he had hoped that after his death they would keep it and I I think what we can never really get into Donald Trump's mind as to why\nHe sold it in in two thousand and three there was a family meeting and they had regular family meeting softer for Trump died they would hand out checks you know for Trump's buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months um to get an update on the status of the empire and to get a check\nAnd then in two thousand and three at one of these meetings Donald Trump announced that it was time to sell and quickly assembled a private sale to a developer in New York for almost all of it and it was sold you know give or take a few buildings in one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSo so that the the uh buildings that were sold all of those buildings ... own at this time of his death I Hope that it also include all the buildings that had been transferred from Fred Trump to the children\nThey included both of buildings that had been transferred down to one city owned it was it was pretty much ISIL empire and it's sold 'em you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to New York developer and ... and the price tag was just over seven hundred million dollars and what's ...\nIt's sold in two thousand four were to a New York develop her name or be shown in the price tag was just over seven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learned through the ... the documents that we went through that that sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars than what the banks would value it out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that dot empire um was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much less\nSo it wasn't like the ... century that ... it definitely wasn't so the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRS\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely got away with that so it's true that the IRS actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe describe in the story and in fact the IRS ours did push back some and especially on\nThe lower valuations they're placed on buildings and made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning from a few million more bucks on that return but the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got\nAn agency that is pretty over matched\nOverworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families who are the most expensive legal and accounting helping who engage in these very sophisticated maneuvers to avoid or evade taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars\nManeuvers to to avoid or evade taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an honor their looking though at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more\nMeanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of\nSimply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at gift in a state tax returns\n[noise] um so then I'm going to ask you to choose either the art video the art or the comeback or The Apprentice and tell us all is actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books are the shell based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals\nOn public\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David or another comeback [laughter] go for it [noise]\nAh well so he publishes the art of the come back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of his sort of\nYou know pulling himself up I'm Out of the mock of his casino collapse\nAnd through his grit and determination and Wylie negotiating skills getting himself back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication of this book\nSo happens to coincide with the time when you actually took possession of one quarter of his father's real estate empire through one of these very elaborate\nTax schemes that we describe in the story so at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map it actually coincides perfectly\nThis moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map it actually coincides perfectly when the moment when he was just taken possession of twenty five percent\nOf this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way not a word of that made its way into the book the art of a comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice and the song money money money might\nNot happen in two thousand and four I'm right is the sale had gone through the the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Fred Trump and yet when you watch not opening scene\nIt's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane is there that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene from Trump built and paid for\n[noise] I'm Wondering how you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the mess of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making abilities\nAnd so many people still believe the math and Donald Trump is still putting forward in that\nInteresting when I think about that I think you have to sort of I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked\nAnd I think that we've ... I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first step in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's\nWealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think that the power of the story is you know I think the\nUm are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think the the power of the story is\nYou know I think the whole careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents up I think it's really hard to refute the story um it's harder for you because it's absolutely true and the documents are there and in a lot of them are the source documents with the Trump family themselves\nUm but I think it will take time for this to sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um but I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times those basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on\nThis story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access into were locked up in this room I'm ... who cleaned it who is allowed\nTo go you know [laughter] we uh we did not have a cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come into one day with a with a little vacuum and and [laughter] I thought it was great but we uh yeah it was just\nThe three of us for a year um with a yeah it's a pretty messy but go right but ...\nAnd it'll cost her father too I Would imagine [laughter] and other people know why you were locked up in this room [noise] um I think\nPeople knew our our editors new but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery mystery surrounding it we are kind of kept to ourselves and uh yeah it was it was difficult everybody you know the people keep asking you what you're up to and [noise] um but we uh we tried to keep a lid on it as best we could\nTime here unless you're south ... him where those northern ... kind of warm up fifty five for Flagstaff today page sixty four\nPrescott Seventy shallow sixty two and Kingman Seventy six over the coming weekend scattered showers and thunderstorms each day with Sunday looking to be the most active\nThis is Arizona Public radio K N A UK pie you'll be Ninety One point seven flying staff cayenne eighty Ninety One point seven page cayenne age eight Ninety point three Grand Canyon and\nK innate you eighty nine point three Prescott with translators K. to seven seven A.

changed when he was using that\nHe he became unrecognizable or he went from being\nYou know just one of the most sort of light filled extraordinary people that I knew and he became\nLike I don't have the right now it's terrifying\nAbsolutely terrifying I'm Mary Louise Kelly healthcare in Arizona's midterms this afternoon on all things considered from an area [noise]\nThis is fresh air let's get back to tear each interview with David shift and his son Nick chef they both written memoirs about coping with mixed addiction to methamphetamines memoirs which are the basis of the new film beautiful boy starring Steve Carell\n[noise] I I think one of the things that you both had trouble with\nIn the rehab programs was the quote God talk you know in the ... anonymous model\nYou look toward a higher power to give you strains and there's a saying that goes let go and let God David you describe in your memoir how ... year you were or are still are in an atheist and raised in it without religion um did\nI too I too felt guilty that you asked me about what I felt guilty for I felt guilty for that too when we heard from some people that the only way to get sober and stay sober is to embrace that and they try to broaden it by saying you know God can be what's\nTo embrace that and they try to broaden it by saying you know God can be whatever you conceive him to be it's a higher power and things like that it was an neck would say that it was just an excuse\nTo resist but I think ultimately\nI learned and I think he learned that you could not deny some of those basic principles including the first one which is you know\nNick didn't agree for a long time of his ... that he that he was powerless over his addiction he thought he was in control he had to nearly died more than once before he finally I think accepted that and once you accept that I think you're in the door\nUm but I just I I think that that God thing you know in ... step programs and in recovery I think ... is a huge problem because I Try I spent a lotta time you know trying so hard to practice prayer and doing all this stuff to make myself you know come to believe\nAnd ultimately you know when I sit with myself and the quiet moments you know when I'm Alone\nYou know I don't believe you know I think that for people who are\nJust fundamentally you know don't believe in God or any you know reason to this world or anything I think that they are at at a disadvantage in terms of getting help through these these kind of programs absolutely\nBut the trip but but the other thing that I think is really important to that we learned is that there isn't just one way there isn't just one way to get healthy and sober and to stop using the first thing that Nick told me about when he arrived at this last program which he sat with a um\nCounselor and the counselor said to him you know why are you here and by then he was a you know he was a perfect student of of of rehab and so he said what you mean about the expected him to say which is I'm here because I'm a drug addict and an alcoholic\nAnd the guy said well wait let's let's go now why are you a drug addict and alcoholic you know why are you trying to kill yourself that's without ...\nBecause I'm a drug addict and alcoholic and the guy said\nWait let's let's go now why are you a drug addict and alcoholic you know why are you trying to kill yourself that's what that we had was all about it was about trying to figure out what was going on inside and that's what are you ... you know it's different for everybody but for neck I think that that I mean you know that's what he says that that that those three months were essential\nTo did that program that you not rely on the higher power principle\nIt didn't rely on it completely no I mean they there was definitely that was there and and that was a part of that but um\nThere was a lot of like experimental therapies and stuff that they did there and you know I sort of got to really go back and it's where every experience some of the traumas that I experience growing up and I'm sort of relive them and and grieve them enough for the first time really ... allow myself to grieve them\nAnd to come to understand who I Am an end to learn you know tried as it sounds or whatever to to learn how to how to love myself and you know today like I I mean I don't want to kill myself you know I I don't at all now I live my life and stuff and yeah it doesn't have anything to do\nWith a higher power for me but uh for a time people it does I'm certainly not you know dissing anybody that feels that way absolutely\nGive it did you find you know something that you could describe as a higher power\n[noise] I I learned to define it in in a way that worked for me which is um it's something about our humanity I Would when I went to ... I was told by someone before this is over you believe in God that didn't that transformation didn't happen to me but I Do believe in\nPrayer it is a way it was a way that I got through I never planned to pray I never said I'm going to pray I'm going to do what they told me but all of a sudden there were moments where I found myself praying and it was a way to get through ... what\nDoes family mean to you if you don't believe in God [noise]\nMoments where I found myself praying and it was a way to get through\n... what does family mean to you if you don't believe in God\n\nYou know it's it's a it's a really good question and I don't even know the answer I guess it was it was it was a it was a reflection of how desperate I was that unconsciously without saying I'm going to ... I was saying please please please save Mac please help heal my son I remember that's what I found it to myself over and over and over again [noise]\nUh and it was way be that way just to stay sane its effect focused on something that you know I could hold onto or maybe I was you know hedging my bats maybe I was praying in a way you know in case someone out there was listening\nNikki nicotine that there's um what part of what saved you from your math addiction was a degree of self knowledge\nThey were helped to acquire in your last rehab mhm and that I think was do we have in which you were diagnosed with having bipolar disorder which is basically manic depression um did that help getting a diagnosis and then getting the medication to deal with a diagnosis\nYes I mean that's you know it's a ... I think it's like\nVery very subtle and you know I Am on two different medications and one of them is a bipolar\nMedication and it's you know it's so subtle I mean I couldn't even tell you necessarily\nYou know what the differences are or how it's helping me but I I think that ... that they it's definitely you know one little piece of the puzzle in terms of learning how to be able to live with yourself you know a little bit more and yeah so I think that if you need it you know if you get a really good doctor that knows what they're doing you know they can help you I think that's awesome after the early\n... Nick tells a story in his book that to me is so profound and it's done in just a beautiful way I think um he came to see us I'm Karen like my wife and Jasper and daisy or we were in this we hadn't seen that for a long time and and Karen said you know let's\nI'm Karen my my wife and Jasper and daisy or we were in this we hadn't seen that for a long time in in ... and said you know let's let's invite neck to join us we were going on a family vacation and and it came over to the U.S\nAnd we were hanging out we had a really good time it was you know we talked a lot and it was very open and he talked to the kids about what had been going on and it was you know sort of the apologize to them in a way that's I think it was just so meaningful to them into caring and to me and we had a really good time and then he describes the day before he was leaving he got\nJust really annoyed [laughter] and you talked about you know he's ready to kill me and all of a sudden it hit him that\nTomorrow I'm leaving oh and that's what's going on here I'm studying my I I don't really want to leave part of me wants to stay here\nAnd be a child again it'd be you know with my family and\nSo I'm sort of ... and ... and then all of a sudden he said that he felt he said that I ... I feel better now and and he went back in the rest of the trip was was great and we had a really nice last day but then he said\nWhat just happened he says another time in my life that moment would have just been the beginning of a descent and it would have been the kind of dissent that rid of ended up and they're going out to have a drink or to get some pot and then\nSome math and he said how could it be the fact that I'm On this new medication and I just thought it was such a beautiful description of the way that it all works together\nWell listen congratulations to both of you on on on the books in on the ... can you know you good luck with um you know continuing eating anything I I you know I Wish you wish you well thank you both so much thank you\nThanks Terry\nChefs memoir about

checking accounts that can be open from anywhere\nEvery time I had to do whatever I could to get into treatment and when they called up begging me to go back telling me that he was going to die so many times I had succumbed I mean all I wanted to do with never mind to to to get him help but I just wanted to see him to see that he was alive\nBut I finally listened to the messages of these rehab programs that talk about this tough love thing and that he had to hit bottom and I hung up the phone and I kept\nThose artist thing I'd ever done and he did call you know just a few days later and said he was ready to go into treatment but he absolutely could have died\nIn that story he basically had two options and I can think of one is to say well if I'm not driving you rehab I'm picking up at all and the other is okay I'll take it home you chose the if I'm not driving you to rehab I'm not taking home it alone you think you're lucky that he didn't die as a result and then he chose to go to we had a few days later\nYou chose the if I'm not driving you to rehab I'm not taking home it alone you think you're lucky that he didn't die as a result and then he chose to go to rehab a few days later it doesn't register that do you think you'd have ... you should have chosen the other option is which it would have been I'll take it home and maybe you wouldn't have gone to me\nI think that every situation is different in retrospect it was fine in retrospect you know it worked but\nIf I was there again I Would have gone to them and brought him home\nAnd [noise] done everything I could to get them into treatment because every day he was out there it was so dangerous I mean that night I didn't sleep of course I was just petrified and I had a reason to because he could have gone out and scored an overdose in God\nIf I got I'm home at least it would have been off the streets and I may have been able to get him back in treatment and I would have done everything I could to get him back the way I feel now yeah you want to get your kid off the streets it's too dangerous out there\nWere listening to an interview with journalist David Sheff to re grow spoke with him in two thousand

Knicks addiction to mess has been made into a movie starring Steve corral\nIf your child under Eighteen you can um force them to go into rehab right\nMost places you can it's it's yes you can it's not easy in some states it's really complicated you have to get judges orders\nYou have to essentially commit them a police officer maybe half has to come and pronounce them a threat to themselves or someone else but still parents do have the legal right to get their kids into treatment did you ever do that\nI never had to resort to any kind of legal means of getting into treatment but still I had a lot of leverage\nYou know he was living at home he he would be desperate he would want to come home he would want help so he would call me up and he'll be willing to go to treatment so I had some leverage I never had to do a formal intervention but people do them\nThey're dangerous or one of the pieces of advice I got over and over again from professionals is that they must be done by professionals by people are trained to do interventions they know what's going on in the ...\nFor again from professionals is that they must be done by professionals by people are trained to do interventions they know what's going on and they understand the risks but um I never had to do that I was able to get into treatment other wave but\nWhatever it takes whatever it takes to get someone to treatment that's what we got to do with the family well sometimes neck would just get tired of being out there and he would be so desperate he would you know he he just wanted to get off the streets you know it wasn't necessarily even life threatening\nUm and so he was willing to go into treatment because that was my deal I'll come pick you up you know drive you a treatment center check you in and so he would do it uh but as things went forward I mean the last time that ... you know he's been sober for a long time it was after Nick and I talk to you on your show\nAnd you know one day we were together and he said I cannot believe what I did I was at someone's house just almost automatic I opened up the medicine cabinet there was a bottle of I could then I took one I thought to myself\nJust one which is common for addicts to you know that's the first thing that they'll say to themselves and to us and send the bottle was gone and he said\nI woke up this morning and realize that if I don't do something I'm going to be back on the streets within a week so he you know this was the first time I didn't have to say a word he got on the phone he called the handled and treatment center in Minnesota He was on a plane that day\nTo me it's possible to look back on that and say you know all the treatments before that were failure here he was sober for such a long time and he relapsed again but to me it's the opposite it shows that the treatments had helped him so much that he was able to recognize that\nBut to me it's the opposite it shows that the treatments have helped him so much that he was able to recognize that he was in a freefall that it was so dangerous for him he he had learned what they teach in a lot of treatment centers this behavioral cognitive thing where you can interrupt\nEither the craving that would lead to relapse or you can stop a relapse early and if you can you know you've made so much progress one of the things they talk about with addiction is progress not perfection so so when they got in that play on that day\nI saw great great progress and since then he's been sober so ah\nIt shows that it's possible I mean people think that treatment can't work a Knicks proof that it does [noise]\nSo let's talk a little bit about twelve step treatment programs you have a lot of experience with them because I think Nick had been in a ... step program\nIs probably going to you know a a twelve step program for parents Ellen on yeah yeah and then you visited them just as research for the book do you see you see you know positives and negatives with the ... step program\nSo I think most people know what the positive\nUh parts are but what are some of the problems you have to stop\nTwelve steps are completely a profound you know treatment for so many people but not most people and that's the problem that I have it's not what the twelve steps it's only many many rehabbed are based on this idea that the twelve steps are the kids are the only way to stay sober that's my problem\nSo my problem with a twelve steps is only when it's forced and it's forced in many places Nick was kicked out of this and treatment programs because he wouldn't embrace the twelve steps and and so we\nFirst in many places Nicolas kicked out of this and treatment programs because he wouldn't embraced the twelve steps\nAnd and so we have to understand that you know there are many ways to get sober and the twelve steps is one and it works for some people but there needs to be alternative\nBut I did go to Alan on meetings and what I found there was something different that helped me you know when they became addicted I didn't know other families who had kids who were addicts I\nI was ashamed and I felt that I was the only one and people tell me over and over and over again go to Ellen on meetings got Al Anon meetings I Would sort of roll my eyes and thing I'm not going into one of those rooms where\nPeople are you know whining and sitting around in a circle and I walked into one of those rooms finally and I felt you know these are my people they know what I'm going through because they're going through it too so that comfort in that support was profound for me\nAlso going into these rooms you know I I was suffering so much inside and so I Would go through my day and I would have to put on the face that everything was okay and I had to work I go to be my younger children daisy and Jasper school and and you know I had to keep it together\nI walked into these rooms and I didn't have to keep it together I was allowed to just sit in the back and feel you know whatever it was this just terror and other people were feeling as in I was able to cry and I was able to\nYou know there was no pretty tense and those rooms there was this openness it didn't make things go away but it made it easier to get through some of the day's\nLesson on a positive note [laughter] and and if it's OK ... if it's not prying into your son next privacy he sounds like he's doing really well now professionally as well as a person that just gives all update on his life is that's not prying too much\nIt's not I mean this is really you know I think he's\nAs well as person that just gives all update on his life that's that's not prying too much\nIt's it's not I mean this is really you know I think he's great country what can I say he's he's an unbelievable person I've been out of his dad and so I'm I'm I'm prejudiced but he", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "19"}
