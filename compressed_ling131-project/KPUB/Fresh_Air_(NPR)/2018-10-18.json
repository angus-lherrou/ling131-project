set in the era of the me too movement\nBow jak horsemen takes advantage of the kind of characters that you can pull off in an animated series it's a world that's a mix of people and talking animals with human characteristics bow jak is a horse who became famous as the star of the nineties sitcom course in around\nBut when season one above jak horsemen begins bow jak is washed up his celebrity has faded and\nHe spends a lot of time drinking feeling sorry for himself and watching old reruns of his sitcom horsing around admiring how great he was on the show back then let's start with a clip from the very first episode of Bo jak horsemen when Bo jak as a guest on the Charlie Rochelle\n[noise] Nineteen Ninety ... situation comedy or something around here don't ABC Show which young ... horses forced to reevaluate its priorities we agrees trees three human children was initially dismissed by critics is wrong and suffering and not good\nBut the family comedy struggled with America loan to air for nine seasons star of horses around ... or ... ...\nIt is good to be here it's early [laughter] okay Raphael Bob Blacksburg welcome to fresh air time changes how we see things doesn't it [laughter]\nYou know we were when you when you did that Charlie Rose opening you probably had no idea that he would be accused by multiple women of sexual harassment and that would lead to the loss of his job\nSo let's just start with the surprise of that for you did you think of that\nHarass men and that would lead to the loss of his job [laughter] so let's just start with the surprise of that for you did you think that opening at the headline the women step forward\nIt really dates the show doesn't it have Charlie Rose be the the voice of sober reason that you know look at bow jak who is such a mess and ... and unprofessional and Charlie Rose up played in this clip by pat and that was wild is are are straight person in the scene\nAnd uh yeah when the allegations against Charlie Rose came out I don't want to say my first thought was oh no my show\nBecause it was and it was truly oh no Charlie Rose ... and and all the women that he allegedly targeted a that's terrible but it it is interesting now to go back to that first episode and look at it and think about how times have changed\nBut because it's animated and it's like a horse as bright and colorful it just takes on a different feel and you can kind of sneak attack into sadness and some fun surprising ways\nI liked that sneak attack into sadness instead and some fun ways [laughter] far north as quick as it kind of sadness I like the final version better [laughter] and and jak\nIsn't such despair afterwards and feels so responsible he's driving any closes his eyes and nearly drives off the road but then opens his eyes just in time to save himself and I think that's a suicide attempt as opposed to him falling asleep at the wheel\nWhere I Would say it's a little lazy suicide attempt right it's a suicide attempt a plausible deniability like he's not actively\nKilling himself but he's allowing the universe to take its course you know what I mean I always felt like in a port in ... maybe minor distinction to us that he was so disappointed and despairing\nBut he was willing to do this but not so much that he was going to actively do it himself\nOne of the episodes that you have in the current season season five which you wrote is um an unusual episode because it's one long monologue ... mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really bad dementia and low jak does not feel warmly toward her so this episode is all his eulogy for her so he's at a podium at 'em like her coffins at the ...\nOnly toward her so this episode is all his eulogy for her so he's at a podium Adam ... her coffins at the side\nAnd he's not trying to paper over what their relationship with like he's talking about all these horrible things that happened in his family and how he was mistreated by his parents and how his father was mean to his mother and they were both mean to bow jak [noise]\nI I Want to play a brief part of his eulogy and less as well or not as much jak horsemen\nI used to be on the TV show called horsing around seriously though hold your applause\nWill held it was written by my friend her because as who's also dead now and it started this little girl named Sarah Lynn\nAnd it was about these ... and early on the network at a note maybe don't mentioned they're orphans so much because audiences tend to find orphans sad and not related at all but I never thought the orphans were said I I always thought they were lucky because they could imagine their parents to be anything they wanted they had something to long for\nAnyway we did this one season finale where Libya is birth mother comes to town and she was a junkie but she's got herself cleaned up and she was being Olivia's life again and of

S. um tell us about the book store your mother used to have like what kind of what kind of books were there and did you read any of them\nAre so my mother owned a a Jewish gifted in book store called Bob and Bob and it was kind of a hobby of Jewish life in the bay area or or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto and the surrounding area and so I really you know what I Would go and ...\nJewish life in the bay area or or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto and the surrounding area\nAnd so I really you know what I Would go and visit the store and I sit in the kids' section or sit at her desk and and and and leaf through the books\nAnd and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish day school um you know I even after a high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews and never felt\nA extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never\nOnce felt like a minority and the communities that I was in um\nShe would always bring home stuff from the store off and it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of minorities that were shipped\n'em and we have we have a banner that we put up every Hanukkah that says happy Halloween because it's missing an end to have the the misfit toys or Monica um it it just felt very normal that to have a Jewish life\nUm and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWas a disconnect between being told about anti Sam ... senators and living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture\nA hundred percent it felt like a thing of the past it felt like oh the Holocaust happened uh and that was terrible but now we live in sophisticated times now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew\nAnd you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes um\nAnd it's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country and they're they have a lot of power\nAnd there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage um and that's been very scary to me um\nAnd there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage um and that's been very scary to me um but also scary\nHow little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening\nUm especially big some for someone who\nYou know as a Jew you hear the story of a Holocaust over and over and over growing up and the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing\nRight there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who were shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them and cutting off their beards\nAnd so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAnd you know officially one of the Jews who control the media\nI guess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kinda feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nThey said it because it's the ... and like I think yeah\nAnd I and I would say a couple of years it'll be like oh yeah we do control the media is not hilarious um and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out and I'm very glad of that power\nUm but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember if it was middle school or high school but somewhere around then\nSo it was it difficult for you to concentrate in long enough to to read books\nYes or sometimes you know I I I could always read books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there is something that really interested in me I could focus and do it\nSome people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there is something that really interested in me I could focus and do it you know the problem is in school you have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in\nAnd there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed where it felt like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just a troubled child I just don't behave\nAnd you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took a pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I Love that audience that I Love making people laugh\nBut a lot of it too is I I had trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't you\nKnow and it was inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize was inappropriate\nYou know like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my parents are everyone can see my underpants don't fit inappropriate and and\nI remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy here pushing the boundaries I did it because I thought oh this'll be a funny thing\nAnd then I was mystified that oh now I'm In trouble it like it did not occur to me that there'd be a cause and effect this action that would lead to me being sent to the principal's office and that this was an outrageous action to to take\n'em you know or just a shelling out stuff in the middle class if I had a funny joke I Would just say it's a well you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I thought I have I Want to say this thing so I'm going to say it\nAnd I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and say this funny thing and when it was not okay I thought that was more of it\nNavigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and say this funny thing and when it was not okay\nI thought that was more of a symptom of being a comic then attention deficit disorder [noise] well\nI think those things are related a little bit for me at least I'm ... I don't necessarily know the difference between you know the problem with ADHD and other a mental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not\nOh you have this thing there for you or this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this precisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas and it's hard to say yes am I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have\nYou know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps and what does this mean I still am not quite sure\nWhat was TV like a safe space where are you where you can like unless\nYourself and television and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of what you were consuming than the natural world and the reason why I ask that is that like there are so many pop culture references and bow jak horsemen and some of them like\nJust like whiz by you and it happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them um made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when you're growing up\nYeah well TV made sense to me and you know there is a a a correlation and causation chicken or egg conversation to have here but on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it right even if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation there definitely\nWas a period in my life where I thought of the funny thing even if it was mean even if it was inappropriate if I thought it would get a laugh from an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this scene that I was living in feel like the scenes\nFrom an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this scene that I was living in\nFeel like the scenes that I was seeing on TV and that was a a real lesson that I had to learn\nUm and I think what's been helpful is being a writer and having an outlet and now if I Am in a situation I think of the funny thing\nI can write it down and say oh I'm going to hold onto this and I'll have a character say later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment or if I think it was a funny situation you know oh wouldn't it be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or if someone came in here and did this\nI can save and go you know why would I give us away for free in this moment I'll I'll get paid for by putting into the story later so having those outlets has been tremendously helpful for me\nYou know I'm thinking now the comedy central is running bulge applicants Netflix series now that Comedy Central is raining it starting with season one\nUm what's that like for you because you in retrospect for like some of the jokes in season one were misguided and now it's getting like a brand new life [laughter] cable\nYeah you know it's it's been interesting because we're we're actually editing some of the episodes down to you know add commercial breaks making under the right time for Comedy Central and you know obviously want them to keep their\nDignity as an episode of television not edited out anything too important but as we are looking for cuts what are the things I'm looking at is is this joke still funny to me or would this scene work without this moment and if it does sometimes we'll take those moments out um but I also think look this is the show and\nFunding for K.

students are healthy and happy school year\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest or New York times reporter says and crack and David Barstow two of the three writers who reported just a couple of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches\nFrom his father and deconstruct the whole Donald Trump myth about how as a self made\nMillionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money Fred Trump Donald's father\nFunneled to him and his other siblings and how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax games we talked about I'm Fred Trump made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that you got a million dollar loan from his father and help parlay that antennas\nInto his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws\n[noise] ah we were able to document in real dollars sixty million dollars in loans no one million\nAnd we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans not one million I'm In today's dollars acquaintance two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in direct wealth that we saw\nTransferred to Don and what we what we also saw but I think what is important also is that in many cases um these were loans that were never repay aid you know he would take out [noise]\nUm we were looking at one particular year was like every month\nHe's going back to that and he's barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks and then a million dollars it was just like a monthly run to to Fred Trump to get more money and we saw especially that the flow of loans increase\nAs Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream that went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in his early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then off being off to the races\nThese were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father\nHe is the money for many of his adventures he had Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support died it was used to support\nHis ventures in Atlantic City and elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially like at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars um in ...\nTrump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars um in debt and this is the time he not only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars um he was in debt to his father was going was father these very crucial times for more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries\nTo build his own empire and ended up in debt and a lot of instances instead of making a fortune from his own investments that\nAlso see that when his so you know when he would fall down the safety net was there for Trump safety was there to catch them\nThere's one spooked just almost unbelievable moment in the store and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this is a time\nAnd the you know the backend of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of his companies are either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos that they're facing a debt payment\nAnd Fred Trump has a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino chips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money history and the million dollars worth of it was ... and a half million dollars worth of casino trips\nAnd at this period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see\nAnd Donald Trump at this period has a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father as well centrally and do well and it was caught a soldier the wheel is taken to Fred Trump's house in December Nineteen Ninety\nInfrared Trump immediately sees this caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire and potentially put at risk and Fred Trump immediately says no he freaks out and he\nTo take control of his empire and potentially put at risk\nAnd Fred Trump immediately says no he freaks out and he makes a call to his daughter who is a federal judge in a lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months is drafted that removes Donald was the sole executor for Trump's will inputs Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new will is dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life\nAfter all his father has done for him that he makes this move it's incredibly dramatic move and scarring to the family what he did\nSo what you're saying I think is that at the end of ... life or toward the end of ... life\nDonald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump bail himself out and Fred Trump Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had helped with so much money over so many are\nWhat we know for sure is that Fred Trump perceived to this as an attempt by his um to gain complete control over his estate and potentially to use\nThe the the empire that Fred Trump had doggedly and patiently built over many decades to use that as far as I'm potentially as collateral to help bail Donald Trump out of his own financial difficulties\nAnd I guess or New York times reporters David Barstow and Suzanne crab after our break

investigative article this month but have Fred Trump use schemes to avoid paying taxes or transferring money from his real estate empire to Donald Trump\nMeasured in today's dollars Donald received about four hundred Thirteen million\nSo then after ... di Donna Trump took the lead and decided they should sell off everything that Fred Trump still own at the time of his death why did Donald Trump make that decision [noise]\nSo the interesting thing about that sale and it's something that we noticed again and again when we were doing our reporting was that\nFor a Trump very much wanted this empire to stay in the family um he had kept it together um through his whole life and he had hoped that after his death they would keep it on I I think what we can never really get into Donald Trump's mind as to why\nHe sold it in in two thousand and three there was a family meeting and they had regular family meeting softer for Trump died they would hand out checks you know for Trump's buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months um to get an update on the status of the empire and to get a chalk\nAnd then in two thousand and three at one of these meetings Donald Trump announced that it was time to sell\nAnd quickly assembled a private sale to a developer in New York for almost all of it and it was sold you know give or take a few buildings in one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSo soon as the the uh buildings that were sold all of those buildings ... own it as a ...\nEight hundred million dollars so that the the uh buildings that were selling all of those buildings ... own at the time of his death out they're awesome clued all the buildings that had been transferred from ... to the children\nThey included both the buildings that had been transferred down the one city owned it was it was pretty much as ... empire and it sold 'em you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York developer name or be shown in the price tag was just over\nSeven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learn through the the the documents that we went through that dot sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars and what the banks would value at out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that died empire was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much less\nSo it wasn't like the deal out of the century that down and Donald Trump may it definitely wasn't so if the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRS\nBut um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely get away with it so it's true that the IRS actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe describe in the story and in fact they are as ours did push back some and especially on\nThe lower valuations they've placed on buildings and made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning if ... million more bucks on that return but the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got\nAn agency that is pretty over matched\nOverworked an auditor who can walk into a recession and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good days\nThat is pretty over matched overworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families who hire the most expensive\nLegal and accounting helping who engage\nIn these very sophisticated maneuvers to avoid or evade taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an honor their looking though at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more\nMeanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of\nSimply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at just in a state tax returns\n[noise] um since then I'm going to ask you to choose either the art video the are the comeback or The Apprentice and tell us all is actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals\nOn public\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David or the comeback [laughter] go for it [noise]\nAh well say he publishes the art of the come back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of his sort of you know pulling himself up I'm Out of the ... of his casino collapse\nAnd through his grit and determination and Wylie negotiating skills getting himself back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication of this book so happens to coincide with the time\nIm self back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication of this book so happens to coincide with the time when you actually took possession of one quarter of his father's real estate empire through one of these very elaborate\nTax schemes that we describe in the story so at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map it actually costs it's perfectly with the moment when he was just taken possession of twenty five percent\nOf this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way not a word of that made its way into the book the art of a comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice in the song money money money money\nThat happened in two thousand and four I'm right as the sale had gone through the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Fred Trump and yet when you watch not opening scene\nIt's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane is there that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene for Trump belt and paid for [noise] I'm Wondering how\nYou feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the mess of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making abilities and so many people still believe the math and\nTrump is still putting forward in that\nIt's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stock and I think that we've ... I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of ...\nStock and I think that we've\n... I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first stop in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think the the power of the story is\nYou know I think the whole careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents up I think it's really hard to refute the story um it's harder for you because it's absolutely true in the documents are there and in a lot of them are the source documents of the Trump family themselves\nUm but I think it will take time for this just sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um but I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times those basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on\nThis story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access knew were locked up in this room I'm ... who cleaned it who is allowed to go [laughter] you know [laughter]\nWe uh we did not have a cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come in one day with a with a little vacuum and and\n[laughter] [laughter] but we uh yeah it was just the three of us for a year um with a yeah it's a pretty messy [laughter] I was a little ...\nAnd it'll cost are phobic Shiite imagine [laughter] than other people know why you were locked up in this room [noise]\nUm actually people knew our our editors new but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery\nAnd then other people know why you were locked up in this room [noise]\nUm actually people knew our our editors do but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery mystery surrounding it we are kind of kept to ourselves and uh yeah it was it was difficult everybody you know the people keep asking you what you're up to and um but we uh we tried to keep a lid on it as best we could", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "18"}
