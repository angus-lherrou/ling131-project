explain what the fifth risk is\nShort answer is is the risk you failed to imagine it's is while you're worried about what you're worried about is the thing is actually going to come and kill you and the longer answer is what I'm working on this book\nAbout the federal government under Trump\nI come to see the federal government as really a portfolio of risks that are being managed\nAnd as I'm wandering around the federal government try to figure out what these risks are over and over again I what I'm asking people in the Energy Department or the agriculture partner even the White House to name kind of the top risks on the tip of their minds\nAre they all come up with a three or four and then they can't think of this so\nWorried about is the thing is actually going to come and kill you\nAnd the longer answer is when I'm working on this book\nAbout the federal government under Trump I come to see the federal government as really a portfolio of risks that are being managed\nAnd as I'm wandering around the federal government trying to figure out what these risks are over and over again I when I'm asking people in the Energy Department or the agriculture partner even the White House to name kind of the top risks on the tip of their minds\nAre they all come up with kind of three or four and then they can't think of the fifth so I thought that's the moment where the mind fails to imagine what it needs to imagine\n[noise] since your book is about the federal government under Trump focusing on the energy agriculture and commerce departments why did you name it ... now that you've explained with ... means\nWhich then apparently caused Trump to take a lot less of him but he you know he is an odd choice if he was very odd choice because with that department really needs is someone who's really comfortable with technology\n[noise] well if you're just joining us my guess is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the book looks at the energy agriculture\nRich list a calculated him having and four of us who watches this investigation discovers that he'd been lying to the

who's really comfortable with technology\n[noise] well if you're just joining us my guess is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book is about the federal government under

books like money ball the big short and the undoing project all of which have been bestsellers his new book the fifth risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments\nNow among others so much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the Mueller investigation and now to um the Kavanaugh confirmations story\nAnd not as much attention is being paid what's happening on the cabinet level on the department level and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening in the department level like the three departments you write about\nThe risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments\nAmong and there's so much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the mother investigation and now to um the Kavanaugh confirmations story\nAnd not as much attention being paid to what's happening on the cabinet level on the department level and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening\nIn the department level like the three departments you write about no agriculture commerce energy that most of us aren't paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on but it's not it never seems to be like the sexiest story\nIt never will be and that's the problem I mean it's like where society of distracted drivers we're not paying attention to the thing that matters most\nThere is this enterprise that is not a tree we had a prize the bigger cited it ... it doesn't function without the government government is is it's been subjected to decades and decades of\nOf abuse and scorn in his collected rough and this guy has come in with a sledgehammer and is is having at it and nobody's paying much to know is paying much attention because of slow moving story and this to me you know\nOne aspect of the fifth risk\nIs the go a lot of the risk that the government manages are very long term slow moving risk climate change would be one of them income inequality ... would be another a cleaning up or you know horrible toxic waste sites that can pollute rivers and\nRuin lives in another they are all kinds of examples of very slow moving problems that are dealt with in a slow way but they require a long term approach and\nOne aspect of the fifth risk\nIs the go a lot of the risk that the government manages are very long term slow moving risk climate change would be one of them income inequality ... would be another a cleaning up or you know horrible toxic waste sites that can pollute rivers and\nRuin lives in another they are all kinds of examples of very slow moving problems that are dealt with in a slow way but they require a long term approach\nAnd on top of this enterprise has been has been thrust is very short term\nAttitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration is incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle and\nThe public is go along with it and that's the that's that's the frightening thing to me\nAnd you see a lot of action happening as a department level that kind of level of government where things are being done we positions aren't being replaced where people\nAre being appointed who aren't really um appropriate for the position\nAnd people and they're people who have the ability to dismantle critical functions of the government who also have a financial incentive to do so because they have some conflict\nSo let's get back to the Commerce Department which you write about in the fifth risk atomic bomb includes the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in L. A. Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department Israeli\nFirst of all what they're doing in the Commerce Department [laughter] it's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent it's sixty five percent or so of the budget it goes to this one thing you know it eats the Commerce Department and they simply do National Weather service by the national weather service\n... because they have some conflict\nSo let's get back to the Commerce Department which you write about in the fifth risk atomic bomb includes the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in L. A. Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department Israeli Noah first of all what did you sign on the Commerce Department [laughter]\nIt's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent it's sixty five percent or so of the budget it goes to this one thing you know it eats the Commerce Department and they simply don't National Weather service by the national weather service is a bit and now there was services the biggest part of no\n... and how do they get their back in the seventies or Nixon was contemplating a reorganization of government and\nUm he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior at the time came out against the Vietnam War in ... Nixon got ticked off and just shoved into the Commerce Department is an act of vengeance so it's there it doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there\nAnd it is it's the single most important institution within the Commerce Department are and it does it eats most of the resources and it and what it does\nUm is absolutely critical and er into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nAnd you're talking about Barry Myers who is the C. E. O. N. accuweather uh that sounds actually like a good fit he runs a weather Prediction Center okay well\nI'm so here's the problem ah typically the person who runs no a as a as a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operation um\nThe problem is that\nAbout the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nAnd you're talking about Barry Myers who is the C. E. O. N. accuweather I that sounds actually like a good thing he runs a weather predictions are okay\nI'm so here's the problem are typically the person who runs NOAA has has a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operation um\nThe problem is that the national weather service uh which has been a ... a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but but but weather prediction has gotten generally\nDramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to be able to give them and I mean and just the you know the daily forecast has gotten better\nOr all of that saves lives and property or if that's the mission of the national weather service to save lives and property to do it it has to\nCommunicate with the public uh it it has to let the rest of it has it has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers a has been on a two decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather\nCan do it instead and that's how accuweather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced in Congress to sexually forbid the national weather service from from doing anything but warning in ... right in advance of a of a weather event that might kill you\nAnd the problem with is is that well in the first place\nIt's the the the the the data that that is required to generate weather\nTwo decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather\nCan do it instead and that's how accuweather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced in Congress to essentially forbid the national weather service from\nFrom doing anything but warning in ... right in advance of a of a weather event that might kill you and the problem with is is that well in the first place\nIs that the the the the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nIs all paid for by the taxpayer I mean that that these billion dollar satellites that are hovering over is the uh the ... the ... the network of radar stations across the country that the national weather service spends the bulk of its money accumulating the data that and then makes available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so that they can go and you know\nAdvertise the whether there's no real reason why the taxpayer should have to pay for this twice having paid for the day to the national weather service really should be able to give people forecasts but what he has been trying to do is organized essentially a kind of exclusive right\nTo use that data and make money from it and his argument is that I shouldn't have to compete with the government but it's a very strange argument because the government gives him basically all he needs to do is business for free\nYeah you're saying that the weather satellites weather radar weather balloons oh the high tech stuff that I'm\nThat no private company that no private company on its own would have the wherewithal to to pay for that it is naturally or a government operation and so and it's naturally a governor operation to deliver a weather forecast for the public so that may Myers or had been like\nBut it's a very strange argument because the government gives him basically all he needs to do is business for free\nYeah you're talking about the weather satellites weather radar weather balloons oh the high tech stuff that I'm\nThat no private company that no private company on its own would have the wherewithal to to pay for that it is naturally or a government operation and so and it's naturally a governor operation to deliver a weather forecast to the public so Barry Myers\nOr had been like one vote away from Senate confirmation where does that stand now\nHis nomination is stalled so he's not in the job yet\nMy guest is Michael

that Cancer Center dot com\nOffering a tire decision guy to help customers find tires that fit their car and driving conditions\nThat basically represents their point of view [noise] so what was the landing team and what was piled tasked with doing\nSo landing team is a grand phrase for what arrived at the department of energy because it was really just pile and he didn't show up until a month after the election\nAnd he would have been in theory tasked with receiving you know hundreds of hours of briefings from people in the department of energy who would prepare them but he what he did instead was met met for about an hour with a couple of people in the secretary's office\nAnd listen politely and didn't take notes and the people who were\nRunning department or jihad the impression\nPast with doing so landing team is a grand phrase for what arrived at the department of energy because it was really just pile and he didn't show up until a month after the election\nAnd he would have been in theory tasked with receiving you know hundreds of hours of briefings\nFrom people in the department of energy who would prepare them but he what he did instead was met met for about an hour with a couple of people in the secretary's office and listened politely and didn't take notes and the people who were\nRunning department or jihad the impression that he had no interest in what they had to say\nOne of the things he did um is part of the quote landing team will send a list of Seventy four questions he wanted answers to Seventy four questions to the department of energy what were some of the question\nHe wanted lists of a name of anybody in the department who attended meetings that were associated with climate change\nHe was trying to identify people who might be hostile to the fossil fuels industry I think so the department didn't actually respond by giving him the list of names but he ... the bigger point was\nHe came in in what ... what they interpret it as a hostile spirit I'm signaling that the new administration was not did not approve of the various attempts the department of energy was making to wean us from fossil fuels and it is you know part of the department of energy mission to\nEngage in and fun basic research in alternative energy\nSo you know your previous book about the science of of risk\nAnd about trying to kind of clout to find a way how the human mind works when it's assessing risk that book was called the undoing project do you feel in a way that your new book could have been called the undoing pocket because in some ways\nWas not did not approve of the various attempts the department of energy was making to wean us from fossil fuels and it is you know part of the department of energy mission to engage in and fund basic research in alternative energy\nSo you know your previous book about the science of of risk and about trying to kind of clout to find a way how the human mind works when it's assessing risk that book was called the undoing project do you feel in a way that your new book could have been called the undoing ... because in some ways\nDepartments and you know in the Trump Administration are getting on ... ... there aren't a lot of people to replace the people from the Obama administration yet and some of the people who have been put in positions to run those departments are antagonistic toward those departments\n[noise] so yes but there's actually there's actually direct connection between the undoing project my last book and this is what got me into this book in the first place [noise]\nOne of the insights that drops out of the work of the psychologist Dan economist and Amos too risky who are studying the way people judge risk is that when you changed the odds people don't sets it\nEspecially with catastrophic risk you take something that is there's a one in a million chance of it happening and change it to one in ten thousand people don't feel that\nAnd I was thinking of that when Trump came in and approach to the federal government the way he did because\nOne way of thinking of the federal government is is this vast portfolio of risks many of them potentially catastrophic risk the risks of a pandemic or or the risk of a a nuclear accident or risk of a terrorist attack or the one after another and many of these are not risk that most people are thinking about\nA million chance of it happening and change it to one in ten thousand people don't feel that and I was thinking of that when Trump came in and approached the federal government the way he did because\nOne way of thinking of the federal government is is this vast portfolio of risks many of them potentially catastrophic risk the risks of a pandemic or or the risk of a a nuclear accident or the risk of a terrorist attack or the one after another and many of these\nAre not risk that most people are thinking about the risk that the nuclear waste site in half or Washington leeches plutonium into the Columbia River and poison the whole Pacific Northwest and I thought Trump's approach\nIs effectively taking lots of you know wanting to million or one of the ... hundred thousand risks and making them more likely making them all more likely\nBecause he's putting people in charge of the risk you don't know anything about it\nAnd I thought the society doesn't feel it caught him and he showed you the people don't really feel this and that insight as what got me going in the first place\n[noise] so you used to work on Wall street way back in the day and you wrote about that experience in your first book liars poker last month mocked the tenth anniversary of the financial collapse of two thousand eight the market has more then recovered over that time\nBut some people are starting to say this might be another bubble um\nHow are you interpreting having written a book recently about risk and having you know been having written about the financial crisis what you've done um I'm actually in what your thoughts are about whether we are now in terms of financial stability in\nWell I'm a big question\nThe question you asked\nCollapse if he's asking a the market has more than recovered over that time\nBut some people are starting to say this might be another bubble I'm\nSorry you interpreting having written a book recently about risk and having you know been having written about the financial crisis which you've done I'm I'm doing what your thoughts are about whether we really are now in terms of financial stability and\nAnd world markets [noise] well I'm a big question\nThe question you're asking me to predict the bad things going to happen next\nWell I I Know that's not really your job but\nNo it's not my job but you know if I ... I Would love to have one outlandish prediction on the record not that I think it's going to happen but like it's a sort of thing that if it does happen I think a lot of people will go oh my God that's exactly where we were headed all\nAssuming Donald Trump remains president for a while\nI think there's at least the possibility of the risk that he will try to default on the American debt selectively like he'll say or the Chinese are trying to sell their treasury bonds is causing disruption in the treasury bond market they stole all that money in the first place from is we're not going to pay the Chinese back\nThis is a a war way of saying that\nI think the risk now in the financial system is political risk\nI at the banks are much better capitalizing better regulated and they were ten years ago I don't think there's going to be a directly a banking crisis but I think there could be a crisis in faith in the dollar and in us credit worthiness our deficits are exploding\nWe have a president who has a history of defaulting on debt\nHe's riled up lots of emotions hostile emotions to foreigners who hold the debt I'm a ... that wouldn't shock\nOur way of saying that I think the risk now in the financial system is political risk\nI at the banks are much better capitalizing better regulated and they were ten years ago I don't think there's going to be a directly a banking crisis but I think there could be a crisis in faith in the dollar and in us credit worthiness our deficits are exploding we have a president who has a history of defaulting on debt\nHe's riled up lots of emotions hostile emotions to foreigners who hold the debt I'm a ... that wouldn't shock me and that would trigger a financial crisis uh so what if you treat them by the national well because\nThe dollar is the world's reserve currency lots and lots of people hold it assuming it's going to be more or less stable they'd be a flight out of the dollar a U.S treasury bonds of the benchmark for a ... of risk a risk was asset in the world would everybody kind of measures themselves off of it's assumed to be\nYou know better than gold if that if that is called into question and then treasury bonds are going to collapse in the interest rate which the U.S government can borrow is going to skyrocket\nUm this is the doomsday scenario and I'm just kind of playing with it here but if you asked me to like\n... predict what might trigger or the next financial crisis I think it's I think I Would predict it's some sort of political event and it would be that sort of thing and if that happened you know it's fun

with a scene Catherine hon plays Rachel a writer married to Richard a theater director played by Paul Giamatti who makes a living with his tour may pickle business they live on a limited budget in the East Village in Manhattan\nThe fertility treatments have already taken a lot out of them when the fertility doctor tells Rachel that her best bet is finding an egg donor that is not something she wants to do and she lets Richard no it as they walked down the street after leaving the fertility clinic\nNo way in hell on doing\nWhat we should think about it [noise]\nI'm not saying that we would do it\nRight we can just explore the idea of you know we feel like a list of all the pros and cons [noise]\nWe talked about this we ... we would never do it no use for that you would never do what are your [noise]\n[laughter] I kept my mouth shut\nBecause I didn't want to pressure you into something that you were going to have to live with for the rest of your life [noise]\nWeight started all the time and I'm assuming that we feel the same way about this have been having secret fantasies about egg donation it's not a secret fantasy it to me I didn't know about it I thought that we had decided together as a couple that we would definitely draw the line at\nFor that you would never do it I uh\n[laughter] I kept my mouth shut\nBecause I didn't want to pressure you into something that you were going to have to live with for the rest of your life\nWait so all the time that I'm assuming that we feel the same way about this you've been having secret fantasies about egg donation it's not a secret fantasy it to me I didn't know about it I thought that we had decided together as a couple that we would definitely draw the line at\nScience fiction it's not science fiction writer ... it's pretty primitive actually they do it with farm animals all the time\nBecause there's all this preparation and instead he lifts up a hyper during the MEK needle and an intra muscular needle and you know spears it into her but and then you got wide and you see wow that is not a sex scene that as a medical situation\n[noise] and and to compare it to say pregnancy like instead of the has\nBeen put in his hand or the partner are putting their hand on you know the president belly feeling their baby inside he's kinda like stabbing her with needles in her belly and her and her head and I'm\n... ... ... again it's just it's not\nThe moment that you dream of when you dream of having a baby in what that's going to be like it can lead ride that moment but that\nIs just so so\n[noise] and and to compare it to say pregnancy like instead of the has\nBeen put in his hand or the partner are putting their hand on you know the president belly feeling their baby inside he's kinda like stabbing her with needles in her belly and her and her head and I'm\n... ... ... again it's just it's\nNot the moment that you dream of when you dream of having a baby in what that's going to be light it can lead ride that moment but that\nProcess is just so so different\nYeah it it's pretty alienating in the body department I mean and then of course it's even taken to a new level when\nInstead of having your husband insemination you you're lying in a you know kind of a stir ups and having a you know endocrinologist between your legs are with some strange catheter device saying okay let's get pregnant\nAnd uh it's not your husband it's the doctor [laughter] that's pretty strange too\nAnd you shoot those scenes in Mr ups [laughter] and if we're ...\nA clinic from the point of view Catherine ... so you're seeing a doctor you're seeing her legs on the steps through her point of view yeah there was one of you so many women have had so many times [laughter] [noise]\nUm yeah and I'm ... I actually have um the doctors don't come off very well in your movie was that your ...\nI actually had great doctors it's a very bizarre job um I Love Dennis O'Hara who played Dr ... and uh\nHe it's a weird job because there's a salesmanship I mean first of all you know it's not an indictment about the fertility industry um because the fertility industry makes amazing things like her\nWomen have had so many times [laughter] [noise] um yeah and um I actually have um the doctors don't come off very well in your movie was that your parents\nI actually had great doctors it's a very bizarre job um I Love Dennis O'Hara who played Dr ... and uh\nHe it's a weird job because there's a salesmanship I mean first of all you know it's not an indictment about the fertility industry um because the fertility industry makes amazing things occur but it's not an easy fix\nWell that leads to another scene that I Want to play the Catherine ... character is a writer and she has a new\nBook that's about to be published a novel that's called\nWomen's studies and her\nHer agent closer and said have you seen the cover and Catherine hon says no no no and so she runs through her email to open the PDF of the cover and she looks at the cover and she's horrified because the covers of you know Catherine has a feminist and the character and and in\nThe novel or on the cover there's a woman and the white flowing dress in a field of like purple and green\nAnd [noise] it's so quote feminine and like old fashioned feminine and so she's mortified and so here's the conversation she has with her husband afterwards or who's played by Paul Giamatti I should mention that as their talking she's finishing brushing her teeth\nAre still ... for what\nThey call is ten minutes ideologies ally that I have a career in panned out just send them the bills for Iowa is an idea\nOf second wave feminism for our ambivalent about having to [noise]\nMortified and so here's the conversation she has with her husband afterwards a who's played by Paul Giamatti I should mention that as their talking she's finishing brushing her teeth\nAre still so betrayed by what\nIn college [noise] feminist ideology ally that I didn't have a career in in ... well I haven't panned out should send them the bills for Iowa is an idea\nBlame second wave feminism for our ambivalent about having a tip [noise]\nKnow you're not because you realize that the voters leaving the dog but\nBefore you kept changing the deadline is\nOh whoa we'll start as soon as I finish to play a\nRight after I get the story published I finished the book\nNo I'm not blaming it oh I I'm just saying that we need to take some responsibility for the situation a\nLot of women has been a hit forty one\nI just don't think it's Gloria Steinem fault that we can't get pregnant\nI guess it is mine too busy writing my stupid book [noise]\nAll the doctors that we're talking about it's\nMy advance the turtle a my old eggs in one of the middle of an idea that oh what a surprise your sperm it was like\nWhoa whoa what so suppose okay\nSo that was Catherine ... and Paul Giamatti and a scene from my guess timer Jenkins new movie which is called private life [noise]\nAll the doctors ever talked about a\n... bad the turtle a my old eggs in one of the middle of an IV at an oh what a surprise your sperm it was like\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa whoa so suppose not hey\nSo that was Catherine ... and ... and a scene from my guest Temer Jenkins new movie which is called private life\nSo did you have this kind of conversation in your head [laughter] when you were trying to conceive in your early forties and wondering if it was just too late if you waited too long did you play both parts here in your own mind yeah\nMean blaming myself yeah we utilize the body and Katherine my ... and ... in your head having that argument with yourself yeah I think I was I think that that's fair a kind of um\nYou know how did I end up here I mean her blaming second wave feminism for her I mean it's such a\nDemented thing to do but then I sort of understand what she said I remember my producer was trying to follow the the logic of the writing and she was like well I'm she's sort of leaps to that and I said you know it's buttering this isn't like a rational this is a kind of\nUpsets buttering person then this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why she feels betrayed by some notion of like a\nYou know be independent and you don't need you know pursue your career and it's not like glorious time ever said that exactly you know she really can't be blamed but I Know what Catherine's character is talking about some sense of like\nNational this is a kind of upsets buttering person then this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why she feels betrayed by some notion of like a\nYou know be independent and you don't need you know pursue your career and it's not like glorious time ever said that exactly you know she is you really can't be blamed but I Know what Catherine's character is talking about some sense of like a license\nTo pursue your\nOr to pursue the other part of your life not the wife part not the mother part but the other part and then suddenly\nShe feels like the rug has been pulled out from under her and this thing that she um delayed is now possibly not available to her I think for a lot of\nWomen when you're trying to reach a certain point in your career there never seems to be a great time to take time away from that to you know get pregnant and and raise a child and take some time either a little are a lot\nAway from the work that you're pursuing from the career you're trying to establish\nWe really afraid you'd waited too long and not you know work had gotten in a way of\nOf becoming I mean it's also it's work and it's probably my own hesitation about taking that plunge and what it means and sort of maybe as you were getting at in our last interview ten years ago my own weird family also played an impact which isn't really\nYou know that marriage and having babies didn't look so good from my childhood point of view [laughter] so maybe I wasn't rushing to do it anyway um but back combined with\nThe you know pursuing a career and being\nThat you know work had gotten in a way of of becoming\nI mean it's also it's work and it's probably my own hesitation about taking that plunge and what it means and sort of maybe as you were getting at in our last interview ten years ago my own weird family also played an impact which isn't really you know that marriage and having babies didn't look so good\nFrom my childhood point of view [laughter] so maybe I wasn't rushing to do it anyway um but that combined with the you know pursuing a\nCareer in being a writer I was a performance artist and then I I was an actor I was performance artist I was making theater I was you know then I decided that to go to graduate school and film and then trying to make films and it was all very\nConsuming and not conducive to having a kid I mean I didn't have any money for one and I live by the skin of my teeth and didn't have health insurance and you know was not I wasn't doing anything that seem particularly stable\nMy guest is

comedy that also has a lot of drama to it about a couple of played by Paul Giamatti and Catherine hon who are in their forties and trying to conceive through various fertility methods and the old fashioned method and\nAlso trying to adopt and it's creating a lot of emotional turmoil and conflict\nOh I should mention that Temer Jenkins also wrote and directed the savages and slums of Beverly Hills\nSo we've spoken after each of your future in films and in two thousand seven when we spoke after the savages and you are forty and talked about how you are trying at that point to have children with your husband you said so\nSteve through various fertility methods and the old fashioned method and\nAlso trying to adopt and it's creating a lot of emotional turmoil and conflict\nOh I should mention that Temer Jenkins also wrote and directed the savages and slums of Beverly Hills\nSo we've spoken after each of your future in films and in two thousand seven when we spoke after the savages and you were forty and talked about how you are trying at that point to have children with your husband you said so you know I guess I'll be an older parent because you are already forty\nYour father was Twenty years older than your mother so he was an older parent and he raised you part of the time as a single parent not a very good one maybe but [laughter] um what was the experience for you like having a parent who is older than most of the other parents\nYeah I mean he was also and he was not a unique character yeah yeah he was from another time it was like having a Damon Runyon character as your dad I mean he was um he was old fashioned anyway\nUm and it but it was really different I remember people saying oh I remember being with my dad at a grocery store in Los Angeles and I think somebody said something about\nOh you know well you know oh honey you know well you just give that to your grandfather and I started to correct the person uh I think it was you know a cashier and I said oh that's not my grandfather and I feel like my dad sort of shut me up\nLike he didn't want to get into it\nAnd I and and then it was sort of I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but [noise] and maybe the idea of having a mom that was Twenty years younger than your dad I don't know but yeah he he also felt like he was out of time he was sort of you know he was a bubble\nJust give that to your grandfather and I started to correct the person uh I think it was you know a cashier and I said oh that's not my grandfather and I feel like my dad sort of shut me up\nLike he didn't want to get into it and I and and then it was sort of ... I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but and maybe the idea of having a mom that was Twenty years younger than your dad I don't know but yeah he he also felt like he was out of time he was sort of\nYou know he was a bubble and we lived in Los Angeles and everybody seems sort of modern and in the seventies and she just seemed like I said like smoking as Paul malls and his sued and and had compulsive gambling he was really like a character\nSo you made three feature films two of them are about being a daughter and her new one is about becoming a parent or your first one slums in Beverly Hills is when\nYou live with your father and he moved you and your brother to Beverly Hills and\nHe was broke basically [laughter] but he wanted you to go to good schools so we'd find like the cheapest places he could possibly find in Beverly Hills for you to stay so you'd have a good ZIP Code and can go to a good school there\nAnd it was just like a weird weird existence your second feeling the savages is based on what happened when your father had dementia and you had to move him to um a a a nursing home\nAnd he was not as usual he was not appreciative of what you were doing\nUm in part because of the dementia in part because he's just not\nYou didn't depict him as the appreciative type [noise] I'm right and there isn't a strange men need between you between the actor and a father and also between the character and her brother so unusual coming together and of course the new movie is about you know a woman\nWhat happened when your father had dementia and you had to move him to um a a a nursing home and he was not as usual he was not appreciative of what you were doing um in part because of the dementia in part because he's just not\nYou didn't depict him as the appreciative type\n'em right and there isn't a strange men need between you between the actor and a father and also between the character and her brother so unusual coming together and of course the new movie is about you know a woman in her forties trying to to have a child through whatever means necessary [noise]\nUm and so no matter which way you kind of turn the camera what you've been looking at in your movies is um\nIs family and you know\nThe complications of having one and wanting to have one\nAnd I'm Wondering if you think having such a complicated childhood yourself because of living several years with your father and not being well parent and during that time has made you so focused you know on the idea of family\nYeah I mean I I must be I mean it's hard to know exactly what goes in to it but I guess I Am I mean our family was super fractured and there were multiple said you know there was actually four children and\nUm we you know didn't live with her mother lived with her father than we lived with her mother a little bit then we moved to Cambridge and my big brother became my legal guardian he adopted us I mean we were pretty we we did a lot [laughter] what what is your Mother's Day arrangements [noise]\nUm when I was a teenager or at that point I had like I was living with my dad for ten years and my dad\nUm ... we moved away from living with my dad plus he was old PS but\nUm we you know didn't live with her mother we live with her father than we lived with her mother a little bit then we moved to Cambridge and my big brother became my legal guardian he adopted us I mean we were pretty we we did a lot [laughter] what what is your mother arrangements\nUm when I was a teenager or at that point I had ... I was living with my dad for ten years and my dad\nUm ... we moved away from living on my dad's plus he was old PS but anyway and I had a little brother and we moved to live with my mother and that was very unstable and kind of crazy and then my oldest brother has ten years older than me um had been\nA living abroad and he returned he was living in ... he was living in Bali actually and he returned\nTo uh go to graduate school at Harvard\nAnd he came to see me and I was living with my mother and he was concerned about me I was a teenager I was pretty depressed and\nI was working in a dry cleaners in Philadelphia and going to lower ... high school for a second and then um he was worried about me and he said that he was moving to Cambridge to to go to school and did I Want to\nMove with him\nHe's sort of save my life how did he said it because I he paid attention well then I did move in with him and then my little brother we all lived in Harvard housing and they um student housing at Harvard and he sort of began became our parent\nHe paid attention to us like we had very narcissistic parents know when we were just no one was paying attention and suddenly and it was very chaotic and\nCrazy and then suddenly we were living with like little monks we're so happy my brother was you know getting his PHD and uh and me and my little brother lived in this Harvard housing and\nThey all lived in Harvard housing and they um student housing at Harvard and he sort of ... became our parent he paid attention to us like we had very narcissistic parents we know we were just no one was paying attention and suddenly and it was very chaotic and\nCrazy and then suddenly we were living with like little monks we're so happy my brother was you know getting his PHD and uh and me and my little brother lived in this Harvard housing and we lived on food stamps and student loans and my brother took out and um\nYou know we our lives improved and we became much better students [laughter]\nThat's cool [noise]\nWhich was ironic because of course everybody from the outside thought oh they don't have any parents must be wild over there but we were the opposite we were really like monks we were so happy not to be in a chaotic place that we we weren't like the wild family we were like the we were trying to find sanity\nWhat's an example of a chaotic moment in your childhood\n... well you know the stuff in California would be my father's relationship to every landlord that we had in LA because we there was always some drama with the rent and having hostile relationships with our landlords\nBecause my dad although we didn't know why you know the landlords were nice to the kids but I mean now I'm like oh they didn't like his because dad was probably late with the rent\n'em so there was that there was a kind of general dysfunction in any building we ever lived in um um and then when we lived with my mother she was I guess she was on her second marriage and her second husband was an alcoholic and it was very chaotic and there was never food in the refrigerator\nHostile relationships with our landlords because my dad although we didn't know why you know the landlords were nice to the kids but I mean now I'm like oh they didn't like his because dad was probably late with the rent\n'em so there was that there was a kind of general dysfunction in any building we ever lived in\nUm um and then when we lived with my mother she I guess she was on her second marriage and her second husband was an alcoholic and it was very chaotic and there was never food in the refrigerator but there were things like cocktail food like olives and\nThings that you would put in a ... marriage you know cherries and ah maybe some parmesan cheese but there was never food food it was very cocktail\nOriented and then um yeah those are a couple of examples so when you were living with your brother\nWas it was at Harvard and on on a ... yeah ... yeah it was Harvard housing it was not on the campus but I'm close to it yeah I was in between Harvard Square and Porter Square off massive so was it helpful to you to be in an atmosphere where there were a lot of college students\nYeah it was really it was so different from our weird like LA Nineteen seventies world like living in the outskirts of Beverly Hills which is just specific and strange and\nUm and then go to you know wherever in Philadelphia which was my mom lived in the suburbs of the main line and ah yeah it was just a Cambridge itself just felt so I mean it was New England it just had a very different feeling\nUm it was and there you know there was just so much focus in our house because my brother was doing so much and he was getting his you know he's taking care of two kids and getting ... like twenty five was crazy I mean it was an amazing sacrifice and I just didn't have\n... and um and then go to you know wherever in Philadelphia which was my mom lived in the suburbs of the main
