welcome to fresh air you know you write in your book that there's a new understanding of what rape and sexual assault means that started on college campuses but with me too movement it's spread beyond

Judiciary Committee had gone to college campuses what'd you think some of the things are they would have been told about ... what did take into consideration before voting\nThings that they might not

how that is maybe changing what what was the kind of common understanding of the definition of sexual assault\n[noise] five oh five nor beavers street and Humphrey summit skied off oh\nThis is fresh air\nLet's get back to my interview with ... author of the new book blurred lines sex power and consent on campus\nSo let's talk about the definition of sexual assault and how that is maybe changing what what was the kind of common understanding of the definition of sexual assault in the three years you were talking to people on college campuses\nThere was a huge shift in the definition of sexual assault from like two thousand and fourteen to Seventeen while I was there and I watched as it happened um many students said to me that they weren't sure if groping\nCounted as sexual assault maybe it had to be penetration 'em\nBy the end of those three years that idea was completely blown up the water 'em and I even had students say to me\nYou know sexual assault is maybe even the way you speak to people the way you abreast on people in speech and make them feel like justice or like dirty like a sexual objects I mean they were thinking through this idea how far can we actually take this\n[noise] so um it is there no commonly held understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is now\nI don't think that there's a national understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is I think that\nUm people who are in line and about this issue understand that it doesn't have to include penetration um but I think that part of why good parts\nThrough this idea how far can we actually take this [noise] so um it\nIs there no commonly held understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is now\nI don't think that there's a national understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is I think that um people who are in line and about this issue understand that it doesn't have to include penetration um but I think that\nPart of why good part of the country is in line with Trump on this issue is that we don't have a national definition\nSo um you also say that the definition of consent is being redefined and the slogan used to be no means no but now it's a yes means yes what's the difference between no means no and yes means yes\nWell there is a huge difference something like yes means yes is okay until you get some sort of yes you don't really have permission to touch somebody now\nI guess you know in the college definition could be verbal or it could be um they like to call it acts unmistakable in their meaning which I suppose means I'm mon are grown or pulling off clothes et cetera\nAnd from looking at this in researching it I didn't agree with this at the outset but I came convinced that this is a\nReally good standard for young people and perhaps for older people as well certainly anybody who's\nIn a workplace you might have a crush on somebody else you know you got to ask a question 'cause you could be misinterpreting signals people do that all the time\nMoon are grown or pulling off clothes et cetera and from looking at this in researching it I didn't agree with this at the outset but I came convinced that this is a\nReally good standard for young people and perhaps for older people as well certainly anybody who's\nIn a workplace you might have a crush on somebody else you know you got to ask a question 'cause you could be misinterpreting signals people do that all the time so why were you\nResistant to this yes means yes standard and why did you change your mind\nWell I'm an adult you know I'm In my forties and I know that that's not the way sex usually happens means sexes something ... book and that's kind of energy between people and more exciting in some ways when it's like that\nYou know we see a lot of young people who are having sex with people that they met on dating apps they barely know these people home that's part of the\n... part of the charge but and I I'm not so doctrinaire that I think that you should have to say yes to each escalating base or sexual act which is the way a lot of people think of yes means yes but I Do think that a question is not that big a deal\nI'm In Gen x we had the question you know should I get a condom which was always\nKind of a a question about protection but it was really a permission question um they really have to be an extra question\n... you read that the strongest argument for affirmative consent for yes means yes is that it frees girls from the cage of socialized politeness one you mean\nYes but I Do think that a question is not that big a deal I'm In Gen x we had the question you know should I get a condo which was always\nKind of a a question about protection but it was really a permission question I'm there really has to be an extra question\n... you read that the strongest argument for affirmative consent for yes means yes is that it frees girls from the cage of socialized politeness when do you mean\nWell one of the complexities of sexual assault is that girls don't always saying no um they certainly don't say it that way no get away from me I'm pushing you away right they say well maybe another time\nUh I don't think I Want to do this tonight until they end up\nGiving up um you know some of the most interesting work that's being done now in terms of trying to fix this problem is about\nGirls understanding the signals from people who might in Trenton them harm and removing themselves from the room before anything actually happens because people understand once they're in the room it's really hard to get out\nWell you know the thing about yes means yes there's a lot of people say oh that's so awkward to kind of have these like rules like almost like a questionnaire like I authorized huge too like you know take off my shirt or whatever [noise] um but it's equally awkward I think for the woman to be in a place where the man is making all these advances\nAnd you have to say no no no stop no I really mean stop no okay I'll leave no it just put the responsibility on her and it makes it like really awkward\nAnd it's not a shared awkwardness it's like one person and having\nWell you know the thing about yes means yes there's a lot of people say oh that's so awkward to kind of have these like rules like almost like a questionnaire like I authorized huge too like you know take off my shirt or whatever [noise] um but it's equally awkward I think for the woman to be in a place where the man is making all these advances\nAnd you have to say no no no stop no I really mean stop no okay I'll leave no it just put the responsibility on her and it makes it like really awkward\nAnd it's not a shared awkwardness it's like one person having the full burden of the awkwardness\nExactly so this is a little dorky okay ... ... it definitely changes things I mean I went to a dance party I like to go out and dance and I\nRecently you know guys try to come up and downs with you and you try to get away and this guy came up and he was about to put his arm around me and then he said is it okay if I put my arm around here and I said no\n[laughter] no I mean why his arm around me and he said oh yeah I get it consent I'm I totally get it I understand I'm Glad I asked was that the first time that happens is\nThat was definitely the first time for me\n[laughter] I mean I ... yeah I I didn't\nThink that that men intended me harm but I didn't want his arm around me I had no interest in him and Mary and I'm I was just there with my girlfriends having a good night and dancing so\nI think that's a great thing to have that happen and to have young girls who\nTruly a you know are in night clubs or at dance parties law understand like this is my buddy I own

wondering\nIf you have any thoughts about that or if that's an issue that came up a lot when talking to young women on campuses well\nIt's certainly not an issue that came up when I spoke with the young women 'cause they completely believe that it's empowering but it's an issue that came up a lot for me because I found myself really torn between those two ideas is is empowering or is this\nDenigrating 'em and you know being somebody who comes from second wave feminism I in my knee jerk reaction is like us\nAnd and I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts about that or if that's an issue that came up a lot when talking to young women on campuses\nIt's certainly not an issue that came up when I spoke with the young women 'cause they completely believe it's empowering but it's an issue that came up a lot for me because I found myself really torn between those two ideas is us empowering or is this an grading um\nAnd you know being somebody who comes from second wave feminism item my knee jerk reaction is like you guys were calling the self object vacation isn't that just a\nA ruse isn't that just somewhere justifying on this kind of\nWay that you're you're presenting yourself but after speaking to so many of these students I truly change my mind about that because I realized like this is how they grew up you know these kids that I interviewed in college just graduating now you know Brittany spears was just like\nThey were they were just tiny when Brittany spears without the culture has been so saturated with sex the entire time that they've been growing up even growing up around pornography around fashion and that is much much ... than anything that I grew up with\nSo they don't have the same ideas about oh if I trust this way it makes me look like a slut because this is the way people dress now there's such a casual way and you're right and a lot of concerts of beyond say or\nKaty Perry ... the you know it's it's crossing a line wave from scanty

huge amount of nervousness about it and they feel I'm anxious and depressed disguised won't like their social media posts et cetera so there's there's a flipside to that but they were adamant with me that this was only to the good that they were presenting themselves\nShe read in your book we're in the process of developing new power dynamics in the bedroom an area where feminism has previously not been able to reach so attached to explain what you mean by that I think this\nRaising of demons that has been going on through the me too era is allowing women not only to save these are the

with the cult classic pink flamingos his film hairspray which was adapted into a hit Broadway musical was an affectionate and funny or much to the teen dance shows he used to watch in Baltimore\nLast Sunday the Baltimore museum of art opened a major exhibits devoted to John Waters running through January six it's called John Waters indecent exposure and he's the first major retrospective of his visual art in his hometown of Baltimore\nA companion catalog has been published compiling not only visuals from the works and photos of John Waters but also from other works that inspired him John

two thousand four Terry interviewed him about an exhibition at New York's new museum of contemporary art it was a photographic series waters began in the early nineties\nMany of the photographs were tribute to his favorite films which not surprisingly include many old exploitation films and tawdry melodramas\nMost of the pieces Terry ask John Waters about in two thousand four also included in the

repay plays a sequel to it it opens up Indian summer is like a woman for\nAnd I thought well that's it you know so I I didn't really ever care\nThat the other kids weren't interested in what I was in because as long I had a very rich fantasy life\nAnd my parents I'm allowed that I had a little stage even as a kid uh I I my parents bought me a reel to reel tape recorder so I could tape songs I was the first download her ever because the real the real tape recorder\nTape songs off the radio but then so I could sing them on lip sync from basically so I always I was a puppeteer as a kid I I had a I had a job I had a career when I was twelve years old so puppeteer\nSo I always had an outlet for this that that was encouraged even though the work I was doing was not exactly the work that they wished I was doing but but I I guess they figured it was this or nothing maybe or prison [laughter]\nBut they were very supportive which was very I'm very very encouraging and I I always say that if if you've got a kid that doesn't fit in is rebelling in any way encouraging if your if your daughter comes home and she's just had her entire face tattooed what you can you do maybe she'll open a tattoo parlor that will do well that's all you can you got to deal with what you got\nSince you didn't feel guilty about watching things in being obsessively interesting interested in that things were\nWhat you got since you didn't feel guilty about watching things in being obsessively interesting interested in that things that weren't supposed to be healthy did you go the other direction figured well I might as well planned up to the hilt and and be you know take on the pose of of the pervert [noise]\nOh I never thought of it that way I I I took one\nI had to create a persona for myself in the beginning when we made these movies because I didn't have\nAny advertising no one knew who was what we had to think of a way to to publicize the movies and divine and I did that sort of as as a\n[laughter] I was the director and he was the same movie star and certainly I dressed weirdly but um it was always confusing I never um [noise] my audience in the beginning\nWas never gay or straight it was gay people that didn't like other gay people let's say three [laughter] it was hippies just didn't like hippies it was it was always the outsider of another outsider group but that's that's what my audience began with and certainly I'm\nI encourage that but it seemed to work because yes in in the beginning underground movies when I made them\nThey were made in a way to offend the very people who would come there in a humorous way though always by doing the whole Kennedy assassination which we did and and divine place Jackie Kennedy was shot in Nineteen sixty five and came out in sixty six [noise] believe me that was to go over very well at the time\nBut at the same time it was a liberal taboo I mean I liked the Kennedy I Love Jacqueline Kennedy or Jacqueline Kennedy of how she pronounces it um so I I was I was always making fun of things that I really really liked him respected\nWhy don't you describe what you did in your version of the Kennedy assassination lifted line in the role of Jackie Kennedy well this was in a movie called each\nWhy don't you describe what you did a newer version of the Kennedy assassination lifted line in the will of Jackie Kennedy well\nThis was in a movie called each her makeup and it's about people that kidnapped models and force them to eat their make up a model of themselves to death and divine was not the star of it he was supporting player in it and there's the same or divine isn't drag just weird drag but with no way gone because we were trying to\nEven offend I guess drag queens at the time by not taking it seriously\nAnd he starts looking through all these Jacqueline Kennedy magazines but there were many off at the time\nFan magazines and he starts to imagine themselves as Jacqueline Kennedy in the Kennedy assassination and we have the whole thing the capital Kate I mean a pitiful version but we have the chef for our we have 'em all the people that were in the car we have Secret Service agents\nAnd um defined as waving to the crowds are no crowds that was filmed on my parents' street and lives in Maryland I'm Maurice avenue\nAnd a and a and then it is scored to our classical music where there's one note that if the gun shot and then divine crawls over the top of a car with the blood and everything and it's quite graphic but it was filmed so primitive way that's a nice way to say badly I'm black and white ah\nSixteen millimeter grainy over expose that when I took pictures of it twenty five thirty years later\nIt began to look like the ... the one of the most famous eight millimeter movies ever\nSo I'm an ... I I I did a a photo of peace based on that pictures of something I did a long time ago and it goes around the wall around the corner of the wall because I I always joke that I'm a ... well I Believe in the art world that the frame as the hype the frame as the advertising campaign\nSo to me it was too big for one wall and it has to go around the wall\n[laughter] I'm In ... for anybody\nPain so to me it was too big for one wall to go around the wall [laughter] I'm\nIn ... for any of our listeners who aren't familiar with divine who in this film that you're referring to play a Jackie Kennedy devine was a you know a very heavy men who who usually played a woman in your movies and pattern himself in some of those rules on an Elizabeth Taylor\nAnd I'm like what do you think of real drag queens at the time well\nThey were square at the time you know I think ... divine helped make drag queens a lot hip or are they all want it to be best Myers and and\n\nUm so it was they were really square they weren't hep ever\nNow all drag queens or hip I mean you see 'em at Woodstock and they're all really funny and have a sense of humor and they have funny names and everything\nBut but then they were very very serious I remember in Philadelphia there's a great movie called the queen about a drag beauty contest in Philadelphia I Know where where you live and Harlow was the winner and I'm very very famous\nA drag queen but but we used Elizabeth coffee who was at the time I'm much more ludicrous I Am much more\nFunding and had a sense of humor about it and used to being a drag queen of as being um comedy terrorist which I think um was much more useful in film than than just a man trying to be a pretty woman\n[noise] you know early in your career you said that your work is really about the sadness normal people feel because they're not involved in show business\n[laughter] so that was the ...\nThing I've ever so I didn't mean to be ... ... I Believe that most everybody secretly imagines himself in show business at every day on their way to work for a little bit depressed because there are people are fab there in a famous of America [laughter] I guess you really need\nOn their way to work for a little bit depressed because there are people are fab they're not famous of America [laughter] I guess you really needed to be famous

in for if you didn't want people to recognize you I've I've always said that show business is filled with the most insecure people of all that\nThat we base a life on having to get approval of
