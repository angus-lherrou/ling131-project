the question is what changed well\nNothing changed and I take issue with their premise a I was representing my district back in twenty sixteen I was fighting for southern Arizona and and I was one of my own campaign and I've never endorsed anyone for anything whether president or a dog catcher and so I just continued with that path\nBut he's now in office and as the president of the United states\nAnd we have this historic opportunity to move America in a new direction and we've done that since he's been in office we've cut taxes we roll back regulations were working to rebuild our military were cure or border so there's so many opportunities that we have in front of us\nAnd I built a good relationship with the president uh the first time I was invited over there I talked to him about the eight ten ward off the plane that I flew and how we see that a lot diminish ration tried to you know put it in the bone yard but how important it was to keep it flying because it protects our troops and I talk to him right then into becoming an eight ten fan\nA I'm a working with this administration were related to sanctuary cities and MS Thirteen gangs are so many things that we have

be here with you tonight and Martha it's good to see you were going to have a good conversation tonight on the issues that matter most to Arizona families rising healthcare costs protecting Medicare and Social Security and keeping our country safe and secure\nBut there'll be some differences that you'll see clear in this evening I been laser focused on the issues that matter most to Arizona families in everyday Arizona's Walmart has chosen to run a campaign based on nasty smears and false attacks\nAnd I expect you'll see more of that this evening but Arizona's now that I've never been afraid to stand alone to do what's right and I always work with anyone to get things done in Arizona and that's the approach I've taken in the United States Congress\nIs all in the valley did you want to respond to any part of that sure absolutely I mean we've heard these talking points a lot already know just talking specifically about the campaigns I had to wear a Fifteen million dollars so far at of attack ads against me\nFrom cares in cinema and our allies in fact in the primary over two million dollars were spent against me a ... by an organization that was a her previous can political consultant with a part of and there was a bit of a sneak attack 'cause when we found out George Soros and Chuck Schumer actually behind them\nWe're now up to no Fifteen million dollars so with everyday Arizona's really care about our job opportunities and we've been able to work on that and provide more opportunity\nYou know just talking specifically about the campaigns I had to wear a Fifteen million dollars so far at of attack ads against me\nFrom cares in cinema and our allies in fact in the primary over two million dollars were spent against me a ... by an organization that was a her previous ... political consultant with a part of and it was a bit of a sneak attack because when we found out George Soros and Chuck Schumer actually behind them\nWe're now up to Fifteen million dollars so what every day Arizona is really care about our job opportunities and we've been able to work on that and provide more opportunities for them we have more jobs right now more people are more jobs opening that people are looking for jobs\nAnd this is really providing more future and more opportunities for people in Arizona and we're going to keep working on that\nEveryday Arizona's can't afford their health care because Obamacare has failed and we need to make sure that we provide affordable available health care for them\nCongresswoman should've I asked a congresswoman Shelley regarding what had changed as what has changed with you may remember you as being a more liberal than you are now back when you were in the state legislature no you vote more often than not with President Trump what changed\nWell its head as Arizona and snow I had been lucky and privilege to surface great state both in the state legislature and of course now in Congress for the last six years\nAnd over the years I'm proud to say that I have taken the time to learn and grow and occasionally even changed my opinion when I served in the U.S Congress for my first several terms with congressman Sam and he and I worked together on a variety of issues including keeping our country safe and growing businesses in Arizona and protecting trade\nSo over time I think it makes sense for individuals who are willing to learn and to grow the difference I think between Martha's approach in my approach\nIs that Martha opposed to many of these issues before running for Senate and then changed her mind very quickly I\nThe years I'm proud to say that I have taken the time to learn and grow and occasionally even changed my opinion when I served in the U.S Congress for my first several terms with congressman Sam and he and I worked together on a variety of issues including keeping our country safe and growing businesses in Arizona\nAnd protecting trade so over time I think it makes sense for individuals who are willing to learn and to grow\nThe difference I think between Martha's approach in my approach\nIs that Martha opposed to many of these issues before running for Senate and then changed her mind very quickly I've\nBeen serving for many years in the United States Congress and before that in the legislature\nAnd have overtime been able to grow and become even better at my job serving Arizona's and folks snow in Arizona ... always put their interests first never party\nSo as you mentioned Ted I often do vote against my own party and that's something I think Arizona's depend on and are proud of they want an independent voice in the United States Congress and what they want in the United States Senate is someone they know who stands up for them not just does what party leaders tell them to do\nHave you changed I guess you know it's the first question Congress allowed to change do whether you know it's\nReally not I left my home at the age of Eighteen and joined the military I lost my dad when I was twelve and I was looking for opportunities to get a good education as the youngest of five kids so I chose to serve in uniform for twenty six years\nI put my life on the line for our country if we were three hundred and twenty five combat hours protecting our freedoms and our way of life\nI'm now serving in Congress and I've been leading on the issues of supporting our military securing the border and providing more economic opportunity for people and I been consistently doing that both serving in Congress and now running for the Senate my record is clear and it's consistent unlike my opponent\nJust real quickly you mentioned that you were going to go through with President Trump this week yeah are you proud of the way President Trump has been\nTo serve in uniform for twenty six years\nI put my life on the line for our country if we were three hundred and twenty five combat hours protecting our freedoms and our way of life\nI'm now serving in Congress and I've been leading on the issues of supporting our military securing the border and providing more economic opportunity for people and I been consistently doing that both serving in Congress and now running for the Senate my record is clear and it's consistent unlike my opponent\nOf real quickly you mentioned you were going to go through with President Trump this week yeah are you proud of the way President Trump has conducted insult in office the\nPresident Trump ... ran for president one time and one\nUh and he's a disruptor he went to D.C to shake things up and he's doing that and we're seeing the results from that not a lot of people wanted to tackle the challenges of North Korea getting access to a nuclear weapon that could hold American city hostage not a lot of people wanted to address updating bad trade agreement so that it would help Americans\nAnd so he does things for sure in Washington DC but providing more opportunities for Americans in Arizona's while ensuring that we're safe and secure if in the threats that are out\nThere who you're proud of the way President Trump has behaved\nI Am proud that he is gone to the White House and he is leading our country in the right direction I Am proud to be working with him to provide more opportunities and to make sure we keep our country safe he didn't need to be doing this I've\nGotten to know him over the last year and a half and he loves America and he's fighting for Americans every single day and I'm going to keep working with him to provide more opportunities for all of us\nSure we keep our country said he didn't need to be doing this I've gotten to know him over the last year and a half and he loves America and he's fighting for Americans every single day and I'm going to keep working with him to provide more opportunities for all of us\nI've been working to try and help protect children from the threat of Social Security fraud and fast so earlier this year I partnered with the Republican colleague of mine Carlos Curbelo of Florida and we pass legislation that actually provides greater protections for children who are targets are victims of Social Security fraud\nWorking together we can actually solve these problems and keep our children safe and secure and protect their privacy rights but unfortunately on this piece of legislation Martha voted yes\nReally think we need to move on to some other important topics because literally this has been debunked and she just taking a time but if you want to talk about protecting children then let's make sure we don't take a donations from back page dot com\nExcuse in cinema took fifty three thousand dollars back page dot dot com you know owners and it was until she was put under pressure why they were under investigation that she finally was shamed into giving it back\nAnd when she was in the Arizona Legislature when they were trying to hold John's accountable for going after victims of child sex trafficking she was advocating for the John's saying that the girls twelve and Thirteen year old you know looked older than her look\nShe just taking a time but if you want to talk about protecting children than let's make sure we don't take a donations from back page dot com\nCinema took fifty three thousand dollars from back page dot dot com you know owners and it was until she was put under pressure while they were under investigation that she finally was shamed into giving it back\nAnd when she was in the Arizona Legislature when they were trying to hold John's accountable for going after victims of child sex trafficking she was advocating for the John's saying that the girls twelve and Thirteen year old you know looked older than her look I'm not making this stuff up these are her words and\nAsk people to go to the real cinema dot com to find out the facts 'cause this snake over as been pretty impressive but people deserve to know what her record is what our past and what the facts are and the things she advocated for\nDo you believe you honestly believe she was protecting adult men were molesting children\nI Would ask people to go watch the whole video she was a defense attorney so I I mean I guess that's where it comes from you will with it but in\nIn that discussion and then later on in ... and twenty ten in another hearing uh the based on her concerns for eight Fifteen sixteen and Seventeen year old the jobs are basically in that bill allowed to have an affirmative defense that said\nI didn't know there are Fifteen sixteen or Seventeen years old and that's the bill that was changed when she says she voted on it but\nIn two thousand ten watch the tape the real cinema dot com paying bills than is there a tirelessly advocating for children because she's seen the scores\nAnd in an argument with representative cinema because she was asking well what's changed why can't we just keep it as it is and Peggy passionately saying it's because they're getting off with less than a traffic ticket so again I just ask voters there's so much at stake here please do the research go to real cinema dot com and you can see for yourself\nSixteen or Seventeen years old and that's the bill that was changed when she says she voted on it but in two thousand ten watch the tape the real cinema dot com pay bills and is there a tirelessly advocating for children because she's seen the scores\nAnd in an argument with representative cinema because she was asking well what's changed why can't we just keep it as it is and Peggy passionately saying it's because of getting off with less than a traffic\nTicket so again I just ask voters there's so much at stake here please do the research go real cinema dot com and you can see for yourself respond please\nBullet Martha's saving out is I actually voted yes on both of those bills after they were and worked hand in hand with my colleague Republican Adam drags often attorney to make sure that this legislation tough and the penalties against these bad guys who engaged in this horrible activity\nAnd something that's important for folks to know about me is that this has been my entire career\nMy first job was as a rape crisis camps are working at a domestic violence shelter and since then I've committed my life and career to protecting women and children from abuse and from assault and my record is strong and twenty Thirteen when we pass the violence against women reauthorization act to give\nBetter tools to law enforcement to crack down on these kinds of heinous crimes I lead that effort\nBut just last month when a vote came up to reauthorize this for the long term Martha voted no to give a long term reauthorization to the violence against women act so I Would encourage folks to go take a look at the boats and as we heard this morning and the Arizona Republic this is ridiculous\nWe ask people to just go look at our vote record because it speaks for itself\nIt does speak for itself and that is absolutely ally that's like a procedural vote that she's pulled a few out there that have nothing to do with the author as I recall throws into violence against women act so pleased\nThat effort but just last month when a vote came up to reauthorize this for the long term Martha voted no to give a long term reauthorization to the violence against women act so I Would encourage folks to go take a look at the boats and as we heard this morning and the Arizona Republic this is ridiculous\nWe ask people to just go look at our vote record because it speaks for itself\nYes it does speak for itself and that is absolutely ally that's like a procedural vote that she's pulled a few out there that have nothing to do with the author as I recall frozen the violence against women act so please don't believe that\nI'm going back to congresswoman cinema and to the original question about Brett Kavanaugh one of the main sticking points on both sides has been discussion about whether justice Kavanaugh would support overturning roe v Wade where do you stand on that issue\nI Believe decisions important decisions such as that should be made between a woman her family and her doctor free from government interference\nAnd where do you stand on that I Am pro life and I have a very strong pro life record so you would support overturned opera I Know I'm focused when it comes to judges on how they interpret the constitution and how they interpret the laws that we make it's not a particularly mishap but I have a very strong pro life record\nSo you would support the overturning roe v would I\nWould support appointing justices I mean this has nothing to do with what Congress is working on where the Senate I Would support appointing justices that aren't are looking independently at the constitution and at the laws that we make a and that they will have a good decision making process based on that [noise]\nAll right let's move on to health care a congresswoman or Mick Sally [noise] how much should government be involved in health here especially when it comes\nSo you would support the overturning roe v would I\nWould support appointing justices I mean this has nothing to do with what Congress is working on where the Senate I Would support appointing justices to that aren't are looking independently at the constitution and at the laws that we make a and that they will have a good decision making process based on that [noise]\nAll right let's move on to health care a congresswoman or Mick Sally [noise]\nHow much should government be involved in health here especially when it concerns folks to find it difficult to get healthcare specifically those with pre existing conditions what is the government's role\nThanks head for the opportunity again to the bunk another attack or from my opponent I voted to protect people with preexisting conditions to make sure insurance companies were forced to give them health care and no cats and insurance and could not canceling that is if they flat out lie we cannot go back to where we were before Obamacare\nWhere people were one diagnosis away from going bankrupt because they could not get access to health care\nAnd so it although was trying to fix it\nObamacare was the wrong or you know the wrong approach it's a trillion dollars in taxes it's rotting Medicare by seven hundred and sixteen billion dollars it's mandates and penalties that were really intending to go after those who are falling through the cracks who didn't get healthcare\nFrom their employer or Medicare Medicaid it ends up is about seven percent of people and they're falling through the cracks there are still falling through the cracks had because I I met an entrepreneur this last week\nWho decided to start her own business oh who has a pre existing conditions but because of Obamacare and because of skyrocketing costs she has no coverage right now more people will pay the penalty last year than actually bought insurance on the Obamacare exchanges so we have to address the issue and we've got to make sure we\nThe mandates and penalties that were really ... intending to go after those who are falling through the cracks who didn't get healthcare from their employer or Medicare and Medicaid it ends up is about seven percent of people and they're falling through the cracks there's still falling through the cracks had because I I met an entrepreneur this last week who decided to start her own business oh\nWho has a pre existing conditions but because of Obamacare and because of skyrocketing costs she has no coverage right now more people will pay the penalty last year than actually bought insurance on the Obamacare exchanges so we have to address the issue and we've got to make sure we protect people with preexisting conditions\nBut the Obamacare model has failed\nWe move forward with a up an approach that gives people tax credits and give them options to shop around more and more small business support to have association health plans more opportunity for people to give to health savings accounts\nThat still can provide affordable available a health insurance for them which isn't working right now under Obamacare So we've got to protect it at the federal level there should be apart but it's best man is at the state as well where there's more options for them to be innovative because what works in California is not what works in Arizona were ...\nWell I'm so glad we're talking about health care because it is the number one issue that I hear from folks both on the campaign trail is I travel the state and in my office in the United States Congress Arizona's are very worried that they will lose coverage for those with preexisting health conditions\nNearly three million Arizona's live with preexisting health conditions wanting samples eliminating Leslie uh she lives in Scottsdale she was diagnosed with diabetes when she was in high school and she's been taking five insulin shots a day for forty seven years\nBut when Martha voted last year to repeal existing law it would have eliminated the protections for people who live with preexisting conditions in our country today she also voted to\nArizona is are very worried that they will lose coverage for those with preexisting health conditions\nNearly three million Arizona inside with preexisting health conditions one example is a woman named Leslie uh she lives in Scottsdale she was diagnosed with diabetes when she was in high school and she's been taking five insulin shots a day for forty seven years\nBut when Martha voted last year to repeal existing law it would have eliminated the protections for people who live with preexisting conditions in our country today she also voted to repeal that same protection in two thousand Fifteen\nSo the reality is that Arizona is are worried about losing access to this critical coverage and Martha voted to take that protection a way\nThat that is just a flat out lie again these are just classic fear tactics if you turn on a TV all over the country right now the Democrats have nothing to run on and so they're choosing to play with fear I voted to protect people with preexisting conditions and as we were moving forward and nothing was moving through the Senate related to this issue\nFourteen Fifteen counties in Arizona there was only one choice last year that is not a choice and the premiums have gone up over a hundred percent year to year there's so many people right now a pre existing conditions they can't get access to health care because Obamacare model doesn't work\nBut when things came to a standstill and we were watching these individuals' still not able to get access to health insurance I\nMy Democrat colleagues and the problem solvers caucus and we sat down to see if there's any way we can find some common ground to help these people get access to health insurance and we came up at the end there was a couple of our Democrat colleagues out there with a white board in my office\nWe know when we there's something we can find to help states was collapsing\nAnd we came up with a planet twenty three Democrats or Republicans at least the the majority of the ...\nThat work but when things came to a standstill and we were watching these individuals' still not able to get access to health insurance\nMy Democrat colleagues and the problem solvers caucus and we sat down to see if there's any way we can find some common ground to help these people get access to health insurance and we came up all the time and there was a couple of our Democrat colleagues out there with a white board in my office\nWe know when we there's something we can find help state was collapsing and we came up with a planet twenty three Democrats or Republicans at least the\nThe majority of the group agreed to so we showed that we can break through the gridlock solve the problem and actually help people get the insurance that they deserve and get the care that they deserve with the conditions that they have in their family again governments players in health care\nWell one thing I think all Americans can agree on as we cannot go back to a time when people couldn't get coverage when they had preexisting health conditions so on Martha talks about a working group and part of the problem solvers caucus which I Am a proud member of the reality is that we took the vote\nAnd during the vote Martha voted to repeal these protections and they are the protections that Arizona and count on every day that same vote also took away protections for people age is fifty to sixty four and would've allowed states to begin charging them as much as five times more for their coverage\nEnding family separation moving towards a merit based system and providing a legislative solution on DACA here's and social work with anybody\nSo don't listen to the talk I even leading on the issue and she had the opportunity to vote for a bill for thirty eight billion dollars of border security\nEnding family separation moving towards a merit based system and providing a legislative solution on DACA\nHere's in social work with anybody but when it came down to it all the Democrats including chairs and voted no on this very important to compromise bill President Trump supported it she was given the opportunity to vote yes and she voted no response was\nWell I have thoughts my party over the years to do what's right for our border you know folks on the east coast and from far away don't understand the issues of the border like we do but I was born and raised in Tucson and I've been living around the border for most of my life so this is real for us in Arizona\nAnd that's why when opportunities came to work across the aisle to do what's right for our state I was willing to buck my party so I've supported a ten million dollar increase for our customs and border patrol agents of five billion dollar increase for ice agents\nAnd have voted for legislation such as capes law\nAnd the gang removal act which allow us to crack down harder on these bad dangerous guys who are committing felonies and hurting people in our community\nThe reality is that this is an issue that I've been working on my entire career it shouldn't be a partisan issue and it's not a partisan issue only when some people choose to make it part is and as Martha has done does this become a fight and the United States Congress\nColors when did you pull your name all the recognizing Americans children's act earlier this year which are targeting dreamers in support streamers you afford at all\nAnd the gang removal act which allow us to crack down harder on these bad dangerous guys who are committing felonies and hurting people in our community the reality is that this is an issue that I've been working on my entire career it shouldn't be a partisan issue and it's not a partisan issue\nOnly when some people choose to make it part is and as Martha has done does this become a fight in the United States Congress\nWhen did you pull your name off the recognizing Americans children's act earlier this year which dog targets dreamers and support streamers you were for about all of a sudden you pulled your name off of the what was that old\nSo I've consistently shown that I was willing to do something on DACA but we have to secure our border and we have to address the root causes of why we have a ... population the first place to make sure that we don't make the mistakes of the past and so as we were working on this issue when the president kicked doc doc at a Congress appropriately\nMice and men and a couple of other Republicans sat in the room for many many hours and came up with legislation that would solve the issue secure the border and address the issue of DACA and when it was brought up to a vote children's cinema voted no we had\nCompromise bill which was twenty five million dollars the worst security the president still supported it and a pathway to citizenship for DACA\nBut it close the loop holes of the cartels are taken advantage of right now and we were in the midst of this discussion\nIt looked like some people were going to force a vote on just a stand alone bill related to DACA\nI wanted to make sure it was clear we've got to secure our border I'm willing to do something on DACA but we've got to secure the border and close the loop holes of the cartels or trafficking people into our communities and the opioid crisis that's killing Arizona's every single day\nI jumped in and let on the issue and cares if given the opportunity to vote yes or no\nTwenty five million for border security in the second bill\nTaken advantage of right now and we were in the midst of this discussion\nIt looked like some people were going to force a vote on justice stand alone bill related to DACA I wanted to make sure it was clear we've got to secure our border I'm willing to do something on DACA but\nWe've got to secure the border and close the loop holes of the cartels or trafficking people into our communities and the opioid crisis that's killing Arizona's every single day I jumped in and let on the issue and character was given the opportunity to vote yes or no\nTwenty five million for border security in the second bill plus a pathway to citizenship for DACA and ending family separation she chose to vote no along with Nancy Pelosi real quickly do support a partial government shutdown to fund a border wall I look I don't support shut down for anything I've been in the military\nI've seen the the the devastating as a result of government shutdowns Washington DC nice to be able to get their act\nTogether and they need to be able to fund the government and fund our military but you know given that opportunity last year when there is a lot of pressure from ... base to address this issue\nShe voted with Chuck Schumer to shut down the government to illegal immigrants over our troops in a partisan play so she talks again game about working with anybody but when given the opportunity to actually solve this issue she left our troops hanging\nOn Mars they continue to talk about very partisan bills and very partisan activities\nBut the reality is that during this discussion of talking about immigration how to solve our problem we do have bipartisan legislation the bill you mentioned it's had that might have removed her name from I'm a co sponsor of that legislation\nI was actually the first Democrat in the country to join with congressman Carlos Curbelo of Miami to sponsor that legislation and I ... sponsored an original co sponsor of a bill called the usa act which I mentioned earlier which both secure our border and ...\nPaying for Martha continues to talk about very partisan bills and very partisan activities but the reality is that during this discussion of talking about immigration how to solve our problem we do have bipartisan legislation the bill you mentioned it's had that Martha removed her name from I'm a co sponsor of that legislation\nI was actually the first Democrat in the country to join with congressman Carlos Curbelo of Miami to sponsor that legislation\nAnd I ... sponsored an original co sponsor of a bill called the usa act which I mentioned earlier which both secure our border and provides a path to citizenship for dreamers Martha has chosen not to support that bipartisan legislation and instead has chosen to support only legislation supported by one political party\nAnd I believe Arizona deserves better and so when there was a opportunity for folks to get very partisan which they did and they do on a regular basis\nI was part of the bipartisan group trying to solve that problem we offered are below the usa act unfortunately partisan leaders in both parties rejected our proposal\nMix Sally you mentioned family separation at the border\nDid you support the Trump administration's a so called zero tolerance policy at the time are there any circumstances under which you are okay with families being separated that way this administration because of the laws that are on the books was put into the situation where they had to either and fought for the law or keep families together I think we need to do both\nAnd my bill and the uh the second bill that cares and voted no on would've ended family separation it would have provided an opportunity for there to be due process and keep families together while they were they were a process for their illegal entry or process for asylum\nWe're also increasing funding for immigration judges so we could end this catch and release\nLook the reality is the cartels know right now that if you show up with a kid\nStrange and because of the laws that are on the books was put into the situation where they had to either and fought for the law or keep families together I think we need to do both\nAnd my bill and the uh the second bill that cares and voted no on would've ended family separation it would have provided an opportunity for there to be due process and keep families together while they were they were a process for their illegal entry or process for asylum\nWe're also increasing funding for immigration judges so we could end this catch and release\nLook the reality is the cartels know right now that if you show up with a kid you're gonna be let go\nI've got a call this weekend from the human mayor saying he was panic that two hundred or more people every single day we're going to be just let go into a you know and they didn't have the capacity because they showed up with a kid and we're seeing the activity increased every single week\nAs they cross the border illegally they know they're going to be let go there is also a case of the border patrol are telling us about where people are not the child of the person who's bringing them in\nAnd this is increasing the incentive to traffic children across the border\nSo my bill fix this legislatively and had the opportunity for us to enforce the law and keep families together and that was the right approach you know she can talk about different bills she got on but the one she had a chance to vote on the one that was a compromise that President Trump supported\nIn the family separation fix DACA and secure the border let's here's voted to support sanctuary cities she voted to cut eyes she's very dangerous on this issue I mean I make sure we secure our borders Ninety seconds for bottle please\nMartha shared a lot of information just now that frankly just not accurate the reality is that the Trump Administration made a decision to separate families at the border in an attempt to try and provide deterrent but that is the wrong decision separating families as not reflective of American values we\nAnd the family separation fix DACA and secure the border with tears voted to support sanctuary cities she voted to cut eyes she's very dangerous on this issue I mean I make sure we secure our borders Ninety seconds for bottle clues\nAbout Martha shared a lot of information just now that frankly just not accurate the reality is that the Trump Administration made a decision\nTo separate families at the border in an attempt to try and provide deterrent but that is the wrong decision\nSeparating families as not reflective of American values\nWe can both secure our border and keep our country safe and secure\nWithout taking children away from their parents there are ways to do this quite easily by monitoring families and moving them through the process of education more quickly but Martha has chosen to move down a road again very partisan and she says we had to compromise legislation\nI think she means compromise with herself\nBecause there was no bipartisanship and any of this discussion which is incredibly disappointing for Arizona's\nThe reason there was no bipartisanship as because Nancy Pelosi decided that Democrats were not going to join and you think about it President Trump supported this bill and he took a lot of flak from it from both directions\nTrading securing the border closing these loopholes moving towards a merit based immigration system and providing a path to citizenship for DACA I mean that is the definition of a compromise on this issue look most Arizona's agree we got to secure the border and family separation and address these other issues\nAre villas a confidence building measure that was also addressing the very real security issues\nOf the cartels that are trafficking through these communities this is not just hypothetical children has forced random barbed wire up at the international boundary you saw yourself when you went down there was Family Guy to secure the border now was family separation\nImmigration system and providing a path to citizenship for DACA I mean that is the definition of a compromise on this issue look most Arizona's agree we got to secure the border and family separation and address these other issues\nAre deal with a confidence building measure that was also addressing the very real security issues of the cartels that are trafficking through these communities this is not just hypothetical Chilton has forced random barbed wire up at the international boundary you saw yourself when you went down there was Family Guy to secure the border now\nWas family separation as a reporter shows a choice that the president could have made to keep these families together as opposed to what used to use the law where we had no choice\nBut the law on the books is to enforce the law and so he ... the ministry and was put in an untenable situation where you're either enforce the law keep families together I think we can all agree families shouldn't be separated but I think we can also agree we need to enforce the law\nBorder security is national security and the definition of a country is that we control who is coming in and out of our borders\nSo enforcing the law superseded keeping family hunger\nIs needs to fix this Ted it's\nOur job to fix the law and so that's what we've been doing and that's what I'd been leading on and curious and voted no on both these bills that would end family separation the law is the law\nThis is a very big difference of opinion between the two of us Martha has chosen to be an apologist in support anything that her party's leak puts forward whereas I've been ranked the third most independent member of Congress I'm also been ranked the third most bipartisan number of Congress\nAnd it's because I'm willing to stand up against my party to do what's right and when it comes to the issue of border security I worked with Congress and Matt Salmon others in the delegation to increase\nHere's been voted no on both

something I definitely kept hidden when when my grandparents are finally told me I was in the fourth grade and I I'll never forget sitting because they called me up\nIt's something I definitely kept hidden when when my grandparents are finally told me I was in the fourth grade and I I'll never forget sitting leak that they called me into the living room\nAnd I remember thinking oh maybe we are going to go in another family vacation because the last time we had a family meeting they told me we're going to Disney World and it was fantastic [noise]\nAnd my grandfather he sat me down on the couch and he said it's time we tell you the truth about your mother and she's in jail and she's a drug addict and that's that's why she's been gone all the time now that was a fourth grade now she had been gone and in and out since I was two years old\nSo I didn't tell anybody for the longest time I trusted one friend my friend Patrick my best friend I grew up next door to\nAnd I I didn't tell anyone I mean it's when you when you have these addictions and your family is I mean you sort of live this duality you you have this thing that that you should hold back from people and then you you put your best face forward [noise]\nUm you know as I got older sometimes I I Would share stories with people in high school some watch but it wasn't really until I delivered what I call an accidental Ted Talk in two thousand and twelve that I shared this story more widely\n[laughter] you as my grandparents loved me so much and you know despite all of the trauma that I was surrounded by their their love floated me through life and they're just about a decade gone now and I still very much feel that love and I very much keeps me afloat [noise]\nThey were tricky people though you know um they drink quite a bit uh in fact they were\nThey were better when I was young then when my mother was young they they were my grandmother could at times be violently drunk um when she was younger I guess I could sum up my grandmother with this\nHad come home from school\nAnd somebody wrong to me and I tell the story about how this kid wrong me she would take the cigarette out of her mouth and say just tell them to go in their hat [laughter]\nNo at the time I was in\nThird grade and it sounds like such this like Great Depression World War two put down and here I Am in the eighties [laughter]\nAm I going to go back to school [laughter]\nThey were so lovingly crafts though you know they curse around but it was never directed towards me and I remember they want to say like you know we're okay if you cursed but if you ever course at us you are in a significant amount of trouble young men you know\nUm they smoke two packs a day each nah or and my grandfather just be most\nMan you know [noise] um they smoke two packs a day each nah never and my grandfather just be moans this movement of ah having places be non smoking\nYou know airplanes you can't smoke on the plane like to put an inconvenience to the point where said Jesus Christ by the time I die I'm going to get to heaven and they're going to say sorry no smoke\n[laughter] he died of lung cancer die yeah he died from well at eighty one [laughter] any outlive your grandmother by a couple of years there's also a heavy smoker also heavy smoker yeah and I should say to\n'em you know she she died the summer before my wedding and unfortunately she died ah she got on a friday or my wife's wedding shower was that Sunday\nAnd in the months leading up to that you know my fiance at the time Gina now my wife she'd be over and and uh my ... my grandmother was hooked up to oxygen and we always had thought that she just had a bad bladder 'cause she was always excuse herself to go to the bathroom and you know like you know she's smoking\nRight with the oxygen around her and it's oh gosh that's ... ... and we're so lucky the hosts didn't explode\nYeah so do you think your grandparents were different people and they were raising you then when they were raising your mother\nI Know they were I Know that my my my grandmother and my mother did not get along and and I think a part of it was a ... my mother was their second child there first daughter\nAnd I really felt there was a lot of jealous when my mother felt this that there was a lot of jealousy that my grandmother surely had for my mother Leslie because\nThat took Joe's attention away I'm Joe when Leslie always had a tight bond surely and Leslie's relationship was always front ah surely was also drinking\nJoe when Leslie always at a tight bond surely and Leslie's relationship was always front ah surely was also drinking to a lot of them um she should drink quite a bit when I was young but she was never really drunk on weekdays and she was drunk on weekdays quite a bit when my mother was young\nYou know had recurring nightmares as a town about monsters would you describe a nightmare [noise]\nThis recurring dream where I was in the middle of a field and on the outskirts of this field you know where they're just force\nAnd these tall lanky monsters like like almost like naked alien zombies would would slowly come out but if I made eye contact with the monsters they would freeze\nBut the problem was I was surrounded by these monsters\nAnd so while I Would maintain eye contact to freeze one monster the monsters to my back would approach me so I'd have to spin around and make eye contact with those monsters but then of course would free of those other monsters and they would start creeping in every dream ended the same way in which they were just on top of me\nAnd I I vividly remember those dreams and and yes there in there in the book and and those were difficult to draw because um you know you're writing out scenes is one thing I mean you have a series of letters that make up words and makeup sentences\nBut visually they don't look like anything but sketching out this book was difficult because you're facing these fears are facing these these nightmares or you're facing these people once again\nWhen do they stop these nightmares [noise]\nSome time just before high school I imagine I'm ... I remember having them throughout elementary school and it's you know ... the way I went to I went to ... school in Worcester, Massachusetts and back then it was kindergarten through eighth grade choice\nThe route elementary school and it's you know the way I went to I went to ... school in Worcester, Massachusetts and back then it was kindergarten through eighth grade choice at the same same school same building for all those nine years\nYour grandparents later told you that they'd often open up the bedroom door and find your sleeping right outside of it um did you have anybody to talk to these nightmares about\nNo no I don't believe I ever spoke to anyone that any of the trouble is you know my grandparents grew up in the great depression and they they you know it wasn't generation and so they certainly weren't the kind of people who thought you should talk about your problems I mean\nI'm a therapy would've been significantly helpful for me as a kid and and um and I go to therapy now and I'm open about that to help uh you know do stigmatize seeing someone who's talking to somebody\nOr on a professional level um and that's where for me art was such a saving grace because I I did work out some of these issues in my sketchbooks and and in my drawings\nWhen you took art classes and then you're in high school at the list or art museum and your your grandfather paid for these classes 'cause he knew how absorbed you are with your with your drawing\nYou were really proud to tell your teacher that you had read a book about how to draw like marvel comics mhm and your teacher did not have the reaction you expected what did your teacher saying\nHe was the best piece of advice any teacher has ever given me throughout my education and I remember I I brought in this book was so excited you know I thought I was get extra credit I read the whole book\nAnd without missing a beat he wouldn't even let me finish my thought his face turned just had like he just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you learned\nHe just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you learned\nAnd and by that what he meant was that the that particular book really had like okay this is the way if you want to work for marvel this is how you have to drive ... this is how you have to draw muscles [noise] this is how you have to think\nAnd so he as an as a as an educator of the arts and specifically he's teaching comic book classes you know he he would just see these young people are judging their talent based on the kind of comics they were reading\nSo he really helped me realize that a ... a comic doesn't need to be superheroes and it doesn't need to be drawn just the way the artist or drawing them professionally at and in that moment ah and and back then this was the early nineties\nThe thought of being a cartoonist you really figured you'd have to go and work for somebody else and dress somebody else's character\nSo that advice by by Marc Lynch really set me on this path of oh I could do my own thing and somehow carve out a nice little life for me doing just what I Want to do that is a possibility\nAnd he tells you you had your own style and that you should develop that he did that upset and did you learn anything nevertheless [laughter] from the marvel comics books Oh absolutely you know from the how to draw like marvel comics that that was actually useful for you\nIs certainly a there's a lot about gesture so if you're having a character say throw a punch you want to be extreme you know at the the punches like really real back or the punch has been fully blown but not right in the middle so and it definitely had a lot of good points of um [noise]\nYou know framing you're shot you know there's still a lot of value in that book and\nI still have the book um but in regard\n[noise] you know framing you're shot you know there's still a lot of value in that book and\nI still have the book um but in regards to art style I think any sort of how to draw book I think Paige wants to be you know [laughter] real one is just have your own style
