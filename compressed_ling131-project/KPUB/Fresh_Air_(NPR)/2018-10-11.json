D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see off the set you look out the window you see space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had to kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors and for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know it was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to a to give that sense then then the\nThat would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors in for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to ah to give that sense then\nThen the audience is going to feel at the actors are gonna be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be real the shaking will be real even some of the terror will be real the knowledge that will be real and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight sell uh Ryan ... isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it looks real answer that he's really experiencing all of the uh ... Haitian and just physical jostling um all of this yes\nYou know we didn't literally a spin rind in the capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to kneel and ... you know ah [laughter] oh we a ride and I both wanted to try and make it as physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody throw up our question [laughter] not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because he started to uh apparently he started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to\nSay and I like getting ... from we we had to take\nWe had to take a moment no it got us actually all very a a word for a second or his rise the type of actor who really just you know a really\nExperiential as possible get anybody throw up our question [laughter] not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because he started to uh apparently you started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to\nSay what did we ain't getting jostled from where we had to take a we had to take a moment\nNo it got us actually all very a a word for a second or his rise the type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much of it himself as as you can ... so I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and uh you know have you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine but\nI think it's a testament to ride that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting ...\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is the noise I mean you're hearing alarms go off in hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quite at all inside the space caps on a recent lessons and\nSaid can you talk a little bit about that sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about\nYeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was put in space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of ... you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space I'm In juxtaposition with or just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know uh this is an hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of ah making its way up there so something like a like the spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we wanted to kind of\nHow you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space I'm In juxtaposition with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making

making its way up there so something like a\nLike a spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we want it to kind of a try to hit an emotional reality for that are in the sense that we sort of way to augment the sounds you'd actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually reminded audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks a\nLittle groans and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire to just whenever possible remind them that this is\nThis is a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something that are just delivered from the future you know their piece together by robots by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight massive puts together\nA press state meant about the deaths of the men on a flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\nMhm um and so you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space hoping that land on the moon but if they don't just in case they download masses preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release eulogy um didn't get that actually happened\nYeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know you can\nIs right before the moon flight massive puts together\nA press they meant about the

movie holding his is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh uh the actual sort of format in and paper um or that you can uh again that you can find on line and and the wording as is word for word um and it's a really I mean it's it's a\nI actually really love that that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given\nBut in a way to calculate in such a poetic beautiful way the willingness to sacrifice and and this kind of reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speech that says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the at the moon will know that there's some part of another world that is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what the intent of that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time this incredible kind of hope and this sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what

um I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues is just how close to death they uh\nLived their lives and seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots were astronaut you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations that they sometimes have

understand they don't do it for that reason I wouldn't even want to watch the movie\nAnd then he's asked do you think other people should go see the movie and Trump says that's up to them it really is that's up to them I don't want to get into the world of boycotts and then he goes on to talk about Colin Kaepernick and Nike\nOr the controversy about the flag material the movie you know I think it was\nA pretty much exclusively among the people who hadn't seen the film and I have to say I understand very much the emotions of something like that or get aroused I think uh obviously the moon landing was an American achievement\nAnd an incredible one and the flag on the moon was a very important part of that which is why we we show it and we show it several times so to flex standing there

brought into the into the lunar soil and propping up at the flag a we made a choice entirely anesthetic choice not a political one to focus on\nNeal's private moments on the moon ah during that time you know the the movies about the ten years leading up to the lunar landing um and so we only spent about eight minutes on the litter surface we really wanted to\nSpend that time to look at things that people didn't see things people didn't know about so what himself would be seeing as he first kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras even gone down and then after his famous line or his an sort of plan to walk off to the little west grader during which point he is spent time alone\nAway from any cameras a and so that's a part of the moon walk that no one really knows about I didn't know about before researching this\nUm those are the things I think they were really important to us in terms of uh in terms of process of what we show 'em but certainly showcase you not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was a product of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers\nThat was something that was incredibly

that\nThis was music he plays on the way to the moon ah things would you refer and yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah okay\nSo it's it's a less Baxter piece called lunar Rhapsody yup and what I find really interesting about this is that you know this comes under the category about of of a genre that's been described as exotic uh but you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way\nWith all due respect to Neil Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices a therapy and this incredibly like Flora and piano if it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty shocking and having that kind of transcendent experience of like\nBeing on your way to the moon and playing with like really corny [laughter]\n... version of what you know lunar might be it just strikes me as so it just so strange I I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you play music so how did it strike you\nKnow I was a ... you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that his are learned about when learning about Neal I'm a it was actually within the\nExperience of like being on your ... to the moon and praying is like

actually in the rye and himself it stumbled on a you mentioned in Japan since book\nThat Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a so Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracts of music that uh that Neal and some of the other astronaut to play during the course of their mission they played a piece from divorced shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter tune or something I was actually a the ... or listens to together that they loved together when they were young and in love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nOr in space and as I learned someone who was you know or who was a having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kind of unexpectedly play distracted really no one\nListening no end in Mitch control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know time space and and the sort of cause most to uh\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nI think well why don't we hear a a little bit of the record that we've been talking\nWould kinda unexpectedly play distracted really no one\nListening no damage control certainly no one in the world overhearing would have any real can actually do except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that

that that was you know a few years until ... kind of languishing you know life it was sort of you know just\nA a you know [noise]\nI've been trying to get a made for a while and with no success and

and and and went to Ryan and said hey would you be interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and ah by the way I also hear ah you're into musicals you have a musical script and I said oh yeah you like musicals city I Love Gene Kelly and\nWe talked about Gene Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first man but a lot of land\nBut as soon as well and it was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into this\nSo I'm finally what brings you the most joined

author of blurred lines sex power and consent on campus over the course of three years she interviewed a hundred twenty students from twenty universities spoke with nearly eighty administrators and experts and read dozens of case reports\nShe says that while writing the book she witnessed a historic moment when survivors moved from the shadows to the spotlight burst on campus and then nationwide

write in your book that there's a new understanding of what rape and sexual assault means that started on college campuses but with me too movement it's spread beyond campuses\nWhat'd you the Kavanaugh hearings and confirmation tell you about how far that new understanding has spread I guess what I'm asking you is this if if the Republican senators in the Judiciary Committee\nHad gone to college campuses what'd you think some of the things are they would have been told about ... what did take into consideration before voting\nThings that they might not have thought of in part by us the Republicans on judiciary were men a lot of them are older men\nVoting things that they might not have thought of in part by the Republicans on judiciary were men a lot of them are older men if you

would have had a completely different set of questions right because they would have already known what college campuses no about sexual assault which is\nVery few women make it up very few women are

more after a break this is fresh air\nGood afternoon you're listening to fresh air on Arizona Public radio can you know you your source for NPR News and talk it's one Nineteen\n... comes from the citizens cleaned elections commission providing unbiased voter information out to register election dates and deadlines who was on the ballot and where to vote vote informed November six easy clean elections dot Gov for tools and resources\nThis is fresh air and let's get back to my interview with ... other of the new book blurred lines sex power and consent on campus\nSo let's talk about the definition of sexual assault and how that is maybe changing what what was the kind of common understanding of the definition of sexual assault in the three years you were talking to people on college campus\nWhat what was the kind of common understanding of the definition of sexual assault in the three years you were talking to people on college campuses\nThere was a huge shift in the definition of sexual assault from like two thousand and fourteen to Seventeen while I was there and I watched as it happened um many students said to me that they weren't sure if groping\nCounted as sexual assault maybe it has to be penetration 'em\nBy the end of the three years that idea was completely blown up the water 'em and I even had students say to me\nYou know sexual assault is maybe even the way you speak to people the way you abreast on people in speech and make them feel like justice uh like dirty like a sexual objects I mean they were thinking through this idea how far can we actually take this [noise]\nSo um it is there no commonly held understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is now\nI don't think that there's a national understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is I think that um people who are in late into about this issue understand that it doesn't have to include penetration um but I think that\nPart of why good part of the country is in line with Trump on this issue is that we don't have a national definition\n[noise] so um you also say that the definition of consent is being redefined and the slogan used to be no means no but now at the yes means yes what's the difference between no means no and yes means yes\nWell there is a huge difference something like yes means yes is okay into you\nBetween no means no and yes means yes\nWell there's a huge difference something like yes means yes is okay until you get some sort of yes you don't really have permission to touch somebody now\nI guess you know in the college definition could be verbal or it could be um they like to call it acts unmistakable in their meaning which I suppose means I'm mon are grown or pulling off clothes etcetera\nAnd from looking at this and researching it I didn't agree with this at the outset but I came convinced that this is a\nReally good standard for young people and perhaps for older people as well certainly anybody who's\nIn a workplace you might have a crush on somebody else you know you got to ask a question 'cause you could be misinterpreting signals people do that all the time so why were you\nResistance to this yes means yes standard and why did you change your mind\nWell I'm an adult you know I'm In my forties and I know that that's not the way sex usually happens means sex is something that is an ... book and that's kind of energy between people and more exciting in some ways when it's like that\nYou know we see a lot of young people who are having sex with people that they met on dating apps they barely know these people home that's part of the\n... part of the charge but and I I'm not so doctrinaire that I think that you should have to say yes to each escalating base or sexual act which is the way a lot of people think of yes means yes but I Do think that the question is not that big a deal\nWhich is the way a lot of people think of yes means yes but I Do think that a question is not that big a deal I'm In Gen x we had the question you know should I get a condo which was always\nKind of a a question about protection but it was really a permission question I'm there really has to be an extra question ...\nYou read that the strongest argument for affirmative consent for yes means yes is that it frees girls from the cage of socialized politeness when do you mean\nWell one of the complexities of sexual assault is that girls don't always saying no um they certainly don't say it that way no get away from me I'm pushing you away right they say well maybe another time\nUh I don't think I Want to do this tonight until band up\nGiving up um you know some of the most interesting work that's being done now in terms of trying to\nFix this problem is about girls understanding the signals from people who might in Trenton them harm and removing themselves from the room before anything actually happens because people understand once they're in the room it's really hard to get out\nWell you know the thing about yes means yes there's a lot of people say oh that's so awkward to kind of have these like rules like almost like a questionnaire like I authorized huge too like you know take off my shirt or whatever [noise] um but it's equally awkward I think for the woman to be in a place where the man is making all these advances\nAnd you have to say no no no stop no I really mean stop no okay I'll leave no it just put the responsibility on her and it makes it like really awkward and it's not a shared awkward\nIt just put the responsibility on her and it makes it like really awkward and it's not a shared awkwardness it's like one person having the full burden of the awkwardness\nExactly so this is a little dorky okay ... ... it definitely changes things I mean I went to a dance party I like to go out and dance and I\nRecently you know guys try to come up and danced with you and you try to get away and this guy came up and he was about to put his arm around me and then he said is it okay if I put my arm around here and I said no\n[laughter] no I mean why his arm around me and he said oh yeah I get it consent I'm I totally get it I understand I'm Glad I asked was that the first time that happens here\nThat was definitely the first time in fact it up for it to me\nI mean I ... yeah I I didn't\nThink that that men intended me harm but I didn't want his arm around me I had no interest in him and Mary and I'm I was just there with my girlfriends having a good night and dancing so\nI think that's a great thing to have that happen and to have young girls who\nTruly a you know are in night clubs or app dance parties a lot understand like this is my buddy I own at people have to ask permission to touch it\n[noise] my guest is Vanessa ... is author
