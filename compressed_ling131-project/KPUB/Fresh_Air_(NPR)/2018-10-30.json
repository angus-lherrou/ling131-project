about how Bowers views echo the rhetoric of the white nationalist movement and about the threat that this movement pose is my guest ... is a Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter who is the author of a book about that movement titled rising out of hatred and focus is on the story of Derek Black\nDerek father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and created the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nDerek was seen as an Arab parents in the movement but here we now says racist and anti Semitic views when he was in his early twenties\nIn a few minutes we'll hear an excerpt of the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black and ... but first we're going to hear the interview I recorded with Sasha ... this morning ...\nWelcome back to fresh air I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that's bringing back to our program when I heard about the massacre the synagogue I thought about your book\n... black has renounced his white nationalist views but his father Don black is still a white nationalist and still has the website storm front\nHe did not pull a trigger the synagogue and I'm not trying to blame him for that but do you find Don black story relevant to the views that were expressed by the shooter Robert Bowers\nI think you can draw a straight line from dawn views and gone to work in this movement to the views expressed by the shooter um you know not straight line honestly starts with just the ink on the shooters body yet attached to a fourteen eighty eight to white nationalist slogans fourteen refers to a fourteen word\nFor the statement of purpose that is central to what storm frog does about securing a future for the white race and the existence of white children you know and and saying things like I'm here because of a white genocide and I can't stand it\nRace and the existence of white children uh you know in and saying things like I'm here because of a white genocide and I can't stand by and watch my people get get murdered 'em as the shooter in this case did when he was at the synagogue that's exactly the the language and the motivation that exist on storm front and that's\nThe way that they speak about this a quote unquote race war that they believe is under way\nYeah it was a um a Bowers had had said that um\nHe believes the Jews were committing genocide against his people ... genocide is what happened to the Jews in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust do white nationalist believe the Jews are committing genocide\nDoesn't allow for it uh he's he's one of the most popular people on gap Richard Spencer the white nationalist spends a lot of time there have there is a very high representation of white Nash\nDoesn't allow for it he's he's one of the most popular people on gab Richard Spencer the white nationalist spends a lot of time there have there is a very high representation of white nationalist racist ideas on gab yeah and I think the danger of a place like gab um and also the danger of of other social media networks is that\nIt allows for people who already have some of these ideas\nTo sort of cultivate their own reality and that was when he went on gab he saw the messages of only the people that he followed which is essentially one long news feed of confirmation bias and that those are the messages that he was getting he was reading again and again about the care caravan about the invaders about the threat to America and\nSo then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and watch my people get slaughtered and that's because that's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the\nWhite nationalist site storm front to the shooting at synagogue I'm In store front is to say that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the sound your son\nSo so what are you reading on storm front now\nIs some really vile I'm sort of celebration of what happens ah there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero I'm a racial or a A R A N and hold him up in those ways I Would say that the largest reaction on storm front um\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh you know several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on storefronts over over the last decade and and the reaction is mostly that\nWell this probably isn't quite the way to go about it uh he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people\nGo about it uh he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself\nBut our our global with and are Jews who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect that every now and then somebody is going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so have you spoken with either done or guarantee black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular um you know and and I think that he's\nHeartbroken at and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens he feels in small ways Gulf War and he wanders and\nYou know how much of the re messaging that he did it in terms of white nationalism plays into you know incidents like this I'm Derek was central to creating the phrase white genocide and to to popular I think the movement said to then have somebody\nGo into a synagogue and murder eleven people and leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself\nSpread again and again on the radio um for years and you're young life is a I think it's it's haunting\nEliza ... who is the author of the book rising out of hatred about Darren black swimmer white nationalist whose father Don black founded the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm from\nWhen the book was published in September I spoke with Jared black and ... will hear that interview after a

out it's six twenty three pressure continues\n\nThis is fresh air the social media posts and statements made by Robert powers who shot and killed eleven congregants at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement\nWe're going to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Derrick black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we now and seeing those views when he was twenty two he helped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers\nBarracks father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm front\nDerek Black as the subject of the book rising out of hatred by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli sass low who we heard from earlier in the show my interview with black also included sassy though the first question was addressed to Derrick black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than white national not nationalism kind of turned it down to is like it's not that we are better than but we're all better off being separated by by race\nIs like a popular everywhere and white nationalism in so that was his thing\nHe didn't invent it but he was for it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he founded storm front and called it a white nationalist community and\nThe main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he found that storm front and called that a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy is being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that that was a not\nAbout superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody and that that's the that was what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's it's totally irrational I how exactly do you think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nFor a second I've always wanted to know\nThe early people who re branded white supremacy to white nationalism whether they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable or whether they really believed that there was a difference between the white supremacy and white nationalism\nThey really did believe they were not\nDoing bad things to other people that the uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and it may be unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better\nUm the the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not and gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and it made it much more difficult to speak about race when their job was just to\nGive people space to say racist ideas in a more explicit proud a confident way\nInception was everybody is basically all white people are basically racist they're just afraid to express it so let's give them a language and\nSo that way in central is everybody is basically all white people are basically race if they're just afraid to express it to let's give them a language in a safe space\nDo they do like the word racist I think that's a made up insult toward the ... the Clintons to word um\nRatio is racial out all over the years if you look at the language in terms of how\nMany people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist to white power\nTo white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that's complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy\nIs that white nationalism I think effectively identifies a movement of people who are actively\nPursuing an and cause of separating a\nYou know races into into different homeland and white supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is\nSo if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguished movement in the same way because much of much of the country was founded on things that are white supremacist and many of our structures\nAre based on white supremacy so that's the distinction distinction sometimes in the language that I think is still\nEffective and useful for us as we talk about it\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black a former young leader of the white nationalist movement who has since renounced the use and Washington Post reporter Eli ... who wrote a book about black called rising out of hatred we'll hear more after a break and Terry Gross and this is fresh air\nUm\n\n[noise]

was a long process but um immigration was just going to out number white people in all their countries and that that was a threat to all the normal why people who are listening to the radio show or posting in the comments section and the quite unlike\nWhat they were being told they were the aggressors that they were the people were making society worse\nIn back to being attacked ... it's not like all the immigrants are going to take our jobs are they going to speak a foreign language we're not going to understand at an American culture you know when the quote unquote cure you're talking about like genocide like they are going to kill all of us we will no longer exists\nI'm a talking point about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme than it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kids in the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against at every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that the entire ideology the end point to the ideology is built on a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on what you mean you want to separate ...\nOn a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on what you mean you want to separate people have different races into different places like ... percent ... percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that and it raises a nebulous thing that that that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining\nThere was a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never public\nUh and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this is your how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to are we going to do this or that and one of those was how do we go into define who's white because only a white person could be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white and so that was very clear there's no way to save the what's the twenty three and me a definition even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white N's and where something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to as to who is white\nWas that you had a generally be considered visually white by most people in America and you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white person even mean\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black a former white nationalist leader and Washington Post ... ... the author of a

you were pretty isolated from any beliefs outside of your family is racist views um but then you want\nYou had been home schooled so you were pretty isolated from any beliefs outside of your family is racist views\nUm but then you went to college and from the way he describes it in the book it was a pretty liberal college in Florida that were Jewish people there you initially tried to hide your identity and then figured you might as well [noise]\nLet people know a before you were ousted by somebody else you placed a magazine [laughter] you must have publication with an article by you and the gym so that people would find it and realize oh God that's their black\nSo after you kind of out of yourself and after having befriended people who would you know Jewish and gay and who were you know very upset when they found out who you really are um you had Jewish friends who reached out to you\nEven had a girlfriend who ... who didn't initially no was Jewish um what what are some of the things that Jewish friends said to you\nThat made sense to you that you hadn't been exposed to before and you thought maybe there's some legitimacy here\nBut I think it's very interesting that I'm Matthew Stephenson and Moshe Asher with the people who invited me to Matthew ... dinners to the strategy that I think it was very very smart of ...\nAre not talking to me about it ah I went to those dinners for two years and the white nationalism never came up well every this other thing that we were possibly interested in did\nA and I think the Matthew said that the reason for that or was that\nIt would have been a not as effective at allowing me to see him and dinners as people that when my family is talking about something anti Semitic that we're not talking about something after it we're talking about him or talk about his life and this is very\nAs people that when my family is talking about something anti Semitic that we're not talking about something after we're talking about him or die but his life and this is very human and he wanted to demonstrate that and even if nothing else came from it it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about when we were thinking about Jewish people\nAnd effective like actually\nActually meeting Jewish people and having Jewish friends did you see you know\nJewish people in general as being human in a way that you hadn't before\nYeah I think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that\nThe Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism was a little bit loose and nuts and unnecessary\nUh that didn't undermined the firm believer in racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups that are already believe that that oh of course Jewish people or white or so it didn't undermine all of white nationalism but it I think it was actually pretty early where either this is this is crazy we need to stop attacking Jewish people back off\nAddition to being the story of decks transformation I mean I think the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on this campus who invested themselves in trying to affect\nYou know profound change and they did that and a lot of different ways I mean there was a\nCivil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school and sort of cast Derek out and made it clear to him how how awful and how he'd for and how hurtful this ideology was and it was also students like Allison eventually his girlfriend who ah\nWho won one is trust built in a relationship but also armored herself with the facts and sort of like\nPoint by point went through in and\nUh and showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and and then there were also students like Matthew in most Shea\nAnd showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and and then there were also students like Matthew and most Shea\nWho in a remarkable act invited to Derrick over a week after week after week not to build a case against him but to build their relationship hoping that\nJust by spending more and more time with them he would be able to begin seeing pass the stereotypes to the people and to the humanity and and hoping that a relationship in of itself could be transformative\nAnd I think it's important to note that that did not happen quickly and ended they knew the full horror of a lot of the beliefs of this ideology and the things that Derrick had said Matthew in ... in between these dinners would sometimes go back through Derek old messages on the storm front site\nAnd they would see the horrible things that you said about Jews and and ... yeah\nUh Jews warm their way into control over our society Jews must go all Jews Moscow and you're in the white nationalist ideology in like the awful pyramid and beliefs Jews are at the top as enemy number one and because I think white nationalist believe\nThe Jews have

were in your teens\nAre no ambassador for skateboarding\nAnd skateboarding so sensitive to being portrayed in film by outsiders and that's understandable because it's often butchered\nSensitive to being portrayed in film by outsiders and that's understandable because it's often butchered but when I was\nMaybe nine or so skateboarding gave me a real sense of especially more in my early teens gave me a real sense of community outside of my home\nAnd I think a lens that I ended up seeing a lot of life through which is you know taste in music close um treatment of authority and just a sense of perverse closeness I dunno just laid an imprint on me\nSo I'm the group uh skaters who you were friends with our aspired to be friends with what was that culture like\nIt was a lot of different things you know I was always terrible I always wanted to be great I think I still would trade a lot of achievements for certain skateboarding achievements that just I don't think are physically possible for me at this point at thirty four I filmed a lot\nAnd there's a great reward that is true we earned even if it's just for you where are you willing to do that when you wanted to skate\nVery briefly in a time where I think I invited pain but I quickly grew out of inviting physical pain in my life\nAnd more emotional [laughter] good for you [laughter] yeah I'm I'm at my scars on these guys are inside [laughter] ... yeah and just a general recklessness which are related to you and I related to this kid's loneliness and so even though this isn't my story\nI wanted to show someone going through deep pain and a real sense of hope through community even if that community is has deep flaws to it like small mindedness prejudice massage any\nThat for this kid it's still provided something hopeful and perhaps these young men will grow up and and learn some of this stuff would you have a dream of getting on a skateboard now\n[noise] ah yeah I Dream about it every night I honestly\nOf this stuff would you have a dream of getting on a skateboard now\n[noise] ah yeah I Dream about it every night I honestly Terry when I tell you I Would trade a lot in my life to be able to do certain tricks\nRight okay I shouldn't use or dream would you unreality [laughter] ever considered an escape or now I landed a case\nFor it in front of our cast and crew in order just a out of being so exciting exhilarated by everyone skating but be to just prove that this is something that at one point was a massive part of my life\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill and he's just written and directed his first film and it's called mid nineties and as you can tell from our conversation\nIt's set among a group of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties we'll be right back and we'll talk about some of the films he starred in\nAfter the break this is fresh air\nGood afternoon you're listening to fresh air on

is Jonah Hill and he's known for starring in movies like Superbad money ball and the wolf of Wall Street\nI Want to ask you again about all The Simpsons scripts that you wrote when you're a kid did you ever try submitting one of them\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting them\nYou be willing to share a story line or a joke\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting them\nWould you be willing to share a story line or a joke from one of your early ...\nHere's what I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was in a file since a young age and my parents were incredibly ah let's just say how would I put it they encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film\nSo perhaps ignore the content matter if certain so [laughter] but I maybe should have waited to see till I was older so I had seen the godfather to really young age 'cause it's my dad's favorite movie\nAnd I wrote a Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten and then I think is a I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the ... and The Simpsons were clever for a nine year old [laughter]\nWho is who\nMarge was Don Corleone [laughter] because as a nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer so she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the Don\nNo excuse me she's Michael so OK okay barges Michael a grandpa Simpson is is Don he dies right away though so Marge is Michael latest Homer fan\nNo Homer see that would be but that would make margin Homer siblings so even in my nine year old mind I knew that was not going to work so Homer is a\nK [laughter] I like Ike Lewis Diane Keaton like [laughter] where are you going to go legit you know [laughter]\nUh Lenny and Carl homers friends from work were Lenny was Frito\nBut you know [laughter] but uh\nLenny and Carl homers friends from work were when he was afraid to do and Carl was sunny\nAnd I don't know I mean it's not actually clever but for a nine year old I was like wow it's interesting that you have the um fishing or the or or even I guess the wherewithal to know who would be the character equivalent of who tend\nTo think of that story and character in that way and to make connections between things that I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were beyond your age as a kid that your parents let you watch because you love movies so much\nI'll tell you a story that I I find interesting because\nI mean I saw everything I devoured film I continue to I Love it so I'd ran through so many films and I would go to the newsstand and you know your parents take you to the magazine stand when you're a kid and you flip through magazines or if there's a magazine see on the corner and they're out another place or something\nI Would look through the film magazines I was just so interested so I Would ask them often can I see this film can I see this I mean most of the time they say yeah so basically it came down to two films that I wasn't allowed to see [noise]\nUm they said we're so lenient you don't even realize how lucky you are you cannot see kids and you cannot see a clockwork\nOrange well kids is all about kids similar to the kids in your movie\nIt's a seminal movie in my life kids is a huge influence on me as a filmmaker but this film is in the opposite of kids were kids is so beautiful and it's ... and it's the world ending tomorrow burned in the world down and this film mid nineties is all about connection and hope\nEven if it's dysfunctional connection and hope and\nThose are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my\nEven if it's dysfunctional connection and hope and\nThose are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my mission to see both of them right away I think I was eleven or twelve how did you do it\nUm a friend of mine who ice skate boarded with who was older had both cassettes at his house\nAnd I saw kids and I was like I Love skateboarding I Love New York this is about kids skateboarding in New York I completely was too young to understand the AIDS subplot or main plot I guess\nAnd so I completely wasn't affected by that so I was just like this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life it wasn't till I was older that I understood\nThe HIV aids plot Martin of the film couldn't win over my head so I just took wow this is subversive and this is dangerous you know [noise]\nAnd then I saw a clockwork orange and I had to go to my parents like a shell of a child and be like you were right I saw it [laughter] any disturbed and I need to talk to [laughter] it's like\nYou know like a lot they want to do is tell them that I disobeyed them but I was too shook up not to speak to them about what I had seen what shape you also asked about the film\nI think the raping ultra violence was just too of course it was too heavy so so hard to watch as an adult let alone a kid what are your parents say to reassure you\nWell first of all they were like you should listen to us because we're telling you this done it for a reason yeah and then of course didn't for many many years and realize they were trying their best I think\nUltimately it did make me braver as an artist in life because I Do think about that and I think ultimately there's something about me that draws me two\nThings that are difficult and maybe I'm uncomfortable with comfort and I think my acting career says\nTwo things that are difficult and maybe I'm uncomfortable with comfort and I think my acting career says that when I really dissect it as well\nI guess just Jonah Hill he wrote and directed the new film mid nineties about a group of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties we'll

of teen skate boarders in the mid nineties\n[noise] you know it's been interesting to like first see kind of like I'm coming to manhood on screen 'cause she was started in your teens I'm super bad you are right in your early twenties yeah\nAnd and now and like in the past I don't know bunch of years five six seven years you've started playing more dramatic roles\nYou know in films like Wall Street and Moneyball how did you get the word out to film directors that you were interested in making the transition to more dramatic role [noise]\nOh how did you get the word out to film directors and that you are interested in making that transition to more dramatic levels [noise]\nIt's just by choices you know um I had seen the puffy chair which I loved and I reached out to the ... brothers after super bad came out and I was like I Would love to work with you\nAnd they gave me this part and Cyrus which is a film that I Love is that um was a great experience with John she Riley ... told me [noise]\nAnd then in ... and then Bennett Miller was making money ball and Catherine had talked about me to ban it and then then it's off Cyrus and in Kashmir and money ball\nAnd then in the interim or\nI continue to do some comedy films that were funny and fun\nAnd then uh\nI had heard about the wolf of Wall Street and I asked you audition\nAnd um\nI knew that was going to fight to get that part but I and I knew I wanted that part really badly and then when I wanted to write and direct I think I had a lot of opportunities to do that if I wanted to make a mainstream comedy\nUh\nWhen I really thought about it I was like wow things in my life are happening that are intense\nAnd am I going to be happy\nJust doing what is expected of me or what my heart really want so I have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out how to love who I Am and I have to figure out what my voice is as a filmmaker and when I looked to my heroes like Mike Nichols or Barry lemon\nAnd I have to figure out what my voice is as a filmmaker and when I looked to my heroes like Mike Nichols or Barry lemon center people got started on comedy and ended up having great filmmaking careers\nI looked at their first films and a lot of times they came from a really personal place and they weren't just funny they were they felt like life and they felt like all the pain and joy of life\n[noise] why don't we hear a scene from a Wolf of Wall Street which was directed by Martin Scorsese\nWritten by parents winter who was also the show runner for the HBO series Boardwalk Empire\nAnd so this this this is a movie that I'm a based on the story of Jordan Bell Ford who was a corrupt stockbroker who made his fortune in penny stocks schemes and eventually went to jail for\nFor fraud and in this scene Jordan played by Leonard Leonardo DiCaprio is in a diner and he's approached by Donny A's off played by you who eventually becomes a business partner but this is their first meeting um so you start the scene [noise]\nActually see that call around\nWhen you're doing I think we live in a building\nSwell food or for your forceful Israel gives right was it [laughter]\nFor work what is your stockbroker\nJoe trust your view so right [noise] [noise]\nI Do a risk for myself I'm trying to put it together in Mexico\nSo right [noise]\nYeah I Do a red for myself I'm trying to put it together in my car in the same build on just I'm not\nUnderstand how how much money [noise]\nSeventy thousand last month [noise]\nI'm Serious and unfair to [noise] to see how much worse [noise]\nHim for told you something thousand of technically Seventy two thousand [noise]\nYou show me pay stuff for Seventy two thousand dollars on it I quit my job right now and I worked for you [noise]\nNo you're not going to find\nA list and I quit and he quit his job which I thought was a little weird I mean I just met this\nCan tell students out of a business or well the things about him to like is phosphorus and white T life I got to deal with your wife back to the war torn rooms with clear lenses just look more wash\n[laughter] okay so that's the thing that Leonardo DiCaprio and\nMy guess Jonah Hill from the wolf of Wall Street um what did you learn from working with Martin Scorsese on off of Las dream I\nI see so many things I guess the main lesson I learned\nWas that it's okay not to judge your characters to just show their behavior as people and the characters in his films often do really ugly things and you still find humanity and the\nAnd I like\nUgly things and you still find humanity in there and I like how unabashedly an unapologetically he shows human behavior for better or worse\nWhich is something you've tried to do and you're new movie\nWhich is I think something that really speaks to meet in art in general and something I'm going to strive for do if I'm lucky enough to get to make another film and something that I tried to do in mid nineties if we don't want to be back to The Simpsons I mean our kind of\nYou as a terrible father ... Iran it terrible father [laughter] you can't be viewed but he also incidentally loving\nBig hearted person right so you know it's like I guess I'm interested in the gray area okay\nSo this weekend this Saturday you're going to host Saturday Night live November third\nSo I'm going to play an excerpt of a Saturday Night live sketch that you when you hosted in twenty fourteen and it's the sketch that most took me by surprise and when I say me I mean me personally so you played a six year old who's with step mother\nAt a ... hunter restaurant seated at a communal table and you're you're acting like this like six year old insult comic with all the insults directed at your stepmother Dr Debbie Wasserstein has played by Vanessa Bayer and she's trying to make you stop [noise]\nInappropriate inappropriate listening to NPR drive over my nightmares will take place in Syria is very gross [laughter]\nMaybe you don't want to train whistle every once in a while [noise]\nOkay and you say [laughter] I was so shocked and in light of the name check you on that\nOkay and you say [laughter] I was so shocked and in light of the name ... I you know on the show [laughter]\nThere's so many layers to why that is humorous to hear this moment\nOh it's just so funny um I think the idea of a little kid who behaves like an old insult comic the whole thing was like\nHe like an old man but he's still a little kid so the fact that he has to listen to NPR incredibly boring to a kid even though he's so aware to talk about the show with such detail and understanding\nBut that actually that character came about years and years ago I did the first um this'll be my fifth time and I guess I hosted first for super bad so I was probably like twenty three or something [noise] um [noise]\nAnd I was at dinner a few weeks before randomly with with um bill Hader an anti Sandberg and I think a key ... oh Seth Meyers was there and\nA bill Hader and told a story about a go into a Benny ... in his home town and there was a kid who he couldn't tell whether the kid was like six or like forty [laughter]\nWhen the when the chef did his trick the kid leaned back in clapped his one hand against the table almost like Tony Soprano style\nI think I just started doing the kid is if he was like an old Catskills comedian and then that's where when I got there a few weeks later we were like oh we should try that as a sketch and then we ended up doing it a bunch of times\nWell known health thank you so much for coming on the show it's been great to talk with you thank you to Jonah Hill wrote and directed the new film mid nineties after we take a short break marine card in will review a new book about Emmett Till\nJonah Hill wrote and directed the new film mid nineties\nAfter we take a short break marine card and we'll review a new book about Emmett Till a fourteen year old African American who was murdered in Mississippi in Nineteen fifty five the outrage that followed became a catalyst in the civil rights movement this is Russia", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "30"}
