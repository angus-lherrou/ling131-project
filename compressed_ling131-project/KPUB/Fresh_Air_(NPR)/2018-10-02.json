there there are several um stories are obviously many stories at the Washington Post broke that I had a hand in one way or another uh ... obviously working very closely with some terrific an amazing colleagues here\nI think the one that jumps out for for many people as the story a that said that that former national security adviser Mike Flynn had not been honest about his conversation with the Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak\nWe wrote the story saying that he in fact had discussed the lifting of sanctions on Russia in those conversations and then lied about it to the White House or to news organizations including our own and to the American public\nUh and this was the sort of just one of many huge stories that we broke during that time and a couple of others that I was involved and include\nThe revelation that the CIA had reached a secret conclusion that Russia was not just trying to disrupt the election was was was trying to help elect Donald Trump and then later when Trump

conclusion that Russia was not just trying to disrupt the election was was was trying to help elect Donald Trump\nAnd then later when Trump was in office I broke several stories about his rough conversations\nI mean not that part of it felt great um I mean for me I had I had actually known Flynn for\nFor a long time probably a decade or so had interviewed him many times I'm overseas and at the Pentagon and other positions\nAnd always liked him I took no pleasure in his ouster I'm In his his resignation um and what came next for him I mean that didn't that didn't make me happy but at the same time it just the I yeah I mean it was\nAs a reporter there's there is nothing better than to be able to get to the bottom of a complex story that there are so many people who are trying to

this administration at this really highly politically charged time where we're living through\nI'm On the other hand we're things happened that had never happened to me as a reporter um several of us started getting\nCarts ... actual letters in the in the mail or thanks for readers from far away places um notes on on our even on my doorstep at home I Would walk through the neighborhood and

just weighing ... is is worthy of using the word lie or not so you've used the word lie so I Want to ask you about how you decided to use it\nYeah I mean I feel like um it is a difficult decision and we don't we don't throw that word around lightly we um we often get criticized at the post for being\nToo reluctant to use that word and I think that's true to other news organizations as well but at the same time I mean we're here at this moment are you know we have a fact checker at the Washington Post who was documented\nFive thousand or more fall swords from this president since he's taken

career when he would adopt phony persona and call reporters for Forbes on the phone and try to lobby them into inflating his net worth for magazines in magazines annual rankings I mean there is a\nThere is an intense here and I don't have any doubt about that or or real any hesitation when appropriate from using the word lie\n[noise] after Flynn resigned under pressure\nUm you spoke to Devin Nunes has the Republican chair of the house intelligence committee and you say that what he told you was basically the opening of what became an ongoing siege by Trump and his allies to discredit the FBI what did he tell you\nThis is at a time when we're trying to figure out well\nWe now know that Flynn had discuss sanctions would the Russians was basically cutting a deal behind his government's back with Moscow\nAnd not just raised a lots and lots of questions about well who else was in contact with ... with the Kremlin during the campaign if anyone right so we're we're digging by our news

the Trump Organization we already knew about Paul Manafort of course and he says that the FBI has been looking at this and all and it's all a dead trail\nAnd I pressed him because I could not believe that he was saying that there was already abundant evidence of contact you could say that that was incidental and meaningless and harmless but you couldn't say didn't exist but\nHe says it you know when I pressed him not even pizza boy delivery contact\nAnd it just struck me at that time that that was\nSo implausible um that he was you know he was trying to throw sand in our eyes basically ah in

which means that they wouldn't be able to divulge\nAnything to a reporter like you and if you called them and this is an attempt to prevent any kind of damaging information about the Trump Administration from from getting out to the public do you know when somebody you're speaking to has signed a non disclosure agreement\nI Can't say I've ever encountered I'm somebody who has signed such a room and I know that they exist in the White House I Know that they've um tried to offer financial inducement 'em to those will be willing to sign them as they as they leave\nYou and if you called them and this is an attempt to prevent any kind of damaging information about the Trump Administration from from getting out to the public do you know when somebody you're speaking to has signed a non disclosure agreement\nI Can't say I've ever encountered I'm somebody who has signed such agreement I Know that they exist in the White House I Know that they've\nUm tried to offer financial inducement 'em to those will be willing to sign them as they as they leave the administration and move on I'm On a morose it comes to mind um\nNo I I just think that's such a bizarre\nApproach these are these are supposedly public officials\nThey are they are are public servants there or not President Trump's public servants um the idea that anybody would be required to sign\nAny kind of loyalty oath to him personally I'm is just goes against the grain of so many ah principles that it's hard to fathom\nSome people who wanted just credit reports about the Trump Administration that report said expose I'm either you know lies false heads misdeeds say all those stories are relying anonymous sources I'm not going to like trust I'm not going to trust and not an anonymous source [noise]\nUm so what are your own rules what are your guidelines for using an anonymous source and for how to use them and and and also like who knows within the editorial hierarchy at the post who those sources are so they can be confident and do any fact checking that's necessary\nSo that's a great question Terry and it's really been a really important one at this moment because we do depend on anonymous\nSay all those stories relying anonymous sources I'm not going to like trust I'm not going to trust and not having an anonymous source [noise]\nUm so what are your rules what are your guidelines for using an anonymous source and for how to use them and and and also like who knows within the editorial hierarchy at the post who those sources are so they can be confident and do any fact checking that's necessary\nSo that's a great question Terry and it's really really important one\nAt this moment because we do depend on anonymous sources um for a lot of the stories we do and frankly if we weren't able to use anonymous sources\nWe would really be unable I think to give our readers in the world an accurate picture of what's happening in the U.S government inside the Trump Administration inside the CIA or abroad\nAs Bob Woodward says over and over again I Want when we say anonymous source the reporter knows who the source as it's the readers who are kept in the dark about the SARS but it's not like you know ended up leaving yelling you the information\nThat's absolutely right the sources are not anonymous to us\nUm these are sources that um we know who they are um many in many instances their sources we have known for many years and have developed trust in because of how reliably they have given us information\nUm and you know frankly even in that case when we're writing sensitive stories I we talked earlier about the the Mike Flynn story in how we ended up\nHaving nine separate sources there's no magic number nine was not the magic number we had to get to to be able to go forward with the with the publication of that story could have been two or three it's more about the caliber of the sources their their positions and whether they have access

know frankly even in that case when we're writing sensitive stories I we talked earlier about the the Mike Flynn story and how we ended up\nHaving nine separate sources there's no magic number nine was not the magic number we had to get to to be able to go forward with the with the publication of that story could have been two or three it's more about the caliber of the sources their their positions and whether they have access to the information that they are providing\nA how trustworthy are they how much do we know about them inside inside the Washington Post there are lots of conversations at varying levels of specificity about that sourcing so sometimes you might be asked well what is the position of the ... where's the sourcing coming from from the story\nUm who are we talking about here and you can you can basically described their positions in government\nSometimes if it's highly sensitive senior editors are going to want to know\nMore they're going to want you to identify your source and that you know that sometimes can get a that can get touchy depending on the nature of your agreement with sore say or source be\nBut it's something you know ultimately despite you know we we all of these accusations and criticisms that's our reliance on anonymous sourcing\nI mean the the record just sort of holds up the stories that we've written over the past two years attributed mainly to anonymous sources have almost all proven overtime to be accurate I\nMean there might be mistakes at the margins here or there were a news organizations aren't perfect in ... and we do make mistakes but boy we've gotten a lot right um and I know Marty Baron the executive editor at the Washington Post talks frequently about\nYou know the post and other news organizations um are always trying to get it right\nBut at this moment in our history where we are under such attack all the time and accusations of fake news you know they're\nHave almost all proven overtime to be

the executive editor at the Washington Post talks frequently about\nYou know the post and other news organizations um are always trying to get it right\nBut at this moment in our history where we are under such attack all the time and accusations of fake news\nYou know there's extraordinary care given to getting the facts and even the nuance exactly right\nIt it's really it would really be damaging to not just the Post's credibility in my credibility as a journalist but to the broader um journalistic community if whenever we get things wrong there's a lot riding on the media right now in its ability to do its job and do it well and do it right\nLet me try to give me one more example of\nThe reporting environment that we're trying to operate in just how much pressure we're under as reporters how much pressure our sources are under a as well um there came a time this past year when the Justice Department in Congress released the memos that former FBI Director Jim Comey had kept\nEvery time he met with Trump every time he meets with Trump something happens troubles him he goes straight to his computer types up a memo to record what ... what transpired\nOne of those talks about a conversation he had with Trump in the oval office and most of the coverage about that memo focused on their interactions about what Trump wanted him to do in terms of backing away from the

what I'm saying into this phone and he points to the phone on his desk and the oval office\nHe's complaining about stories and he's talking as I read this memo I realize he's talking about me he's talking about the stories that I had written for the post\nCombing is talking about yes I agree with you sometimes it's great to put somebody's head on a pike as an example the Trump goes on a joke about putting\nTrump goes on to put joke about putting were to say he believes reporters should be put in jail or in jokes about how once reporter spends a little time in jail they make a new friend suddenly they're willing to talk\nIt's a really disconcerting moment for anybody in journalism anybody who cares about journalism um but for me it it was just eerie um to to think that he's talking specifically about stories I had written for the Washington Post\nThey're talking about heads on pikes reporters in jail chasing down sources it was it was unnerving it make you afraid\nWell\nLet me let me ... it\nIt made me afraid I ...

best sellers money ball and the big short which were adopted into films and the undoing project\nLewis looks at Trump's government by focusing on three departments energy commerce and agriculture\nIf you're thinking that this is about boring bureaucracy consider that as Lewis points out the government manages a portfolio of risks that no private person or a corporation was ever able to manage ranging from forecasting and warning about hurricanes the national weather service is part of the Commerce Department\nTo preventing the accidental explosions have our own nuclear weapons one of the energy department's many responsibilities\nMany a central positions in the Trump Administration remain unfilled and some of the key positions Lewis says filled by people who are uninformed about what

warning about hurricanes the national weather service is part of the Commerce Department\nTo preventing the accidental explosions have our own nuclear weapons one of the energy department's many responsibilities\nMany essential positions in the Trump Administration remain unfilled and some of the key positions Lewis says uh filled by people who are uninformed about what areas they're supposed to be overseeing well others have conflicts of interest our political views that make them antagonistic toward the department or agency they're leading\nLewis started writing about this in articles published in Vanity Fair Michael Lewis welcome back to ... explain what the fifth risk is\nShort answer is is the risk you fail to imagine it's is while you're worried about what you're worried about is the thing is actually going to come and kill you and the longer answer is what I'm working on this book about the federal government under Trump\nI come to see the federal government as really a portfolio of risks that are being managed\nAnd as I'm wandering around the federal government trying to figure out what these risks are over and over again I what I'm asking people in the Energy Department or the agriculture part or even the White House to name kind of the top risks on the tip of their minds\nAre they all come up with kind of three or four and then they can't think of this so I thought that's the moment where the mind failed to imagine what it needs to imagine\n[noise] since your book is about the federal government under Trump focusing on the energy agriculture and commerce departments why did you name it the fifth risk now that you've explained with a fifth risk means\nAsking people in the Energy Department or the agriculture partner even the White House to name kind of the top ... risks on the tip of their minds are they all come up with kind of three or four and then they can't think of the fifth so I thought that's the moment where the mind fails to imagine what it needs to imagine\n[noise] since your book is about the federal government under Trump focusing on the energy agriculture and commerce departments why did you name it the ... now that you've explained what the fifth risk means\nWhich then apparently caused Trump to think a lot less of him but he you know he is an odd choice he was very odd choice because with that department really needs is someone who's really comfortable with technology\n[noise] well if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book is about the federal

like money ball the big short and the undoing project to all of which have been bestsellers his new book the fifth risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments\nNow among others so much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the Mueller investigation and now to um the Kavanaugh confirmations story\nAnd not as much attention is being paid what's happening on the cabinet level on the department level and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening\nIn the department level like the three departments you write about no agriculture commerce energy that most of us aren't paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on but it's not it never seems to be like the sexiest story\nAnd never will be and that's the problem I mean it's like we're a society of distracted drivers we're not paying attention to the thing that matters most there is this enterprise that is not really surprised the bigger sites\nThe department at all and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening in the department level like the three departments you write about no agriculture commerce energy that most of us aren't paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on\nBut it's not it never seems to be like the sexiest story\nIt never will be and that's the problem I mean it's like where society of distracted drivers we're not paying attention to the thing that matters most\nThere is this enterprise that is not a trivial enterprise the big aside it ... it doesn't function without the government government is is it's been subjected to decades and decades of\nOf abuse and scorn and it's collected rough and this guy has come in with a sledgehammer and is is having at it and nobody's paying much to know he's paying much attention because of slow moving story and this to me you know\nOne aspect of the fifth risk is the go a lot of the risk that the government manages\nAre very long term slow moving risk climate change would be one of them income inequality ... would be another ah cleaning up or you know horrible toxic waste sites that can pollute rivers and\nRuin lives in another they are all kinds of examples of very slow moving problems that are dealt with in a slow way but they require a long term approach\nAnd on top of this enterprise has been has been thrust is very short term attitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration is incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle and\nThe public has gone along with it and that's the that's that's the frightening thing to me\nAnd you see a lot of action happening at the department level that that kind of level of government where things\nMoving problems that are dealt with in a slow way but they require a long term approach\nAnd on top of this enterprise has been has been for us this very short term attitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration is incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle and\nThe public is go along with it and that's the that's that's the frightening thing to me\nAnd you see a lot of action happening at the department level that kind of level of government where things are being done we positions aren't being replaced where people\nAre being appointed who aren't really um appropriate for the position\nAnd people and they're people who have the ability to dismantle critical functions of the government who also have a financial incentive to do so because they have some conflict\nSo let's get back to the Commerce Department which you write about in his death risk atomic bomb includes the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in L. A. Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department Israeli Noah first of all what did you find in the Commerce Department\n[noise] it's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent it's sixty five percent or so of the budget it goes to this one thing you know it eats the Commerce Department and they simply don't National Weather service by the national weather service is a bit and now there was there which is the biggest part of no\n... and how do they get their back in the seventies or Nixon was contemplating a reorganization of government and\nUm he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior at the time came out against the Vietnam War next Nixon got ticked off and just shoved into the Commerce Department is an act of vengeance so it's there it doesn't much matter that it's there except that people\nSixty five percent or so of the budget it goes to this one thing I Know it eats the Commerce Department and this is the national weather service by the national weather service is a bit and now there was services the biggest part of no\n... and how do they get their back in the seventies or Nixon was contemplating a reorganization of government and\nUm he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior at the time came out against the Vietnam War next Nixon got ticked off and just shoved into the Commerce Department is an act of vengeance so it's there it doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there\nAnd it is it's the single most important institution within the Commerce Department a and it does it eats most of the resources and it and what it does\nUm is absolutely critical and er into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nAnd you're talking about Barry Myers who is the C. E. O. N. accuweather I that sounds actually like a good thing he runs a weather Prediction Center okay\nWell I'm\nSo here's the problem ah typically the person who runs NOAA has has a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operation um\nThe problem is that the national weather service uh which has been a ... a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but but but weather prediction has gotten generally\nDramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to be able to give them and I mean ... and just the you know the daily\n... no as a giant science operation um\nThe problem is that the national weather service or which has been a ... a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but but but weather prediction has gotten generally\nDramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to be able to give them an image and just the you know the daily forecast has gotten better\nOr all of that saves lives and property or if that's the mission of the national weather service to save lives and property to do it it has to communicate with the public\nUh it it has to let them is that it has and has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers\nA has been on a two decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather can do it instead\nAnd that's how accuweather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced in Congress to sexually forbid the national weather service from from doing anything but warning in ... right in advance of a a of a weather event that might kill you and the problem with is is that\nWell in the first place is the the the the the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nIs all paid for by the taxpayer I mean these billion dollar satellites that are hovering over us the ah the ... the ... the network of radar stations across the country that the national weather service spends the bulk of its money accumulating the data that and then makes available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so that they can go and you know advertise the weather\nPlace is the the the the the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nIs all paid for by the taxpayer I mean these billion dollar satellites that are hovering over us the uh the ... the ... the network of radar stations across the country that the national weather service spends the bulk of its money accumulating the data that and then makes available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so that they can go and\nYou know advertise the whether there's no real reason why the taxpayer should have to pay for this twice having paid for the date of the national weather service really should be able to give people forecasts but what he's been trying to do is organized is actually a kind of exclusive rights\nTo use that data and make money from it and his argument is that I shouldn't have to compete with the government but it's a very strange argument because the government gives him basically all he needs to do is business for free\nYeah you're saying about the weather satellites weather radar weather balloons oh the high tech stuff that um\nIt no private company that no private company on its own would have the wherewithal to to pay for that it is a naturally or a government operation and so and it's naturally a governor operation to deliver a weather forecast to the public\nSo that mean Myers had been like one vote away from Senate confirmation where does that stand now\nHis nomination is stalled so he's not in the job yet\nMy guest is Michael Lewis his new book is called the fifth risk we'll talk more after a break I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air\n... to deliver a weather forecast to the public\nSo Barry Myers or had been like one vote away from Senate confirmation where does that stand now\nHis nomination is stalled so he's not in the job yet my guest is Michael Lewis his new book is called the fifth risk we'll talk more after a break I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from cancer treatment centers of America working to outsmart cancer for the use of genomic testing to profile each individual's cancer and revealed possible treatment option\nLearned more about precision cancer treatment that Cancer Center dot com\nThat basically represents their point of view so what was the landing team and what was pile tasked with doing\nSo landing team is a grand phrase for what arrived at the department of energy because it was really just pile and he didn't show up until a month after the election\nAnd he would have been in theory tasked with receiving you know hundreds of hours or briefings from people in the department of energy who would prepare them but he what he did instead was met met for about an hour with a couple of people in the secretary's office and listen politely and didn't take notes\nAnd the people who were running the part of energy have the impression that he had no interest in what they had to say\nOne of the things he did um as part of the court landing team will send a list of Seventy four questions he wanted answers to Seventy four questions to the department of energy what were some of the questions\nHe wanted lists of uh names of anybody in the department who attended meetings that were associated with climate change he was trying to identify people who might be hostile to the ...\nAnd didn't take notes and the people who were running the part veggie had the impression that he had no interest in what they had to say\nOne of the things he did um is part of the quote landing team will send a list of Seventy four questions he wanted answers to somebody for questions to the department of energy what were some of the questions\nHe wanted lists of uh names of anybody in the department who attended meetings that were associated with climate change\nHe was trying to identify people who might be hostile to the fossil fuels industry I think so the department didn't actually respond by giving them the list of names but he ... the bigger point was\nHe came in in what were they interpret it as a hostile spirit I'm signaling that the new administration was not did not approve of the various attempts\nThe department of energy was making to wean us from fossil fuels and it is you know part of the department of energy mission to engage in and fund basic research in alternative energy\nSo you know your previous book about the science of of risk and about trying to kind of clout to find a way how the human mind works when it's assessing risk that book was called the undoing project do you feel in a way that your new book could have been called the undoing ... because in some ways\nDepartments and you know in the Trump Administration are getting on ... because there aren't a lot of people to replace the people from the Obama administration yet and some of the people who have been put in positions to run those department are antagonistic toward those departments\n[noise] so yes but there's actually there's actually direct connection between the undoing project my last book and this is what got me into this book in the first place\nA new book could have been called the undoing pocket because in some ways\nDepartments and you know I in the Trump Administration are getting on ... ... there aren't a lot of people to replace the people from the Obama administration yet and some of the people who have been put in positions to run those department are antagonistic toward those department\nSo yes but there's actually there's actually direct connection between the undoing project my last book in this one is what got me into this book in the first place [noise]\nOne of the insights that drops out of the work of the psychologist Dan economist and Amos diversity who are studying the way people judge risk\nIs that when you changed the ... people don't sense it especially with catastrophic risk you take something that ... there's a one in a million chance of it happening\nAnd change it to one in ten thousand people don't feel that and I was thinking of that when Trump came in and approached the federal government the way he did because\nOne way of thinking of the federal government is is this vast portfolio of risks many of them potentially catastrophic risk the risks of a pandemic or a the risk of a a nuclear accident or the risk of a terrorist attack or the you know one after another and many of these\nAre not risk that most people are thinking about the risk that the nuclear waste site in half or Washington leeches plutonium into the Columbia River and poison the whole Pacific Northwest and I thought Trump's approach\nIs effectively taking lots of you know one in a million or one of the ... hundred thousand risks and making them more likely making them all more likely because he's putting people in charge of the risk you don't know anything about it\nAnd I thought this society doesn't feel it it kind of ...\nOne after another and many of these are not risk that most people are thinking about the risk that the nuclear waste site in half or Washington leeches plutonium into the Columbia River and poison the whole Pacific Northwest and I thought Trump's approach\nIs effectively taking lots of you know one in a million or ... hundred thousand risks and making them more likely making them all more likely\nBecause he's putting people in charge of the risk you don't know anything about it and I ... the society doesn't feel it caught him into ... shows you that people don't really feel this and that inside is what got me going in the first place\n[noise] so you used to work on Wall street way back in the day and you wrote about that experience in your first book liars poker last month mocked the tenth anniversary of the financial collapse of two thousand eight the market has more than recovered over that time\nBut some people are starting to say this might be another bubble um\nHow are you interpreting having written a book recently about risk and having you know been having written about the financial crisis what you've done um I'm actually in what your thoughts are about whether we are now in terms of financial stability and\nAnd world markets [noise] well I'm a big question [laughter]\nWhat is the question you're asking me to predict the bad things going to happen next\nWell I I Know that's not really your job but\nNo it's not my job but you know if I ... I Would love to have one outlandish prediction on the record not that I think it's going to happen but like it's a sort of thing that if it does happen I think a lot of people will go oh my God that's exactly where we were headed all\nAssuming Donald Trump remains president for a while\nI think there's at least the possibility\nWell I'm a big question\nWhat is the question I mean you're asking me to predict the bad things going to happen next well I I Know that's not really your job but no it's not my job but you know if I ... I\nWould love to have one ... outlandish prediction on the record not that I think it's going to happen but like it's a sort of thing that if it does happen I think a lot of people will go oh my God that's exactly where we were headed all\nAssuming Donald Trump remains president for a while\nI think there's at least the possibility of the risk that he will try to default on the American debt selectively like he'll say or the Chinese are trying to sell their treasury bonds is causing disruption in the treasury bond market they stole our money in the first place from us we're not going to pay the Chinese back\nThis is a a larger way of saying that\nI think the risk now in the financial system is political risk\nI at the banks are much better capitalized and better regulated and they were ten years ago I don't think there's going to be directly a banking crisis but I think there could be a crisis in faith in the dollar and in us credit worthiness our deficits are exploding\nWe have a president who has a history of defaulting on debt\nHe's riled up lots of emotions hostile emotions to foreigners who hold\nThe debt I'm a ... that wouldn't shocked me and that would trigger a financial crisis a so why would if you treat them by the national as\nBecause the dollar is the world's reserve currency lots and lots of people hold it assuming it's going to be more or less stable\nThey'd be a flight out of the dollar a U.S treasury bonds of the benchmark for a ... of risk a risk was asset in the world would everybody kind of measures themselves off of it's assumed to be you know better than gold\nTo foreigners who hold the debt I'm a ... that wouldn't shocked me and that would trigger a financial crisis a so why would if you treat the wrath of national as well because\nThe dollar is the world's reserve currency lots and lots of people hold it assuming it's going to be more or less stable they'd be a flight out of the dollar a U.S treasury bonds or the benchmark for a ... of risk a risk was asset in the world would everybody kind of measures themselves off of it's assumed to be\nYou know better than gold if that if that is called into question and then treasury bonds are going to collapse in the interest rate which the U.S government can borrow is going to skyrocket\nUm this is the doomsday scenario and just kind of playing with it here but if you asked me to like\n... predict what might trigger a the next financial crisis I think it's I think I Would predict it some sort of political event and it would be that sort of thing and if that happened you know it's fun when you predict things funding sort of predict things where where ...\nWhen they happen they make sense of a lot of things that have happened leading up to it\nAh I think a lot of people would say oh my God we should have seen that coming\n[noise] my guest is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book is about the federal government under
