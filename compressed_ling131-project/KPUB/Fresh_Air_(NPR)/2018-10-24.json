from the rolls if they haven't voted frequently enough in Georgia alone that policy purged an estimated a hundred seven thousand voters according\nTo a new investigation by American Public Media's investigative unit\nAnd twenty Thirteen the Supreme Court struck down the heart of the voting rights act\nBut current ballot initiatives in several states could make it easier in the future to register to vote in those states and to crack down on gerrymandering my guess Ari Berman has been covering developments in voting rights and voting restrictions he's the author of the book give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America\nHe's a senior writer for Mother Jones reporting fellow of the nation Institute and there's also written about voting issues with the New York times magazine and Rolling Stone\nAri Berman welcome back to fresh air before we talk state by state and get into specifics is it a coincidence that there are voters being perjure asked for IDs ideas that many citizens don't have in several states\nIt's not a coincidence and let me just give you the big picture of what's happening with\nVoting rights right now so since the twenty ten election\nTwenty four states have implemented in New restrictions on voting so nearly half the states in the country have tightened their voting laws to do things like require strict forms of photo ID

to vote or to cut back on early voting periods or to close polling places or to purge the voter rolls and many of these restrictions on voting are playing out now and the ... elections in critical states like Georgia\nNorth Dakota Kansas et cetera where there are very close elections\nSo is it a coincidence that all this is happening\nIt's not a coincidence this has really been a major strategy within the Republican Party\nThe modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones we'll talk more about voting rights after this short break this is fresh

[noise]\nBush's continues stone K. and they you know it's six twenty [noise]\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Ari Berman we're talking about voter rights and voter suppression he is the author of the book give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones\nSo we've talked about the current election in Georgia where Brian Kemp the secretary of state is also running for office\nSo let's take a look at Kansas where the secretary of state is also running for office in this instance it's Kris Kobach who's running for governor what are some of the ways in which he's restricted voting rights in Kansas\nNot just any secretary of State Kerry I Would say that Kris Kobach is the most high profile secretary of state in the country and he has really been the leader\nIn the Republican Party when it comes to restricting voting rights this was the guy who was named vice chair of Donald Trump's election integrity commission which was formed in a very high profile way and it shut down before it actually did anything but it requested voter data\nFrom all fifty states which set off a huge fire storm last year Kobach was the guy who told Donald Trump that three million people voted illegally in the twenty sixteen election no legitimate evidence has been put forward by\nWe're Kobach was the guy who told Donald Trump that three million people voted illegally in the twenty sixteen election no legitimate evidence has been put forward by Trump or Kobach to support this than the less Kobach is really the guy who was formed intellectual case for restricting voting and what he's done in Kansas is a few things\nHe wrote a law that was passed by the Kansas Legislature called the safe act\nThat did a few concrete things when it came to restricting voting the first thing it did is that it required proof of citizenship to register to vote meaning that you had to have a a passport or birth certificate or naturalization papers to register to vote\nThis law blocked one in seven cans oh almost thirty five thousand people from registering to vote in that state the federal court actually struck that law down earlier this year and said that there was\nAlmost no evidence of voter fraud in Kansas to justify the potential disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters so so that part of the law has been struck down but another part of the law of voter id law where you have to show government issued id to be able to vote that part of the law remains in effect that I've looked at the numbers in Kansas\nAnd over twelve hundred ballots have been tossed since ... was secretary of state of Kansas because voters showed up at the polls without having the right id\nBut Kobus only won his primary his Republican primary by three hundred and fifty one votes and now he's locked in a very close election with Democrat Laura Kelly\nWho's a member of the state Senate an independent candidate Greg Orman\nAnd even the smallest reduction in turn out to shift the race and co box favor and the government Accountability Office did a study of Kansas voter id law and they found that Kansas voter id law in twenty twelve and it was first in effect\nReduce turnout by two percent in that state with the largest drop off among black votes\nIlan twenty twelve and it was first in effect reduce turnout by two percent in that state with the largest drop off among black voters young voters and first time voters and these are all people that are going to be less likely to support Kobach than the traditional Republican base\nYou say that Kris Kobach was actually the source of President Trump's false claim that millions of people voted illegally and twenty sixteen and if you compensate for all of those illegal votes Trump would have won the popular vote and not Hillary so what is called that do to plant that idea\nKris Kobach met with Donald Trump after the election basically Kobach was a disappointing for a cabinet position he was under consideration to be head of the department of homeland security\nAnd Kobach had to study not a very legitimate study but nonetheless it was a study that he gave Donald Trump that purport to show that three million people had voted illegally in the twenties sixteen election and shortly after this meeting with Kobach\nTrump tweeted that millions of people voted illegally and when I interviewed Kobach for the New York times magazine last year he told me that he was the source of Trump's claim\nAnd showed me this study that purport to show this however when the author of that study who was a professor at Old Dominion university testified in a federal lawsuit challenging Kansas proof of citizenship law\nCalled Buck's own expert disavowed that study and basically said it didn't show anywhere near that three million people voted to legally\nKris Kobach has also been an advocate for a new question to be added to the census and the census might not seem like it's actually a voting issue but it is voting issue Kodak advocated for adding a question about citizenship are you a citizen [noise]\nUm how does that apply to voting\nAdding a question about citizenship are you a citizen [noise] um how does that apply to voting rights\nIt's a huge issue because census data is used to draw voting districts it's used to draw districts for state legislatures it's used to draw districts for the U.S house it's used to determine\nHow many electoral votes each state has so the census was instrumental when it comes to voting and what happened according to court documents\nIs that Steve Bannon at the time of the chief strategist to Donald Trump\nCalled commerce secretary Wilbur Ross who's in charge of running the census and says\nI Want you to talk to Kris Kobach about adding this question about us citizenship to the census and what Kris Kobach toad Ross is he suggested wording for the citizenship question and then he said\nIt's needed because right now in his words illegals or being counted when it comes to representation I I don't want to get to technical here Terry but the the way that districts are drawn is they're based on total population so everyone in a given area is counted\nWhen it comes to drawn a district in deciding what level representation an area should have what Kobach wants to do is restrict those\nDistricts to only counting people who are citizens\nIf you did that areas with lots of non citizens places like Texas and New York and California would have much less representation\nThan places where there's a lot more citizens if Kobach has his way\nDistricts are going to be drawn only based on citizenship what that will mean is that will be a major power shift to Republicans because generally speaking areas of lots of immigrants tend to vote democratic if you exclude them from counting then despite the massive demographic change we're seeing\nPublic ends because generally speaking airs lots of immigrants tend to vote democratic if you exclude them from counting then despite the massive demographic change we're seeing\nThat the districts are gonna become more conservative and this question about us citizenship hasn't been asked on the census since Nineteen fifty and there's a tremendous fear that if it is asked\nLatinos Asian Americans other minorities whether documented or undocumented are going to be afraid to respond to the sense is that the areas where these people live will get fewer political seeds less money less political representation than they otherwise what an affair and accurate census\nSo where does that stand now this question\nRight now there are six different federal lawsuits challenging this question the most high profile lawsuits is being led by New York\nAnd sixty in other states and basically what they're saying is that this question is going to have a major league suppressive effect on people responding to the question that you're going to see how many people are afraid to give their citizenship on the census because they're worried about Donald Trump's immigration policies and they don't want to tell\nDonald Trump what their legal status\nIs and that's going to affect the entire senses and so if the census is unfair consensus is inaccurate and so many things to the census does is going to be unfair and an accurate as well\nMy guest is Ari Berman author of give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and senior reporter at Mother Jones after a break we'll talk more about voting restrictions and ballot measures that may expand voting rights\nAnd we'll look at the Supreme Court with Brett Kavanaugh on the bench and how it would likely respond to cases pertaining to voter suppression in voting rights\nI'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air\n\nI'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air\n[noise]\nThen you know our family foundation supports WHYY

initiative the one that could affect the most people is in Florida\nWhere they have a ballot initiative\nThat would restore voting rights to ex felons so Florida is one of only four states that prevents ex felons from voting meaning even after you've served your time you've paid your debt to society\nYou have to wait five to seven years in Florida\nTo appeal to have your voting rights restored by the governor and his executive clemency board and this current governor Rick Scott in Florida has restored voting rights to almost nobody you have a situation in Florida where one point six million\nEx felons can felt that the staggering number what that means is that one in ten people in Florida\nIncluding one in five African Americans in the state can't vote because they have a felony\nConvictions so ten percent of people in the most important swing state in the country that has routinely decided presidential elections aren't able to participate in aren't able to vote in twenty Eighteen and this ballot initiative would restore voting rights to up to one point four million people in Florida\nThat would be the largest in franchise meant of new voters since the passage of the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five so despite all the suppression we're seeing in Georgia North Dakota and Kansas and other states Florida has a chance to give their rights\nSixty five so despite all the suppression we're seeing in Georgia North Dakota and Kansas and other states Florida has a chance to give the right to vote back to more people than at any time since the Nineteen sixties and and that's the good news that help doesn't get drowned out by all the bad news\nSo Rick Scott the governor of Florida who you described as the chief enforcer of the felon disenfranchisement law he's running for Senate against three term incumbent amounts and he\nIs and so here you have a situation where the architect of a policy that has disenfranchised one point six million ex felons in Florida\nIs running for office and the people disenfranchised by Rick Scott aren't able to vote against him and previous governors and Florida have restored voting rights to many more people than Scott has Jeb Bush the governor of Florida restored voting rights to Seventy seven thousand ex felons\nCharlie Crist Jeb Bush's successor restore voting rights to a hundred and fifty five thousand ex felons in Florida Rick Scott has only\nRestored voting rights to three thousand people in Florida during his eight years as governor so he has implemented this felon disenfranchisement law in the most restrictive way possible and it's not just his race Florida could also elect\nThe first black governor in their states history Andrew Gillum but you have a situation where five hundred thousand half a million\nDisenfranchised African Americans aren't able to vote potentially to elect the state's first black governor\n[noise] so\nIn the past there have certainly been a lot of voting related court decisions that have been appealed as high as a Supreme Court the Supreme Court now has added Brett Kavanaugh not to the bench what's his position on voting rights [noise] he has from the ...\nNow has added Brett Kavanaugh not to the bench what his position on voting rights [noise] he\nHas from the cases we've seen a pretty alarming record on voting rights he\nUpheld a voter id law from South Carolina and twenty twelve that the Obama administration had opposed and said could disenfranchise tens of thousands of minority voters in that state but Calvin I wrote the majority opinion upholding this law\nAnd he basically said that even if there was no evidence of voter fraud that states could enact new restrictions on voting and that sets a very broad precedent for Republican controlled states like Georgia like North Dakota like Kansas to enact\nNew restrictions on voting and even if there is no evidence of the kind of fraud that they are purporting to crack down on they can uphold these measures as legal ... even if they just say that they are intended to in ... words or promote the integrity of the election and so he is going to be joining\nA very conservative court already this was the same Supreme Court remember and Terry and twenty Thirteen that got at the heart of the voting rights act\nAnd he is going to be less open to potentially striking down these restrictions than his predecessor Anthony Kennedy who was already pretty conservative on these issues was and so now we're facing\nThe most conservative court on civil rights issues since the Jim Crow era and there is a tremendous amount of fear that Brett Kavanaugh is going to give a green light to the kind of voter suppression efforts that we're seeing playing out in the ... election right now\nThe chief justice John Roberts is now considered to be the swing vote in the court with his record on voting rights [noise]\nAmazing to me that Roberts is now considered the swing vote on the court when he has really been\nAnd the court with his record on voting rights [noise]\nIt's amazing to me that Roberts is now considered the swing vote on the court when he has really been the most aggressive advocate on the court\nFor limiting voting rights and this goes back many years when John Roberts was a young lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department all the way back in the Nineteen eighties he led efforts\nTo weaken the voting rights act that was a key part of his portfolio and then when he joined the Supreme Court he authored the twenty Thirteen decision that gutted the heart of the voting rights act\nAnd ruled that those states the longest histories of discrimination no longer needed to prove their voting changes with the federal government Roberts mocks the idea\nThat voting discrimination was still widespread or pervasive in his words and in fact everything that we're seeing right now which seemed to contradict that the fact that there are so many new barriers to voting\nBoth in states that were covered by the voting rights act places like Texas and Georgia or and says that weren't covered by this one provision of the voting rights act like Kansas the fact that there is such widespread\nVoting discrimination that we're seeing right now what seemed to argue not just for keeping the voting rights act intact\nBut if anything strengthening it to have more protections against voting discrimination but instead the Supreme Court did the opposite and voting rights advocates are extremely worried that all of these new restrictions on voting when they go before the Supreme Court are basically going to be upheld\nThe argument for voting restrictions is fraud that you have to do this to prevent fraud if you look nationally and voting fry how pervasive hasn't done\nStudy shows that voter fraud is a very small problem in American elections not non existent\nEvery study shows that voter fraud is a very small problem in American elections not non existent\nBut incredibly rare that from two thousand to twenty fourteen according to one study there were only thirty one cases of voter impersonation out of one billion votes cast\nSo even in states where there are no voter ID laws like New York where I live it's very difficult to commit fraud in New York but we do is we sign our names at the polling station and they have to check\nThat the signature on file matches the signature that were signing when we go to vote well if I Want it to commit voter fraud in New York in a state with out of voter id law I Would have to find a voter I Would have to know what their addresses I'd have to know what their signature looks like I Would have to know that they hadn't voted already\nAnd I would be facing potentially five years in jail a felony conviction a tremendous fine\nAnd I would only be shifting one extra vote after all of that so it doesn't mean that voter fraud never occurs but the penalties for voter fraud are already very high the mechanisms that we\nHave in place already deter people from doing it if you try to commit fraud you're most likely to get caught and then you're are only shifting a very small number of votes one vote usually most\nAnd so what I see based on the data is that the number of people prevented from voting by restrictions on voting is exponentially larger than the cases of voter fraud or see\nWell let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is journalist Ari Berman he's the author of the book give us the ballot modern struggle for

go to snow is going to go on and everybody you know what do you think about I don't know if you're not in the [laughter] you don't know what\nIs one of the migraine and one is dumb I gave\nThem and I think that for me acting is just a bit more lonely because you do so much of the work on your own and then you arrive kind of hopefully full so speaking and then you're with your scene partners in your director and but\nDirecting is I'm\nSo collaborative it's more like\nYou know playing in an orchestra or something and maybe you're you're one of the ... you know you're the leader maybe I don't mean that arrogant latest mean that's the that's the job you're dumb\nAnd honestly one of the hard things for me was that I didn't have any alone time 'cause I'm quite used to that somebody is\nAlways asking you a question somebody you up to make a million decisions that day\nBut I loved that feeling of collaboration with every little bit of the crew and sort of just helping to create like a space where we could all kind of go to work together and you're almost like parenting like you're just trying to get the best out of every body and I've found that really gratifying\nIf you're just joining

small port town in Southern California turn of the twentieth century\nUm during the early days when they're discovering that there's oil there\nAnd um there's an oil man played by Daniel Day Lewis is a bit of a con man and also ugh incredible capitalistic comes to town and wants to\nGet as much of the oil there as possible you want some money from oil and you and he become antagonists and in in one scene scene Oregon here\nHe's basically told by one landowner that he'll sign over the oil rights to Daniel Day Lewis if Daniel Day Lewis agrees to be baptized by you\nAnd your makeshift church mhm so this is a scene where you're ... him and I should just say parent that ugly\nTies by you\nAnd your makeshift church mhm so this is the scene where you're baptize ing him and I should just say parenthetically that the Daniel Day Lewis character earlier in the film he's taken in a boy whose father was in was killed in a mining accident\nAnd then when the boy goes deaf as a result of another ah oil accident I'm Daniel Day Lewis sends him away to school\nOkay so here's the scene with my guest Paul day now and Daniel Day Lewis\nWe should honor with us here well wishes for celebration\nGame

the devil slapping the devil out of Daniel Day Lewis a\nAlso getting even with Daniel Day Lewis was beating them up earlier in in the film that that is seen as almost like this incredible operatic do wet did you think of it that way when you're making it [noise]\nIt was sort of intense just to hear that you know that it's time for me\nI I'm I was sort of cast the last minute mess and I started about four days after I was cast the most part\nWere initially cast as the preachers brother\nYeah and then they moved you to be\nAsked in this part you initially cast as the preachers brother\nYeah and then they moved to be yeah the the teen preacher is that why does do characters became became twins are they not ... ... and they were they were just brother brother and you know that you were playing both of us so they saw something in you where they wanted you to play the bigger\nPart yeah I said I suppose so but you know one while itself I mean sort of sort of why it was going back there is is just listening to that clip you know it gave me I'm a feeling which was I just remember that the two days before I started\nSpending went up to sun down in that church alone um you know he lives church and\nThat was a really sort of um\nBeautiful couple of days just sort of trying to learn the script and make contact with the the the the character and in in in this empty church or I don't know why that is when I went back to\nIt was your idea to to live on your part well sitting in the church\nWhen I was just suddenly on location and I was like what okay how one day one is Monday and [noise] okay I'm going to go to the church and learn like seems um [noise] it's funny 'cause that clip to quite a long scenes so that was a sort of seeing the film for all all day long and uh\nI Believe our first set up was probably be some kind of wider let me some kind of master shot and uh I I slapped Daniel as you said in the end towards the end of the scene and I think we were supposed to once we get that part just stop you know because what we're gonna be shooting his all day and\nAnd I remember ah the first take forgetting and just slapping him many times and as soon as we cut I remembered that I was supposed to stop and I went oh God um and I think I'd ...

I think there were things that I was aware of that I felt like I don't know if that's the healthiest um\nMoney celebrity exactly above all exactly yeah\nI think I always needed the other part of my life which we which we don't often talk about 'cause it's not what we can somebody's interested in but like\nFriends and music or like basketball you know like that that's an important balance point you know to to who I Am so I just didn't want to be around all actors at the simplest way to put it 'cause I was already a big part of my life so [noise] um I went to college is an English major\nBasically to kind of double check like hey let's let's make sure that you're just you know the the the trains already moving I Need is you know I could get off so to speak um I'd already done a film called the LIE when I was sixteen\nIt did well for an independent film I was lucky to have an agent you know and and to sort of have a one little foot in the door\nBut I needed to know\nThat it was me and my choice a sort of studying something else being a diluted poet for a moment or you know reading the great Russian novels or whatever kind of helped me you know go okay you know what actually I miss [laughter] you know that and I like it and I want to do it and and frankly\nIt was getting the part in a film called the balance of Jack and rose when I was Eighteen we someone when I was Nineteen that Daniel Day Lewis was in and\nIt was getting the part in a phone call the balance of Jack and rose [noise]\nWhen I was Eighteen we saw when I was thinking that Daniel Day Lewis was in and that was the first time on film I got to play a character that was not my ... like myself so to speak ... I just done a couple of parts or when I was like a dorky glasses which I you know ... ... am in real life and I felt like I don't that's not\nActing to me like I don't want to just be a version of myself and I was worried because I didn't know yet that you had a choice to say yes or no part in getting\nSomebody believing in me to play this part and ... maybe go oh I can be an actor like this is what I Want\nTo I was reading an interview with your partner ... than and congratulations you both have a little baby now [laughter] [noise]\nUm and and she was comparing some of the gender differences between her world is an address in your world as an actor so she said nine times out of ten in a rural she has to cry and that you rarely have to cry and that once in a dish and she had to have a gun and be tough\nAnd you've had a lot of additions that have been involved in guns are being tough you ever like I'm frustrated with the number of movies involving like guns and and and violence and\n[noise] well yeah I Am personally you know even as a viewer and I've always myself chosen to look at it like\nThe ... part of it so yeah like a film like prisoners has violence right but I think that there's a sense of morality I actually think it's conflicted you know your lead character is responding in a violent way and I don't think it's looked upon\nYou know with shiny eyes um that's I think maybe it's okay you know I Hope I'm not just justifying it but I mean I Try to look at things and go with the cost of this you know twelve years a slave there's a lot of violence but this is you know a story that that has a value and and also frankly\nThe cost of this you know twelve years a slave there's a lot of violence but this is you know a story that that has a value and and also frankly like actually a little squeamish even though I Do a lot of dark material emotionally\nI um I don't respond well to to to just pilots for violence sake you know that's not my um\nSo what does make you squeamish will blood actually and I think the older I get the worse it is actually it's not like something where you become more it it actually becomes more on easy for me especially now being a parent right like seeing the first breath of life taken\nAnd to watch life expire so easily again and again you know on screen I Do think entertainment's okay though and and I just think it's about how people handle it right\nSo you know your your partner so we can then ... a couple of months ago um that's messy [laughter] well you squeamish about\nWell I thought I Would be and I wasn't I loved it I thought it was incredible\nI mean though he was just hard work yeah and\nUh I thought it was\nPitino it's been great to talk with you thank you so much and congratulations singing is I don't think you\nProbably know co wrote and directed the new film adaptation of the Richard Ford novel wild life\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "24"}
