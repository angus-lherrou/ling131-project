Gross\nAnd on line and can you know you dot org\nThis is fresh air I'm Terry Gross when Leonard Cohen died two years ago at the age of eighty two he left behind many unpublished poems and lyrics some of his final poems lyrics notebook injuries and drawings are collected in the new book the flame his son my guest Adam Cohen wrote the forward\nAnd I'm also produced the album his father recorded shortly before his death called you want a darker\nAnd him as a singer and songwriter who's album like a man when gold and Canada and twenty twelve he was born in Montreal in Nineteen Seventy two and I'm going to talk with us about Leonard Cohen as a writer performer and father and tell us about working closely with his father in the final year of his life\nLeonard Cohen is lyrics have adept few songwriters have achieved reflecting reverence and despair ... beauty and his knowledge of broken this lyrics informed by his Judaism his practice of Zen Buddhism and has dealt\nSome of his many well known songs include Suzanne so long Marianne famous blue raincoat Chelsea hotel number two everybody knows power of song I'm your man and of course his best known most frequently recorded and performed song hallelujah\nAdam Cohen welcome to fresh air I just want to start by saying I Love your father's music I left his writing\nAnd I feel privileged to have had the chance to hear him in concert and to talk with him on our show and I'm grateful for the chance to talk with you today so thank you for being here when I interviewed her father and two thousand six after the publication of a book of his poems and songs\nHe asked to read a poem that he'd just written that hadn't yet been published but it's now published in his new book the flame so I thought it would be a perfect way to start with your father's reading of at home a street or from or\nBut it's now published in his new book the plane was I thought it would be a perfect way to start with your father's reading of that home a street or from our teeth ethnic interview\nI used to be your favorite drunk good for one more laugh\nThen we both ran out of luck and lock was all we had\nYou put on the uniform to fight the civil war I tried to join but no one like the side I'm fighting for so let's drink too when it's over and the strength to when we meet\nAll be waiting on this corner where they are used to be a street\nIt was and all that easy when you up and walked away\nBut all the way that little story for another rainy day I Know your burdens happy as you will it through the night the guru says it's empty but that doesn't mean it's light\nMaybe the more interesting things certainly to me would be to to just say that\nWe were writing some kind of mysterious wind and the grace of the occasion there was an urgency to the entire\nMission and of course it had to do with a serious health issues he was a mobilized you had a multiple compression fractures of his spine and it involves an incredible monastic effort on his part to [noise]\nTo be present and to deliver the way he did but\nThere's something about his work in general not just on the last to help them but in this book and in general he he invites you into your own inner life because he takes the inner life seriously\nHe's not like one of these contemporaries I won't mention any names but there are many wonderful contemporaries of his who have in my estimation become misspell jacks ... because there's somehow they succumb to the temptation of going back into their older catalog\nAnd their regurgitate ing things whereas this man was speaking from the very wrong that he found himself at in life\nLet me re introduce you if you're just joining us my guest is Adam Cohen and he's the son of Leonard Cohen and now there's a new collection of Leonard cons final ... homes no injuries and drawings and these are all collected in the new book the flame and\nAdam Cohen wrote the introduction to that and they take a short break and then we'll be right back this is fresh yeah good afternoon\nAdam Cohen wrote the introduction to it we're going to take a short break and then we'll be right back this is fresh air\nGood afternoon

final homes lyrics and drawings and notebook entries previously unpublished and it's called the flame and Adam wrote the introduction to it\nI'm going to ask you to read a poem that's published in the new collection in the past you miss collection of Leonard ... works I'm so is there is something that you could choose that would be relevant to what we're talking about now\nYou know what I don't want to read this problems\nI think that I think in some way or another if we could urge people to um to consult to work with smaller samples or otherwise it takes a kind of ... breed a stone that I think he would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it\n[noise] um\nWondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his songs or read his homes there was this really dark quality but there was this like kind of existential distance from it at the same time and it transcend than quality as well that made for\nIt's like kind of existential distance from it at the same time and it transcend than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is troubling you by the idea of you you reading poems yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality who is expressing at the same time\nAnd that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which he talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that ah that this is\nThis is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nI appreciate you saying that as a son but as a fan of your father's work I Will say that he performed his work in concert to large crowds of people\nAnd there are so many performers who have performed his songs so they have and that that have his work has a life outside of his mouth and him and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room\nQuietly reading his poems so I've always wanted to I Want to get on the record an essay what I\nKnow and I'll go one step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe they're contradictory in a sense I mean this was a man who's put the word hallelujah\nOn many millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men or that of course when it's attached to song uh it's supposed to lift and uh and exist away songs of always existed I just mean that there's something about\nReading poetry\nAnd uh and exist away songs have always existed I just mean that there's something about\nReading the poetry\nThat I'm feels instructional or a has a kind of rigor to it I'm of a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of\nPeople quietly thumbing through this book in absorbing in as I say really taking the time with the jewels that are embedded in every line taking their own time\nNot with my meter now with my voice\nWell since you've declined to read more pounds that you find that I'm going to find out I'm not being ... can tankers or intransigent\nNow it's just it's a it's I'd I'd be lying if I didn't say it was a little disappointing but I I can I can live with that so I thought I'd play your father reading another another problem with his\nFrom the interview that we recorded in two thousand six and this is a poem called titles and it was published in a book that he did in two thousand six of 'em homes in their ex so this is Leonard Cohen recorded in two thousand six on fresh air\nI had the title poet and maybe I was one for a while also the title singer was kindly according to me even though I could barely cardio June\nFor many years I was known as a month I shaved my head in war robes and got up very early I hated everyone but I acted

connection of your father writing in solitude and the reader re reading alone in as entering his [laughter] entering his solitude yeah as\nYou noted also a kind of humor you know I remember I Love one of his lines where he says uh feel so good not to love you like I did it's like the tour away my blindfolded and said we're going to let this prisoner live [laughter] that that was hilarious\nMy guest

to some of your father's most famous songs are already written and recorded by the time you were born Suzanne someone Marion here that's nowhere to say goodbye burning a wire Chelsea hotel who by fire I'm so did you hear about you do if you didn't need me [laughter]\nDid you hear a lot when you were growing up I mean it's like when I was growing up I thought about songs and singers but I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like\nA lot when you were growing up I mean it's like when I was growing up I thought about songs and singers but I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like\nWhat's the sun and who's singing it ... um but but you are you at your father was a song writer seem nice to have had an awareness that sign writing was a craft that something people actually did and the ... like grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them anyway you\nKnow of course I heard them you know I I was a five year old uh on the side of stages watching them being performed a far looking at it into the looking at it the faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the melodies and then as I grew older there was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language\nAnd um\n[noise] then you grow older and then you then you sort of see I remember um I remember I myself I was making a record at the time and I'd scripted and I asked my father for council is a dead you know meet me me me I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain\nWhen we were sitting on the corner Wilshire and ... and I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record and\nWas expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stop continue refining but instead he turned to me and said\nAnd scrap you record that's an amateur move sit amateur move he said yeah it's not about\nHow you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel\nAnd\nAt that moment I realized that um\nHow the songs make them feel\nAnd\nAt that moment I realized that um the la vida always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but it was also about their intention out he was holding up this baton that\nHe had been given\nBy the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and [noise] and something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that uh that baton off the ground\n[noise] were you when you have parents separated um five six and ... the don't remember how much did you get to see a father after that\nI'm In a relationship now and the imperfections of\nA union between two people ... has been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father was able to stay in his children's life\nDespite those complications and then some a was a remarkable is remarkable to me um I my mother moved my sister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from him at all but just to follow our own whims\nAnd uh my father you know would often even\nPark a caravan I'm at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he he's always been part of our lives\nVeto he's he always maintained a role um in in our life despite my parents' separation\n... like a mobile home [noise]\nOh yeah the like what do you call those like a like a jet stream kind of thing mhm yeah I remember my mother moved my sister\nThe liquid you call those like a like a jet stream kind of thing\nMhm okay yeah I remember my mother\nMoved my sister and I all the way to south of France where we live to\nAnd there's a long dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type things they put it to the tea where the road and met the dirt road and he just lived there [laughter] my mother didn't want him on the property so uh you know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead in his care of in\nHow long have you got that far\nWell he did that and variations of that throughout my entire life and and you know as I say the the the intent to be part of his children's live um the deliberate this with which he\nContorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was present in our lives was ... feet\nThere's something really terrible that happened to you and then it in its own way as maybe responsible for the revival of his career and for for\nUm his reconnection to people um I ... around the world and that's that um he had an accountant or a business manager who like drain\nYour father savings and sold the publishing rights to your father son that's kinda like stealing his soul to sell all the publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transgression um and like I think your sister who discovered that had happened like if I didn't even know [noise]\n\nYeah you know\nHe often joked it is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with a song and poetry um in incredible\nThat [laughter] that with the canon of his work with his divorce\nThe economic woes with song and poetry um in incredible that [laughter]\nThat with the canon of his work with his devotion to black eating pages and melody that that he built the life he built himself\nAnd um when he experienced this uh this episode that you're referring to it actually did compel him back out of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um\nEpisode of his life which was to to discover that all this time ... made the heart grow fonder who knew\nHe'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and and others you know would quote him and um but it didn't result in the kind of mass appeal\nAnd lo and behold from this economic crisis arose this most unexpected in\nFestive of periods in his life I was a festive I mean it was incredible to see the um\nThe amount of universities to suddenly started\nTeaching is works I'm studying is works or even read the whole rabbinical clan adopting his lyrics as liturgy um Madison Square garden in the ... to you know twenty thousand cedars suddenly being feel they have never sold more than six thousand tickets\nSo thank goodness for that economic crisis\nSo did he ever get the song writes back she has no it really yeah
