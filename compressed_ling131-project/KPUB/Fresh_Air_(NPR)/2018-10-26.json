practices were exposed in an FBI investigation which led to a sprawling indictment that rocked the basketball world last year\nIn the first of three trials in the case the federal jury yesterday convicted three men of conspiring to use cash payments to recruit players to college basketball programs including the University of Louisville it's legendary coach Rick Pitino wasn't charged but the scandal cost him his job\nHe's one of the subjects of ... new book the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball I spoke to suck a lot of yesterday when the jury in the case was still deliberating\nWell my ... welcome back to fresh air you know any enterprise that generates large sums of money can be beset by corruption how much money does college basketball generate\nWell billions I mean it really depends on how you calculate it directly to the universities and to the NC double a\nBillions but if you figure in the gambling money and money that's generated by recruiting sites in all these crazy ways you know you're getting into the four or five or six billion dollars a year\nRight and where does the money go\nThe money largely goes to the adults who run the games very little of it goes to the players or the players get the value of their scholarships so if you look at a program like Louisville which is program that I focused on they generate about forty five\nWhoever their scholarships so if you look at a program like Louisville which has program that I focused on\nThey generate about forty five million dollars a year in revenue they give out the thirteenth scholarships that adds up to about four hundred thousand dollars a year the rest of it gets spread out to the coach who makes eight million dollars a year\nJust the assistant coaches who make as much as a half million dollars a year all throughout the athletic department people are making six figure salaries it does not go to the players and what I call the unpaid workforce\nA thousand or more pliers a couple of hundred college coaches and they're playing in gyms all over Los Vegas some of them are staying on the strip and they are being scout

they are trying to get their hooks into kids and get their hooks into families\nAnd get into their inner circles and then to see what's in it for me can I deal this kid to a particular college can I

Thirteen fourteen kind of become celebrities kind of think of themselves as a business\nAbsolutely there are there are kids who you know this is their life and one of the things that really struck me

college end of this it's the assistant coaches who are really involved in recruiting explain what they do how they're paid\nThe assistant college coaches are the sort of ones who first to make contact with a young player and his family\nThey fly all over the country and there's a lot of pressure on assistant coaches that used to be an assistant college coach was a coach first he taught the game he mentored the young men\nA lot of them now if not most of them are recruiters first and they are charged with bringing the head coach the best players it's sometimes set in college basketball but you win in July and that means you win games by getting the best\nIt's sometimes set in college basketball but you win in July and that means you win games by getting the best players from the tournaments the grass roots tournaments in July in Las Vegas in elsewhere but the assistant coaches that's their job get me kids\nThe thinking in\nThe industry and among journalists and many who follow this world is that many of the head coach of say just get me players don't tell me how you did it just bringing them to me there are things I don't want to know\nThese assistant coaches jobs are very well paid they're hard to get their hard to keep their hard to get back into business if you lose the job the temptation to cheat is extreme\nBut she had these kids that are kind of showing their stuff in this amateur basketball kind of network and the street runners sort of pre agents that build relationships and hope to steer them to universities assistant coaches who want to make connections there and the federal government has charged in this case that we're seeing money flowing\nAmong these parties to help to lure kids to universities there is another really creepy part of the story which took me awhile to get which is the street runners not just using you know incentive to get kids to colleges\nBut in some cases paying the assistant college coaches to steer their players already in college to a certain financial advisor at the St runner has a relationship with what's going on there\nThat's exactly right and I and I think that's the most insidious part of this so in the federal government's case there have been several assistant coaches charged with\nPart of this so in the federal government's case there have been several assistant coaches charged with taking bribes from these runners or go betweens\nOn the grass roots circuit and the intent of the bribe is to say okay you already have this player he's headed to the pros send them to me I Want to manage his money when he becomes a pro you know put him in my lap [noise]\nAll right so if you're a financial advisor at ... this is what you do and you managed to have ... in some way or another and get an NBA player as your client what's it worth to you\nAnd NBA player over the course of a ten year career can easily make a hundred million dollars or more so if you're an agent and get two or three percent of that salary that adds up to a lot if you have five or ten of those players that\nAdds up to a whole lot if you were quote managing the money of one of these players\nI don't know what that might add up to if you're doing it legitimately um you're getting what a money manager might make there's a lot you're dealing in tens of millions of dollars\nIf I were a future NBA player or I were the family of a future NBA player I don't think that I Would necessarily send my kid to somebody who specializes in managing the money of sports stars\nBut there is an ecosystem of people who serve professional athletes manage their money or if you get traded their specialists who will set you up in a new city they will go to private schools and figure out what private school your child should go to\nWill set you up in a new city they will go to private schools and figure out what private school your child should go to they will find you designer for your new house and and interior designer so sports is a very insular business and\nA lot of the players want to deal with known quantities\nAnd part of this is there's the money manager he manages NBA players money so the game is to become one of those guys and then they have

Pitino\nBall last year a federal grand jury charged ten men in the case and the first three to be tried were convicted yesterday Pitino was not charged but did lose his job in the scandal\nWhen these federal indictments were announced a year ago it was big news or people in the college basketball world shocked to hear that these things were going on\nThey absolutely were not shocked\nWhat the FBI I did was put names and faces to what\nMany people had assumed or knew was going on but there was an element of shock\nAnd what that was was that the FBI was on the case the FBI was knocking on doors the FBI was bringing parents and coaches and players into interrogation rooms as opposed to the NC double a if you're in college basketball\nIt's an occupational risk that you may run afoul of the NC double a it was not considered an occupational risk that you may be visited by the FBI and maybe looking at prison time that was a shock\n... and has it had a major effect on college basketball program some in Louisville certainly was turned upside down they lost their coach what about others\nI think overall it has not yet had a big impact on college basketball\nKnow I mentioned that they do well and a fantasy land and part of that just involves putting your head in the sand so that one of the most prominent coaches in college basketball\nThe legendary Mike ... coach K of Duke was quoted as saying this is a blip this is nothing you know this trial is nothing um it's a small sliver of what really goes on\nThis is a blip this is nothing you know this trial is nothing um it's a small sliver of what really goes on well nobody believes that but\nThe fact that coach K set it gives you an indication of the sort of institutional reaction to to what has gone on and a\nDetermination to sort of try to get past this without really changing anything\nYou know you're right that the question in the criminal case is whether this conduct violated federal criminal statutes but what what's really at issue here is the fundamental hypocrisy if not corruption of the whole structure of college sports explain what you mean\nWhat college sports does not pay its workforce it generates billions of dollars\nAnd it doesn't pay and at a certain juncture that's just not defensible maybe when the money was a little less you could say okay they're getting their scholarships now you've got players generating ten and twenty and thirty and forty million dollars for a particular programs and they're not\nReal students their loyalty and their their responsibility is to their team first which takes up forty or fifty or sixty hours a week\nAnd you're not paying them you know you are you are having their elders just spread the money around and they're not all by the way going into pro basketball or pro football some of them are just moving through not necessarily getting a degree\nComing out with some injuries and yet the NC double a persists in the myth of the student athlete when everyone knows that if anything it's the athletes student you know the the athlete is what you're there for\nWhen everyone knows that if anything it's the athletes student you know the the athlete is what you're there for\nThem to come back to one thing you said earlier um you said a lot of people knew that that shady things were going on and that there was a risk of running afoul of and see a regulations it as a whole new game if you have the FBI asking questions do you think that'll make a difference in the future\nI Do think it will make some difference but I think the difference will be\nJust in the way that people\nConduct possibly criminal activity I think people will be more careful you already heard these people you know on the recordings that the FBI took them\nYou know talking about you know we have to do this and some underhanded ways we have to get it out of certain accounts so they knew they were engaged in criminal activity I think there'll be or possibly criminal activity I think they'll become more careful\nSunny the ... the former Nike\nExecutive the godfather of the grassroots circuit he told me these people forgot where the boundaries where you know they got too greedy he also saddened by the way you never do this kind of stuff on the telephone so there's an element of all of this that makes\nThis look like just common criminal activity it makes the three shoe companies seem like crime families on the on the basketball circuit so to the extent that all of this is true and I think it is whether it's criminal we don't know\nIt will continue to go on because there's too much incentive for it to go on I certainly think with the FBI on the case people would become much more careful\nJust so we cover this I mean you said that in some respects she went apparel companies look pretty bad in this what do they say about that\nAnd just so we covered this I mean ... you said that in some respects shooting apparel companies look pretty bad in this what do they say about their role in in college recruitment in these charges\nThe apparel companies have been very quiet they've put out sort of vanilla statements that this is not what we do um but they've been very very quiet\nThere is a Adidas executive who is one of the three current defendants his name is James ghetto he's being represented by\nA lawyer hired by Adidas and finally James ghetto who ... executive his father was a high school coach\nHe's an insider he's a basketball insider almost all of these defendants are well liked well known insiders they're not people who operated you know outside the system I think one of the scariest things for people in the basketball industry to the extent that that they are alarmed is\nThese people were them they were family they were part of the basketball fraternity and Adidas and Under Armour and Nike are part of the corporate basketball fraternity and I don't think they are planning on much

and\nBut I've had gay friends gay male friends like write to me and say you know you describe this element of loop but he was really gay\nAnd the other day I got one of those and it was you know as a pretty stern email that you know made me think about what I had written I had lunch with one of his former girlfriends she was saying look there's no way Louis gauge\nHis sexuality with something I think you know as you gauge the adage you so you wanted to see you know and I I think Louis kind of open to going wherever that\nWas and I think everybody had a language for it then well that's right they didn't that language didn't exist if I did want a guy I just\nDidn't want to say one thing about his parents because you know there really was this sense you know after the shock treatments of of lose never forgiving them for that but when ... left the velvet underground he went back and lived with his family\nI Am really surprised when I rent a ...\nKnow and and uh I once said you know his first wife was talking about Lou being cheap introducing a guide you never want to spend money we were living in these all these small places you would never ask his father for money and at that\nHis first wife was talking about Lou being cheap and she was saying a guide you ever want to spend money we were living in these all of these small places you would never ask his father for money and at that point in my research I I took a loose story as you know the truth and I just said well with his father ever given their money and she said of course he was giving them money\nYou know if it's anything for the you know he was the you know he was the oldest son and his Jewish family and you know his father was a very conventional man who would have loved to have a son that wanted to take over his accounting business you know he didn't get that\nHe couldn't get around you know a lot of what lose life and you know even his art was like but you know on the other hand would ever lose needed anything he was there and\nYou know that was one of the complexities Lou dedicated his book of lyrics to his parents and his sister\nYou know a ... you know it wasn't as simple as a\nYou know as it might initially seem\nAnother thing that really nice like amazed me\nA reading about this in your book is that after the velvet underground split up and he went on his own you didn't have any money not set so he got a job working for his father hyping up in his father's accounting office yes extending have trans grass have is that [laughter] I'm not totally\nDon't have any I always see what's hey guys you know well my mother always said you know like a you know you should have something to fall back on and kind of typing was not for me\nUm you know I think it was just a way to to buy time and make money and if they were ... yeah exactly yeah somebody told me a story I wasn't able to confirm this but that the night Lou ... with the velvet underground you know after a show at max is Kansas City\nUm that his parents were waiting for him in the car to drive and back to Long Island I mean I could never get that confirmed but it's certainly possible and he certainly did move back there immediately and you know they kind of\nBut it's certainly possible and he certainly did move back there immediately and you know they kind of relationship that was a [noise] you know along with\nA you know this kind of you know festering anger that Lou felt him and he would never meet with them without his sister being there he always refer to them by their first names was never like mom and dad\nUm and you know he certainly would characterize them in song you know in ways that you know must have made their skin crawl\nBut ah yeah but in real life you know we got along with them fairly well so early\nIn um the velvet underground period\nThey team up with Andy Warhol like Andy Warhol brings them under his wing he wants he wants to have a man she I'm kind of have yet to kind of expand his his his his reach\n'em and what worked and what didn't work about that connection with Warhol what were they went didn't work for an lead\nWell let's you know that's very interesting question because you know um [noise]\nYeah ... or ... Andy wanted a band in the same way you know it was just like oh you know movies are getting popular and you know just going to make some movies now and you know it says like we should have a banjo rock and roll is getting to be a thing and\nSo they found the velvet underground um you know through some you know and you know artists who had gone to see them and thought they might work for Andy\nI'm you know a Andy Warhol and Paul Marcy has kind of like right hand man at the factory their studio\nDecided that the the velvet underground we're kind of too boring looking so they got Nico you know who was a you know a German model an actress and soon to be finger too young to be their lead singer Lewis not crazy about that\nBut I think he felt like Warhol was going to bring\nSoon to be finger to you know to be their lead singer Lewis not crazy about that but I think he felt like Warhol was going to bring 'em a degree of visibility\nThat was good it was important and that he would just go along with it he limited knickers participation as much as he could\nYou know um she only saying you know a few songs or the band was pointedly called the velvet underground and Nico you know like that is she's not a member of the band\nAnd as soon as he could he got ... you know he kicked Nico has the band as well after having an affair\nAnd well that's very true [laughter] exactly it was you know part of those times um\nAnd that was a you know so that was one of the issues of Warhol a Warhol was great because you know back then you know I was a kid in New York around that time where I was in the newspapers all the time you know not\nA you know not art critics writing about it and although that too but it's just like a this crazy guy you know he thinks that Campbell Soup cans or art and he went to this party the other day I mean every day was in the newspaper so whatever he did got attention\nAnd ah you know Lou took advantage of that but that also hurt the velvet underground in that\nYou know rock and roll certainly back then was a pretty Ernest thing and the Warhol seemed like a put on like a joke oh this is like an Andy Warhol version of a band you know for for people who you haven't heard them yet you know in hurt our amazing there so\nYou know I think eventually like once they made you know certainly the first album and we're in the process of making the second one I think Lou felt All right we've kind of established a baseline here now and he's got to go I have you know this needs to be a more professional operation and\nLou felt All right we've kind of established ... years ago and he's got to go are you do need to be more professional operation you know there's no way of the world was you know a rock and roll manager of you know\nMy guess is Anthony ...

read at a new biography called Lou Reed life literally ... seconds solo album after the velvet underground broke up a transformer was produced by David Bowie\nAnd you know always of course famous for all of his you know persona is and for his sexual fluidity what impact did working with David Bowie have on lead in terms of his self image and his persona\nWell you know Lou how complicated feelings about that um you know at the time it was a big opportunity I mean David belly was kind of the you know the coming thing and uh you know bully [laughter] you know as\nWith flu like there was a very conventional aspect of what we I mean much as he was a boundary breaker he always you know kind of respected his elder CEO and and the people who had an important influence on him and Lou Reed was right at the top of that list and so he you know but we offered to produce transformer and restored\nYou know lose standing after the velvet underground and created a solo career for him and gave him his only hit\n'em they'll walk on the wall side was on that record um [noise]\nKnow so little of course you know once you got the hit that he desperately wanted you know kind of came to resented and you know thought of it as um you know just to kind of pop song and why do people sort of reduced me too that\nUh but at the time that he needed it he really needed it and he really wanted it and I'm ... and ... guitar player ... who co produced that album with ah with with David or they created that song and also you know of other beautiful songs like you know perfect day and satellite of love that\nWith David uh they created that song and also you know other beautiful songs like you know perfect day and satellite of love that are that are on that record and uh you know made it such a you know such a significant album for Lou\n... walk on that ... from that album and um\nThis was his only real like radio hit and it was a big hit 'em in the sun the lyrics are inspired by some of the trans women he knew from Andy Warhol a factory so so let's hear it and then we'll talk about\n...\nCalling from Miami Advil hitchhiked to way across the U.S they\nLoved her eyebrows on the way to shave their legs and then he was she she says the the\nCigarette welcome and while the sun and said hey honey ...\n[noise] ...\nCandy came from now on the island is\nActually read walk on the outside his album transformer which was produced with David Bowie\nI'm so that so that was actually a head for a little read but it sounds from your book like he was ... he wanted to hit so badly finally has any sounds like he was actually kind of ambivalent about it\nWell that's you know there were you know he was pulled back and forth by you know his desire you know look Lou Reed grew up in an era where there was no I mean the velvet underground sort of created this\nYou know where it was possible there to be a rock band had have credibility and not have hits before that you either had hits or you went home you know\nIt was possible there to be a rock band and have credibility and not have hits before that you either had hits or you went home\nYou know [laughter] I'm more than more going to get out of that yeah\nYeah precisely and even if you did have hits [laughter] you know you got a year or two and you then you went home but um you know for Lu so Lu I mean I learned that um ethic kind of in his DNA\nAh but at the same time you know he saw himself as an artist and he saw himself as want us to do serious things and\nAnd take left turns and you know go in New directions and so the degree to which you know the record companies like oh okay great we've got to hit like now let's do pick another walk on the outside or walk on the website again and you know that kind of irritated him and you know of course he made Berlin which at the time was vilified\nOr you know later to be you know resurrected and and uh and ... but you know at the time it came out it was regarded as a you know just an outrage and crazy move because it was you know such a a harsh and depressing record\n'em so you know he would turn on himself you know he would he would do whatever he needed to do\nTo to restore his standing once he had destroyed his standing you know because the next thing was rock and roll animal which was you know a big FM radio record it a a big success at a big seller was alive album and a good one [noise]\nUm yeah but then after Lou made that you know a record or two later remade metal machine music which nearly destroyed his career was just an hour of just\nYou know deafening guitar feedback you know it was again a gesture that was unthinkable before Lou did it\nAnd I'm like I never wanted he wanted to have is music rich people and be loved and B\nBefore Lou did it and um so I felt like I never wanted he wanted\nTo have is music rich people and be loved and be popular but at the same time he distressed and that and wants to be like outside the mainstream and outside of that kind of acceptance\nExactly and it's almost as if he wanted to punish people for like [laughter]\nHonestly I mean I think that was I think that was an element of it mhm mhm [noise] um\nSo I'm In his ... you say that that album basically ended the period of his life where he described himself as gay what what changed [noise]\nWell one thing was the end of his relationship with Rachel which was a huge it's documented quite movingly or in the song street hostile apart call slip away where you know he says you know she took the the rings right off my fingers and\nYou know he in an interview again at that time you know said you know that was real she did that I mean essentially they're saying like Rachel you stole whatever jewelry was around and took off and [noise] um I think they had been falling apart there's some lots of\nLots of theorize about why that is in some sense of I'm Rachel wanted to make a transition that she was taking hormones whether Lew did or did not approve of that but one thing that happened was Lu met I'm Sylvia morale is sue became his second wife\nAnd you know began moving more into that relationship and getting serious and that was um [noise] you know over the course of two or three years Luke got clean\nOr got straight and um and his gay life became something that\nGot clean a got straight\nAnd um and his gay life became something that\nI mean he's still honored in certain ways a song like Halloween parade or a you know there will be references to it but he would never speak of himself as gay after that you know I think he had very complicated feelings about his um his homosexual life\nAnd even if he was out there as anybody could be he also turned on it and are\nOften not with that you know that much um [noise] bitterness\nBut uh\nBut still we would never discuss it\n[noise] you know so I I Want to play different accept at St hassle and not to slip away part that you referred to sure where the part that's about somebody overdosing\nUm and the person narrating the story is like so called\nJust sell indifferent about it it's almost upsetting to listen to you but it's it's yeah it's great music and it's great writing um so then there's the middle part [laughter] a street hassled you want to say anything about this this part\nI'm Lewis drawing on the story of a a guy who used to be around the factory he was found dead\nOr industry or as an thought to be kind of that he was hit by a car that mean that was the official story the unofficial story that was that he had died of a heroin overdose in somebody's apartment and they had dragged 'em out onto the street and just left him by the docks\nI'm as if he had you know had an accident of some kind\nI'm Lou turns that male character into a female character and then you have described the guy who is the host of the party 'em urging\nDot male character which were female character and then you have described the guy who was the host of the party 'em urging his guts to get just girls body out of his apartment [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "26"}
