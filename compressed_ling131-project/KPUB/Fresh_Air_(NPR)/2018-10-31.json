skateboarding\nAnd skateboarding so sensitive to being portrayed in film by outsiders and that's understandable because it's often for church but when I was\nMaybe nine or so skateboarding gave me a

I think a lens that I ended up seeing a lot of life through which is you know taste in music close um treatment of authority and just a sense of perverse closeness\nI dunno just laid an imprint on

lot\nBecause to be graded skateboarding you have to be willing to slam on your face down ten stairs\nBecause to be graded skateboarding you have to be willing to slam on your face down ten stairs on

for you where\nAre you willing to do that when you wanted to skate very briefly\nIn a time where I think I invited pain but I quickly grew out of inviting physical pain in my life and more emotional

all The Simpsons scripts that you wrote when you're a kid did you ever try submitting one of them\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting them would you\nBe willing to share a story line or a joke from one of your early script\nHere's where I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was in a file since a young age and my parents were incredibly ah let's just say how would I put it\nThey encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film so perhaps ignore the content matter of certain thoughts but I maybe should have waited to see till I was old\nThey saw how interested I was in film so perhaps ignore the content matter if certain so [laughter] but I maybe should have waited to see till I was older so I had seen the godfather to really young age because it's my dad's favorite movie and\nI wrote a Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten and then I think is a I I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the ... and The Simpsons were clever for a nine year old [laughter]\nWho is who Marge was Don Corleone [laughter] because as a nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer so she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the Don no excuse me she's Michael\nOK okay charges Michael a grandpa Simpson is is Don he dies right away though so Marge is Michael weight as Homer fan\nNo Homer see that would be but that would make Marge Homer siblings so even in my nine year old mind I knew that was not going to work so Homer is a K [laughter]\nI like Ike Lewis Diane Keaton like [laughter] where are you going to go legit you know [laughter] but ah Lenny and Carl homers friends from work were Lenny was Frito and Carl was sunny\nAnd I don't know I mean it's not actually clever but for a nine year old I was like wow it's interesting that you have the M fishing or the or or even I guess the wherewithal to know who would be the character equivalent of who tend\nTo think of that story and character in that way and to make connections between things that I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were\nTo think about story and character in that way and to make connections between things that I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were beyond your age as a kid that your parents let you watch because you love movies so much\nI'll tell you a story that I I find interesting because\nI mean I saw everything I devoured film I continue to I Love it so I'd ran through so many films and I would go to the newsstand and you know your parents take you to the magazine stand when you're a kid and you flip through magazines or if there's a magazine see on the corner and they're out another place or something\nI Would look through the film magazines I was just so interested so I Would ask them often can I see this film can I see this film and most of the time they say yeah so basically it came down to two films that I wasn't allowed to see [noise]\nUm they said we're so mean you you don't even realize how lucky you are you cannot see kids and you cannot see a clockwork orange\nWell kids is all about kids similar to the kids in your movie\nAnd it's a seminal movie in my life kids is a huge influence on me as a filmmaker but this film is in the opposite of kids were kids is so beautiful and it's ... and it's the world ending tomorrow burn the world down and this film mid nineties is all about connection and hope\nEven if it's dysfunctional connection and hope and\nThose are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my mission to see both of them right away I think I was eleven or twelve how did you do it\nUm a friend of mine who ... who was older had both cassettes at his house\nAnd I saw kids and I was like I Love skateboarding I Love New York this is about kids skateboarding in New York I completely was too young to understand the AIDS subplot or main plot I guess and so I completely wasn't affected by that\nNew York I completely was too young to understand the AIDS subplot or main plot I guess and so I completely wasn't affected by that so I was just like this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life it wasn't till I was older that I understood\nThe HIV aids plot murder film couldn't win over my head so I just took wow this is subversive and this is dangerous you know [noise]\nAnd then I saw a clockwork orange and I had to go to my parents like a shell of a child and be like you are right I saw it [laughter] any disturbed and I need to talk to because I was like\nYou know like a lot they want to do is tell them that I disobeyed them but I was too shook up not to speak to him about what I had seen what shape you also about the film\nI think the raping ultra violence was just too of course it was to have you so so hard to watch as an adult let alone a kid what are your parents say to reassure you [noise]\nWell first of all they were like you should listen to us because we're telling you this stuff for a reason yeah and then of course didn't for many many years and realize they were trying their best I think\nUltimately it did make me braver as an artist in life because I Do think about that and I think ultimately there's something about me that draws me two\nThings that are difficult and maybe I'm uncomfortable with comfort and I think my acting career says that when I really dissect it is well\nGuest is Jonah Hill he wrote and directed the new film mid nineties about a group of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties we'll talk more after a break\nAnd Marine

lot in your early twenties\nYeah and and now like in the past I don't know bunch of years five six seven years you've started playing more dramatic rules\nYou know in films like Wall Street and

were funny and fun\nAnd then uh\nI had heard about the wolf of Wall Street and I asked you audition\nAnd um\nI knew that was going to be a fight to get that part but I I knew I wanted that part really badly\nAnd then\nWhen I wanted to write and direct I think I had\nA lot of opportunities to do that if I wanted to make a mainstream comedy\nUh\nAnd when I really thought about it I was like wow things in my life are happening that are intense\nAnd am I going to be happy\nJust doing what is expected of me or what my heart really want so I have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out how to love who I Am\nAnd I have to figure out what my voice is as a filmmaker and when I looked to my heroes like Mike Nichols or Barry lemon center people got started on comedy and ended up having great filmmaking careers\nI looked at their first films and a lot of times they came from a really personal place and they weren't just funny they were they felt like life and they felt like all the pain

torn rooms with clear lenses just look more wash\n[laughter] okay so that's the thing that Leonardo DiCaprio and my guess Jonah Hill from the wolf of Wall Street um what did you learn from working with Martin Scorsese on off of street\nJust honestly so many things I guess the main lesson I learned\nWas that it's okay not to judge your characters to just show their behavior as people and the characters in his films often do really ugly things and you still find humanity and the\nAnd I like how\nUnabashedly an unapologetically he shows human behavior for better or worse which is something you've tried to do in your new movie\nWhich is I think something that really speaks to me in art in general and something I'm\nGoing to strive to do if I'm lucky enough to get to make another film and

Democratic Party\nHis new book is about how the court became so politicized and so powerful\nIt also includes profiles of several of the justices the book is based in part on ... interviews with several of the current justices as well as pass justices sixty five law clerks who worked at the Supreme Court and congressional and White House officials dating back to the Reagan Administration\nA lot of the interviews were done on the condition that he not named the source Kaplan is also a former legal affairs editor at Newsweek where he covered the Supreme Court for a decade his new book is called the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the constitution\nDavid Kaplan welcome to fresh air so one of the main themes of your book is that the court has become so politicized you can predict how each justice will vote it's become politics by another name elaborate on that idea for us\nWell almost hot button issues like abortion and same sex marriage in voting\nPolitics by another name elaborate on that idea for a\nWhile on those hot button issues like abortion and same sex marriage and voting rights and gun control and campaign finance you pretty much know ahead of time where they're going to come out so the larger question I'm trying to ask in the book is whether the court ought to be as interventionist\nAnd as involved in American Life\nAs it is and enduring for example the recent Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings you heard questions about specific issues like abortion or presidential power but nobody asked\nWhether the court is properly involved in so many of these political and social issues because everyone pretty much assumes a that it ought to be\nIn what sense do you think that the court is over ...\nThe court docket is almost entirely discretionary the justices decide which cases they want to hear and too often they choose to hear cases involving issues that I argue would better be left\nWhether they're biased or as you know have the appearance of bias is a real problem for the court and there is no real solution I don't for example I think you will see recusal Z\nIn such areas of the law I don't think you'll see Kevin recused himself anymore than Clarence Thomas did part of that is it's hard for justice to recuse himself\nOr herself at a lower court you can always substitute in a new judge you can't do that\nOn the Supreme Court there nine justices if one doesn't sit in the case then you're down to a they don't like even numbers of justices but we'll we'll Kavanaugh bend over backwards in in such cases to try to undo the concern people have that's\nSuch dime store psychology is beyond my pay grade they're certainly isn't any indication in his opinions to date of a bias but you know his performance after Dr Ford testify\nTalking about how this was a vast left wing conspiracy the Clintons and all that even if he apologized for try to in Wall Street journal op ed piece I think that in some respects\nA leaves him\nTwo and a Wall Street journal op ed piece I think that in some respects a leaves him\nIn an even tougher position than he might in a sexual harassment\nCase there are a lot of cases that if they don't involve the Clinton specifically obviously they involve politics and a cabinet or you could argue showed his true partisan shelf in that twenty minutes of testimony I Would be justice concern in that area\nWhat kind of cases do you think that might influence\nWell you could imagine campaign finance\nAppeal coming up they're going to be more of those and depending on who brings it\nAre are there Republican interest where their democratic interests I think even if he's not in fact biased the appearance of by a bias is a real one\nHaving settled that there are all kinds of reasons of course to criticize justice Thomas's performance on the court for the last Thirty years and I do so in my book but I'm not sure you can point to a lot of cases in the area of of\nA sexual harassment or regulation of the workplace 'em and say that\nThomas ruled the way he did out of ... or bitterness from his hearings back then\nI don't know if this was after last February or not but last February that lives in New York magazine cover story headlined the case for impeaching Clarence Thomas with stories of other women besides Anita Hill who had stories of sexual harassment ... um regarding Clarence Thomas\nSo it's um it's a story that keeps you know coming back to life\nIt does and some folks could argue that maybe it was truly generous it was unique and it was dated but the Kavanaugh stuff brought that all back to light\nYou didn't maybe it was silly generous it was unique and it was dated but the Kavanaugh stuff brought that all back to light and as you point out now we've got two justices under a cloud separated by Thirty years that is really bad\nFor the court it's bad for the courts ...\nI think it helps to an end feeble Congress we have a lousy Congress for any number of reasons but one of the reasons as various congressmen and senators would tell me they don't act is 'cause they know that the justices across the street\nWill act and I also think it it distorts presidential elections and the way that we saw in two thousand\nSixteen twenty twenty five percent of Trump voters said they didn't like Trump's temperament they didn't agree with the with a lot of what he said but they voted for him simply because of the Supreme Court\n[noise] so um it in terms of how politicized the court has become I'm\nPresident Trump supported Brett Kavanaugh through the hearings and Trump consulted Christine Blasey Ford who made the allegations of sexual assault [noise] are you concerned are their concerns out there that Kavanaugh will feel beholden to Trump and therefore\nCome to conclusions in ways that support the Trump Administration when the Trump Administration is involved in the case\nI think they're all kinds of\nLegitimate bases for criticizing Cavanaugh I thought his testimony\nAfter Dr Ford was appalling I thought Kavanaugh's performance of the press conference the White House was a not a fitting of a justice but I think the notion that now that he's on the Supreme Court he's going to feel beholden to the president who appointed him\nIs misguided one of the great aspects of the system which has lots of ...\nHe's going to feel beholden to the president who appointed him is misguided one of the great aspects of the system\nWhich has lots of laws is that once you're on the bench and have life tenure you really don't have to look down Pennsylvania Avenue with any degree of loyalty because the president can do anything at that point other than tweet so I think\nBy and large most justices or throughout history have\nSuccessfully proclaimed and demonstrated their independence from the president's so pointed them look at the Nixon tapes case in Nineteen Seventy four were unanimous court ruled against Richard Nixon that doesn't mean you kind of a friendship\nWith the president various FDR appointed justices remained friends with FDR butter on my list of criticisms of and concerns about Brecht cabinet or the fact that he's grateful to this president I don't think will affect his decision making I think most justices most of the time\nOnce they're up there they're free and clear\n[noise] I hadn't known of Brett Kavanaugh before he was nominated to be a Supreme Court justice but you write that some people some insiders were surprised that he wasn't on\nTrump's first list of a potential nominees the one that the one that that ended with the core such nomination and you say some movement conservatives called Kavanaugh\nApproved ... milk toast to lacked guts and again this was before his nomination this was during the course that nomination why was he called ... ... ... to lack that's\nAll they would say he was such because of an opinion he wrote in one of the Obamacare cases where he didn't reach out and strike down the statue which is what the movement conservatives\nWrote in one of the Obamacare cases where he didn't reach out and strike down the statue which is what the movement conservatives won and instead he said\nThat his court the federal appellate court in Washington or should not be hearing the case deciding the case at that moment on procedural grounds there was a technical issue that we we will go into details on but he wrote what I thought was a measured\nScholarly legal opinion saying the case isn't quite right for us it's a timing issue I thought it was a good solid opinion do I remember that doesn't matter but I think he was taken out to the woodshed by a lot of movement conservatives who said why didn't you do\nOr the right thing here and that was the chief strike\nAgainst them now I happen to think that Kavanaugh on the court will wind up being less of the arch conservative that Thomas and Alito\nHave been or that Gorsuch will be I Would predict that cabin oh we'll veer closer\nTo what passes for the center of the court that chief justice Roberts is now the swing vote and I think his institutional ism his affection for the court and for its own reputation may lead him in ... on some occasions\nTo rein in the courts power in the way that chief justice did decisively so\nThe Obamacare ruling upholding the statute back in two thousand twelve I think Kavanaugh will\nVeer on occasion closer and then in that direction than for example Neil Gorsuch\nMy guest is David a cap and former legal affairs editor at Newsweek and author

Kaplan author of the new book the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the constitution he's also former legal affairs editor at Newsweek\nSo we have to Trump appointees on the Supreme Court now Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh Justice Scalia who was replaced by Gorsuch uh was an originalist\nWhich means uh interpreting the constitution as it was intended to be interpreted by the founders when it was written\nAnd not considering it a document that has to be updated for the times that we live in and Thomas considers himself an originalist or a texture list I say that not really understanding the difference between those two\nTerms but um is Gorsuch are Kavanaugh an originalist or texture list or do they not subscribe to that point of view\nI think they would both call themselves card carrying originalists and to some extent ... having said that I'm In my book originalism is bunk\nCard carrying originalists and to some extent ... having said that I'm In my book originalism is bunk because even original is\nOnly use originalist originalism when it suits them when it doesn't suit them they ignore it I think it's a lot of nonsense and of course the most important thing\nAbout the whole original is a a a trope is that if you look at the constitution and I've read mine a lot there is no causing the constitution that says thou shall interpret me\nBased on what you thought those who wrote me two hundred and fifty years ago thought it's nonsense\nWas something you say about originalism is that because you're trying to literally follow what the founding fathers meant when they wrote the constitution\nAt a time when there was slavery at a time when women did not have equal rights\nYou say that originalism favor as a status quo fixed in the Eighteen century and it tends to favor the halves of that time and to this favor all other such as minorities and other unpopular lead against and maybe we can at women to that\nAll true but of course the constitution is not written as a set of regulations some constitutions the world are written that way when you use phrases like a equal protection of the laws or due process of law\nOr no unreasonable searches and seizures when you write things in such general terms you necessarily are inviting those who interpret you whether they are judges or presidents were senators I'm to use their own\nJudgments as to what it means that's why you write a constitution [noise] do you think\nThat justice is in general have become more politicized\nAs to what it means that's why you write a constitution [noise] do you think\nThat justice is in general have become more politicized in recent years than they've been in the past yes okay why do you think that is\nI think in part because the selection process that we use now and the better if more cynical\nA process that White House is used to pick nominees results in such candidates you know the Brett Kavanaugh is a competent judge show was Neil Gorsuch but they weren't chosen to go some of their stellar credentials those were necessary requirement for getting chosen\nThey were chosen because I thought they vote the right way\nIn the same way I think that Ruth Bader Ginsburg was chosen by Bill Clinton and it's so do some Sonia Sotomayor for example was chosen by Iraq Obama and you know you can blame presidents that are blamed the Senate but I I think you in the first instance you need to blame the court because it gets involved\nSo often it raises the stakes of who sits\nOn the court so if the court is in effect going to govern the country on so many key issues than you really need to look at how you think individual members of the court are going to vote when you do that politics the role of politics necessarily becomes heightened it wasn't\nAlways that way when John Paul Stevens was picked by Gerald Ford in the mid Nineteen seventies and it wasn't for that reason and I could give you half a dozen a dozen other example those days are long gone I Would like to see the return of those days\nDo you think the political politicization of Supreme Court nominees ... includes how Mitch McConnell blocked Merrick Garland from even coming to the Judiciary Committee after he was nominated\nIncludes how Mitch McConnell blocked Merrick Garland from even coming to the Judiciary Committee after he was nominated\nAbsolutely and and listen if the Democrats get control\nOf Congress of this this time round or in two years twenty twenty I think you'll if they can get their act together because they're not really good at playing dirty or you may see them raise the stakes you know they talk about ... about getting rid of life tenure at the Supreme Court that would require\nA constitutional amendment but if you want to increase\nThe size of the court pack the court as it were all you need is an act of Congress if the Democrats control the house in the Senate or the White House and twenty Twenty one I don't think\nCourt packing is off the table at all and if you want to get back\nThe Merrick Garland seat and if you want to take back control of the court\nJust add to more seats a point to liberals that an eleven member court you have a six foot majority do I think that's possible yes\n[noise] being a Supreme Court justice is I'm a lifetime appointment you leave when you say you want to leave and\nHow old is your third against but now eighty five and how old was a\nJohn Paul Stevens' when he left\nNinety yeah so ... you can say for a really long time um\nSo a lot of people already good is it pretty good gig gig [laughter] yeah\n[laughter] um so the lifetime appointment issue has been challenged by many people because now that people are living to such\nOlder ages than they used to when the Supreme Court was first created you know and when the constitution was first written um the president's power to appoint a Supreme Court justice that's been\n... was first written um the president's power to appoint a Supreme Court justice that's become a much bigger power than it ever was big cuts in part of the extension of\nThe lifespan of Americans [noise] um so you know some people including you have proposed changing the lifetime nature of the appointment\nWhy do you think we should consider changing it and what are some of the suggestions you have\nWell would lower the stakes of any particular\nNomination if for example there was a single term of Eighteen years as many others have suggested in which I indoors\nI think that would lower the temperature it would allow once you kicked in the system over time because she couldn't make current justices leave it would allow every president to get your nominations you'd have a new justice every two years I think that would be a great idea it will never happen\nUm I mean I think the most creative idea that I came across was not so much a single term but by staffing the Supreme Court randomly I'm with a rotating series of nine judges picked among the chief judges\nOf the twelve lower federal appeals court in the country\nIf it was just any bunch of judges picked and maybe it wouldn't be a nine of twelve maybe we'll be five of twelve then you might\nActually give forced to the idea that the court is a neutral body it rules based on law not personality not based on the political views of this or that justice\nBut that these more anonymous lower court judges and the chief judge is of course are rotated based on seniority system might look more or less\nNot um is lower court judges and the chief judge is of course are rotated based on seniority system might look more like we have long imagined it to be the idea that the court is politicized is not\nA new issue it's just far more dramatic than used to be and it cuts against what we all learned in civics class which is that the law supposed to be neutral or government of laws not men and women and so forth I think shuttle that any of these changes are incredibly unrealistic", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "31"}
