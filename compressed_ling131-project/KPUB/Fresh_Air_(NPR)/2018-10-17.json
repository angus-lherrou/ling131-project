definitely kept hidden when when my grandparents are finally told me I was in the fourth grade and I I'll never forget sitting me 'cause they called me into the living room\nAnd I remember thinking oh maybe we are going to go in another family vacation because the last time we had a family meeting they told me we're going to Disney World and it was fantastic [noise] and my grandfather who sat me down on the couch and he said it's time we tell you the truth about your mother and she's in jail and she's a drug addict and that's that's why she's been gone all this time now\nTo tell people that your mother had been a heroin addict\nOr throughout my childhood it's something I definitely kept hidden when when my grandparents are finally told me I was in the fourth grade and I I'll never forget

that's that's that's why she's been gone all this time now that was a fourth grade now she had been gone and in and out since I was two years old\nSo I didn't tell anybody for the longest time I I trusted one friend my friend Patrick my best friend I grew up next door to\nHis mother was a heroin addict his grandparents took a legal custody of him when he was a turning three\nAnd this is a story of his childhood\nSo your grandparents sound like they were very loving toward you but then they had pretty graph personalities particularly your grandmother I Want you to describe how you draw your grandmother and how you draw your grandmother's cigarettes which are typically hanging from her lips\nYes I my grandparents loved me so much and you know despite all of the trauma that I was surrounded by their their love floated me through life and they're just about\nWas a turning three and this is a story of his childhood\nFill your grandparents sound like they were very loving toward you but that they had pretty graph personalities particularly your grandmother I Want you to describe how you draw your grandmother and how you draw your grandmother's cigarettes which are typically hanging from her lips\n[laughter] yes I my grandparents loved me so much and you know despite all of the trauma that I was surrounded by their their love floated me through life and they're just about a decade gone now and I still very much feel that love and I very much keeps me afloat [noise]\nThey were tricky people though you know um they drink quite a bit uh in fact they were\nThey were better when I was young then when my mother was young they they were my grandmother could at times be violently drunk um when she was younger I guess I could sum up my grandmother with this\nHad come home from school\nAnd somebody wrong to me and I tell the story about how this kid wrong me she would take the cigarette out of her mouth and say just tell them to go their hat [laughter]\nNo at the time I was in third\nGrade and it sounds like such this like Great Depression World War two put down and here I Am in the eighties [laughter]\nAm I going to go back to school [laughter]\nThey were so lovingly crafts though you know they curse around but it was never directed towards me and I remember they want to say like you know we're okay if you cursed but if you ever course at us you are in a significant amount of trouble young men\nYou know [noise] um they smoke two packs a day each\nNah or and my grandfather just be moans this movement of uh having places be non smoking you know airplanes you can't smoke on the plane like\nGo back to school really care about [laughter]\nThey were so lovingly crass though you know they curse around but it was never directed towards me and I remember they want to say like you know we're okay if you cursed but if you ever course at us you are in a significant amount of trouble young men you know [noise] um they smoke two packs a day each nah or\nAnd my grandfather just be moans this movement of ah having places be non smoking\nYou know airplanes you can't smoke on the plane like what an inconvenience to the point where said Jesus Christ by the time I die I'm going to get to heaven and they're going to say sorry no smoke\n[laughter] he died of lung cancer die yeah he does well at eighty one [laughter] any outlive your grandmother by a couple of years is also a heavy smoker also heavy smoker and I should say to\n'em you know she she died the summer before my wedding and unfortunately she died ah she got on a friday or my wife's wedding story was that Sunday\nAnd in the months leading up to that you know my fiance at the time Gina now my wife she'd be over and and uh my ... my grandmother is hooked up to oxygen and we always had thought that she just had a bad bladder 'cause she was always excuse herself to go to the bathroom and just like you know she's smoking right with the oxygen around her nose\nOh gosh that's deemed as though they were so lucky the hosted and explode yeah so do you think your grandparents were different people and they were raising you and when they were raising your mother\nI Know they were I Know that my my my grandmother and my mother did not get along and I and I think a part of it was a ... my mother was their second child there first daughter and I really felt there was a lot of jealous when my mother felt this that there was a lot of jealousy that my grandmother\nOxygen around her notes oh gosh that's dangerous as though they were so lucky the house didn't explode yeah so do you think your grandparents or different people and they were raising you then when they were raising your mother\nI Know they were I Know that my my my grandmother and my mother did not get along and I and I think a part of it was uh my my mother was their second child there first daughter\nAnd I really felt there was a lot of jealous when my mother felt this that there was a lot of jealousy that my grandmother surely had for my mother Leslie because\nThat took Joe's attention away I'm\nJoe when Leslie always had a tight bond surely and Leslie's relationship was always front ah surely was also drinking ... a lot of them um she should drink quite a bit when I was young but she was never really drunk on weekdays and she was drunk on weekdays quite a bit when my mother was young\nYou know had recurring nightmares as a town about monsters would you describe the nightmare\nThis recurring dream where I was in the middle of a field and on the outskirts of this field you know where they're just force\nAnd these tall lanky monsters like like almost like naked alien zombies would would slowly come out but if I made eye contact with the monsters they would freeze\nBut the problem was I was surrounded by these monsters\nAnd so while I Would maintain eye contact to freeze one monster the monsters to my back would approach me so I'd have to spin around and make eye contact with those monsters but that of course would free of those other monsters and they would start creeping in every dream ended the same way in which they were on top of me\nAnd I vividly remember those dreams and and yes they are in their in\nZombies would would slowly come out but if I made eye contact with the monsters they would freeze\nBut the problem was I was surrounded by these monsters\nAnd so while I Would maintain eye contact to freeze one monster the monsters to my back would approach me so I'd have to spin around and make eye contact with those monsters but that of course would free of those other monsters and they would start creeping in every dream ended the same way in which they were just on top of me\nAnd I I vividly remember those dreams and and yes there in there in the book and and those were difficult to draw because um you know you're writing out scenes is one thing when you have a series of letters that make up words and make up sentences\nBut visually they don't look like anything but sketching out this book was difficult because you're facing these fears are facing these these nightmares or you're facing these people once again\nWhen do they stop these nightmares [noise]\nProbably some time just before high school I imagine I'm ... I remember having them throughout elementary school and it's you know the way I went to I went to ... school in Worcester, Massachusetts and back then it was kindergarten through eighth grade so I was at the same same school St building for all those nine years\nYour grandparents later told you that they'd often open up the bedroom door and find your sleeping right outside of um did you have anybody to talk to these nightmares about\nNo I don't believe I ever spoke to anyone that any of the trouble is you know my grandparents grew up in the great depression and they they you know it wasn't generation and so they certainly weren't the kind of people who thought you should talk about your problems I mean\nI'm a therapy would've been significantly helpful for me as a kid and and um and I go to therapy now and I'm open about that to help uh you know to stigmatize you seeing someone is talking to somebody\nThey'd often open up the bedroom door and find you sleeping right outside of it um did you have anybody to talk to these nightmares about\nNo no I don't believe I ever spoke to anyone that any of the trouble is you know my grandparents grew up in the great depression and they they you know it wasn't generation and so they certainly weren't the kind of people who thought you should talk about your problems I mean\nI'm a therapy would've been significantly helpful for me as a kid and and um and I go to therapy now and I'm open about that to help uh you know do stigmatize seeing someone is talking to somebody\nOr on a professional level um and that's where for me are was such a saving grace because I I did work out some of these issues in my sketchbooks and and in my drawings\nWhen you took art classes when you were in high school at the list or art museum and your your grandfather paid for these classes because he knew how absorbed you are with your with your drawing\nYou were really proud to tell your teacher that you had read a book about how to draw like marvel comics mhm and your teacher did not have the reaction you expected what did your teacher saying\nOh he was the best piece of advice any teacher has ever given me throughout my education and I remember I I brought in this book was so excited you know I thought I was get extra credit I read the whole book\nAnd without missing a beat he wouldn't even let me finish my thought his face turned just had like he just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you learned\nAnd and by that what he meant was ... that that particular book really had like okay this is the way if you want to work for marvel this is how you have to drive ... this is how you have to draw muscles [noise]\nThis is how you have to ask\nAnd so he as an as as uh\nYou know I thought I was get extra credit I read the whole book and without missing a beat he wouldn't even let me finish my thought his face turned just had like he just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you learned\nAnd and by that what he meant was ... that particular book really had like okay this is the way if you want to work for marvel this is how you have to drive ... this is how you have to draw muscles [noise] this is how you have to ask\nAnd so he as an as as an educator of the art and specifically he's teaching comic book classes you know he he would just see these young people are judging their talent based on the kind of comics they were reading\nSo he really helped me realize that a ... a comic doesn't need to be superheroes and it doesn't need to be drawn just the way the artist or drawing them professionally at and in that moment ah and and back then this was now the early nineties\nThe thought of being a cartoonist you really figured you'd have to go and work for somebody else and dress somebody else's character\nSo that advice by by Marc Lynch really set me on this path of oh I could do my own thing and somehow carve out a nice little life for me doing just what I Want to do that's a possibility\nAny tells you you had your own style and that you should develop that he did say upsetting but did you learn anything nevertheless [laughter] from the marvel comics books Oh absolutely you know from the how to draw like marvel comics that that was actually useful for you\nIs certainly a there's a lot about gesture so if you're having a character say throw a punch you want to be extreme you know that the punches like really real back or the punch has been fully blown but not right in the middle so and it definitely had a lot of good points of\nDoing just what I Want to do that's a possibility\nAnd he tells you you had your own style and that you should develop that he did that upset but did you learn anything nevertheless from the marvel comics books Oh absolutely you know from the how to draw like marvel comics with that though it was actually useful for is\nCertainly a there's a lot about gesture so if you're having a character say throw a punch you want to be extreme you know the the punches like really real back or the punches been fully blown but not right in the middle so and it definitely had a lot of good points of um [noise]\nYou know framing you're shot you know there's still a lot of value in that book and I still have the book um\nBut in regards to art style I think any sort of how to draw book I think Paige wants to be you know real one is just have your own style [laughter] don't ignore ignore everything you're about\nMy guest is Jared J. ... his

born\nA this was December of two thousand and eleven she started getting arrested again and so in January of two thousand twelve\nHolly who is who she is my aunt's by lineage but my sister or by heart and soul called me on the phone and she said did you see the paper today\nAs a hobby [laughter] I live in North Hampton I live in our ... no I didn't see the paper what happened and uh my mother was arrested for expressing false prescriptions at at pharmacies\nAnd I I went in person to talk to my mother had of her court date and she she has she assured me that she was not using she was just selling it to a guy to make extra money and I said well that's really not going to convince me to bring my kids around here\nAnd I really had to put some distance between us at that point you know why I had a three year old a newborn and they needed their dad and I needed to be fully there for my children\nAnd I and so yeah the the way I Would keep track of her she would she would get arrested 'em and they get arrested for driving without a license or or or you know she would be driving and the police officer tried to pull her over and she would try to outrun them\nShe did spend a little bit of time in jail again ah the last time I saw her was that a family funeral\nAnd that this was this would have been in spring of two thousand six team and we had a we had a nice connection\nNeeded to be fully there for my children\nAnd I and so yeah the the way I Would keep track of her she would she would get arrested 'em and they get arrested for driving without a license or or or you know she would be driving and the police officer try to pull her over and she would try to outrun them\nShe did spend a little bit of time in jail again ah the last time I saw her was that a family funeral\nAnd that this was this would have been in spring of two thousand six team and we had a we had a nice connection you know and she said I Love you and I always will and I said mom I Love you and I always will\nAnd you know you do ... I Would worry I'd wake up in the middle of the night thinking what if what if I'm wrong but if she really isn't using you know but then I realized that she wasn't alone because she was with she was running herself with other people\nJust she wasn't making herself accessible to me\nAnd you know I was she knew I was writing what would become hate kiddo and I was getting to the point where I thought you know I'm a long and at a trial process from really going to need to talk to her about when I'm writing about and will she wants her real name or or should I come up with a pseudonym standing\nAnd I received a phone call one night it was march of two thousand Seventeen at the end of the month\nAnd it was her it was her younger brother Steven and he informed me that she had died of a drug overdose she'd she'd on heroin and it was heartbreaking to be right\nYou know and it it it affirmed for me what I I did what I needed to do to protect my new young family and on Monday morning I went into the funeral home in Stephen who's a hearing and he's like he's my uncle buddy is like my brother\nAnd I received a phone call one night it was march of two thousand Seventeen at the end of the month and it was it was her younger brother Steven and he informed me that she had died of a drug overdose she'd she'd already on heroin and it was heartbreaking to be right\nYou know and it it it affirmed for me what I I did what I needed to do to protect my new young family\nAnd on Monday morning I went into the funeral home in Stephen who's got the again he's like he's my uncle buddy is like my brother met me there [noise]\nAnd I really had the feeling of you know she's going to be cremated by kind of want to see her one more time\nAnd and the field director pointed out like you you don't want to see her now like I hadn't signed off to get the body to be transferred from the work to the funeral home so I said you know what well let's let's have a viewing and I had in my mind that she would wear the dress she wore it to to my wedding\nAnd so I had in my mind that I Would just turn up at her house I would open the closet and sure enough there would be the dress\nAnd Steven accompany me and now it seems the afternoon\nAnd ah there's a man in the house then she she had claimed that was response or and I later learned that you typically would not have a sponsor of the opposite sex 'em and they certainly would be living with you so later I later came to learn that this this man was her boyfriend and so\nHe opened the door and uh he was just completely out of his mind I mean he was high on heroin his eyes were blood red his skin was white as bone he had a T shirt sweat pants no no socks for shoes on and he's talking a mile a minute\nAnd I'm Still ... tunnel vision that I Want to see my mom and make my mum beautiful again that I entered the house\nAnd um went to her bedroom couldn't find couldn't find the dress\nBut later I later came to learn that this this man was her boyfriend and so\nHe opened the door and uh he was just completely out of his mind I mean he was high on heroin his eyes were blood red his skin was white as bony had a T shirt sweat pants no no socks for shoes on and he's talking a mile a minute\nAnd I'm Still ... tunnel vision that I Want to see my mom and make my mom beautiful again that I entered the house\nAnd um went to her bedroom couldn't find\nCouldn't find the dress for the night my my my glance went over to her bureau\nAnd it was just filled with ugliness it was filled with metal spoons and tourniquets and and all all of her drug paraphernalia\nAnd so her boyfriend at the time said oh you know what there's a there's a cedar closet and this other room right now of course I dress that was that important to her she would preserve in the theater closet\nSo I ... I stepped in the other room where the cedar closet is and on a little nicer than I saw him again and then on the lazy boy there I saw three handguns annex so that was to handguns and now I'm ...

Blacksburg welcome to fresh air time changes how we see things doesn't it [laughter]\nYou know it's slim later you when you did that Charlie Rose opening you probably had no idea that he would be excused by multiple women of sexual harassment and that would lead to the loss of his job\nSo let's just start with the surprise of that for you did you think of that opening episode when the women step forward\nIt really dates the show doesn't it have Charlie Rose be the the voice of sober reason that you know look at bow jak who is such a mess and all that far into and unprofessional and Charlie Rose or played in in this clip by patent Oswald is are are straight person in the scene\nAnd uh yeah when the allegations against Charlie Rose came out I don't want to say my first thought was oh no my show\nBecause it wasn't it was truly oh no Charlie Rose and and all the women that he allegedly targeted a that's terrible but it it is interesting now to to go back to that first episode and look at it and think about how times have changed\nIt is a very silly cartoon universe but it can also I think maybe because of that go to some very sincere dark a melancholy and even tragic places and that may be in a live action show some of the story beats would feel modeling or saccharin or you know a misery corny\nBut because it's animated and it's like a horse and\nIt's bright and colorful it just takes on a different feel and you can kind of sneak attack in the sadness and some funds surprising ways\nI liked that sneak attack into sadness into in some fun ways [laughter] far north as quick as it kind of sadness I like the final version of that [laughter]\nAnd and jackets and such despair afterwards and feels responsible he's driving any closes his eyes and nearly drives off the road but then opens his eyes just in time to save himself and I think that's a suicide attempt as opposed to him falling asleep at the wheel\nWell let's say it's a lazy suicide attempt right it's a suicide attempt a plausible deniability like he's not actively\nKilling himself but he's allowing the universe to take its course you know what I mean I always felt like in a port in ... but maybe minor distinction to us that he is so despondent despairing that he was willing to do this but not so much that he was going to actively do it himself\nOne of the episodes that you have in the current season season five what you wrote is um an unusual\nSelf one of the episodes that you have in the current season season five which you wrote is um an unusual episode because it's one lung monologue bow jacks mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really bad dementia and low jak does not feel warmly toward her so this episode is all his eulogy for her so he's at a podium at 'em like her coffins at the side\nAnd he's not trying to paper over what their relationship with like he's talking about all these horrible things that happened in his family and how he was mistreated by his parents and how his father was mean to his mother and they were both mean to bow jak [noise]\nI I Want to play a brief part of his eulogy and Mrs well or not as Beau jak horsemen\nI used to be on the TV show called horsing around fiercely they'll hold your applause\nWill held it was written by my friend her ... as who's also dead now and it started this little girl named Sarah limb\nAnd it was about these orphans in early on the network at a note maybe don't mentioned they're orphans so much because audiences tend to fight orphans sad and not related at all but I never thought the orphans were said I I always thought they were lucky because they could imagine their parents to be anything they wanted something to long for\nAny way we did this one season finale we're Libya's birth mother comes to to she was a junkie but she's got her so cleaned up and she was to be in a live your life again and of course she's like a perfect grownup version of Libya or go to the mall together and get her ears pierced like she's always wanted in any way that we're supposed to Warner be careful\n... way of letting you do but Libya\nJust thinks the horses jealous when the mom says she's moving to California Olivia decides to go with her\nAs a way of letting you do but Olivia just thinks the horses jealous when the mom says she's moving to California Olivia decides to go with her\nAnd the network really juiced the cliffhanger ... Olivia gone for good but of course because it's a TV show should not gone for good of course because it's a TV show Olivia's mother had a relapse and had to go back to rehab facility had hitchhiked all the way home getting rides from Mr T. Alvin the cast of stop\nOf course that's what happened because what are you going to do just not handled Libya on the show\nYou shouldn't have happy endings sitcoms not really because if everyone's happy the show would be over and above all else the show\nHas to keep going there's always more show and you can call horsing around dumb or bad or unrealistic but there is nothing more realistic than that you never get a happy ending 'cause there's always more show\nI guess until there is\nAn assay saying until there isn't he's looking at his mother's cough and you know his mother had told him earlier you were born broken your bow jak horsemen there's no cure for that I'm so he he really had a bad relationship with her and when he says early in that clip\nThat um he ended our our fans because they can't imagine their parents anyway they wanted to um [noise] what made you think about that well\nYou know I I I think a big part of this episode at a big part of the larger story of his relationship with his mother ... and his relationship with his parents is about\nThis idea of can you forgive people who have done nothing to earn your forgiveness and and can you find peace with this woman who was so damaging to you but it's gone now and will never hurt you again and even in the last years of her life was a frail scared woman herself\nTo you but it's gone now and will never hurt you again and even in the last years of her life was a frail scared woman herself and I'm really interested in that idea and that that question of\nYou know what do we owe the people in our lives as far as forgiveness goes and I think what's really interesting for me is the tension between that and too easy for giving us a public figures right and and I want to believe\nOn a personal level level that nobody is era deem a ball or so far gone that they can't find a way to be better and be forgiven\nAnd how does that track with me where I also think some of these you know famous Garbage Men who've heard so many people in them so many terrible things should just go away forever and not be allowed any sort of redemption\nAnd I don't know how I reconcile those two ideas and and that tension for me\nHas been at least a ... a really interesting to explore over the course of this last season but also the show in general\nSo in this era of the me too movement more so so many men have so much to apologize for [laughter]\nI'm One of the funny things that you've come up with for the series or you you and the writers is do we forgive you awards you created a whole awards ceremony for people who need to apologize for saying would you describe forgive ease the we\nFor sure but we forgive you awards as presented on the show are awards\nThat celebrities gets when the industry has decided to forgive them so we have a a character we made up called Vance Wagner who who's gotten into some trouble in the past and he's being presented a we forgive you award from\nI think for time forgive the recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd it one of the sad to slash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it\nTime forgive the recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger and it one of the sad to slash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it is when we first started writing the season\nLast year or last summer we were talking about how sad it is that our industry is so quick to forgive these you know really terrible men who do awful things and they're able to kind of likes link back into the limelight and we wanted to satirized that\nAnd then over the course of the last year it started to feel like oh wait a second maybe there's been like a huge sea change in our industry all of a sudden it feels like we're holding them accountable and we're we're kicking them out of the industry and then just in the last month or so it started to feel like oh no wait maybe we're forgiving\nI don't know maybe this is sadly relevance a new um so it feels like oh we're really you know on top of the last month of pop\nCulture news when in fact we were describing this thing that's been happening for years and years what makes you think that people are being forgiving again well\nUh it was announced that Mel Gibson is co writing and directing a new movie for Warner Brothers\nAnd I I don't know if we have we forgotten his anti Semitic remarks is homophobic remarks his threats against his domestic partner the allegations that he beat her is use of of racial slurs\nIn miss defies me in this era that we're in we're we're claiming to hold men accountable that it still feels like we are not you know Louis C K A stand up set a little ways back and got a standing ovation\nA there are reports that Garrison Keillor and Matt Lauer are planning their comebacks I think that there is\nWork that those men can be doing to better themselves and I would\nPersonally love to hear about it I Would be happy if they want to do come back and do an interview and reflect on their midst\nCan be doing to better themselves and I would\nPersonally love to hear about it I Would be happy if they want to do come back and do an interview and reflect on their misdeeds and talk about what they've learned and then I think from there maybe we can you know we think about their professional development and I feel like we're going about this backwards and it I found a

of the Netflix animated comedy tragedies Hayes a bow jak horsemen which is now being shown on reruns on Comedy Central\nWatching the series especially like after the eulogy episode I would've thought that you were a bitter mental at a very troubled childhood reading about you a little bit my impression is that was not so\nYour parents were involved with a Jewish culture your mother rent a Jewish bookstore your father help Russian Jewish immigrants in the U. S. um\nYour parents were involved with a Jewish culture your mother rented Jewish bookstore your father help Russian Jewish immigrants in the last um tell us about the book store your mother used to have like what kind of what kind of books were there and did you read any of them\nAre so my mother owned a a Jewish gifted in book store called Bob and Bob and it was kind of a hub of Jewish life in the um bay area or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto and the surrounding area\nAnd so I really you know what I Would go and visit the store and I sit in the kids' section or sit at her desk and and and and leaf through the books\nAnd and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish day school um you know I even after a high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews and never felt\nA extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never\nOnce felt like a minority and the communities that I was in um\nShe would always bring home stuff from the store often it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of ... that were shipped\n'em and we have we have a banner that we put up every Hanukkah that says happy Halloween because it's missing an end to have the the misfit toys Hanukkah um it it just felt very normal that to have a Jewish life\nUm and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWas disconnect me between being told about anti Sam ... senators and living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture\nA hundred percent it felt like a thing of the past it felt like oh the Holocaust happened uh and that was terrible but now we live in sophisticated times now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew\nAnd you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes um\nOK to be a Jew and you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes um\nAnd it's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country and they're they have a lot of power\nAnd there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage um and that's been very scary to me uh but also scary how little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening\nUm especially big some for someone who\nYou know as a Jew you hear the story of a Holocaust over and over and over growing up and the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing right there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me\nWho were shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them and cutting off their beards\nAnd so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAnd you know officially one of the Jews control the media\nI guess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kind of feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nThey said it because it's the ... and like I think yeah and I and I would\nSay a couple of years it'll be like oh yeah we do control the media is not hilarious\nUm and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out and I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nThat's about I don't you remember if it was ...\nI ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember if it was middle school or high school but somewhere around them\nSo it was a difficult for you to concentrate long enough to to read books\nUm yes or sometimes you know I I I could always read books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there is something that really interested in me I could focus and do it you know the problem is in school\nYou have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in\nAnd there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed where it felt like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just troubled child I just don't behave\nAnd you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took her pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I Love that audience that I Love making people laugh\nBut a lot of it too is I I had trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't you\nKnow and it was inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize was inappropriate\nKnow like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my parents are everyone can see my underpants inappropriate inappropriate and\nI remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy here pushing the boundaries I did it because I thought oh this'll be a funny thing and then I was mystified\nThat oh now I'm In trouble it like it did not occur to me that there'd be a cause and effect this action that would lead to me being sent to the principal's office and that this was an outrageous action to to take\n'em you know or just\nA shouting out stuff in the middle\nAnd that this was an outrageous action to to take 'em you know or just\nA shelling out stuff in the middle class if I had a funny joke I Would just say it's a ... you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I thought I have I Want to say this thing so I'm going to say it\nAnd I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and say this funny thing and when it was not okay\nI thought that was more of a symptom of being a comic then attention deficit disorder [noise] well\nI think those things are related a little bit for me at least I'm ... I don't necessarily know the difference I mean you know the problem with ADHD and other a mental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not oh you have this thing therefore you're this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this\nPrecisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas and it's hard to say yes am I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have\nYou know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps in what does this mean I I still am not quite sure\nWhat was TV like a safe space for you or you can like unless yourself and television and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of\nWhat you were consuming than the natural world and the reason why I ask that is that like there are so many pop culture references and bow jak horsemen and some of them like just like whiz by you and it happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them\nUm so it made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when you were growing up\nWell TV made sense to me and you know there is a a correlation and causation chicken or egg conversation to have here but on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it right even if it was maybe\nCorrelation and causation chicken or egg conversation to have here but on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it right even if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation there definitely\nWas a period in my life where I thought of the funny thing even if it was mean even if it was inappropriate if I thought it would get a laugh from an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this scene that I was living in\nFeel like the scenes that I was seeing on TV and that was a a real lesson that I had to learn um and I think what's been helpful is being a writer and having an outlet and now if I Am in a situation I think of the funny thing I\nCan write it down and say oh I'm going to hold onto this and I'll have a character say it later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment or if I think it was a funny situation you know oh wouldn't it be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or if someone came in here and did this\nI can save and go you know why would I give us away for free in this moment I'll I'll get paid for by putting it in a story later so having those outlets has been tremendously helpful for me\nYou know I'm thinking now the comedy central is is running bow jak witches Netflix series now that Comedy Central is rain yet starting with season one\nUm what's that like for you because you in retrospect for like some of the jokes in season one were misguided and now it's getting like a brand new life [laughter] cable\nYou know it's it's been interesting because we're we're actually editing some of the episodes down to you know add commercial breaks and making under the right time for Comedy Central and you know obviously want them to keep their\nDignity as an episode of television not edited out anything too important but as we are looking for cuts one of things I'm looking at is is this joke still funny to me or would this scene work without this moment and if it does sometimes we'll take\nThe cuts one of things I'm looking at is is this joke still funny to me or would this scene work without this moment and if it does sometimes we'll take those moments out um but I also think look this is the show and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "17"}
