before applied pressure\nYou know I feel that we've had this grand bargain with China for a long time in which\nUm we knew these things were going on and we would talk with the Chinese about it and yet we wouldn't apply the leverage because we were also benefitting from the relationship we were getting less expensive goods consumers were happy companies were making money even political leaders\nTheir voters were getting a less expensive product and stretching dollars and it just came to a tipping point er and and so now we're applying pressure\nUh so I I think the approach that we're taking we have to the U.S that is has to come with the idea that OK you've been doing these things but we have been more or less complicit because we really didn't apply pressure until very
