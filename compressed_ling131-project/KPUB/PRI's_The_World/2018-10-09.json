global climate and how it impacts hundreds of millions of people around the world it means a whole lot\nScientists have been looking at how we might keep the warming of the planet to one point five degrees Celsius\nAnd researchers who just put out a new United Nations report on climate change say that goal it's still possible but limiting warming to one point five degrees Celsius or about three degrees Fahrenheit would require huge changes to transportation land use and urban infrastructure that are unprecedented in human history we\nReally need to start working very hard right from you know if we're not going to see the options slip away so the message is indeed a very strong\nThat was Jim ... from the UN's inter governmental panel on climate change which released the report the rules Carolyn Beeler is here to tell us more about it this report found as possible to reach that one and a half degrees Celsius target but just how hard would it be\nHard as you mentioned that reports authors hundreds of them wrote this Freddie inter governmental panel on climate change is that there is quote no documented historic precedent for the scale of the economy wide changes we'd have to make to cut emissions enough to keep global warming to one point five degrees Celsius that's because we have to cut carbon in this\nThat was Jim ... from the UN's inter governmental panel on climate change which released the report the rules Carolyn Beeler here to tell us more about it this report found as possible to reach that one and a half degrees Celsius target but just how hard would it be\nWell hard as you mentioned the report's authors hundreds of them wrote this for the inter governmental panel on climate change said there is quote no documented historic precedent for the scale of the economy wide changes we'd have to make to cut emissions enough to keep global warming to one point five degrees Celsius\nThat's because we'd have to cut carbon emissions roughly in half in roughly a decade and would actually have to reach net zero emissions and just Thirty years\nI just want to underline how hard that would be to do it basically means that we have to reduce carbon emissions enough by twenty fifty that anything we met we can then sucked back out of the atmosphere by planting trees are taking other steps so that would be a huge undertaking\nYeah I mean people are already talking about how hard it is why Carolyn has this report focus exclusively on the differences between one and a half Celsius and too so it's in other words this is the difference between about three degrees Fahrenheit versus three and a half degrees Fahrenheit\nBecause those are the two numbers that are written into the twenty Fifteen un climate change agreement so for a long time two degrees Celsius with sort of thought of as this kind of goal\nBut in Paris at the un conference in twenty Fifteen low lying island nations and really vulnerable countries like the Marshall Islands in Bangladesh banded together to push for this more ambitious target to be written into this global document so they got it in their\nBangladeshi climate advisor ... we'll talk with one of the people working behind the scenes to get that more ambitious target written into that taxed\nAt that game it was more of a moral argument that we wanted to save all on the planet and love just some people on the planet but what we have enough\nSo the U.S was sort of thought of as this kind of goal\nBut in Paris at the un conference in twenty Fifteen low lying island nations and really vulnerable countries like the Marshall Islands in Bangladesh banded together to push for this more ambitious target to be written into this global document so they got it in their\nBangladeshi climate advisor ... we'll talk with one of the people working behind the scenes to get that more and dishes target written into that taxed\nAt that game it was more of a moral argument that we won't get disabled people on the planet and love just some people on the planet but what we have no is a very very sort of scientific assessment of how much damage seemed to me he's going to be to the whole world is just for people on the planet\nYou okay so what would two degrees Celsius due to the whole world\nThis report spells out some really significant differences even though one point five and two degrees don't sound like that far apart for example um ten and a half million more people would be impacted by sea level rise under two degrees and hundreds of millions more people would frequently face extreme heat waves\nUm natural habitats would shrink for a lot more animals\nAnd coral reefs would be all but destroyed whereas under one point five degrees of warming some would still be around\nYou and twenty fifth is just around the corner so this is this is really sobering news um and like so much of what we hear about climate change kind of depressing where's the hope in this report [noise]\nI think people like ... in Bangladesh who've been pushing for this one point five degree target for a long time would say they're happy that it's still technically feasible to reach that\nAlso that this report that so thoroughly documents the differences in real human experience between one point five degrees and two degrees will help focused even more on that more ambitious target which I'll do it would be very difficult to reach I think that increased focus would be seen as a positive by a lot of people [noise]\nKind of depressing where's the hope in this report\n[noise] well I think people like ... ... email ... in Bangladesh been pushing for this one point five degree target for a long time would say they're happy that it's still technically feasible to reach that\nAnd also that this report that so thoroughly documents the differences in real human experience between one point five degrees and two degrees will help focused even more on that ... target which I'll do it would be very difficult to reach I think that increased focus would be seen as a positive by a lot of people\nThe world's Carolyn Beeler there the winners of this year's Nobel Prize in economics or to American scholars who make connections between climate change and economic growth\nThe royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said that William Nord house and Paul Romer were picked for their work on the most basic and pressing economic issues of our age\nNord house as a pioneer in environmental economics he started warning policymakers in the Nineteen seventies that their economic models were failing to take the impact of climate change into account\nNew York university professor Paul Romer helped create the modern approach to understanding innovation and how it relates to economic growth\nHe joins us now from NYU Stern school of business uh first of all professor congratulations I have you had a chance to speak with your fellow winner William nor does no\nI haven't I just wrote one of his nephew hoping that I can find out how to get in touch with Bill it's really a terrific honor to be linked together with him he's just a great scholar and exceptional lead decent guy couldn't ask for better association\nSo your work is linked to the work of Dr Norton house how would you describe your work\nWe're both interested in not the kind of trade off that's common and economics like we can use this field to produce a little more corn or a little more wheat what Bill and I were focused on is the huge gains that income\nOne of his but like a nephew hoping that I could find out how to get in touch with Bill it's really a terrific honor to be linked together with him he's just a great scholar and an exceptionally decent guy couldn't ask for better association\nSo your work is linked to the work of Dr Norton house how would you describe your work\nWe're both interested in not the kind of trade off that's common and economics like we can use this field to produce a little more corn or a little more wheat\nWhat Bill and I were focused on is the huge gains that can come from discovering new things the real source of progress for humans has been the discovery of new ideas that gives you more of both corn and wheat so that's a unifying element in what we do [noise]\nYou know we have our own different specialization bill is really the one who's focusing explicitly on climate change but you know I'm very supportive that work and I firmly persuaded that the real key to addressing the ... of the energy system will be technological progress\nAnd the key to policy right now should be to encourage this amazing machines for discovery we have in the modern economy just encourage that to go tackle this very important problem\nSo it sounds like your body of research looks at the discovery of new things part of technology can you talk about how that overlaps with the work of Dr ... with climate change\nThere is a very simple model that would say something like oh the government supports basic scientific research by bit given grants to university professors than the private economy puts that knowledge to work\nProfessors love that story because it involves the government giving money to professor so you know [laughter] they're they're keen on that but the truth is that most discovery and most learning comes from the ...\nResearch looks at that discovery of new things part of technology can you talk about how that overlaps with the work of Dr ... with climate change\nThere is a very simple model that would say something like oh the government supports basic scientific research by been given grants to university professors than the private economy puts that knowledge to work\nProfessors love that story because it involves the government giving money to professor so you know they're they're keen on that but the truth is that most discovery and most learning comes from the work on specific problems and the academics often come along later and kind of clean up afterwards\nLike when people started working out how to use steam engines to do work\nIt was much later that physicists came along and invented thermodynamics to figure out you know what the heck are these guys doing so it wasn't like thermodynamics led to the invention steam engines steam engines led to their Monday nights there was a real advantage to creating incentives for start ups and firms to go out and try and make a business in this area\nAnd so I think both villain I Would recommend a kind of attacks on say carbon based energy sources\nYou need to use government policy to unleash this machine for discovering which is the modern accounting professor what's next for you I went to the world bank right after the vote on Brexit that was the summer when he's sixteen\nYep yep that for me was a real red flag there were many things going on there were still trying to understand that part of what was going on is there a lot of people who basically said if the economists are for or against it so it's a whole lot of people say of what kind of us are for or against it\nWent to the world bank right after the vote on Brexit\nBut it was the summer's twenty sixteen yep yep that for me

from a spy and Russia so you know maybe not you can't find his birth certificate right because maybe that's all the information is hidden away forever but again these spies have realized too they have a family they have kids\nSo you can find information that would track back to them so\nI mean yes maybe some of this kind of spy Ware but a lot of very very basic routine research on this stuff you learned and you know high school or college or you know searching looking for in interesting details and cross referencing them and see what's on your matches up\nNow that you've got a name what else were you able to find out about Dr Alexander Michigan like do have evidence that he was working on behalf of the Kremlin\n[noise] yeah I mean this guy is listed his registered addresses as the headquarters of the cherry which went first glance it's absolutely insane like why would a secret spy list his public\nAddress like on his driver's license to address the you know see I ... the equivalent of the CIA well he did it because uh you know if he gets pulled over in his car the cop pulls up his address and he sees the address of the you know the Russian CIA more or less and he's like oh actually no everything's me up and up you can just go you know\nName what else were you able to find out about Dr Alexander Michigan like do have evidence that he was working on behalf of the

I'm an air traffic database we found is three hundred and five men all between the ages of twenty five and fifty you all have the same register to address that just says one address in Moscow so all these men almost certainly are often you that you are you\nAnd they all lifted their vehicle registration as his address 'cause they just don't want to pay traffic fines and they get pulled over or they get pulled over drunk driving or speeding the cop just let them go right because they don't want to mess with somebody in the intelligence services so really everything just goes down to laziness and I guess corruption in a way to 'em and that's how ... how are you able to research this um played out\nSo the headline in the guardian on this news intrigued me it said a string of own goals by Russian Spies exposes a strange sloppy and is so what is your take on the possibility that this was not sloppy and his butt intentional that Russia want it to leak who these men were\nI mean I suppose that always possible right because you know every time any investigation ... Russia people always chime in and saying well they wanted you to find it very well if they want us to find a wise no one published this stuff before because you know these insurance registration for these vehicles to the jury you headquarters\nYou know they've been doing this for years and years and years and years and registering new agencies address same like Jerry you address it again it makes no sense when you think about it but it all kind of boils down to again just corruption in laziness a few weeks\nIntentional that Russia want it to leak who these men were\nI mean I suppose I always possible right because you know every time any investigation and the information I Russia people always chime in and saying well they want you to find the right well if they want us to find a why is no one published this stuff before because you know these insurance registration through these vehicles to the jury you headquarters [noise]\nYou know they've been doing this for years and years and years and years and registering new agencies address same like Jerry you address it again it makes no sense when you think about it but it all kind of boils down to again just corruption and laziness\nA few weeks ago your website building cat identified as a second person allegedly involved with this ... poisoning I have authorities in the u._k. or anywhere else been in touch with you about your findings\n[noise] um no no no not really at all I mean I don't really have any in I don't think Elliot our founder has any contacts with UK police either um so we don't know what they're thinking for all we know they discovered this all weeks and weeks ago or maybe in this all completely news we honestly have no idea\nYou know just listening to what you said about all the available data that is on line is it impossible to be a spy and the digital age\nIt depends I I again I don't know if I have no idea I've never worked in the intelligence services but I'm sure you can do it in some ways but it's much much harder than ever been before\nThat was our solar with the new site bell in cats together with their partners that the insider and they say they've uncovered the identities of two Russian intelligence officers suspected of poisoning former Russians sought Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the u._k. back in March\nThey say they've uncovered the identities of two Russian intelligence officers suspected of poisoning former Russians sought Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the u._k. back in March and", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "year": "2018", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "09"}
