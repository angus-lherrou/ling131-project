listed on starlight books Facebook page\nMarker worm and you're with the world\nThe story of what happened to the missing and presumed dead Saudi journalist ... continues to unfold how it's been unfolding though that's what we want to focus on right now\nThere's sometimes gruesome details in the case appear to be coming out in a deliberate slow drip courtesy of Turkish officials they're the ones who first put out the story that ... was brutally murdered inside the Saturday consulate in Istanbul to learn more we got in touch with Carlotta Gall dissemble bureau chief for the New York times\nSo Howard took her to visuals getting their information and how are they parsing out what they know\nWell that's what's so interesting is I'd say they've known from the very get go I'm literally from the first day or evening\nWhat happened was that the first week the Turkish\nOfficials 'em all anonymous or asking not because it started reaching out to foreign media which was interesting 'cause it's not usually what they do yeah so that then became a big story in the west and it was clear that that was the aim they want it to be listened in the west they want it to be believed\nSo um it's been so they've been they've been cautious and careful with how they have\nReleased um what they know the details coming out\nThey'd be cautious and careful with how they have\nReleased um what they know the details coming out by drip I'm\nIn a way that has kept it in the news every day\nSo how much of a problem is it for journalists both foreign and Turkish to report the Turkish findings when the people in charge of the scene of the crime the Saudis are not really corroborating anything right now\nVery difficult I mean that's you know and and it remains this mystery in many ways\nThis ... now that's coming out in the Turkish press which we can't completely dark five to one of the one of the things was that the record the audio recordings maybe came from his apple watch\nThat was quite quickly shut down by technical X but I'm the photos that were released of the fifty and Saudis who are being accused of being the scored who flew in the sense that day and flew out that day we had teams in Neal and they were checking ... to try and match them with\nOpen source material social media and stuff and so on we found people who\nAre easily recognizable from a you know the entourage of uh the crown prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salman they caught on um you know photograph news agency photograph so those are the things we able to match up there are others that it's difficult to work out who they are\nThese leaks ah have gotten a lot of attention in part because the killing is reported to be hideous and a ... he was tortured some are going to see this as a threat not something that went around by ... in your reporting have you come close to understanding this\n[noise] um no not yet I mean I think the first we need to find what exactly happened and then perhaps we move on to why and why in this way\nBut first we need to find what exactly happened and then perhaps we move on to why and why in this way but\nYou know this wasn't a a a shooting in a dark alley um that could be pinned on a new one this was a very brazen attack and so I think the Turks have been tucked should that as a threat against them against our own government and president out on himself so that's why that particularly in range I think\nAnd so now people are looking at the relations between turkey and Saudi Arabia which although the sudden diplomatic different as they do have differences considerable difference it\nAnd so now you see in the pro government columnists quite a lot of anger spilling out a victory and demands that um the crown prince you remove so it's it's gone going very high\nCarlotta Gall the New York times bureau chief and assemble thanks very much for being with us pleasure to be with you\nMm\n\nHurricane Michael is gone but the recovery is just beginning Michael tore through the south east us last week a powerful storm likely made even more powerful by climate change\nAmong the places that took a direct hit ten dull air force base in Florida to know just one of many us bases around the world that are vulnerable to be growing impacts of climate change\nBut as the world's Carolyn Beeler reports the military is not tracking those costs\n[noise] have metal ripped off at ... in the air force base and one air he says like stripped his voice [noise]\nWind also smashed buildings in ... and flipped over fires if for roofs off of airplane hangar and damaged efforts\nThe wind also smashed buildings in piles of lumber and flipped over cars it's for roofs off of airplane hangar\nAnd damaged F twenty two stealth fighter jets worth more than three hundred million dollars each\nMore than a week later officials are still surveying the damage but when they're done the repair costs will not be added to any running tally of military spending related to extreme weather or climate change because that doesn't exist\nI think it is fair to say that the military does not know what the costs of climate change will be going forward\nThat's John konger he oversaw environmental policy and managed facilities for the department of defense during the Obama administration last year the government Accountability Office recommended that the military start tracking the cost of extreme weather and climate change at all their installations ...\nWrote that recommendation for the watchdog agency we think it's important to capture the distinction between a normal\nMaintenance or repair versus the closer College of a severe storms show that it helps to guide future adaptation projects\nLook or give it a lot easier to justify the cost of an adaptation project like strengthening a hanger roof if you know how much you've spent repairing hangar roots in the past and how much more you might spend in the face of increasingly intense storms and he points out it's not just about the money\nWe have military bases to support a military mission and if the base is out of commission by definition if not supporting the military mission\nThe department of defense responded to the watchdog agency is called to track climate and extreme weather class by saying no thanks\nActually they did say all of them are they responded that quote associating a single event to climate change is difficult and does not war at that time and money expended in doing so four or five years ago\nThat quote associating a single event to climate change is difficult and does not war at that time and money expended in doing so\nFour or five years ago that statement was correct\nTrevor ... is with the economic research company Rudy andme group\nThe science was not yet at a point where that kind of attribution was possible but thanks to a lot of research work over the past few years we can do it\nScientists still don't usually say a specific drought or hurricane was caused by climate change but they can say for example that an individual drought was twice as likely because of climate change or that Fifteen Percent more main felt during hurricane\nCombining that new science with big economic data lets people like Hauser estimate how much climate change will cost investors insurance companies and government agencies\nRight down to a building level to estimate how much more likely it is at a given building a experiences extreme weather events now than it was Thirty years ago and how much more likely it will be in the future and what the price tag of\nFiguring out how much damage climate change is currently costing the military nearly five thousand sites around the world wouldn't be cheap but Hauser says it'd be totally doable\nI mean I don't know exactly what it would cost but I'm guessing it would cost them wash then you know half of a wing of one of six getting fighter\nA department of defense spokesperson told the world they plan and design facilities to address whether an environmental conditions but climate change planning doesn't have that specific budget line however they say they're currently reviewing their climate resilience policies for the world Carolyn Beeler\nCruel asking them their assets since they have seriously nasty and failing to provide houses details meant they had to pay the highest rate five here as a day or child for the school meals\nFamilies would also required to pay two hundred and ten years per child each quarter for the school bus and many obviously ... to do so was talking about migrants will sometimes don't have a job how can afford two hundred and ten\nYears [noise] so what did this mean for immigrant kids like what were the eating at lunch and how do they go to school and how did they get home\n[noise] the thing is that before signing a low the first thing ... he's trying to figure out the consequence of that resolution and convinced they were totally aware my grandchildren will ... being forced to eat separately from their classmates there was ...\nConsequence of that resolution\nAnd convinced they were totally aware migrant children who've been forced to eat separately from their classmates there was these older load that prevents Keats from bringing their own food from home inside their class obviously was a problem for the parents because they were forced to\nTake their kids to school in the morning\nThan some of them were checking their kids back home for lunch and then sending them back\nSo they had to do back and forth from the house to school like three or four times a day to provide their keys some food\nHow have Italians been reacting to this\nThere was a reporter for ... for many ... TV program for first report to the case and they went to low income from that some of the seats and slow the asking them what do you think of the reason you should\nYou know well they were pretty happy with it\nBecause they proceed migrants invaders but things were different you know after a few days when the news got huge and easily and as I say a ... any support that there is that they should but then when he figured it out that a massive crew finding to help the migrant key to the radio race\nSixty thousand euros he said that a ... of assets that being an off to go out on the school meals\nThere was one left wing politician in Italy called this resolution apartheid ah how many Italians feel that way [noise] [noise] yes there is a vision is being described as an op are tied as a form of segregation\nOr that he's the feeling that we are going seriously to fire\nThat think ... are now studying to seeing that you know this is probably the most far right governments in the end of the world war second any Adelie for sure and maybe in ... you know for\nReally the most far right governments in the end of the world war second in Italy for sure\nAnd maybe ... ... you\nKnow for kids it's never easy arriving at a new school and then you face these regulations that alienated from other classmates have you spoken with immigrant families and did they tell you how their kids are dealing with this\n[noise] I did speak to a mother ... she came from Tunisia and she was telling me that she fell you mediated she felt\nYou know she was angry she was seriously you know disappointed and humiliated by a little time by politicians were totally aware of the conditions of migrants in lowly\nSo they felt the was injustice and it's very hard for them to express their anger and frustration because often they are invisible any of the\nInterior minister motel solving supported this resolution but then backtracked as I said has the mayor of Modi also backtracked\nNo she didn't know she didn't she said that she will come see either a self suffocation or the federal yes as as a way to guarantee school meals the kids but she said that she was ... there is an issue\nGuardian reporter Lorenzo ... thank you thank you speaking\nOf things that sound wrong imagine a TV show like cops but for ice as an immigration and Customs Enforcement you know show would follow ice agents around as they conduct raids looking for suspected undocumented immigrants\nAnd the purpose of this TV show that sensibly entertainment you may be surprised to hear that a TV show much like that does exist in Japan Nevin Thompson has seen it he's Japan editor for the online news ... news organization global voices\nWell it's like a typical uh reality talk show in this case immigration officer\nNews ... news organization global voices\nWell it's like a typical uh reality cop show in this case immigration officers go out and seek out um I guess these over stairs or people who are\nWorking against the terms of of their views in Japan and stake out people you're there with them in the car um they capture them interrogate them and then um as the title of the show suggests there deport him in the next plane type thing\nWow what what's the name of the show either in Japanese or translation and English\nIn Japanese it's called that high killing all shooting Kahn which I guess translate says caught at the moment the deportation wow minutes actually modeled on another a cop show it uh in Japan called a title no shooting kind which is like caught at the moment of arrest sounds like a trend\nWell yeah I mean there's a lot of these shows everywhere in the world you know I'm In Canada where I'm from for example uh we had a show like this that uh Canada border services agency collaborated with with the producers and actually the Kenyan government help funded and so they would go out and look for so called illegal immigrants and stuff like that very tasteless\nAnd it was only taken off the air because of the uh it'd be contravene privacy regulations Canada\nWhat is the tone of the the Japanese program and what were your impressions of it\nWell I mean it's it's very literate and breathless um when you eat you basically have a a Japanese person I'm narrating what's happening it's it's it's kind of odd because like their tone is very tricky and in writing pleasant so now the the immigration agents are on their way to the\nThe dormitory where some Vietnamese a guest workers are suspected of of of hiding out in and then they sort of narrative and say it's a very um you know cinema verite say you're you're with ... with them in the car there is a a camera you know you're driving down the road it's kind of odd because like because Jeff Japan also\nVery ... you're you're with ... with them in the car there's a a camera you know you're driving down the road and it's kind of odd because like because Jeff Japan also has very stringent privacy regulations\nYou can't really show anybody's face and so everything is blurt out including the like the neighborhood where it is 'cause like like say if you show the neighborhood\nOr the people who live there would probably complain in ... criticized and so it's just like this is like an hour and a half of what worry blurt out images you can't see people's faces and voices are disguised as quite an odd program\nThis was a two hour episode aired earlier this month is that a one off or are they going to be more episodes that follow these migrant raids and deportations\nI imagine there probably will be um because uh the the program did to cooperate with ah the Tokyo branch of the national immigration girl\nSo they they I mean there's people who put a lot of time and effort into set in this thing up and and just also because the the immigration bureau is going to be elevated status to an immigration agency and get more resources I'd assume is going to be some work PR efforts like this too\nI gather there's been some backlash to the show in Japan what have active it's been saying well\nI mean yeah at least on line there was considerable backlash from\nAnti racism activists who are very well organized in Japan Japan is a very vibrant anti racism a movement and so yeah they they basically said a turning this into the entertainment like why why you showing people being deported\nHow can this be entertainment and then um be the mainstream media picked it up so you know various newspapers ran articles about you know how degrading the show is\nI mean is it shot and friday 'cause I mean like ... the bad guys aren't really bad guys they just are looking for a job and you know trying to stay a little longer to make some money and overstay their work permits well I mean\nGuys aren't really bad guys they just are looking for a job and you know trying to stay a little longer to make some money and overstay their work permits\nWell I mean I guess it would be the obvious appeal is racism because people I suppose have biases about people from other countries the uh they don't speak our language or they look a bit different and\nAnd they're coming over here and in taking our jobs type thing so I I but personally I I'm not sure like uh I think is just to kind of a ... kind of a cheap TV to watch\nI remember the cop show theme song ended it by getting samples all over the place that they have a a catchy theme tune that everybody's not singing\nYeah I mean I I guess you might think also we live in a time when around the world I think people are feeling less secure than ever before just because of a say for example Donald Trump for\nBrexit or invasion of Crimea so maybe people are just feeling I'm less secure in their own country is so perhaps these sorts of shows provide some reassurance that\nSomeone is doing something to protect us here\nNevin Tom Cindy Japan editor for global voices thank you very much for telling us about this a somewhat bizarre show oh You're welcome was great to talk with you\nAnd [noise]\nChanging leaves and climate change that's just ahead you're on the world\nSupport for the world comes from babble language ... that
