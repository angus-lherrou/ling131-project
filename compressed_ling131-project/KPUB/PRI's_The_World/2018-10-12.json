exception is in trade secrets for our companies that remains probably the biggest area of ... intellectual property that is difficult to protect why\nBecause there isn't a proper legislation on this

of issues but if you listen to President Trump you might think it all boils down to one thing dairy products from Canada\nThey've treated our farmers in Wisconsin and New York state that a lot of other states\nVery badly the new trade deals still needs legislative approval but it would give us dairy farmers more access to Canadian markets Jason Margolis went to Ontario to hear from farmers there\nPhilip Armstrong's family has been farming in ... Ontario for a very long time\nOr family has been on this piece of land is Eighteen sixty nine\nObviously dairy farming has evolved a lot since then it's also made a huge leap sends Armstrong graduated college thirty seven years ago today each have is three hundred and eighty cows whereas a high tech color we watch is twenty four cows getting milk and the computer measures they're out for\nThe call or that they have on them see his id but it also measures her eating habits on an individual ... measures for room in the stomach flu was to make sure that that's going well [noise]\nIt measures are lying down time and measures are activity\nThat technology with better breeding and nutrition and Armstrong says his cows are nearly twice as productive as for decades ago\nThis might seem great but it's also created a problem for the world's dairy farmers they're producing too much milk so to keep things in check Canada has a system called supply managed\nThey're producing too much milk so to keep things in check Canada has a system called supply management\nEach farm has a quota and that's our share of the Canadian Marc\nThey match supply with consumer demand as part of its supply management system Canada also places high tariffs on foreign dairy imports up to about three hundred percent that's what's enraged President Trump\nCanada does lead in some American dairy before terrorists kicking and that's part of the updated NAFTA Canada would open up a few percentage points more to the Americans you go\nOkay well so much growth in income we're giving up that allows us to modernize to expand so it's frustrating for us as dairy farmers\nAnd perplexing the dairy trade between the U.S and Canada is a sliver of overall trade between the two nations and Armstrong is annoyed that President Trump singled out Canadian dairy as the problem\nHe was distorting the facts or maybe didn't understand the fact that I don't know and so\nIf we were hurting their dairy farmers well Americans had a six hundred million dollar surplus with us but he got into his head that we were mistreating their farmers\nMany American dairy farmers agreed with President Trump and applaud him for standing up for them they point out that Canada also recently redefine some of its milk products which could effectively shut out American products\nTheir pain is real thousands of small American dairy farms have shut down in recent years it's not all because of Canada far from it they'd been squeezed out by consolidation corporate agriculture global competition and low prices\nPeople are also consuming less milk a lot of male cat in the past has been a dumped because it couldn't be processed and in an appropriate time\nSays people are also consuming less milk a lot of male cat in the past has been a dumped because it couldn't be processed and inappropriate time or sold and extreme discount Brian Gould is a\nProfessor of agribusiness at the University of Wisconsin well us dairy farmers maybe in a bad place ... says the U.S shouldn't be telling Canada how to manage its agriculture\nWe have no right to do that I I really think we're on thin ice when we demand that they'd get rid of their quota system\nGold says think of the reverse Canada telling us to dismantle its production system the U. S. government sets the minimum price for milk and provide some subsidies us also has its own high tariffs on certain dairy products sour\nCream for instance it's I think it's I don't know exactly it's like\nGrand Lloyd the c._e._o. of the dairy farmers of Ontario couldn't put his finger on the exact amount the U.S sour cream tariff is one hundred and eighty seven percent\nAnd Lloyd says there are a lot of other us dairy tariffs on other cheeses and now you have like fifty percent terrorists Lloyd says this whole milk spat with Canada it's just politics\nWisconsin being a significant important state to the Republicans namely obviously Speaker Ryan and it was a state that carried Trump became a political lightning rod and that is what started the whole process\nBack on the farm fill up arms says the new NAFTA agreement doesn't address the fundamental problem American farmers are producing too much milk and Armstrong believes opening a little bit more of Canada won't make a dent in that\nYou know I feel for the dairy farmer in the United states if daughter has what happened is ... a fear but it has no impact on their on their wellbeing it all\nPlenty of Wisconsin in New York farm or see things differently they're glad\nWhat were his ... year old and there will be it'll again plenty of Wisconsin in New York former see things differently they're glad to have more access\nThe Canadian markets still there's an ironic twist here many American dairy farmers and organizations are actually now looking into a supply management system of their own similar to Canada's for the world Jason Margolis Khalid on Ontario ... from\nThis week we've been obsessed with what could be a murder story the victim Saudi journalist on October second Jamal ... entered the Saudi Arabian constantly in Istanbul and has not been seen since we're not the only ones obsessed\nInside Saudi Arabia and outside I think we're all trying to figure out what has happened to him\nSo how ... is a Saudi journalist and filmmaker who made a documentary critical of Saudi Arabia she also new Jamal ... like him she lived outside the Saudi kingdom because she says speaking up can get you in trouble with the authorities there\nDissidents human rights activists or even just simple critics of what's going on that area for the past few years have been put in prison\nTaken from different countries and brought back to Saudi Arabia and so Japan is the highest profile of something that's been going on inside Saudi Arabia for more than a year now let's say and that's the scary thing\nIs also a tell us again what happened to you after you produced a documentary\nSo that the government officially accused me of supporting terrorism and so this shows a lack of understanding of the Saudi Government itself of what is independent journalists because there isn't anything called independent journalism in Saudi Arabia and so like for a lot of people even when I was being interviewed about the film there\nWere like how would you like to be identified argue Saudi dissident and it's like no I'm a journalist\nWas covering a story but because there is no such platforms inside Saudi Arabia where you can say these things we all\nSaudi dissident and it's like no I'm a journalist\nWas covering the story but because there is no such platforms inside Saudi Arabia where you can say these things we all become dissidents inadvertently and there was no other space\nAnd this is the problem with with with how the Saudi Government a ceiling with everyone right now they are shutting down even the my oldest of comments and critique\nAbout their policies and so they've left no room for us they've left no room for us to be able to properly cover stories and then they love criticizing journalists for not understanding what's going on in Saudi Arabia and so it's a lose lose situation for us\nHas has the government clamped down harder since Mohammed bin Salman a came\nI Can't lose her absolutely on everyone just what I mean like ... before you could be a human rights activists on for example women driving or being critical of the economic reform in Saudi Arabia\nAnd there wouldn't be as much backlash as now we fought like a lot of the activists that had been arrested before the ban was lifted that that would be released by now but instead of being released a lot more pressure has been put on them and they're using them or ... it's\nInsane ... is a Saudi journalist and filmmaker we've been speaking to her from Washington I think he's often they can ... [noise]\nIn flight and that initiated the emergency abort sequence and the capsule that they were writing on performed what's known as a ballistic reentry and that's when you come in at a much steeper angle when you land on earth\nSo I think they experienced nearly seven jeeze which is seven times earth gravity so pretty intense flight but they landed safely and they were able to be reunited with their families and ultimately it was a good and happy ending\nSo how high were they when they had to start doing it and\nI Believe they're about thirty miles up so they weren't quite in space yet but they were almost there the astronaut noted that they experienced a moment of weightlessness which you're not supposed to be feeling at that part of the flight and I think that had to deal with the fact that there were\nNo longer connected with the booster and then at that point they start spinning and the ... century and then they're parachutes deployed to slow them down to that they could land

pressed up\nAnd it feels like something is pressing down on you like a mattress I didn't experience nearly the level that they did but just imagine kind of feeling like you're pressed up against something you're feels so much heavier that's what they were feeling and it can be pretty intense\n[noise] are there any new details about what might have caused this problem I don't know if\nThey've traced the exact origin but I Believe something happened during the stage separation so when rockets launched pieces of hardware shed a way to save on weight and the Soyuz has four main boosters\nAround the center core and they were supposed to break away but Russia things that maybe there was some contact\nBetween one of the boosters and the center core we're when really they are supposed to separate completely this was the sixty ... of this particular Soyuz rocket so it's been around for decades [laughter] I don't know if they know what caused that contact but I think that's the leading theory at the moment [noise]\nNone of us in Russia there frequently in a specially these days when it comes to geopolitics but they cooperate frequently when it comes to space flight why is that\nNASA has been kind of shiny beacon of hope in our relations with Russia and I think it's just because when it comes to space we cannot let geopolitics inter now it definitely creeps into other aspects\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine that kind of sparked a debate about whether or not the military should use Russian rocket technology to launch satellites into space so it has\nHad an impact on other parts of our space infrastructure but when it comes to NASA we just can't let those things get in a way we need then at the moment because the soy is is the only way to get humans to the international space station so we have to continue cooperating and hopefully not that Russia will let geopolitics getting the way that\nIs significant setback for the international space station\nAnd hopefully not that Russia will let geopolitics getting the way that\nIs significant setback for the international space station\nI Would say it's definitely concerning about the nation's future we currently have three astronauts into orbit on the station and they are going to have to come home eventually\nThey got up there and it's the way it is as well and the Soyuz capsule can't last forever and orbit they have a few hundred or below the lifetime and we're about a hundred and thirty days\nInto that so they are slated to come down in December they could probably stretch that to January but not very long so either they're going to have to come down soon or Russia could possibly launch an empty Soyuz capsule and send that up to the station and give them an extra two hundred days to stay on board\nBut that hasn't been determined yet we don't know if that's actually going to happen it just depends on what the investigation finds\nLauren ... is senior science reporter for the
