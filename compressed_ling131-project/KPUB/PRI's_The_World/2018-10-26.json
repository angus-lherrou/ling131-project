weaker language is now something that's forbidden in schools\nThey might see their parents as backward which is what they're basically being taught by the state and we are parents feel as though they have no power to stop that sort of activity\nSo how do harm civilians view their roles in this government project\nSo I found a variety of perspectives it's it's complex because there's hon people

action was politicized\nSo there's a lot of concern there from this older group the newer group of people that I met people that came to the province more recently are much more positive about the approach the state is taking they see it as something that needs to be done has essential or many of these newer folks that I met were wearing lapel pins that had Xi Jinping's face on them or\nThe Chinese flag they call each other comrade or sort of a patriotism fever among them\nAlso seemed as though they enjoyed dominating the spaces of leaders\nLike in a restaurant for instance if there's a long wait for food they would demand that they'd be served first\nSo it seems as though they were taking up the position of the occupier or you know to conquer kinda enjoying the privilege that they now have there certainly are resonances echoes with earlier projects to control unwanted populations\nThe way they train their final solution is lasting stability or long term security but it's quite big we don't know exactly what that looks like it seems as though they're thinking that the whole people for a generation\nEither in the camps or in tight surveillance and then maybe the next generation the young children that are going to these Chinese medium schools now that they'll be able to assimilate into mainstream society\nSo their position is really quite fraught and
