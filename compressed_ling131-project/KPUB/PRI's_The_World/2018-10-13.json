by people hacking into them it's a size five scenario but it may not be that far from reality that\nAt least is the warning coming this week from a new report from the government Accountability Office found that the country's next generation weapons systems can be easy targets for cyber attacks\nThat made some experts in the field to think about the TV show Battlestar Galactica\nIn at an enemy

are themselves classified so nowhere in this report or the weapons systems themselves name\nWe can do that these are everything from jet fighters to anti missile interceptors and an every kind of weapon system that the Pentagon is developing wow\nSo so what kind of vulnerability is did the report find\nAll sorts of vulnerability is the scariest thing I think is that they found that\nBasically an entire generation of Pentagon weapons seems to have been developed without cyber security in mind which means that these aren't necessarily vulnerabilities that are only for high level hackers\nTo

passwords in one case it was as simple as guessing a password and nine seconds\nAnd in some in many cases the DOD\nWeapons developers did not notice that the testers were in their system acting like hackers and they even didn't notice when the testers we're trying to be intentionally noisy to make themselves visible so that they would be found even then they weren't found\nNow to be clear these are weapons systems that are already deployed or are they things that are being developed and are going to be deployed what what kind of time period we're talking about so we are talking about\nSystems that are being developed the reason why this report was done by the government Accountability Office was at the Senate Armed forces committee asked them to look into the ah weapons that

range of issues but if you listen to President Trump you might think it all boils down to one thing dairy products from Canada\nThey've treated our farmers in Wisconsin and New York state that a lot of other states\nVery badly the new trade deals still needs legislative approval but it would give us dairy farmers more access to Canadian markets Jason Margolis went to Ontario to hear from farmers there\nPhilip Armstrong's family has been farming in ... Ontario for a very long time\nOr family has been on this piece of land says Eighteen sixty nine\nObviously dairy farming has evolved a lot since then it's also made a huge leap sends Armstrong graduating college thirty seven years ago today each of his three hundred and eighty cows whereas a high tech color we watch is twenty four cows getting milk and the computer measures they're out for\nThe call or that they have on them see his id but it's also measures her eating habits on an individual ... measures for room in the stomach flu is to make sure that that's going well [noise]\nIt measures are lying down time and measures are activists\nThat technology with better breeding and nutrition and Armstrong says his cows are nearly twice as productive as for decades ago this might seem great but it's also created a problem for the world's dairy farmers\nThis might seem great but it's also created a problem for the world's dairy farmers they're producing too much milk so to keep things in check Canada has a system called supply management\nEach farm has a quota and that's our share of the Canadian Marc\nThey match supply with consumer demand as part of its supply management system Canada also places high tariffs on foreign dairy imports up to about three hundred percent that's what's enraged President Trump\nCanada does lead in some American dairy before terrorists kicking and that's part of the updated NAFTA Canada would open up a few percentage points more to the Americans\nYou go okay well so much growth in income we're giving up that allows us to modernize to expand so it's frustrating for us as dairy farmers\nAnd perplexing the dairy trade between the U.S and Canada is a sliver of overall trade between the two nations and Armstrong is annoyed that President Trump singled out Canadian dairy as the problem\nHe was distorting the facts or maybe didn't understand the facts I don't know and so\nIf we were hurting their dairy farmers well Americans had a six hundred million dollar surplus with us but he got into his head that we were mistreating their farmers\nMany American dairy farmers agreed with President Trump and applaud him for standing up for them they point out that Canada also recently redefined some of its milk products which could effectively shut out American products\nTheir pain is real thousands of small American dairy farms have shut down in recent years it's not all because of Canada far from it they'd been squeezed out by consolidation corporate agriculture global competition and low prices people are also consuming less milk\nThey've been squeezed out by consolidation corporate agriculture global competition and low prices people are also consuming less milk\nA lot of male cat in the past has been dumped because it couldn't be processed and inappropriate time or sold an extreme discount\nBrian Gould is a professor of agribusiness at the University of Wisconsin well us dairy farmers maybe in a bad place ... says the U.S shouldn't be telling Canada how to manage its agriculture\nWe have no right to do that I I really think runs the nice when we demand that they get rid of their quota system\nGold says I think that the reverse Canada telling us to dismantle its production system the U. S. government's sets a minimum price for milk and provide some subsidies us also has its own high tariffs on certain dairy products sour cream for instance\nIt so I think it's I don't remember exactly it's like\nGrand Lloyd the c._e._o. of the dairy farmers of Ontario couldn't put his finger on the exact amount the U.S sour cream tariff is one hundred and eighty seven percent\nAnd Lloyd says there are a lot of other us tariffs on other cheeses and I have like fifty percent terrorists Lloyd says this whole milk spat with Canada it's just politics Wisconsin\nBeing a significant important state to the Republicans a namely obviously Speaker Ryan and it was a state that carried Trump became a political lightning rod and that is what started the whole process\nBack on the farm fill up arms says the new NAFTA agreement doesn't address the fundamental problem American farmers are producing too much milk and Armstrong believes opening a little bit more of Canada won't make a dent in that\nYou know I feel for the dairy farmer in the United states if daughter her for what\nHappened is runner up here but it has no impact on their on their will\n...\n... a fear what were his ... year old and there will be it'll\nAgain plenty of Wisconsin in New York former see things differently they're glad to have more access\nTo the Canadian markets still there's an ironic twist here many American dairy farmers and organizations are actually now looking into a supply management system of their own similar to Canada is for the world Jason Margolis Khalid on Ontario I'm\nThis week we've been obsessed with what could be a murder story the victim Saudi journalist on October second Jamal ... entered the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul and has not been seen since we're not the only ones obsessed\nInside Saudi Arabia and outside I think we're all trying to figure out what has happened to him\nSo how ... ... is a Saudi journalist and filmmaker who made a documentary critical of Saudi Arabia she also new Jamal ... like him she lived outside the Saudi kingdom because she says speaking up can get you in trouble with the authorities there\nDissidents human rights activists\nOr even just simple critics of what's going on Saturday for the past few years have been put in prison taken from different countries and brought back to Saudi Arabia and so ... the highest profile of something that's been going on ... for more than a year now let's say and that's the scary thing\nIs also a tell us again what happened to you after you produced a documentary\nSo that the government officially accused me of supporting terrorism and so this shows a lack of understanding of the Saudi Government itself of what is independent drummer because there isn't\nAnything called the dependent journalism in Saudi Arabia and so like a for a lot of people even when I was being interviewed about the film there were like how would you like to be identified argue Saudi dissidents like no I'm a journalist was covering a story\nPeople even when I was being interviewed about the film there were like how would you like to be identified are you a Saudi dissidents like no I'm a journalist was covering the story\nBut because there is no such platforms inside Saudi Arabia where you can say these things we all become dissidents inadvertently and there was no other space\nAnd this is the problem with with with how the Saudi Government is dealing with everyone right now they are shutting down even my oldest of comments and critique about their policies and so they've left no room for us they've left no room for us to be able to properly\nCover stories and then they love criticizing journalists for not understanding what's going on in Saudi Arabia and so it's a lose lose situation for us\nHas has the government clamped down harder since Mohammed bin Salman\nA came I could lose her absolutely on everyone just what I mean like ... before you could be a human rights activists on for example woman driving or being critical of the economic reform in Saudi Arabia\nAnd there wouldn't be as much backlash as now we fought like a lot of the activists that have been arrested before the ban was lifted that that would be released by now but instead of being released the a lot more pressure has been put on them and they're using them or espionage it's insane\n... is a Saudi journalist and filmmaker we've been speaking to her from Washington Thank you suffer ...

land on earth\nSo I think they experienced nearly seven jeeze which is seven times earth's gravity so pretty intense flight um but they landed safely and they were able to be reunited with their families and ultimately it was a good and happy ending\nSo how high were they when they had to start doing I Believe they're about thirty miles up so they weren't quite in space yet but they were almost there the astronaut noted that they experienced a moment of weightlessness which you're not supposed to be failing at that part of the flight and I think that had to do with the fact that there were\nNo longer connected with the booster and then at that point they start spinning in the ... century and then they're parachutes deployed to slow them down so that they could land safely\nThey're

like something is pressing down on you like a mattress I didn't experience nearly the level that they did but just imagine kind of feeling like you're pressed up against something you're ill so much heavier that's what they were feeling and it can be pretty intense\n[noise] are there any new details about what might have causes problem I don't know if\nThey've traced the exact origin but I Believe something happened during the stage separations so when rockets launched pieces of hardware shed a way to save on weight and the Soyuz has four main boosters\nAround the center core and they were supposed to break away but Russia things that maybe there was some contact\nBetween one of the boosters and the center core we're when really they are supposed to separate completely this was the sixty ... of this particular sways rocket so it's been around for decades [laughter] I don't know if they know what caused that contact but I think that's the leading theory at the moment\n[noise] none of us and Russia they're frequently in a specially these days when it comes to geopolitics but they cooperate frequently when it comes to space flight why is that NASA has\nBeen kind of shiny beacon of hope in our relations with Russia and I think it's just because when it comes to space we cannot let geopolitics enter no it definitely creeps into other aspects\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine that kind of sparked a debate about whether or not the military should use Russian rocket technology to launch satellites into space so it has had an impact on other parts of our space infrastructure\nBut when it comes to NASA we just can't let those things get in a way we need then at the moment because the soy is is the only way to get humans to the international space station so we have to continue cooperating and hopefully not that Russia will let geopolitics getting the way that\nIs significant setback for the international space station [noise]\nLet geopolitics get in a way that is significant setback for the international space station\nI Would say it's definitely concerning about the Asians teacher we currently have three astronauts into orbit on the station and they're going to have to come home eventually\nThey got up there and it's the way as as well and the Soyuz capsule can't last forever and or but they have a few hundred or below the lifetime and we're about a hundred and thirty days\nInto that so there are slated to come down in December they could probably stretch that to January but not very long so either they're going to have to come down soon or Russia could possibly launch an empty phrase capsule and send that up to the station and give them an extra two hundred days to stay on board\nBut that hasn't been determined yet we don't know if that's actually going to happen it just depends on what the investigation finds\nLauren ... is senior science reporter for the verge thanks Lauren\nThanks for having me this next story is also about
