you are now my having portion you are now in east ice meaningful and that you know so it changed the way they can and injustice\nThat my dad had a reporter and you know the economy in Mexico city wrote about ... he bought a remarkable advocate for women's soccer in Mexico mysteriously and brutally murdered ... thank you very much for telling us about motivator no problem thank you\nIt's been three weeks we're still trying to unravel the mystery of Saudi journalist ... disappearance and suspected murder the Saudi Arabian authorities denied having anything to do with it now they admit ... died inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul as a result of a fight\nFew are buying it all along President Trump is facing mounting pressure to punish Saudi Arabia if it did murder ... by the president has been reluctant to do that in part because he says American Jobs are at stake\nSix hundred thousand jobs maybe more than that and we'd be very hurtful to this country if we said oh we're not going to sell it to you so\nHow many Americans would lose their jobs if President Trump stopped selling weapons to the Saudis arms and security analyst William Hartung studies weapon sales at the center for international policy we'd like you to crunch the numbers for us you've heard President Trump's figures\nThe Saudis arms and security analyst William Hartung studies weapon sales at the center for international policy we'd like you to crunch the numbers for as you've heard President Trump's figures he mentioned six hundred thousand jobs in that clip just a moment ago how many us defense jobs actually depend on Saudi Arabia\nWell it's hard to know precisely but you know a year and a half ago the president said it was forty thousand jobs there hasn't been a major platform where they've actually signed a deal since President Trump came into office so\nEven if they you know decided to get rid of some deals and made under Obama we'd be talking thousands or at most tens of thousands of jobs not six hundred thousand or even a million which he said uh the other day as well you know in the economy with a hundred and thirty million people employed\nIt's just a blip I mean obviously if you work in a particular factory where things are built that are being sold to the Saudis it's a different matter but it's for our economy as a whole it's certainly not much and certainly not a reason to arm of murderous regime that's not only kill the journalists but is bombing thousands of people in Yemen\nThe president talks about Saturday contracts Boeing and Raytheon you're saying that those contracts date back to the Obama administration so just tell us how many deals are currently signed and what have the Saudis paid for\nAnd there was some big here in the Obama period\nWhere they offered sixty billion dollars worth of weapons all in a couple of packages so not all of us have gone through by a team fighter planes Apache attack helicopters those happened and those were worth tens of billions of dollars some of that money has already flowed they've started delivering the fifteenth\nSo the money as water under the brand should since already been spent we're not going to see it again that would be hard for them to interrupt a deal that's in mid flow because allegedly they need these systems so what's actually on the table that might changes the deal for a missile defense system called fab\nWhich was introduced during the Trump period and they have yet to agree on the details so in theory the Saudis can say well you know this particular deal\nThad which was introduced during the Trump period and they have yet to agree on the details so in theory the size can say well you know this particular deal we're not going to go through with\nAnd is there any risk if Trump or to ... that in China or Russia would pick up any of the\nBusiness Saudi Arabia's whole military is built on us in UK supplying weapons communications and maintenance and spare parts it would take a long time to turn that around\nSo William just give us the big picture here how important is the defense industry like all the jobs from planning to production and how much of the U.S economy depends on defense goods and how much is that is relying on Saudi Arabia\nWell everything the Pentagon spends accounts for about three and a half percent of our entire economy\nAnd not all that as weapons and then the Saudi peace has a tiny fraction of that less than a tenth of a percent I Would say so it's really for the national economy it's not really important at all it's marginal it's it's really important and very specific places where a particular bomb has built for a particular aircraft\nI mean it's hard to know why President Trump wheels out numbers that actually aren't totally accurate but if you had to guess why do you think he would be bringing those numbers way way up I think\nPartly he likes to show himself in sort of a master dealmaker who's getting the best deal for the American people and the American worker and you can see that as trade policy as well\nBut also I think he's trying to change the conversation away from the crimes of the Saudi regime because he wants to team up with them a and going after Iran\nIs built any mock heads to any what Cirque and polar council and Alaska based in Anchorage but she grew up in ... and she says until a hundred years or so ago there was no permanent village on Sarah chef island her ancestors lived all along this part of the coast and they use the island frequently but they didn't live here year round\nAnd that's the thing that they were kind of semi nomadic um we didn't have permanent settlements and that sort of thing\nBut all of that changed in the early Nineteen hundreds when the U.S government and the Lutheran Church came to coastal Alaska and build churches and schools\nIt was an extension of the colonization process that had already swept through the lower forty eight states Alaska Native people were told they had to send their kids to the new schools or risk having them taken away over time the population of this part of the coast concentrated on Sarah chap island\nSo this thing called development committed these people to a spot which turns out to be directly in harm's way\nThe thing called development committed these people to a spot which turns out to be directly in harm's way\nWorse case scenario of course is a storm comes in it and forces them off that land um this year\nThat's Joel climate again at the Interior Department he set out to get federal agencies to help protect people in coastal Alaska from the threats of rapid climate change ... and other towns were already engaged in planning your own solutions but the sticking point with money\nMoving a whole town is a complicated inexpensive affair one federal study pay the cost of living ... at a hundred and Seventy nine million dollars\nAnd ... doesn't have that kind of money they don't have any kind of money actually forty percent of people live below the poverty line many homes don't have running water but Congress was not supportive of helping them make the move many members weren't and still aren't willing to accept that human caused climate change is even real\nFinding dollars was very difficult we did manage to get some grant money and some grant program spun up but the boys just embarrassingly difficult to find those dollars within the federal government\nIn twenty sixteen right before leaving office President Obama signed an executive order protecting marine resources and the bearing sea and setting up a new structure for helping Arctic communities respond to climate change\nClimate was optimistic that would finally bringing meaningful action for ... and he thought it would stand up under the new Trump Administration\nDespite all the anti climate change rhetoric of these new folks uh I wasn't worried about climate change adaptation because you you know you're\nYou're addressing issues that are very clear in front of you people are being directly impacted by climate change it's not a model it's not a theory it's fact and of course uh\nClear in front of you people are being directly impacted by climate change it's not a model it's not a theory it's fact and of course uh I was being very naive\nLess than four months into the new administration President Trump revoked Obama's executive order the project was dead\nIt was a clear shot across the bow that have a doesn't matter whether you're working on reducing greenhouse gas emissions or protecting people imperil anything that has a with climate change to it ah has to stop\nThen a few months later Clements got reassigned to a totally unrelated job for which he had no qualifications and he wasn't alone\nWhen I found out that dozens more senior executives like me had been reassigned I realized that it was that I was part of a purge\nClimate found a lawyer and filed a whistle blower complaint which is still pending he also wrote an op ed in the Washington Post and started speaking publicly about what's at stake not just his and his colleagues jobs but the people of many coastal Alaskan communities\nI mean government should be scrambling to try and find ways and dollars to get people out of harm's way and find innovative ways to do that it's what government does and that's what's appalling about this\nWhat would you say to people who are like um well it's your problem why should a state of Alaska or the federal government or anyone else help you if you need two hundred million dollars to move go find two hundred million dollars and good luck to you\nYeah well they'll they'll be saying the same thing to Miami pretty soon right so I mean what happens up there\nAre in the face of climate change is an important bellwether for what's gonna happen and the rest of the coastal areas of the United states right I mean we're all American citizens and we have some expectation that we're not on her own right and and that's one of the things that makes this country great\n[noise] I reach out twice to the department of interior\nRight and and that's one of the things that makes this country great\n[noise]\nI reached out twice to the department of interior for comment but they did not respond\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nSo given how tenuous the situation is why don't people just leave ... like if they can't relocate the whole village why don't the residents just go somewhere else no are fair banks or Seattle\nThat's a that's cultural death to these communities each one of these villages is its own distinct culture their own distinct dialect to ask them to just assimilate into another village somewhere a is to ask them to let go their culture entirely which I think is is horrible\n[noise] everyone I met in ... seem to agree on this they want to stay together people here depend on subsistence hunting to feed their families and that food is shared with elders and others who can't go out and hunt\nIn fact people insured rough rely on each other for all of the essentials of life they visit each other when they're sick they take care of each other's kids and they know that their future depends on\nKeeping those relationships intact\nBloated will start to take her ... or ... or ... you know such a way I feel\nThis is Stan Lee talked to the vice mayor of ...\nAnd ... D work community you know it come from families are good for the community like a real big family\nStanley's on the search and rescue team here and he knows better than anyone just how bad things could seem to get he is frustrated by the indifference in Washington\nAre are really read were proven to believe in climate change and all the credit or wife go look at it or ...\n... is a case study in how climate change can't be understood in isolation from history and politics\nChange can't be understood in isolation from history and politics this community is where it is in large part because outside institutions wanted to exert control over these people and their way of life\nThe United states government was very effective when it wanted to make people subtle in this particular place but it's so far proven completely ineffective and helping them to get out now that it's clear they need to relocate\nFor America to earn over ... rural country\nJoke limit says that we're likely to lose at least one coastal Alaskan village within the next ten years it could be ... and it doesn't take much imagination at all to picture it the winds wailing the waves rising in the frigid water rolling and crashing over this island on a dark winter night\nIt's a nightmare scenario and it's completely possible that's why Stanley talk to says they need to relocate and they need to do it together\nWe're not trying to make a new were martial art work during the ... through for them ... to ... a real [noise]\nOn some of the nights in the far north the sun never really sets and the kids have ... for taking full advantage of the endless twilight [noise] eight year old Walter ... takes a break from the swirling kid mosh pit to catch his breath\nAnd ponder the universal rituals of childhood\nBoys [noise]\nThese kids show no sign of getting tired but I'm ready for bed\nAnd as I Walk away the sounds of their pop up playground or\nQuickly drowned out by the war\nA hundred steps two hundred steps\nHundred steps to hundreds stuff\nOne of the climate change buzz words right now is resilience the people that are ... are\nExperts in it they've been practicing it for a long long time and what they're asking for is basically the right to keep practicing resilience they just call it by a different name\nFor the world I'm Amy Martin ...

consultant in Mexico city he's also a former spokesman in the government of president Enrique Pena Nieto\nDanielle thank you for your time happy to talk to you Michael\nYesterday President Trump announced that he would make cuts in U.S foreign aid for three Central American countries Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nThey've been receiving the said since twenty sixteen and it's expected to go down by nearly forty percent in twenty Nineteen that means cutting tens of millions of dollars in financial assistance to the region we wanted to know what that eight actually goes to\nSarah appears is with the migration Policy Institute in Washington\nSo what has this aid been used for what what was it earmarked for and how was it used\nTo use very wide variety of issues I mean one of the biggest issues when you're talking specifically about the northern triangle country is the alliance for prosperity this is a program that arose out of a separate migration crisis that we had in two thousand fourteen when a lot of it in a company and child migrants arrived at our southern border\nPresident Obama at that time and knowledge that in order to really address migration you need to go to the root cause and and look at what's going on in these countries to cause people to to flee and and really have this mass exodus\nThe alliance for prosperity is designed to increase economic prosperity and those countries and strengthen institutions because there's a lot of issues with corruption so that's one of our our major programs going into these countries and and one of the programs that the president you know in reality is threatening to the end\nSo regardless of how much eventually get stripped out of the budget line for a Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador Ken the Trump Administration or any other administration without approval of Congress just slash an aid package to a country [noise]\nGuatemala Honduras and El Salvador Ken the Trump Administration or any other administration without approval of Congress just slash an aid package to a country\nLooking at the law as it might be possible that he has the ability to transfer maybe ten percent of what has been appropriated but no he cannot do that unilaterally and of course because Congress isn't in session now if he really wanted to to end it to these countries he'd really need to wait until they come back in session after November\nAnd Sarah how political do see this movie is it something that Trump believes will play well with Republican voters prior to the midterms\nYeah absolutely President Trump ran on immigration he saw that issue when Hindi election and I think he thinks that it is a good one for Republicans going into the midterms so this caravan effectively as a political gift to him and Republicans\nIn that they can play this up they can play themselves up as the party that is hard line on immigration and that will\nSave the country to quote unquote from this caravan\nTrump made this announcement yesterday have you heard any news from Honduras or El Salvador Guatemala a about what could happen if as much as forty percent of the state gets caught\nI think the northern triangle country in Mexico as well are are doing a good job of trying to\nWeed through what's coming out from the president and what's coming out in the press and and try to stick to what's actually happening on the ground they recognize that we have a very eminent election in the country and they're just trying to stick with what they think will will actually come so I haven't heard a lot of\nReal concern on the ground up around that aid\nAnd just because it seems so unlikely that that Congress would go through with a threat like that\nAnd what is your organization the migration Policy Institute planning in terms of strategy to to take this on anything\nAnd what is your organization the migration Policy Institute planning in terms of strategy to to take this on anything\nFor us we're really looking at those reforms to asylum like I mentioned earlier we actually published a report last month\nAdvocating for certain reforms to the asylum system including changing asylum for individuals who are applying at our border like this care of and so that and it operates more efficiently because right now if if anyone in the care of and apply for asylum\nThey'll likely be placed in our immigration court backlog which stretches on for years so lovely waiting in the United states and the way down the line\nAnd immigration court judge will have to pick up their case and started from scratch and see if it isn't sincere asylum application\nIn reality we'd like to see a a more efficient system operating at the southern border so where we're working really hard to to kind of push out that idea and and stress the importance of granting asylum to those who married at\n... a policy analyst at the migration Policy Institute in Washington Thank you for your time thank you for

and that she had to get them to repeat it to me three times baked in English and Arabic but he said to me over the next year\nAs many as four million people could be displaced because of what the
