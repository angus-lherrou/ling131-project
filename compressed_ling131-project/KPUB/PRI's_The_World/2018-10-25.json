is the world lately things have been pretty tense between the U.S and China and not just over trade and tariffs earlier this month and a major speech vice president Mike Pence took aim at China's leaders\nThere contesting America was geopolitical advantages and trying in essence to change the international order in their favor under President Trump's leadership the United states has taken decisive action to respond to China with American action\nOther areas of friction include the south China Sea Taiwan human rights intellectual property not to mention President Trump accusing China of meddling in the mid term election campaign David Rennie writes the CIA Guam column and the economy is so big question David here is this a new Cold War with China\nIt doesn't have to be on China is extremely keen that it should not be they don't even want to trade will and they are pretty desperate to avoid one and work out what America wants\nBut it used to be just a few hundred line is here in Beijing who saw that America actually\nCouldn't be negotiated with that America wanted to contain China under still China's rise that fringe of hard line is is now spreading an awful lot of Chinese leaders look at the speech by vice president Mike Pence attacking China for a a kind of laundry list of complaints\nThey look at how Donald Trump isn't really engaging when it comes to winding down this\nA kind of laundry list of complaints they look at how Donald Trump isn't really engaging when it comes to winding down this potential trade ... and they're starting to wonder whether that was fear\nMight actually be what's happening to them which is that just as they were poised to become a kind of great superpower or the top of this of economic Tyson poll America in its last kind of\nDying vengeance is a kind of aging heck I'm On has to ... and so that is the that is the question that Beijing leaders ... and they absolutely will not looking for this fight right now that busy trying to become rich and powerful and this has come out of out of the blew up and\nWell the Trans Pacific partnership or TPP that was supposed to give us some leverage with some of those issues like intellectual property rights but Trump pulled out of it\nThat's really I mean those are those ... a retired very senior American officials in Beijing last week and it was all off the record so I Can't name in it but he was a kind of household name and his day and he comes to try and a lot for business or an stokes the Chinese they take advice from him\nAnd he had a small dinner for a group of us in Beijing we're discussing what Donald Trump wants on you know I was discussing having into the Trump the times about trying to understand in DC I kind of put it to him and he was kind of uncomfortable but then said that maybe there was something to this the\nThe problem is that the machine in Washington\nHas kind of systematic structural things but it wants China to do differently to play by the rules to try and fix the world trade older as you say Marco to you know to what was something like the ... everyone opens their markets that will Donald Trump I don't think is a systems kind of guy\nI think he has a number of very powerful very instinctive ideas I think if you look at what he's been saying about China on trade it's almost as if you know he's a real estate guy and he thinks of the American market the American economy as a ...\nIf you look at what he's been saying about China on trade it's almost as if you know he's a real estate guy and he thinks of the American market the American economy as a fantastically valuable piece of real estate\nAnd that previous presidents and America's administrations were too dumb and to kind of kindly to charge enough rent to the rest of the world access to that market and so it's like you know Donald Trump's back in his real estate days he's he he he owns a valuable property this time it's called the United states\nAnd it's time to review the rent and it's not going to be pleasant for the guy on the other side of the table\nBut there isn't gonna biggest structural kind of vision of how to run the world trading older it's just it's time you paid a lot more rent I I think that's the core of what Donald Trump is up to right now\nWhat is China's vision for the world\nSo he's a really interesting thing the Chinese joined the world Trade Organization Seventeen years ago and have basically been gaming the system ever since uh China China is very interesting world power because China has an incredibly\nClear vision of where it wants to end up it has a very clear and gold and you know broadly that's to be one of the world's most powerful to countries and so powerful that no one else gets to say no to them\nTo go how they get that is not actually so important that quite opportunistic if one policy looks block they'll try another if there's too much pushback then there'll be nice for but that's very very kind of cross through by feeding the the Chinese kind of fries and and\nFor a long time they gave me the world trading system and and that was how they liked it well it's really interesting about this last few months to trade tensions and you get this when he talked to a European government leaders have been talking to the Chinese visiting Beijing it turns out that the one thing that the Chinese dislike more than an American led worlds trading older is no rules\nIt turns out that the one thing that the Chinese dislike more than an American led will trading order is no rules a tool\nAnd so suddenly the Chinese are being undermined the rules gave me the rules playing the system so I think they realize that the one thing they don't want to do is to lose the system completely so suddenly the Chinese are quite in the order of reforming the WTO no longer kind of cheating so much so the result is kind of\nThis one of these moving parts where you could actually see something quite positive\n... the problem is\nThat you can also see some very negative kind of forces that could feed off each other and we could go the wrong direction or an absolutely confident Chinese don't actually know how to play this ... because\nReasonably senior Chinese officials are now working their way down to list the people who can explain Washington and they got so low down the list there are people like me and I literally have conversations with what I say I'm opposed to it's not my job to tell you\nYou know how to handle the Americans but they're all skiing everyone\nIs this trade war avoidable Graham Allison over at Harvard coined the phrase a few cities trap tell us what that is and how the Chinese yet\nShe says this was an ancient Greek historian who wrote about when you had a very militaristic rising power spotter coming up against the status quo ... Athens it ended up inevitably the war and so he analyzed a number of occasions I have a human history where\nThe status quo power finds itself being challenged by an upstart\nAnd in a depressing number of cases that does trigger armed conflict I mean you could be an optimist in say the Chinese are busy trying to get rich\nThat trying to become more powerful they are absolutely not looking to solve the Cold War they don't have time for this they don't have time even for trade will let alone a shooting war so they're just not going to stall sentencing um and actually I didn't think told Trump is a particular\nThey don't have time for this they don't have time for trade will let alone a shooting war so they're just not going to stall sentencing um and actually I didn't think told Trump is a particularly militaristic\nMan I mean he's the kind of the guy who got any number of funds from Vietnam I think he's not physically a kind of war like person he's kind of ... soft handed kind of New York real estate guy\nUm so I think as people it shouldn't go to war but the dynamics can get a bit away from you when you've got these two big big countries no longer think that they are\nConfined win win solutions you know this does feel weirdly zero some now it feels as though the American charges that China's rise is at America's expense\nAnd that this was a kind of wouldn't before trying to get so big\nThat it's too late to stop it it's it's a window to try and bend the cup and there was this ... thing Donald Trump said I think it was at the U.N General assembly speech when he said the previous presidents have sort of been ready to watch China rise to become the world's most powerful country and the on his watch\nThat wasn't going to happen quite so see that's a really extraordinary statements and you know previous American presidents said you know if you're going to rise let's make sure you rise in the right way you're going to rise as a responsible stakeholder remember that phrase that people used to use about China that it was going to become a kind of\nA member of the greater good uh uphold the international older along with everyone else but for Donald Trump to say at least as a piece of rhetoric\nThis is a concern all around the globe right now like in Brazil we've been reporting on the heated presidential election runoff in Brazil this weekend\nRight wing candidate ... scenario is facing off against left his opponent Fernando ... died this information and fake news have been huge issues in that race a lot of it is playing out on the messaging platform what's up\nWhich we should note is owned by Facebook you as a direct quarter of a is a Brazilian researcher now in Boston studying all this at Harvard showing student center she's also involved in an effort called ... over a collaboration between twenty five Brazilian newsrooms to identify and debunk fake news\nQuarter of a tells me that the fake stories she's seeing on what's up are out of control\nMake fun actually because the the misinformation campaign in Brazil they sometimes can get upset\nFor all we make fun actually because the the misinformation campaigns in Brazil they sometimes can get absorbed in what way at the are supported and beliefs and fears that are totally\nKnown since like Venezuela I supported by Hezbollah or stuff like this\nAnd I was coming here and I had a discussion with a friend that teaches at Harvard she was trying to convince me that the right wing candidate was the antidote to view not becoming a Venezuela supported by Hezbollah so\n... was a teacher Brazilian she's ...\nShe's president and she probably heard this thing's via watch that\nAnd I I started to last and it was like yeah you know what listen here's the website of control over this is ally this this this is nonsense please you're a teacher at Harvard [laughter] but people believe this thing's\nSo is that one of the rumors that Hezbollah connection with Venezuela is one of the members of spreading on what's happened Brazil\nYes this is bringing you this is fresh room or [laughter]\nThan there are the older still remembers making a comeback as Brazil's president ... seats up\nFor example we had a real more about the last candidate being the creator of something called ... which is supposed to be an indication oak heat to teach kids how to be gay\nWhile the implication being if you vote for the left wing candidate you're going to have ... kids in\nSchools and there will be connections with the government of Venezuela and has a lot of the same time I see what you're saying absurd um just to be clear what definitive links have there been between these disinformation campaigns and I've\n... I see what you're saying but absurd um just to be clear what definitive links have there been between these disinformation campaigns and either political candidate like the charge a gyro both in our own launch those yeah that'll legitimate claim\nThis is a rule more from two thousand twelve it's just you up in the website of the right wing candidate\nHe created this a false information he was a a a member of the the Congress so he took this issue to the Congress and several Congress ... person that are religious they supported him in this story and this became a monster\nBoth in our was also accused of creating another monster a big one last week a Brazilian newspaper reporter that the right wing candidate was working with local marketing firms to buy a bundle of phone numbers\nAnd use them to mask tax propaganda to Brazilians through what's up Brazilian authorities are investigating those claims in the meantime people like you as a record of a are trying to put out the flames

that make\nPeople believe so what I see is that there's an entire system if you look just to watch that uh we're not getting all the picture\nI mean I I I don't want to suggest that Brazil is different from any other place in the world but I mean is there a kind of a cultural thing here with the contagion of these these fake news stories\nYes we have a a social and economic component that need to be taken into account when you talk about fake news and what what are those cars I think we have a huge inequality in poor people are left behind in in so many things including education\nWe have a level of instability that was provoked by the impeachment\nOf Duma that meet people who is a former president ... yeah uh that make ... made people believing in and they don't believe in these
