that her student fees that should not have been revoked and she is now being released and her lawyer is on the way to the airport to pick her up\nSo take us back and remind us what the dilemma was for Israel in for Laura ... who is she in what it is really visuals detain or upon her arrival\nAt the heart of this issue Marco is that Israel passed a law and twenty Seventeen that allows it to bar entry to foreigners who are involved in calling for a boycott of Israel and so it's real estate lawyers said that\nAl ... father is a Palestinian descent and that she was the president of students for justice in Palestine a pro Palestinian group while\nShe was at the University of Florida and she present an ongoing risk of calling for a boycott while in the country and until now the lower courts
