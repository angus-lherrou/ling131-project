officers and you'll have to like could declare stuff like\nGoing through any border in the world except showing your ears show your passport for\nThings like that exactly so if you go and talk with people in Ireland on either side of the border they will tell you this would be very bad first of all the bad for the Irish economy\nAnd they also remember back in the bad old days during the troubles

don't want is a de facto border that runs in the Irish Sea that sort of separates Northern Ireland\nFrom the rest of Britain they don't want to emphasize\nThat divided all between Northern Ireland\nAnd the u._k. yeah so how is all this going to shake out\nAgain this is the conundrum that nobody seems to be able to explain and it's sitting there on the doorstep of of Theresa May the

means that it's slowly slipping away grim Z is currently the only habitable spot in the country touched by the Arctic Circle\nAnd that's drawn tourists here for decades as the Chrysler describes\nWhat they did his you know just when you arrived in the plane is that it was assigned the maid of honor them in your mid ... where the unload the tourists up there and that could walk them around the sly and give them a certificate and send them back home again\nIn twenty Thirteen the local government decided this simple Arctic Circle marker was due for an upgrade so they launched a competition and like Christian said earlier the information they put out said that the Arctic Circle is moving fourteen centimeters a year\nBut stores teen told them it was actually moving a whole lot more than that an average of fourteen meters a year in the spot and at that rate the Arctic Circle only touch currency for a few more decades\nIf I had to leave the Harlem to learn from forties showed one would be the country lizards and\nAfter that the Arctic Circle will leave all of Iceland behind for thousands of years until the earth's axis begins to swing back in the other direction this was not great news for the people have ... they'd always been told the Arctic Circle ran through the middle of their island\nWith when we moved from ... I'm sure this is true [noise]\nSteven Christian realized they had a decision to make cigarettes\nAnd it will leave the island and wasn't forties chauvinist if you go to ... you know\nAfter that the Arctic Circle will leave all of Iceland behind for thousands of years until the earth's axis begins to swing back in the other direction this was not great news for the people have ... they'd always been told the Arctic Circle ran through the middle of their island\nWith when we moved from this old and you saw this is true\nSteven Christian realized they had a decision to me\nThey can ignore the science of how the Arctic Circle actually works and just make another stationary monument in the same old place or they could let this new information reshape their whole idea for the monument and as you've no doubt gassed they decided the complicated facts were much more interesting than a nice easy fiction\nSo so everything is changing sort of things on the move\nSo we had lots of different ways of representing those moments and then gradually it crystallized into something as simple as a sport because it's something you can move and it also represents what we're wrong\nBecause everything that we're talking about or thinking about is actually affected by balls\nOkay so some kind of ball something that rules but also something that doesn't roll too much ... are really windy place\nIt has to have a certain presence of certain physicality a certain weight\nSo an enormous mall of concrete ... tons it's three meters in diameter or about nine feet\nSo it's it's bigger than us now there was the thing that we realized that has to be big enough to be something that you couldn't put your arms rocked it an even if five people link that author it'd be it'd be having a struggle so it's it's something you you can't contain it has its own life\nBut also something that doesn't roll too much ... are really windy place\nIt has to have a certain presence of certain physicality a certain weight\nSo an enormous ball of concrete ... tons it's three meters in diameter or about nine feet\nSo it's it's bigger than us you know there was the thing that we realized it has to be\nBig enough to be something that you couldn't put your arms rocked it's an even if five people link that author it'd be it'd be having a struggle so it's it's something you've you've called contain it has its own life does its own thing and we just have to follow unlike now even though we notice going north this summer it will go south\nYep you heard that right it's even more complicated\nThe Arctic Circle isn't only moving in one direction the moon has one of her to ... says that has the earth's axis ways back and forth about twenty thousand years in each direction there is a much smaller faster wobble happening as well this one is caused by the moon\nOn is should be both Eighteen points to choose\nWhat it comes down to is this the movement of the Arctic Circle isn't a straight line it's a squid all a big line moving in one direction with a bunch of smaller little ... and then just when I thought I really understood what was going on or seen said this\nWas after this one girl comes into his own people remember finger bunker route to use the movements of the U.S crushed this is something we can't predict very accurately\nPieces of the earth's crust are also moving in that throws another wrench in the works I have to say as I was learning all of this my heart kind of went out to Steve and Kristin and the competition organizers it seemed like a simple challenge make a monument to the Arctic Circle on this tiny little line\nWhat was going on or seen said this\nLooks out for this one girl comes into his own people remember finger burger of Arthur's the movement of the U.S crushed ... produced very accurately\nPieces of the earth's crust are also moving in that throws another wrench in the works I have to say as I was learning all of this my heart kind of went out to Steve and Kristin and the competition organizers\nIt seemed like a simple challenge make a monument to the Arctic Circle on this tiny little line the human beings and drawn around the top of the earth\nBut the deeper these two went into it the more complex it became\nBut I think that's also something you accept as you get older you realize that you don't have a girl and everything the older you get the more you realize you don't know\nThis kind of thing happens to all of us this moment when we learn something new that makes everything so much harder and more complicated than we thought and then we have to decide if we're going to take that in our turn away\nThis happens a lot with climate change as we learn about how our own actions are impacting the climate for some of us it can get so overwhelming that will grab on to any alternative story anything that helps us just to turn away\nAnd one of those stories is actually related to this story it's a narrative that says the planet is heating up because of changes in ... and other natural processes not our carbon pollution you may have heard this yourself and wondered\nCould there be anything to that so let's take a quick look\nOf all the earth's climate does of course change naturally the planet has always fluctuated between ice ages and warmer periods and changes in ... are part of what drives that pattern but those changes play out over tens or even hundreds of thousands of years the warming we're experiencing now\nRid of that says the planet is heating up because of changes in ... and other natural processes not our carbon pollution you may have heard this yourself and\nWondered could there be anything to that so let's take a quick look\nFirst of all the earth's climate does of course change naturally the planet has always fluctuated between ice ages and warmer periods and changes in ... are part of what drives that pattern\nBut those changes play out over tens or even hundreds of thousands of years\nThe warming we're experiencing now is happening at lightning speed in comparison we can measure it in decades\nAnd the cause of that warming is clear it's us burning fossil fuels moves carbon into the atmosphere and not traps more heat this is a fact so we have a choice do we try to push it aside so that we don't have to change or do we accept the truth as difficult as it might be\nWhen it came to making this Arctic Circle monument Steve and Kristin chose option number two they open themselves up to the more complicated truths\nAnd it turned out to lead to something pretty darn cool\nThis is a moving to use it for ... which which is nothing you can touch or see I'm not so interesting about the object is following this idea\n\nThe ball is the least important thing about\nThe piece itself is the movement what the bull does is it represents the movement\nHumans don't really like change we like sharp lines from definitions but the actual physical world do not work this way it's really hard to

says that's actually pretty easy to verify and in the case of the Cherokee Nation the process doesn't involve a DNA test\nTracing your native heritage is actually very simple for a lot of people because when the U.S government was attempting to commit genocide on native peoples they documented us meticulously\nNearly two hundred years ago the U.S government agreed on a policy of removing Native Americans from their land American officials defined people as Native American based on their ancestry they called it blood quantum basically what percentage of your blood is native\nAbout two

look around people kind of what you might have ... and all this stuff [laughter]\n\nSome of the messages in lessons and stuff that I get from people say you know you have no idea who I Am I'm not in school I've been through some hard times just want to thank you for your for I think\nIt's quite striking that people to this day still find it you know inspired it's a nice thing and\nUm that I've done something that has helped so many people in there oh why\nEven when they provided us with these statistics they couldn't tell us whether they were talking about the number of individuals or the number of families to separate it that's a big difference and they also went to back to a class action lawsuit under which there'd been about twenty five twenty six hundred families that were separated\nBut it appears that about eight hundred other people were separated beyond what they discuss in this class action lawsuit\nYour report lays out three ways that the Trump Administration policies affect people coming to the U.S for asylum one of those is obviously family separation what are the others well\nThat the Trump Administration was separating families was not just to be cruel it wanted to detain all asylum seekers indefinitely\nIf you're detaining refugees only based on their migration status and they don't present and you kind of risks of society or viscous lean that constitutes arbitrary detention under international law\nAnd then right now along the entire length of the U.S Mexico border\nThe Trump Administration is pushing thousands of asylum seekers back into Mexico\nAnd signs of that it's safe for them to wait there we also found that the U.S authorities have been encouraging Mexican immigration officials to deport this asylum seekers back to the very countries where they fled persecution or threats of death and that's flatly illegal under both US law and international law\nSo there are these three interlocking policies and since we released\nDeath and that's flatly illegal under both US law and international law so there is these three interlocking policies and since we released a report both Republican and democratic members of Congress have come to his asking for more information we're hopeful that\nAs we get closer to the appropriations process that Congress can use the power of the purse to compel the department of homeland security to be more forthcoming\nBack now to Maria the Brazilian grandmother seeking asylum in the U.S with her grandson Brian griffey says Amnesty International was president and Marie is final immigration hearing and it wasn't looking good for\nActually witness as the judge\nSuch compel her in the courtroom to give up her asylum claim in order to be reunited with her grandson with special needs before being deported back to Brazil\nThe implication was all of a sudden I'm claims of merit less right so you're saying we want to close the loop holes but we can reunite you what's your grandson so you don't get deported without um so what you see here is a clear threat of permanently separating the grandmother from her grandson at the threat of being deported without him\nAnd what we saw in terms of both the grandmother and the grandson is it the long term consequences are great she actually had a medical emergency\nWhere she had to be rushed to the hospital because of health deteriorated so much from the mental anguish of being separated from her grandson with special needs and she presented this in court and still they prolonged her attention finally actually it was only when a congressperson bay so O'Rourke got involved that she was released and able to to reunite with her grandson\nWhere our Maria and her grandson today there in Connecticut he's still under state custody she was seeking to move from weekend visits to having guardianship over him again but she has to\nGo through the bureaucratic hoops while she also appeals for asylum claim I spoke with her a few weeks ago and she said you know I Need to go to a psychologist I'm scars a deep I forget what I was saying I Can't sleep at night it was all the symptoms that I've identified when I've worked in war zones but she told me you know that when she first saw him he wasn't being taken care of\nForget what it was saying I Can't sleep at night it was all the symptoms that I've identified when I've worked in war zones but she told me you know that when she first saw him he wasn't being taken care of properly he was in this heavily air conditioned room just shivering saying you know a mommy mommy why did you hear\nAnd that every time they leave each other after a visit all day they both go through the suffering because they're reliving the moment to the separation\nWas emcee international Brian
