origins of lifetime tenure for judges over there\n[noise] yes well this is a country which had its battles are appointment of judges and they must have happened a long time ago so the\nEnglish civil war of the seventeenth century was the midpoint of a century of struggles\nAnd at that point the judges served at the pleasure of the king so that can could dismiss them at any time so when parliament became more powerful it's pasta framework and Seventeen hundred and in that act of settlement it provided that they\nCould no longer dismiss them interestingly\nIt led to assimilate change in the U.S at the time of independence\nLet me just clarify their of so basically the judicial system in in England evolved for the same reason we kind of say here to prevent the demonic bullying judges\nYes that's a great way of putting it um there was some brave judges in the seventeenth century but if we look at the standout cases that were more judges for example denying bail or just arbitrarily imprisoning opponents of the king when that hadn't committed crimes that type of behavior\nWhich was driven by their sheer dismissal one could say looking at the big picture\nAnd today in England or those lifetime appointment still the situation\nSuddenly enough that not so lifetime appointment was the main safeguard for nearly three hundred years but in the Nineteen eighties it was realized that as more judges were reaching advanced\nJudges in the seventeenth century but if we look at the standout cases that were more judges for example denying bail or just arbitrarily imprisoning opponents

appointments still the situation\nSuddenly enough they're not so lifetime appointment was the main safeguard for nearly three hundred years but in the Nineteen eighties it was realized that\nAs more judges were reaching advanced age that I'm a ... cheese curds deteriorate and that's one of the most famous English Czechoslovakian and\nThe leading judge of the twentieth century started expressing some very or socially conservative views and books he was writing and the feeling was that if judges were going to do this at the front edge\nThey could bring the reputation of the courts into district periods so retirement age was introduced it's currently Seventy\nI mean they're more than fifty countries in the commonwealth which are influenced by the English model from India to your own native South Africa and they all evolved in the same direction of ending lifetime tenure\nI guess they have so there are exceptions but there are three small Pacific Island states where judges that typically brought in on a contract basis for this discussion when we're talking about logic countries we can leave them to one side so it's striking that\nThere's no more lifetime appointment in that group of upcoming little countries with the heritage that the u._s. system also shows\nSo here I Am a little confused about where the U.S sits right now so if you consider the systems have judicial appointments or in the countries you've looked at and compare them to the current state of affairs in the U.S would you say the U.S is behind the times\nI I\nWhere judges are typically brought in on a

pressure on individual\nJustices to decide when to retire so Justice Kennedy made a very important decision when he retired now like any of us he's been title to to stop working buck that decision carried far more consequences\nBecause it was his and systems where there's a retirement age a more predictable in that way and sets up less tension between presidents of governments on the one side
