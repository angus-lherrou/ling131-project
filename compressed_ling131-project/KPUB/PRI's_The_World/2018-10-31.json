S. you're automatically a citizen\nIt's not clear if he can do that the concept is enshrined in an amendment to the U.S constitution for the president told Axios he could do away with it unilaterally\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nMartha Jones is a professor at Johns Hopkins university and the author of birthright citizens a history of race and rights so this is all tied into the fourteenth amendment and there was an interesting history behind that could could you talk about what went into forming it\nSure the fourteenth amendment comes in being in the aftermath of the U.S civil war for a million plus former slaves are now free people and the question is who will they be in a formal constitutional sense with respect to the nation\nFourteenth amendment declares them to be birthright citizens but it goes further of course because it extends beyond former slaves to all persons born in the United states making them citizens that the United states\nSo let's talk about that a more in a moment I'm up because it's all part of of your research let's just get into the president's for what we're looking at today\nSo let's talk about the uh more in a moment I'm a because it's all part of of your research let's just get into the president's for what we're looking at today or a prior caseloads can close to defining or interpreting this from the Supreme Court the most important\nCase for thinking about this question is that of a gentleman named belong Kim arc um they just decided by the Supreme Court in Eighteen Ninety eight one Kim ark is born in the United states um his parents are Chinese immigrants who\nCannot become citizens of the United states because of the existing Chinese exclusion acts at the period but long himself assumes himself to be a citizen because he was born in the United states he leaves states to do business in China\nAnd when he returns he's detained at the port and refused entry entry his case goes to the U.S Supreme Court where the court affirms that\nEven as long Kim ... parents cannot become citizens of the United states he because he was born in the U.S pursuant to the fourteenth amendment is a citizen\nIf it wasn't for that generosity I don't really know why the sky hasn't fallen you know at a time like this I have to believe in love I have to believe in the generosity of people\nI have to believe that we don't struggle alone I Would argue that after this horrific horrific\nTragedy I bet you that more people are going to be more willing to help\nA Jose Antonio Vargas his new book is called dear America notes of an undocumented citizen because I thank you\nThank you so much for having me [noise]\nWe have rivers and always full interview with Vargas by the way of the world dot O.

GBH has spent a year looking deeply at how all this has impacted people all around the world they're documentary the Facebook dilemma is airing on PBS this week\nWe want to focus on one country discussed in the documentary the Philippines where president Rodrigo Duterte day is accused of using a coordinated army of trolls to silence critics\nDavid any patriotic phone ring on line see sponsoring and he's you know hiring men can rebate so they say is information that just change democracy and we're allies are prevalent [noise]\nLines James Jacoby worked on this investigation and joins us in the world studios thanks for coming by James thank you [noise]\nUh what is the place of Facebook in the lives of most Filipinos like how much of the population has access to it and how much do they interact with each other via the up well it's remarkable the story Facebook and Southeast Asia is amazing that they pushed aggressively\nDo they interact with each other via the up well it's remarkable the story\nFacebook in Southeast Asia is amazing in that they pushed aggressively into south east Asia and to Philippines and demand more other countries\nAnd they are essentially the de facto Internet and a lot of those countries because they offer Facebook as part of a data plan where people don't actually have to\nUse the data in order to use it and the Philippines it's between Ninety and a hundred percent of the Internet users in the Philippines use Facebook as the Internet basically and Maria wrestler who who's a woman were interviewing in the film from the Philippines who runs a big news organization there she\nTalks about the fact that it's their public space it truly is their public space in the Philippines um in terms of the\nTheir digital lives so Maria ... so we just heard from her more from her in a moment um we've reported on the store that uh occurred in Myanmar where fake news actually lead to violence headed Rodrigo Duterte day the Filipino president weaponize Facebook during the election campaign and twenty sixteen so\nWhat happened is Facebook actually offered a lot of help to deter today during his campaign for president and helped him to really harness the power of the platforms helped his campaign really understand how to use it effectively and as Maria wrestle reports\nAfter he was elected he essentially weaponized it by turning all this campaign machinery all these accounts that he was controlling he had\nA network of fake accounts and paid followers that we're disseminating all sorts of lives about his policies and uh also going after critics in a rather vicious hateful way um and in some cases uh trying to incite violence against people\n[noise] so uh on Maria ... is a a ... this activist I mean she worked for a prominent news website in the Philippines Rappler media and when she started noticing this problem she actually\nUh on Maria ... a ... this activist I mean she worked for a prominent news website in the Philippines Rappler media and when she started noticing this problem she actually brought it to Facebook's attention in twenty sixteen as we learn in the dock here's an exchange between you James and ... so\nWere you given an explanation as to why they weren't acting [noise]\nI think baseball walk down to the Philippines and they were focused on what they didn't realize is that countries like the [noise] countries way institutions are clear corruption is rampant these countries don't have to see\nWhen you bring everyone onto a platform and do not exercise any kind of rules if you don't implement those rules before you're going to create chaos\nSo James what did Facebook tell you about the way they responded to the Philippines and to Maria Russia's complaints\nWell Facebook has set a number of things in response to it on one they said they were too slow and addressing the problems that Maria brought to them and it wasn't until Maria\nProduced and published a three part investigative series that exposed the fact that there were these accounts that were spreading hate speech and misinformation that Facebook actually took action on those accounts\nBut as she tells us the problem is ongoing interestingly recently in as a as I think it was an April Facebook is pain Murray arrest US Organization to be a third party fact checker of things that are going viral on Facebook in the Philippines\nBut as she put it to us recently they're completely inundated and Facebook still doesn't really have handled the problem there\nDoes that suggest you know hiring her as a fact checker ... does that suggest Facebook\nLee inundated and Facebook still doesn't really have handled the problem there does that suggest you know hiring her as a fact checker does that suggest Facebook is going to pursue and due diligence or they were just trying to plug the hole I think that that there are fact checking project that they're trying to do all around the world um\nIs what they're seen as the first step toward a solution or at least containing the problem of hate speech and misinformation to have\nPeople on the ground that are fact checking material in the home country or in the language and um it's really an outsourcing of it and what's also fascinated about it is that\n... runs a news organization and she's utilizing resources that would otherwise be put toward reporting and doing fact checking riots going viral on Facebook\nYeah [noise] um if you zoom out of the Philippines a for a moment I mean many of us are closely watching Facebook's operations here in the U.S and abroad and the the big question which you raised several times are they doing enough at Facebook to stop these campaigns whether it's disinformation\nFake news hate speech or what do you think after spending a year investigating all this and actually being at a you know age ... for Facebook\nWell they um it's an interesting question because what does it mean enough and I asked people at Facebook you know what the standard for success here because there's no ability for us to audit them were really left in this position of having to take their word for it and whatever it is\nThat the standard that they set for themselves but there's so much that we just don't know but as a ... this this is a writer Alexis Madrigal from the Atlantic ah says in your dog and it's really a was a really powerful quote the very things that divide us the most are the things that get the most engagement um talk about that a bit and ... where that's most evident right now\nWell we've got our mid term elections and um and we've had you know that the horrific events here of the past week and\nMost evident right now well we've got our mid term elections and um and we've had you know that the horrific events here of the past week\nAnd seen that whether it's the shooter in Pittsburgh or the attempted bomber\nUm these are people that are very radicalized on social media polarization and filter bubbles are are a real thing on social media and this kind of reinforcement of world views that's the main discussion happening right now I think\nJames after a year of working on this er and investigating Facebook\nOr are you on the platform or what if you were or you know off it I I'm On it I've always taken a I have a very small footprint on their um which by the way it doesn't mean much in terms of what date of their collective around you um but uh it's just um [noise]\nYeah I'm I'm torn and sign up to ... who is in the film was a scholar at UNC\nUm says I think one of the most important in lines which is what are you going to do about the fact that all your friends and family are there it's this tremendous thing to be able to communicate with people it really is an amazing invention budget is so problematic so ... what are you going to do\nJames Jacoby with frontline part two of the Facebook dilemma airs tonight on PBS and you can find part one online at P. B. S. dot org James thanks very much for coming in that you\nCan see the Fifteen\nYeah I mean not totally but it also got on a plane to Pittsburgh um there was another reaction to from the Israeli ambassador to the u._s. so Ron ... um he was on MSNBC blaming anti Semitism on both the left and the right he's blaming both sides\nOne of the big forces in college campuses today is anti Semitism and those and so the anti Semite so usually not neo Nazis on college campuses they're coming from the radical left so we have to stand against anti Semitism whether it's civil rights or whether it's I'm Single life\nYeah um I think here again Israeli Jews are not following the intricacies of right versus Latin America\nI think a lot of Israeli Jews as we know from holes support Donald Trump they don't really care so much better domestic policies they don't really know very much better domestic policies it's important Toyotas really due to the Trump support Israel in the Trump supports a strong Israel so I'm ... comments I think perplexed American Jews more than they do Israeli Jews\nIsrael to Trump's support the strong Israel so I'm Ron drummers comments I think perplexed American Jews more than they do Israeli Jews\nAnd it told me a bit of a reaction among some of Israel's left wing politicians to what happened in Pittsburgh\nSay over all although there has been expressions of condolence to the next person the shock of are the new kind of quickly moved on here I think a lot of Israeli Jews don't fully understand the impact\nThat has had on the American Jewish community they don't fully understand the plays the synagogue life for American Jews they don't understand that for American Jews synagogue as a second home it's a place where kids grow up and Hebrew school where they hide\nAs I did like you know hiding out from from Hebrew school in the bathroom with my friend and a place where you would play and kind of come of age\nAnd that you you know this is a place where people feel at home I put a share story I did a lot of reporting about the residents of Pittsburgh and the people from real hell and I'm\nOne of the stories that move me most was the story of\nJerry Ruben ... sixty six years old he was one of the eleven people who were murdered he rushed to the sound of the noise we don't know if you knew it was gunfire at that point to go help and that is when he was shot\nAnd and as a moral in Pittsburgh people spoke about how he had this interesting custom dream order Scottish which is a Jewish prayer memorializing the dead and it's set in every single service\nHe stood up he always stood up for the ... and that is traditionally a time but only those were morning actually stand up and when asked why did he stand up every single time he said well I have no children so one day\nThere will be nobody to stand for me so I stand for all of those who have no one to stand for them and on Saturday everybody stood up and stood for Jerry in in his memory and I think um\nThat standing up and that standing up together is such a metaphor and I think\nOverall Israeli Jews and Israelis in general they don't need a cynic guy\nThat standing out to that standing up together it's such a metaphor and I think overall Israeli Jews and Israelis in general they don't need a cynic I give them Jewish community because they had their Jewish community\nWithin their own lives and in a way that American Jews if they want to find community if they want to hide a sense of solidarity among themselves that they find it in the walls or the synagogue and that is another sort of way that Israeli Jews and American Jews you\nKnow don't connect do you know the president does reveal are quite a few differences between American and Israeli Jews what would you how would you sum up those differences like what's the bumper sticker here\n[noise] me think um\n[noise] that American Jews and Israeli Jews aren't too there are different paths right now I Would say American Jews for the most part are liberal like consider themselves very much attached to their immigrant roots and because of that they tend\nTo support rights for immigrants they tend to very much believe in the ... the repeated in the Bible more than any other tenant would just\nBe kind to the stranger because you two are much once the stranger in Egypt and so there's this very strong desire to acknowledge that you know American Jews have\nDone fairly well to themselves and in America I'm and feel fairly successful and feel very comfortable um and I think that comfort to the lens them to sort of be more liberal and more open where Israeli Jews still\nFeel under attack they feel very much sort of\nThe product of sort of post traumatic has Holocaust world where they look at\nThings very much in sort of a zero sum game it times you know us versus them whether it comes to Arab neighbors or you know I'm\nFresh from within somehow an Israeli the trends toward sort of like circling the wagons in fear and American jury you have a trend sort of towards plurality Jewish pluralism openness and I think you should just divisions coming more clearly now and the Pittsburgh\nAttach tragically in some ways highlights those splinters\nReporter dinner cropped with ... in Tel Aviv she's also the host of the protests the branch Dina thanks very much for your

Carl [noise] than we would hope and that means the rates of changing the environments have essentially out pace the capacity of the calls themselves to adopt\nRoof gates died last week at the age of fifty six months after being diagnosed with brain cancer longtime friend and collaborator Virginia was says gates was one of the very first scientists to make the connection between coral bleaching and global warming\nShe started in the Nineteen eighties in the very early days when none of us understood what was going on she was able to show that corals did this strange pay lanes and she was able to tie it to warming and at that time we were just starting to understand what global warming was\nOver the years gates became a bowl of teacher and an eternal optimist in a field whose future looks grim until her death gates led a research lab at the University of Hawaii that's trying to figure out ways to help coral adapt to warming oceans friend Virginia wife says she was also a regular and vibrant public speaker\nI don't remember her ability to light up around and make everyone in the room feel like she's talking jets to them she had this wonderful silky highbrow English accent that she ...\nTalking just to them she had this wonderful silky highbrow English accent that she joked with her secret weapon and she was able to tell the story of corals and she was brilliant at it she really excelled at it\nI Know you've described her as an iconic closet or feel why\nSo she was and I kind of class and a couple of different ways the best one to think about right now is this idea of\nAssisted evolution of corals to very controversial it's the idea that humans need the help corals evolve faster to be able to tolerate the heating that's happening and some scientists really think that that's not our place to do that and\nBut others led by Ruth really feel that we need to try a variety of options\nShe's the first to admit it may not work but if you don't try it then we can't know\nBut personally I feel very strongly she was an iconoclast in terms of the way she approached science she disliked pushing your colleagues decided to get ahead and she was much more about cooperation and encouraging\nAll diversity brown people and women and because of that sometimes she ruffled feathers but she ruffled feathers to make the world of coral science a more inclusive cooperative place\nSuch determination to help his coral reefs are in the face of the past few years several major coral reef bleaching events and the rest of the news isn't good I'm In coral reefs are expected to be almost completely destroyed in coming decades\nAnd yet ... recruits remained so optimistic how did she retained that optimism all studying something so depressing\nWow at such a great question Marco I think all of us are trying to bottle that um especially in light of her loss\nSomething so depressing well it's such a great question mark how I think all of us are trying to bottle that um especially in light of her life she just looked forward and she felt like\nYou know we can try our hands up and give up or we can look for solutions then I think her enthusiasm really instilled that same passion and a lot of other people [noise] what\nIs the one memory of Virginia that you'll always hang onto about Rick Gates\n[noise] her laugh\nYou know she was not a big person but she had this huge laugh that failed the round people in restaurants would turn around and stare I mean and she laughs she left early and often and it was infectious\nVirginia was a biology

S. means automatic citizenship we talked about that and the fourteenth amendment yesterday today we want to spend some time exploring different ideas about citizenship\nLet's start with a simple document that is a powerful symbol of citizenship a passport\nOutside your home country your passport can dictate easy travel or blocked access because not all passports are created equal the world's syringes ... starts us off\nIt takes a lot of courage to leave your day job to travel the world it takes even more courage if you're not rich and you hold an Iranian passport ten years ago that's exactly what ... did\nHe quit his job at the physics teacher intent on cashed out his savings and became a full time travel they're making a bit of money along [laughter] headed huskies in Siberia [noise] he's played designer phone these locals in Zimbabwe\n[noise] any strong a traditional slow he needs to look at Mount Kilimanjaro\nOn both on the\nList that I was with him on that trip is a friend [noise] today plus I make\nThem living by organizing and needing budget friendly towards for small groups of Iranian when choosing a destination he tells me the first question on his mind is how easy is it going to be to get a visa\nTime since one about a month plus port muscle\nDestination he tells me the first question on his mind is how easy is it going to be to get a visa\nMore time if one about among post ... ...\nUnfortunately my house or to the huge by a gigantic mountain tells me he's speaking from his home in ...\nUh or the ... you're going to undo suffered about Bush's ...\nFor a lot of people ... passports evokes movement travel before me he says it's the opposite is a reminder of hardship and pain just got me thinking how does an Iranian passports compared to other\nDown I've passed Venezuela I've passed St Vincent\nOn hold off a ... she's the author of the cosmopolitan the coming of the global citizen it's a book about citizenship and passports about the world\nOf course that could all change under Donald Trump\nThe U.S go change on the on the Trump or and this is why we as Europeans look with so much interest in so much ... of what's going on in the United states and really hope that the United states or would not\nGo down that way that NPR in Germany went down being overconfident over its capacities and ah being overly enthusiastic\nAbout its wrote him to build\nVernon pots all political scientist at the Technical University of dressing thank you very much for the pleasure talking to your\nYour tuned to the world\nYou're listening to the world on can you do Arizona Public radio your source for NPR News and talk good afternoon it's two twenty\nFunding for K.

later this afternoon chili temperatures particularly in elevation round the Flagstaff Grand Canyon region struggling to top off at fifty this afternoon abhorrent Apache County high temperature\nTemperatures particularly in elevation round the Flagstaff and Grand Canyon region struggling to top off at fifty this afternoon abhorrent Apache County high temperatures mid fifties around Prescott low sixties made upper sixties for Sedona\nAnd the ... valley cold temperatures for the trick or treaters\nI Know\nI'm working woman misses the world thinks the drop of fact there's a lot of interest around the globe in our mid term elections next week enough to send an Australian political strategist halfway across the planet\nBruce hawk or as his name for the past month he's been traveling around the U.S speaking with voters and filming a documentary about it what struck him so far here's what he said in mind you this was before the Pittsburgh synagogue attack division was struck\nBy the amount of division in America I mean I've been traveling Houston's not in Ninety six to observe presidential campaigns and I've never seen anything quite like that\nEverybody here and there is in their respective camp and it's almost impossible to find anybody who is sitting on the fancy they're all in one camp all the other and have a very very strongly held views about Donald Trump he is the story\nAnd I don't get a sense that Americans are very happy politically right now even those who ... hours on either side I think this is science of disconnect and it upsets people it's the same story everywhere we go\nOn happiness that really seems to be on the painting a lot of what we see and said this quiet I think which is permeating American society right now even for people who are very strong Trump supporters and we'll probably see themselves as being in the ascendency so that's the hard road that I think Americans are taking right now\nSo the big question you're trying to answer talking to American voters is what matters to you how varied have those answers been\nExtremely I may pay Trump's supporters as I say Trump is\nWhat matters to you how varied have those answers been extremely I may pay Trump's support\nAs as I say Trump is being somebody who's just shaking up the country in a way that has never been done before\nAnd they believe that he's achieving things and then they'll site North Korea is an example of that the tariffs wars with China and the other side of the coin it's division it's the shouting out it's the singling out of minority groups and individuals\nThat people find very offensive and drives a lot of their intentions in this midterm election\nYou know I mean the trade war on terror is that's not necessarily a good thing for people in the middle of the country farmers for example are you finding what\nThat is a fascinating thing you know we're just in Breckenridge, Minnesota just a few days ago and we conduct a little focus group that primarily amongst farmers and what they told us was that even though ... not buying their crops the down by bad twenty five percent and returns\nThat were prepared to give Donald Trump a chance to sort out this war with the Chinese but then would speak to other ... that is well and good but ... now full and if we can solve this problem out really soon we're going to have another habit snakes you may not going to have anything to do with it\nSo it's interesting that sometimes their emotional attachment to a personal to a coal was kept out why the hip pocket and as we call it in stride but usually motivates what people's biting intentions of going to be\n... have you ever seen that dynamic like that back in Australia it's very rare\nExcept in as strategy we do have something of a Trump phenomena and it usually comes with people who once calling the shots in a society where they feel they're being left out left behind and I will sometimes support candidates who don't represent their interests\nThe shots in a society where they feel they're being left out left behind and I will sometimes support candidates who don't represent their interests and that happened a few years ago when we had a woman called polling Hansen she's still around and she ran a particular one nation very populist and\nShe was upsetting Asians and ... but people in tourists dependent electric was voting for her and sorry yeah sometimes people vote against their interests I read an article once and it said was Turkey's votes of Thanksgiving sometimes that just happens to\nThe question now I think that we're gonna have to be asking in two years' time if we come back as well\nHas Trump delivered on the big things that he said he was going to because right now what we're saying is that people who might be sitting in the middle I'm more inclined to cite will give him a chance we're going to see how you guys and that may mean that the cycle blue why that's coming might just be more of a trickle\nHow much does an issue like immigration or what we're talking about earlier ... how much did the opinions you heard from Americans vary depending on the region\nWell it depended to a large extent actually in South Carolina you cannot get away from rice as an issue\nAnd people of color they were very very distressed that I felt that that will being singled out by Donald Trump and in fact we spoke to a Seventy seven year old man African American who grew up in the eyes of segregation in South Carolina had refused admission in the lunch counters and restaurants and\nSort it as roars and he said he had never seen anything like Donald Trump in his lifetime he had never seen such of racism and he's view coming from a president does somebody in such high office\nHe said it was much more subtle in the past and he felt it but he'd never felt this roar exposure that's extraordinary\nMy office he said it was much more subtle in the past and he felt it but he'd never felt this roar exposure\nThat's extraordinary Bruce you've been in the U.S before and as you know the mid term elections historically have low voter turnout what's it like in Australia or greater sense there that you have to take care of the civic responsibility of casting a vote\nWilling to strike have compulsory ... [laughter] that's taken that responsibility out of our hands and tell us we'll be fine if we die hard but a science take it for granted really that they have divided on election day and we have Ninety five percent turnout\nAnd that of course changes the nature of politics ... it means that the politicians are much more focused on the same to Rob and having to energize the bike so all the time if you're a pep compulsory biting your politician in history you know that your traditional voters are going to come out and support you it's\nThe people in the middle you have to convince and that means that as time politics even though it sounds very divisible times\nStill is much more inclusive in the basic tenants that I'm the pain the major political parties for example\nOr you know we have a national hills scale which would never be touched by either the major parties on I think in my lifetime it just is not an issue I Know that if I were to pot from that that would be the end of the prospects of winning an election\nDo you get the sense that Americans are more motivated to go to the polls this year\nMore motivated everywhere we go way hearing reports from journalists and all those that turnout is greater with early voting mental so registration that they Kevin uh issue has motivated and energized democratic voters particularly women\nSo on both sides with saying this remarkable energizing I'll be very surprised if we don't see ... to meet him voting turnout and we're also getting at reports that in states like Georgia where there's allegations of lettuce\nSay ... me too I'm voting turnout and we're also getting a reports that in states like Georgia where there's been allegations of suppression that that has had to resist effect and that there has been a very high turnout before the election day by people who presumably are offended by what's happening there\nAnd one of the things that are being doing is talking to young people and asking them what do you think about Donald Trump in the priority says he has and they basically say\nThat totally out of step with what we are worried about and the number one issue that we get back is climate change because this is the generation that's going to have to deal with these problems and the other is intergenerational dead but they really do worry about climate and climate change\nAnd you can understand why you know I wouldn't be around to see the worst effects of climate change but they will not think that will become a bigger and bigger issue as this generation starts to assert more and more power\nBruce Walker is an Australian political strategists he's been filming a documentary called a hard road travels and Trump's America we'll speak with him again after the midterms\nBy the way if you're a new U.S citizen are voting for the first time here in America we want to hear from you what does voting mean to you and how does it compare with voting in another country\nEmail us at this address my world at the world dot org again that's my world at the world dot O. R. G.\nI mean in reality had I been raised in his background and exposed to the things who's to say that I wouldn't have been exactly on the side of the line and and I think that's what's important for all of us to remember just because you disagree with something doesn't make you write\nSo can we talk about your own role as leader because you lead these highly classified missions in Iraq that led to massage all Zarqawi in two thousand six being killed you are also the top us commander in Afghanistan a war that's now entering its Eighteenth year as soldiers are signing up as you know who were not even born when that war began\nIs that a colossal failure of leadership\nWell I don't know if it's a failure of leadership because there's been some good leaders are certainly a failure of policy or its lack of success of policy if we're talking Afghanistan in particular\nOr you had troubles with the Obama administration your bosses and your tenure in Afghanistan was terminated where did the\nLeadership there fail\nWell I mean part of it on my end the reality is although President Obama had a different policy view than I did not hugely different I was you know very supportive of what he asked me to do but at a point an news story came out or a media story in Rolling Stone\nAnd I was you know very supportive of what he asked me to do but at a point and news story came out or a media story in Rolling Stone magazine\nThat I didn't think was fair but at the same time I'm a commander in Afghanistan and it's not it's my job not to let hot stories land on the desk of the commander in chief so that was my failure whether I disagreed with it or not\nGeneral McChrystal let's talk about current leadership you're retired now and we're seeing us troops play new rules this week we learned that the Pentagon and sending more than five thousand troops to the Mexican border uh five thousand more than double the number of troops in Syria what does that decision tell us about our current leadership\nDecision to send U.S forces to somewhere like the border is a symbol and in the minds of some Americans it probably says ... how we have an invasion coming a we have an emergency we have to protect the homeland\nAnd while that's not the case it creates that mental image and sending regular military forces down their sins of the idea that we're going to be decisive flipper really defending what we ought to do is put in drones out to get targeting Hindu airstrikes on the migrant convoy and just stop it\nBefore it gets close but of course that's absurd\nAnd that's immoral and that's not something that we're even thinking about doing but we shouldn't even send the idea that this is going to defend the walls of the Alamo however in some ways it is a crisis\nIt's a crisis because up close we're going to have the arrival of a number of people who want entry into the United states in many cases they have a pretty valid reasons for wanting to leave Honduras or Guatemala\nA lack of opportunity plus threats to them and so now we're going to be up close and personal with a moral issue so I think it's when we talk about putting military around we almost confused the issue because the route issue here is one of our image\nMoral issue so I think it's\nWhen we talk about putting military around we almost confused the issue 'cause the route issue here is one of our immigration policy and in America's values and we've got to look in the mirror decide what our values are adjust our policy reflects those and it's got to be a compromise because not all Americans are going to agree\nSo how do you feel our country is being led laid off from me what is your take on the on the tone brings up by the oval office\nI don't think our country is being led well it All right now but I Would expanded beyond the oval office I Would say on the left in the right there's a ... to the rhetoric now\nAnd this gets back to what we talked about earlier and values we need instead of looking at the TV and yelling at whatever side we don't like we need to look in the mirror and we need to say All right what are our values what do we want from our leaders because I don't expect the president to have the answers\nI expect the president to create an ecosystem in which the answers can be reached but I expect the president\nTo reflect our values I expect to reflect the values for me I I expect the president to inspire me to be better than I might otherwise be when I Am weary and impatient I expect the president\nTo be the kind of symbol it says wow I Need to be a little more patient I lead to be a little more energetic whatever it is I Need to be a little more courageous a little more compassionate\nI expect the president to reflect all the things that we hope we can be\nAn does Donald Trump reflect your values does it reflect American values\nWell I think each of us has to ask ask ourselves that question\nI'm I'm at a new does he reflect your values general\nI think I just answered that question I don't believe that President Trump reflects the kind of inspirational leadership that I respond to but I'm One person\n[noise] I don't believe that President Trump reflects the kind of inspirational leadership that I respond to but I'm One person and the real question is how each of us do and we need to we need to be very honest with ourselves first and then with each other [noise]\nGeneral Stanley McChrystal his new book is leaders myth and reality thank you very much for being with us oh it's my pleasure\nBoat okay like many
