government for his activism before that he was working in relative obscurity in Beijing in the mid nineties and for some years in New York City I look back on those years now as an important season in his life\nIf you talk about the winter then you come to spring here come to summer more and more pressures of time\nHis new book capture some of those times it's called I way way Beijing photographs Nineteen Ninety three to two thousand and three and several photos he documents the final days of his father I Ching what a China is fine as modern poets and an artist who like his son felt the wrath of Chinese authorities\nAfter he passed away I feel you feel you're alone\nWho like his son felt the wrath of Chinese authorities\nAfter he passed away I feel you feel you're alone and they don't belong to anybody and uh\nAnd maybe that's a moment you want to act so that's really a psychologically ... parish and for me to become a new boss for myself a new boss of yourself yes this is like the godfather fail\nSo I'd like you if you would tell us the story of the preparations for his memorial after your father died in Nineteen Ninety six because that Chinese officials had their own ideas about how that offense should really unfold right\nYes is this the communist society everything for clear\nHierarchy you know so he was a kick out from a Communist Party\nAnd even he was the same generation is a state leaders chairman mall drawing an eye on the people\nThat work together but uh but he was heavily criticized us or right is in some way against the party so your father was in that inner circle with now oh yeah yeah they're really core which is supported their revulsion or part of their own ...\nBundle eight of course have being picked it out or from the party has unpaid revolution and uh spend about ... years so yeah I well not just allowed to ride towards his name's totally disappeared in the public\nSo the memorial how did that memorial first they decided to his body has to be covered by communist flack\nIs very high on there and that means you're you're part of it is a revolution by the time I feel ... uncomfortable you know I said you know\nYou're you're a part of it is a revolution by the time I feel ... uncomfortable you know I said you know you should not do something to somebody already passed away which you know is may against his will so I made that argument that says we don't need covers out a flag\nDid they resist ... yeah they they told me they said you'll find that doesn't just belong to a family you know which is very good argument and they say I recently announced to\nThe Communist Party or state was it a convincing argument though no it's not it's a ... insulting to some mind now and has suffered so much\nThat they took being covered by that piece of read but I think it was this a Hummer and a cause that sickle sickle yeah on it if I mean it's brutal [noise]\nHurts me and then there were the flowers flowers in this kind of Sarah money they all use the same set of a paper flowers you know\nIf someone you spend the next day or a week later somebody dies they oh yeah yeah yeah same I I Will walk in the room I feel no no no we don't need to use and isn't being used before\nSo they say why they're going to do I set out well by a fresh ours my father's point his art scene he heath life so much relate to the highest aesthetic judgment on a moral judgment\nSo I said I have to change it so we send out a A R people the bald all the ... forest in Beijing city wow I Know they made a fresh for bad so he can sleep or in the middle but still covered by this red blankets\nWhile your father was ill you\nSleep or in the middle but still covered by this red blanket\nWhile your father was ill you did this performance I that's all I can call it a you intentionally smashed itching dynasty porcelain and a ... dynasty earn and you were photographed smashing another are and how did these ideas come to you especially well your father was was dying\nJust not really much ideas is really attitude or some kind of a stupid ridiculous uh action you see ... to that kind of ... and all the time was your intention to shake up the Chinese public know was not possible you'll have no path for\nThe rest of society is in deep sleep and they don't care\nIt was interesting something you said about smashing the vows you felt it was almost like a child acting out and I want to ask you about the middle finger because it's a photographic motif that you've used pointing your finger\nAt the Hong Kong's skyline appointing her middle finger at the Eiffel Tower Chairman Mao I felt like when I saw this it's like a rebellious teenager has just gotten a camera for the first time what is up with the finger\nIs just so sad that survey ... now I realize that don't do that anymore because I'm a girl older you know and the U.S individual in this society what else do I mean it's just give out your opinions\nSo you spent a lot of time in the United states do you feel you can still count on the U.S to be kind of the beacon of free expression around the world\nI don't really sinks outweigh you know on the surf racing on the shallow surveys yes us are defending individual rights or human rights but deeply us also costs and a lot of problem for other people from other nations for broader humor\nDeeply us also costs and a lot of problem for other people from other nations for broader human rights violations\nI mean I asked partly because you live in Berlin now but I understand you're moving to New York with your family right yes so I Know you've described to us as a country of immigrants which I think a lot of people would agree with but president Donald Trump seems to reject that idea how do you feel about this reality as you were removed\nTo the end of the reality is about how you you as a nation still have power to accept the difference still have an allergy or\nDo young enough to take to the challenge and have a vision and a and a half of the big heart so if they don't then there will push people way they'll blame other people and uh it just shows that we can is\nAnd if that big heart starts to shrink while you're here are you going to turn your eye and your critics toward the United states or at least make your critics in your art of China more universal and maybe I'm to the u._s.\nI always protect the basic rights of freedom of speech and a human rights I don't see that the only as a Chinese problem as universal problem\nI weigh thank you very much for your time it was a an honor and a

last six years\nShe hasn't pushed the probe into the soil very far at all before it hit something something that sounds like a big not as soon as she pulls the pro back out and then if you touch this\nWow is really really call them ... ... ...\nJust a few seconds or the end of the pool has become so cold that it's uncomfortable to touch it's almost eerie like it picked up a message for us from the hidden world right under our feet the world of permafrost it can be anywhere from a meter to a kilometer sick it can be very very cold or just barely frozen\nAnd all around the Arctic it's starting to thaw you might have seen some of the pictures roads that are sinking in buckling homes shifting cracking and trees tilting an awkward angles\nSeen some of the pictures roads that are sinking buckling homes shifting and cracking and trees tilting at awkward angles giving rise to the label drunken forests in fact there's a line of telephone poles next to the ... and I are standing in one of them looks a little drunk and to\nThat one that is kind of filtering now that is probably standing in an area where the ... is just disappearing now so they will have\nTo do that so for people who live in the Arctic these changes are really big deal and many northern cultures sellers cut into the permafrost have been a reliable way to store food it becomes nature's freezer now people can't always trust that their food won't spoil\nAnd thawing permafrost affects all of the newer kind of infrastructure to not only buildings water mains sewage drains even cemeteries\nCommunities are scrambling to adapt to the ground literally shifts beneath them but ... says permafrost as important to all of us no matter where we live because it's providing a globally important service keeping carbon out of the atmosphere free of charge\nSo the permafrost that we have here was formed probably in the during the last ice age so like eleven thousand years or so ago and that material in the ... is that old like it it's made out of materials from finds that used to grow at that time\nAnd the remains of dead animals are in the soil to not fossilized Bones Are petrified wood to actual stuff\nAnd all of this organic material had a lot of carbon in it in fact that's what the word organic means organic chemistry is carbon chemistry so ... says the soil has a lot of dead plants in it she means we put our carbon in the freezer\nWe have and now we're unfortunately kind of taking the plug out of the freezer and the structure sauce\nShe means we put our carbon in the freezer\nYeah we have and now we're unfortunately kind of taking the plug out of the freezer and the store and she saw\nAnd so then one from a frost it starts to truly saw than than carbon just kind of comes like how does the carbon get from down there to up into the atmosphere um because microbes are eating it and they are aspiring so they are breathing\nBasically and then they emit carbon so it's micro breath that we have to worry about basically [laughter]\nMicrobes when living things die microbes begin breaking them down and the carbon that was locked up in a blade of grass or the horn upper basin gets liberated and floats up into the atmosphere as methane or carbon dioxide\nFreezing slows microbes down but it doesn't kill them stalling speeds them backup\n\nBack at the lake Matilda rose up close to a big funnel floating upside down in the water that has a big syringe fitted onto the skinny and sticking out these little contraptions look pretty homemade because they are\nThe way we make them floated ... or even ... noodles things from using swimming pool\n[laughter] so you take your phone will turn it upside down rather piece of pool noodles around the wide part and put a plastic syringe on the top and you've got yourself a little trap designed to capture gases bubbling up from the lake below\nMatilda wrote us up to another child and your team reaches over the side of the boat with a syringe and his hand\nSo he's pulling out the gas\nReports from middle leaders of gosh they're just used to be losing to look so much a word from the bubble and the global travel through the water into our trip and I was in certain states\nGosh so this used to be ... intellect sediments a words from the bubble and the global travel through the water and through our trip and now it's been a surge they've likely captured a mixture of gases most of which are well luckily you know but we're not sure so we take these to laugh and then we measure the actual messing up and driven\nMethane is a powerful greenhouse gas and these scientists have forty or these bubble traps on this lake and a bunch more nearby\nThey check all of them multiple times a week all summer long\nAnd this is all just to understand how much methane is coming off this one small area this year under these particular conditions groups of scientists are at work around the Arctic studying sites that are wetter or dryer colder or warmers with more or less vegetation\nAnd they're all trying to understand just how quickly these billions of tons of carbon might be released\nI think the the scary part is that we don't know what an extra four degrees of warming will do to this huge amount of carbon stored here in the room for us we're trying to actively figure that out\nYour team says it's hard to accurately assess greenhouse emissions from Arctic soil because the whole system is so complex\nBut it's also hard because humans have never warm the planet up like we are now we have nothing to compare this to at least from our species perspective we're in what climate scientists call a new analog situation a massive global experiment\nThere's not that we turn on that big Arctic permafrost machine or we don't know what it does [noise] um and until we actually figure out what it does maybe you could do to stop turning up [noise] [noise]\nIf you have the warming of one degree that makes all the difference in the world because it gets from frozen to thought and that is something that scientists are really worried about because\nWarming of one degree that makes all the difference in the world because it gets from frozen to salt and that is something that scientists are really worried about because there are many ah thresholds that you might cross there\n... says that in many parts of the Arctic the permafrost has already thought enough to start emitting carbon in other places the frozen soil is right on the cusp of that pay the point where a change of one or two degrees can transform it from being something that stores carbon to something that ... that\nWe might tip the scales of these really large exchanges then it can have really dramatic consequences\nIt's not about saving the polar bear I think a lot of people and I think I mentioned I mean that's all it does if he had to pull up back in ... but but it's also about like us surviving as a species because if it gets much warmer\nAct the way that we have evolved with our agriculture and how we like the food that we eat and where we live is just not adapted to it\nWe don't know how close we are to a massive release of carbon from frozen Arctic soils but we do know that every bit of carbon we emit into the atmosphere gets us closer to that point\nScientists call it a positive feedback loop more carbon in the air leads to more warming which leads to the release of more carbon in the process just builds on itself\nAnother thing we know is that we don't get a second chance at this once our emissions potentially trigger this huge release of carbon we've put ourselves at the mercy of processes that we can't control and that will dramatically reshape the earth's climate and her own civilizations\nI ask your team if he thought there was any way to stop this\n\nI ask your king he thought there was any way to stop this experiment we're conducting on the Arctic or if he thought the damage was already done and now we just have to ride it out [noise]\nNow we have an ability to stop [noise] of course we do we have choices and\nI think especially in the western world in which will we have choices and therefore we have responsibility [noise] um [noise]\nAnd [noise] one of the ways is to try and understand his experiment better and that's my that's what we do here and the other part is acting on what we already know which is stuffed putting so much greenhouse gases in the atmosphere [noise]\nYeah I I think we have a responsibility on a single tenant\nFor the world any Martin obvious skills

S. you're automatically a citizen it's not clear if he can do that the concept is enshrined in an amendment to the U.S constitution for the president told actually as he could do away with it unilaterally\nYou can definitely do with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nMartha Jones is a professor at Johns Hopkins university and the author of birthright citizens a history of race and rights so this is all tied into the fourteenth amendment and there's an interesting history behind that could could you talk about what went into forming it\nSure the fourteenth amendment comes into being\nIn the aftermath of the U.S civil war for a million plus former slaves are now free people and the question is who will they be in a formal constitutional sense with respect to the nation\nThe fourteenth amendment declares them to be birthright citizens but it goes further of course because it extends beyond former slaves to all persons born in the United states making them citizens that the United states\nSo let's talk about that a more in a moment I'm up because it's all part of of your research let's just get into the president's for what we're looking at today or a prior case that came close to defining or interpreting this from the Supreme Court the most\nImportant case for thinking about this question is that of a gentleman named Juan Kim ark and they decided by the Supreme Court and Eighteen Ninety eight one can ark is born in the United states on his parents are Chinese immigrants who cannot be ...\nThe Supreme Court in Eighteen Ninety eight one Kim ark is born in the United states um his parents are Chinese immigrants\nWho cannot become citizens of the United states because of the existing Chinese exclusion acts of the period but long himself assumes himself to be a citizen because he was born in the United states he\nLeaves states to do business in China\nAnd when he returns he's detained at the port\nAnd refused re entry his case goes to the U.S Supreme Court where the court affirms that\nEven as long Kim arts parents cannot become citizens of the United states he because he was born in the U.S pursuant to the fourteenth amendment is a citizen\nIn the generosity of people I have to believe\nThat we don't struggle alone I Would argue that after this horrific horrific\nTragedy I bet you that more people are going to be more willing to help\nWith Antonio Banderas his new book is called dear America notes of an undocumented citizen I'll say thank you thank you so much for having me [noise]\nWe have rivers was full interview with Vargas by the way as a world dot O.

GBH I spent a year looking deeply at how all this has impacted people all around the world they're documentary the Facebook dilemma is airing on PBS this week\nWe want to focus on one country discussed in the documentary the Philippines where president Rodrigo Duterte day is accused of using a coordinated army of trolls to silence critics\nDavid any patriotic folding on line ... sponsoring him and he's just hiring men ... says this information just change democracy and we're allies are prevalent [noise]\nFront lines James Jacoby worked on this investigation and joins us in the world studios thanks for coming by ... thank you [noise] uh what is the place of Facebook in the lives of most Filipinos like how much of the population has access to it and how much do they interact with each other by the up\nWhile it's remarkable the story Facebook and southeast Asia's amazing that they pushed aggressively into south east Asia and to Philippines and demand more other countries\nAnd they are essentially the de facto Internet and a lot of those countries because they offer Facebook as part of a data plan where people don't actually have to\nUse the data in order to use it and the Philippines it's between Ninety and a hundred percent of the Internet users in the Philippines use Facebook as the Internet basically and Maria\nTeens it's between Ninety and a hundred percent of the Internet users in the Philippines use Facebook as the Internet basically and Maria wrestler who who's a woman were interviewing in the film from the Philippines who runs a big news organization there she\nTalks about the fact that it's their public space it truly is their public space in the Philippines um in terms of that does their digital lives\nSo Maria ... so we just heard from we'll hear more from her in a moment um we've reported on the store that uh occurred in Myanmar where fake news actually lead to violence headed Rodrigo Duterte day the Filipino president weaponize Facebook during the election campaign and twenty sixteen\nSo what happened is Facebook actually offered a lot of help to ... to a a during his campaign for president and helped him to really harness the power the platform helped his campaign really understand how to use it effectively and as Maria wrestle reports\nAfter he was elected he essentially weaponized it by turning all this campaign machinery all these accounts that he was controlling he had\nA network of fake accounts and paid followers that we're descending all sorts of lies about his policies and also going after critics in a rather vicious hateful way um and in some cases are trying to incite violence against people\nSo on Maria ... is a a ... this activist and she worked for a prominent news website in the Philippines Rappler media and when she started noticing this problem she actually brought it to Facebook's attention in twenty sixteen as we learn in the dock here's an exchange between you James and ... so\nWere you given an explanation as to why they weren't acting [noise]\nI think one day and they were focused on what they didn't realize is that countries\nFacebook walk in to the Philippines and they were focused on what they didn't realize is that countries like the [noise] countries way institutions or ... corruption is rampant these don't have the same size\nWhen you bring everyone onto a platform and do not exercise any kind of rules if you don't implement those rules for for ... and the chaos\nSo James what did Facebook tell you about the way they responded to the Philippines and to Maria Russia's complaints\nWell Facebook has set a number of things in response to it on one they said they were too slow in addressing the problems that Maria brought to them and it wasn't until Maria\nProduced and published a three part investigative series that exposed the fact that there were these accounts that were spreading hate speech and misinformation that Facebook actually took action on those accounts\nBut as she tells us the problem is ongoing interestingly recently in as a as I think it was an April Facebook is pain Murray arrest US Organization to be a third party fact checker of things that are going viral on Facebook in the Philippines\nBut as she put it to us recently they're completely inundated and Facebook still doesn't really have handled the problem there\nDoes that suggest you know hiring hers effect ... does that suggest Facebook is going to pursue and due diligence or they were just trying to plug the hole\nI think that that there are fact checking project that they're trying to do all around the world um is what they're seen as the first step toward a solution or at least containing the problem of hate speech and misinformation to have\nPeople on the ground that are fact checking material in the home country or in the language and um it's really\nPeople on the ground that are fact checking material in the home country or in the language and um it's really an outsourcing of it and what's also fascinated about it is that\nWhere your rent Reza runs a news organization and she's utilizing resources that would otherwise be put toward reporting and doing fact checking riots going viral on Facebook\nYeah [noise] um if you zoom out of the Philippines a for a moment I mean many of us are closely watching Facebook's operations here in the U.S and abroad and the the big question would you rate several times are they doing enough at Facebook to stop these campaigns whether it's information\nFake news hate speech or what do you think after spending a year investigating all this and actually being at the age cue for Facebook\nWell they um it's an interesting question because what does it mean enough and I asked people at Facebook you know what the standard for success here\nBecause there's no ability for us to audit them were really left in this position of having to take their word for it and whatever it is that the standard that they set for themselves but there's so much that we just don't know\nBut as a ... this this is a writer Alexis Madrigal from the Atlantic ah says in your dog and it's really it was a really powerful quote the very things that divide us the most are the things that get the most engagement um talk about that a bit and ... where that's most evident right now\nWell we've got our mid term elections and um and we've had you know that the horrific events here of the past week\nAnd scenes that whether it's the shooter in Pittsburgh or the attempted bomber um these are people that are very radicalized on social media\nPolarization and filter bubbles are are a real thing on social media and this kind of reinforcement of world views that's the main discussion happening right now I think\nJames after a year of working on this er and\nOf reinforcement of world views that's the main discussion happening right now I think\nJames after a year of working on this er and investigating Facebook or are you on the platform or what if you were or you know off it\nI I'm On it I've always taken a I have a very small footprint on their um which by the way it doesn't mean much in terms of what data they're collecting around you um but ah it's just um [noise]\nYeah I'm I'm torn and sign up to ... who's in the film was a scholar at UNC\nUm says I think one of the most important line which is what are you going to do about the fact that all your friends and family are there it's this tremendous thing to be able to communicate with people it really is an amazing invention budget is so problematic so ... what are you going to do\nJames Jacoby with frontline part two of the Facebook dilemma airs tonight on PBS and you can find part one on line at P. B. S. dot org James thanks very much for coming in like you\nDid you see the Fifteen\nYeah I mean not totally but it also got on a plane to Pittsburgh um there was another reaction to from the Israeli ambassador to the U.S a ... um he was on MSNBC blaming anti Semitism on both the left and the right he's blaming both sides\nWanted the big forces in college campuses today is anti Semitism and those answer the anti Semite so usually not me or not seeing on college campuses they're coming from the radical left so we have to stand against anti Semitism whether it comes from the right or whether it's on civil law yeah\nUm I think here again Israeli Jews are not following the intricacies of right versus Latin America\nI think a lot of Israeli Jews would be no firm hold support Donald Trump they don't really care so much better domestic policies they don't really know very much better domestic these important Toyotas really due to the Trump support Israel to Trump's support the strong Israel so I'm ... comments I think perplexed American Jews more than they do Israeli Jews\nDue to tell me a bit about reaction among some of Israel's left wing politicians to what happened in Pittsburgh\nOver all although there has been expressions of condolence expressions of shocking to hire the new kind of quickly moved on here I think a lot of Israeli Jews don't fully understand the impact that has had on the American Jewish community they don't fully understand the plays the synagogue life for\nI think a lot of Israeli Jews don't fully understand the impact\nThat has had on the American Jewish community they don't fully understand the plays the synagogue life for American Jews they don't understand that for American Jews a synagogue is a second\nHome it's a place where kids grow up and Hebrew school where they hide as I did like you know hiding out from from Hebrew school in the bathroom with my friend and a place where you would play and kind of come of age\nAnd that you you know this is a place where people feel at home I Want to share a story I did a lot of reporting about the residents of Pittsburgh and the people from real hell and I'm\nOne of the stories that move me most was the story of\nJerry Ruben ... sixty six years old he was one of the eleven people who are murdered he rushed to the sound of the noise we don't know if you knew it was gunfire at that point to go help and that is when he was shot\nAnd and after the memorial in Pittsburgh people spoke about how he had this interesting custom dream order Scottish which is the Jewish prayer memorializing the dead and it's set in every single service\nHe stood up he always stood up for the ... and that is traditionally a time and only those who are mourning actually stand up and when asked why did he stand up every single time he said well I have no children so one day\nThere will be nobody to stand for me so I stand for all of those who have no one to stand for them and on Saturday everybody stood up and stood for Jerry in in his memory and I think um\nThat standing out to that standing up together it's such a metaphor and I think overall Israeli Jews and Israelis in general they don't need a synagogue given Jewish community because they had their Jewish community\nWithin their own lives and and in a way that American Jews if they want to find community if they want to hide a sense of solidarity among themselves that they find it in the walls of a synagogue and that is another sort of way that Israeli Jews and American Jews you know don't connect\nYou know the president does reveal across the differences between American and Israeli Jews what would you\nIsraeli Jews and American Jews you know don't connect\nDo you know the president does reveal a quite a few differences between American and Israeli Jews what would you how would you sum up those differences like what's the bumper sticker\nHere let me think um\n[noise] that American Jews and Israeli Jews aren't you there and you can pass right now I Would say American Jews for the most part are liberal like consider themselves very\nMuch attached to their immigrant roots and because of that they tend to support rights for immigrants they tend to very much believe in the Senate that's repeated in the Bible more than any other tenant which is\nBe kind to the stranger because you two are much once a stranger in Egypt and so there's this very strong desire to acknowledge that you know American Jews have\nDone fairly well to themselves in in America I'm and feel fairly successful into celebrate comfortable um and I think that comfort to the lead them to sort of be more liberal and more open where Israeli Jews still\nFeel under attack they feel very much sort of the\nProduct of sort of post traumatic has Holocaust world where they look at\nThings very much and it sort of zero sum game at times you know aspirations them whether it comes to Arab neighbors or you know\nI'm threats from within somehow an Israeli the trend toward sort of like circling the wagons in fear and American jury you have a trend sort of towards plurality Jewish pluralism openness and I think you should those divisions coming more clearly now and Pittsburgh\nAttach tragically in some ways highlights those splintered\nReporter Dana cropped with Haaretz in Tel Aviv she's also the host of the podcast

we're losing more Carl [noise] than we would hope and that means the rates of changing the environments have essentially out pace the capacity of the calls themselves to adopt\nRoof gates died last week at the age of fifty six months after being diagnosed with brain cancer longtime friend and collaborator Virginia was says gates was one of the very first scientists to make the connection between coral bleaching and global warming\nShe started in the Nineteen eighties in the very early days when none of us understood what was going on she was able to show that corals did this strange pay lanes and she was able to tie it to warming and at that time we were just starting to understand what global warming was\nOver the years gates became a beloved teacher and an eternal optimist in a field whose future looks grim until her death gates led a research lab at the University of Hawaii that's trying to figure out ways to help coral adapt to warming oceans friend Virginia wife says she was also a regular and vibrant public speaker\nI don't remember her ability to light up a room and make everyone in the room feel like she's talking jets to them she had this wonderful silky highbrow English accent that she joked with her secret weapon\nAnd she was able to tell the story of corals and she was brilliant at it she really excelled at it\nI Know you've described her as an iconic closet or feel why\nSo she was and I kind of class and a couple of different ways the best one to think about right now is this idea of assisted evolution of corals very controversial\nOne to think about right now is this idea of\nAssisted evolution of corals very controversial it's the idea that humans need the help corals evolve faster to be able to tolerate\nThe heating that's happening and some scientists really think that that's not our place to do that and but others led by roots really feel that we need to try a variety of options\nShe's the first to admit it may not work but if you don't try it then we can't know\nBut personally I feel very strongly she was an iconoclast in terms of the way she approached science she disliked pushing your colleagues decided to get ahead and she was much more about cooperation and encouraging\nAll diversity brown people and women and because of that sometimes she ruffled feathers but she ruffled feathers to make the world of coral science a more inclusive cooperative place\nSuch determination to help his coral reefs are in the face of the past few years several major coral reef bleaching events and the rest of the news isn't good I'm In coral reefs are expected to be almost completely destroyed in coming decades\nAnd yet roof goods remained so optimistic how did she retained that optimism all studying something so depressing\nWell it's such a great question Marco I think all of us are trying to bottle that um especially in light of her life\nShe just looked forward and she felt like you know we can throw her hands up and give up or we can look for solutions then I think her enthusiasm really instilled that same passion and a lot of other people\n[noise] what is the one memory of Virginia that you'll always hang onto a boatload of goods [noise] her laugh\nYou know she was not a big purse\nPeople [noise] what is the one memory of Virginia that you'll always hang onto about Rick Gates [noise] her laugh\nYou know she was not a big person but she had this huge laugh that failed around people in restaurants would turn around and stare I mean ... and she laughs she left early and often and it was infectious\nVirginia was a biology professor at Oregon State university and a longtime friend and colleague of coral researcher Rick Gates who died last week Virginia thanks for telling us about Ruth and our condolences
