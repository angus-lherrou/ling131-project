images\nFor women and this is the world for most of us with access to the Internet Google can be mind blowing it's powerful search engine can quickly give you information on and images of pretty much anything on earth\nIn China because of censorship that can't be the case and yet Google has long been thinking about getting back into China even though it left the country years ago partly because of censorship\nWe learned about Google's efforts to get back into China in August when the intercept reported that the company was secretly working on a search job that complies with Beijing's tough censorship restrictions Google has mostly avoided talking about this this week it broke his silence\nIs very early ah we don't know whether we would or I couldn't do do this in China but he felt it was important for us to explore\nThat Google CEO soon DARPA chai onstage at a conference hosted by wired magazine this week it was the clearest acknowledgement yet that Google is creeping back into the Chinese market\nIt's a wonderful innovative market they wanted to learn what good would look like they're in China so that's what we both can turn a leaf\nAs I mentioned Google already has some idea of what getting back into China would be like v J boy a party was with the company last time around\nIt was only two thousand and states and I was an engineer on Google News and Google had launched Web search in China and they want it to expand their product offerings and Google News was one of the\nProducts that they wanted to launch in China so the task of writing the codes to launch good news in China was given to me and it was immediately clear when the requirements was given to me that\nThere are number of censorship requirements and I immediately felt very uncomfortable with working on it\nYeah what was the things that we're we're being asked to be censored and this was China asking Google to do the censoring correct\nThat's right yeah so entire news\nWe're we're being asked to be censored and this was China asking Google to do the censoring\nCorrect that's right yeah so entirely new sections where it to be removed from the products so the ... section was to be removed later on they asked us to remove the business section is well\nThat's a lot of world news and business news yeah any story that came on to those categories was to be removed and certain topics would not allow the stories on human rights and things of that nature\nAnd they also had a requirement that if there was this particular story that they didn't like that we would be able to remove it from now the website within Fifteen minutes\nAnd the thing that really troubled me at the time was the idea that someone would have the courage to write about something important and then we would censor it then something happened to that journalist\nWas was too much for me so I uh\nI refused to work on it and I was a little concerned I get fired at the time it to doing that how how ... how widely known at Google or was your position\nIt was not not at all and so what happened later on Oscar I refuse to work on it was a I got up at an engineering all hands meeting that to a meeting where

Israelis in the neighborhood what they thought of law at all costs in case and\nThey said you know if she doesn't like this country she doesn't need to come but there are definitely other people who I've heard say this does not look good for a country that calls itself a democracy\nAnd as opposed to the hearing that I attended in Tel Aviv at this hearing judges seemed to be very skeptical of the way that the Israeli authorities were interpreting this two thousand Seventeen law\nSo no Laura all customers ... to go to classes at Hebrew University any sense of what her life is going to be like when she gets or is she going to face pressure not to get involved in activism\nEarlier this week some students put an empty chair and class saying the seat is reserved for cost them and they wrote it also in Arabic and then that sign was defaced by right wing ears so you can see that her presence and Hebrew University is definitely going to raise questions\nBut she's also and in any program for human rights and transitional justice her fellow classmates are going to be dealing with questions around that very issue that she challenged and so I'm sure it'll be a whole year it's plenty of academic and non academic thing to discuss\nThe new ... thanks very much for your time thinking Marco [noise]\nTeacher pictures of this for the United nations years ago along with drawings and people

the wealthier one\nDo have computers and smartphones that the government has the power to monitor them very closely\nA lot of North Korean devices can automatically detect foreign media files and stop

the shores 'cause they're incredible inversions for us\nIt'd be a says I thought through our really fabulous driven or we could probably go through a couple of the shores 'cause they're incredible and very inspirational\nMr John was the second person to share his story yes go ahead [noise]\nCall some people\nAlso for president in North Korea of political resist so I was there for three years old and he's unfit among\nMr John goes on to describe his work with no chain he also tells Trump the he was moved by a speech he gave at the south Korean national assembly three months earlier he translated Trump's speech and included it and send over\nNorth Korea ... very much so that helped\nThat was great\nIn June months after this meeting President Trump had his big summit with North Korea's leader Kim Jong un Mr John was not optimistic\nAnd what to do to a hundred or two of them were he doesn't really understand why people think Kim Jong un is more like a messenger for\nPeace he rather things that he is a double with a smile on his face he killed his own brother he'll assassinated his brother and also he killed one of the relatives so he's the person who doesn't really treat the people\nIn the way they should be\nTrump's claims he mentioned human rights during the summit but there's no public record of what he said Mr Jong wants to be hopeful but he's not convinced that the summit will have any real effect on the still unfolding tragedy of North Korea he called it political theater last question\nMr Jong do you think you'll do this work for the rest of your life and what are you hoping for in the future\nCritical e books\nJohn do you think you'll do this work for the rest of your life and what are you hoping for in the future\nChris uh eat the chain ... or\nSomething I should go on now is the single digits are\nGoing to be on you know he at some point he wanted to give up but now he feels like he has a sense of responsibility in in a sense of duty to make this work especially considering that there are still people and friends back in North Korea in concentration camps and\nHe was the the only one who got released so he feels not a part of some kinds of responsibility\nTo make you make it work for the rest of them\nI can barely hear the last thing Mr Jong says\nI'm sort of [noise]\nSometimes he treats by his friends\n\n\nThat report from

[noise]\nWhat I was told us that roughly seven hundred hundred and had arrived yesterday and so the idea of a caravan as one might think of it is not really accurate it feels to me more like a mass of thousands of people traveling right now to the Mexico Guatemala border\nI mean it sounds just like a very long line of people as many as four thousand though I mean that that's pretty dramatic\nIt's completely dramatic where I was last night was at a municipal sports center it was like a basketball court with bleachers and there were just hundreds of people in it sleeping\nEating and it was loud and it kind of smelled of human sweat and what really stood out to me was just how many kids do work and I'm not just talking teenagers are ten year olds I'm Talking toddler stumbling around in their diapers\nSo it started with a lot of Hondurans I'm reminded us where they're all coming from right now and and why they're leaving their countries\nI think that's still the vast majority of people are ...

active\nA marker woman you're with the world the story of what happened to the missing and presumed dead Saudi journalist ... continues to unfold\nHow it's been unfolding though that's what we want to focus on right now sometimes gruesome details in the case appear to be coming out in a deliberate slow drip courtesy of Turkish officials they're the ones who first put out the story that ... was brutally murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nTo learn more we got in touch with Carlotta Gall assembled bureau chief for the New York times so\nHoward Turkish officials getting their information and how are they parsing out what they know\nWell that's what's so interesting is I think they've known from the very get go I'm literally from the first day or evening [noise]\nUm what happened was that the first week the Turkish\nOfficials I'm old anonymous all asking not to be quoted started reaching out to foreign media which was interesting because it's not usually what they do yeah so that then became a big story in the west and it was clear that that was that am they want it to be listened in the west they want it to be believed [noise]\nSo um it's been said they'd be they'd be cautious and careful with how they have\nReleased um what they know the details coming out by drip I'm\nIn a way that has kept it in the news every day\nSo how much of a problem is it for journalists both foreign and Turkish to report the Turkish findings when the people in charge of the scene of the crime the Saudis are not really corroborating anything right now\nVery difficult I mean that's you know and and it remains this mystery in many ways there's no full now that's coming out in the Turkish press which we can't completely dark ... one of the one of the things was that the record the audio recordings maybe came from\nNow that's coming out in the Turkish press which we can't completely dark five to one of the one of the things was that the record the audio recordings

the sense that day and flew out that day we had teams in New and they were checking ... to try and match them with\nOpen source materials social media and stuff and so on we found people who\nAre easily recognizable from a you know the entourage of ah the crown prince of Saudi Arabia mom had been someone they caught on [noise] um you know photograph news agency photograph so those sort of things we able to match up there are others that it's difficult to work out who they are all\nThese leaks ah have gotten a lot of attention in part because the killing is reported to be hideous and a

need to find what exactly happened and then perhaps we move on to why and why in this way but\nYou know this wasn't a a a shooting in a dark alley um that could be pinned on no one this is a very brazen attack and so I think the Turks have been tucked should that as a threat against them against their own government and president out on himself so that's why that particularly in ranged I

million dollars each\nMore than a week later officials are still surveying the damage but when they're done the repair costs will not be added to any running tally of military spending related to extreme weather or climate change because that doesn't exist\nI think it is fair to say that the military does not know what the cause of climate change will be going forward\nThat's John konger he

and climate change and all their installations ... wrote\nThat recommendation for the watchdog agency we think it's important to capture the distinction between a normal\nMaintenance repair versus the closer College of a severe storms so that it helps to guide future adaptation projects\nLook argues it's a lot easier to justify the cost of an adaptation project like strengthening a hanger roof if you know how much you've spent repairing hang our roots in the past and how much more you might spend in the face of increasingly intense storms and he points out it's not just about the money\nWe have military bases to support a military mission and if the base is out of commission by definition is not supporting the military mission\nThe department of defense responded to the watchdog agencies call to track climate an extreme weather costs by saying no thanks actually they did say a little more they responded that quote associating a single event to climate change is difficult and does not war at that time and money expended in doing so\nFour or five years ago that statement was correct\nTrevor Hauser is with the economic research company rodeo group\nThe science was not yet at a point where that kind of attribution was possible but\nThanks to a lot of research work over the past few years we can do it\nStill don't usually say a specific drought or hurricane was caused by

an individual drought was twice as likely because of climate change or that Fifteen Percent more ... during the hurricane combining that new science with big economic data lets people like how's your

as extreme weather events now than it was Thirty years ago and how much more likely it will be in the future and what the price tag is\nFiguring out how much damage climate change is currently costing the military nearly five thousand sites around the world wouldn't be cheap but Hauser says it'd be totally doable\nI mean I don't know exactly what it would cost but I'm guessing it would cost them less than half of a wing of why the F ... fighter\nDepartment of defense spokesperson told the world they plan and design facilities to address whether an environmental conditions but climate change

Lorenzo ... thank you thank you\nSpeaking of things that sound wrong imagine a TV show like cops but for ice as an immigration and Customs Enforcement you know show would follow ice agents around as they conduct raise looking for suspected undocumented immigrants\nAnd the purpose of this TV show that sensibly entertainment you may be surprised to hear that a TV show much like that does exist in Japan Nevin Thompson has seen it he's Japan editor for the online news ... news organization global voices\nWell it's like a typical uh reality cop show in this case immigration officers go out and seek out um I guess these over stairs or people who are\nWorking against the terms of of their views in Japan mistake people you're there with them in the car um they they capture them interrogate them and then um as the title of the show suggest there for two in the next plane but bang\nWow what what's the name of the show either in Japanese or translation and English\nIn Japanese it's called the ... which I guess translates a scotch at the moment the deportation wow minutes actually model\nIn Japanese it's called diet hike yo know shooting Kahn which I guess translate says caught at the moment of deportation wow minutes actually modeled on another a cop show it uh in Japan called a Tylenol ... which is like caught at the moment of harassed sounds like a trend\nWell yeah I mean there's a lot of these shows everywhere in the world you know I'm In Canada where I'm from for example uh we had a show like this that Canada border services agency\nCollaborated with with the producers and actually the Kenyan government help funded and so they would go out and look for so called illegal immigrants and stuff like that very tasteless and it was only taken off the air because of the uh the contravene privacy regulations in Canada\nWhat is the tone of the the Japanese program and what were your impressions of it\nWell I mean it's it's very leery and breathless um when you eat you basically have a a Japanese person I'm narrating what's happening it's it's it's kind of odd because like their tone is very tricky and in Brighton cousin so now the the immigration agents are on their way to the\nThe dormitory where some Vietnamese a guest workers are suspected of of of hiding out in a minute sort of narrative and say it's a very um you know cinema verite say you're you're with their with them in the car there's a a camera\nYou know you're driving down the road it's kind of odd because like because Jeff Japan also has very stringent privacy regulations\nYou can't really show anybody's face so everything is word out including the like the neighborhood where it is 'cause like like say if you show the neighborhood\nOr the people who live there would probably complain in ... criticized and so it's just like this is like an hour and a half of what worry blurt out images you can't see people's faces and voices are disguised as quite an odd program\nThis was a two hour episode aired earlier this month is that a one off or are they going to be more episodes that follow these migrant raids and deportation\nIt's quite an odd program this was a two hour episode aired earlier this month is it a one off or are they going to be more episodes that followed these migrant raids and deportations\nI imagine there probably will be um because uh the the program did to cooperate with ah the Tokyo branch of the national immigration girl\nSo they they I mean there's people who put a lot of time and effort into set in this thing up and and just also because the the immigration bureau is going to be elevated status to an immigration agency and get more resources I'd assumed is going to be some work PR efforts like this too\nI I gather there's been some backlash to the show in Japan what have active it's been saying\nWell I mean yeah I like on line there is considerable backlash from anti racism activists who are very well organized in Japan Japan is a very vibrant anti racism a movement and so yeah they they basically said ... entertainment like why why you showing people being deported\nHow can this be entertainment and then um be the mainstream media picked it up so you know various newspapers ran articles about you know how degrading the show is\nI mean is it shot and friday 'cause I mean like ... the bad guys aren't really bad guys they just are looking for a job and you know trying to stay a little longer to make some money and overstayed their work permits\nWell I mean I guess it'd be the obvious appeal is racism because people I suppose have biases about ah people from other countries the ah they don't speak our language or they look a bit different and\nAnd they're coming over here and in taking our jobs type thing so I'm but personally I I'm not sure like uh I think is just to kind of a ... sensational kind of a cheap TV to watch\nI remember the cop show theme song and did it by getting samples all over the place that they have a a catchy tune that everybody's not singing [laughter]\nI mean I I guess you might think also we live within time\nGetting sampled all over the place that they have a a catchy theme tune that everybody's not singing\nYeah I mean I I guess you might think also we live in a time when around the world I think people are feeling less secure than ever before just because I'm a stay for example Donald Trump for\nBrexit or invasion of Crimea so maybe people are just feeling I'm less secure in their own country so perhaps these sorts of shows provide some reassurance that\nSomeone is doing something to protect us here\nAnd I've been Tom Cindy Japan editor for global voices thank you very much for telling us about this a somewhat bizarre show\nOh You're welcome was great to talk
