the origins of lifetime tenure for judges over there\n[noise] yes well this is a country which had its battles or apartment of judges and they must have happened a long time ago so the English civil war of the seventeenth century\nWas the midpoint of a century of struggles and at that point the judges served at the pleasure of the king so they can could dismiss them at any time so when parliament became more powerful it a pasta framework and Seventeen hundred and in that active settlement it provided that they\nCould no longer dismiss them interestingly\nIt led to some of the change in the U.S at the time of independence\nLet me just clarify their of so basically the judicial system and in England evolved for the same reason we kind of say here to prevent the monarch bullying judges\nYes that's a great way of putting it um there was some brave judges in the seventeenth century but if we look at the standout cases that were more judges for example denying bail or just arbitrarily imprisoning opponents of the king when that hadn't committed crimes that type of behavior\nWhich was driven by their sheer dismissal one could say looking at the big picture\nAnd today in England or those lifetime appointments still the situation\nSuddenly enough said not so lifetime appointment was the main safeguard for nearly three hundred years but in the Nineteen eighties it was realized

judges were reaching advanced age that I'm a ... ... ... and that's one of the most famous English stretches low tending\nThe leading judge of the twentieth century started expressing some very or socially conservative views and books he was writing and the feeling was that if judges were going to do this at the front edge\nThey could bring the reputation of the courts into district periods so retirement age was introduced it's currently Seventy\nI mean they're more than fifty countries in the commonwealth which are influenced by the English model from India to your own native South Africa and they all evolved in the same direction of ending lifetime tenure\nI guess they have so there are exceptions but there are three small Pacific Island states where judges that typically brought in on a contract basis or for this discussion when we're talking about logic countries we can leave them to one side so it's striking that\nThere's no more lifetime appointment in that group of upcoming little countries with their heritage that the u._s. system also says\nSo here I Am a little confused about where the U.S sits right now so if you consider the systems of judicial appointments or in

parties and purposes I what I Do want to highlight is this\nSpecific issue of retirement that we've been speaking about that is an area in which we've seen that the U.S has been left\nBehind with other countries have introduced to time it just\nEnded and another problem that causes that we haven't talked about yet is the pressure on individual\nJustices to decide when to retire so Justice Kennedy made a very important decision when he retired now like any of us he's been titled to to stop working buck that decision carried far more consequences\nBecause it was his and systems where there's a retirement age a more predictable in that way and sets up less tension between presidents of governments on the one side and judges on the other side who have to decide whether to yield the

S. like the Kavanaugh nomination for example they do turn and focus on amplifying both sides of that issue kind of sowing discord which is again really similar to what we saw in twenty sixteen\nOr are these campaigns are targeting specific races and specific states\nEven in races that have been very high profile\nFor example the crews are ... Senate race in Texas right while there is a lot of social media engagement around that race\nAnd there are some tactics being used again by we think domestic actors that are arguably manipulative we're not seeing a lot of foreign amplification of um of one candidate or another and in those races\nGenerally how would you say these operations are right now compared to what we saw in the twenty sixteen us presidential election both in terms of the end goal and uh the strategy how it's actually done what\nWe're seeing an evolution of tactics so this is definitely an arms race the social media platforms haven't proved to their ability to detect certain types of tactics that we know are associated with foreign influence but of course new tactics are evolving a new proxies are being

proxies are being developed or new human assets are being cultivated so that foreign actors can operate through real Americans and ... skate their activity\nUm and in terms of strategy I'd say that's been largely consistent from one election to the next\nAs much as there's been a huge focus on whether or not the Russian operation was focused on supporting the Trump campaign over the Clinton campaign ultimately I think what we've seen over the long term is that they're real strategy was focusing on things that were very divisive and of course presidential elections are very device and\nAnd the more divisive they can make that conversation the veteran the Kavanaugh nomination and the me too movement of the allegations of sexual assault I think of course\nThat's been a a very sort of an open wound for the country right now so it's really no surprise that these accounts were trying to\nUm exacerbate that uh that discord\nSpeaking of social media tactics we just heard a story about Facebook working with fact checkers are on the ground and Brazil to prevent the spread of disinformation or as people there had to polls over the weekend this coming weekend our Facebook and other social media companies doing the same kind of things here in the U.S [noise] they are\nAnd I think working with fact checkers is certainly one part of the solution of course we want the

the social media platforms are also starting to work with third parties to identify this sort of manipulative distribution\n[noise] I I just want to ask you about the the news today a department of justice that charging seven Russian military officials for hacking into anti doping agency's and activists as well as a Pennsylvania nuclear energy concern um it's kind of apples and oranges compared to what we're talking about but it does suggest more Russian meddling\nHow do you see these charges against the concern of more apparent election meddling\nI think this is actually an indication that what we traditionally think about as cyber warfare and what we've started to think about his information warfare are actually won in the same\nAnd the more that we think about these two things as being synonymous are overlapping the more we'll be able to defend ourselves against these types of attacks in the future and thoughtfully engage with our adversaries around what isn't isn't
