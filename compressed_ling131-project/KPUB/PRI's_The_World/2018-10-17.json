S. for asylum one of those is obviously family separation what are the others\nWell the reason that the Trump Administration was separated families was not just to be cruel it wanted to detain all asylum seekers indefinitely\nIf you're detaining refugees only based on their migration status and they don't present any kind of risks of society or viscous lean that constitutes arbitrary detention under international law\nAnd then right now along the entire length of the U.S Mexico border the Trump Administration is pushing thousands of asylum seekers back into Mexico and telling them that it's

them to wait there we also found that the U.S authorities had been encouraging Mexican immigration officials to deport those asylum seekers back to the very countries where they fled persecution or threats of death and that's flat illegal under both US law and international law\nSo they're these three interlocking policies and since we released a report both Republican and democratic members of Congress have come to is asking for more information we're hopeful that as we get closer to the appropriations process that Congress can use the power of the purse to compel the department of homeland security to be more forthcoming\nBack now to Maria the Brazilian grandmother seeking asylum in the U.S with her grandson Brian griffey says Amnesty International was president of Murray's final

grandson so you don't get deported without um so what you see here is a clear threat of permanently separating the grandmother from her grandson at the threat of being deported without him\nAnd what we saw in terms of both the grandmother and the grandson is it the long term consequences are great she actually had a medical emergency\nWhere she had to be rushed to the hospital because of health deteriorated so much from the mental anguish of being separated from her grandson with special needs and she presented us in court and still they prolonged her attention finally actually it was only
