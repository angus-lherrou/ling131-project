she's the international director of the AFL CIO she says that back in June housekeepers from Chicago presented at an international labor conference in Geneva they inspired other housekeepers working

have to work with\nWhat we had a little bit to start with just from the information that Russia had released and also the British authorities had really about the cover identities like this guy so we now know his real name is Aleksandr Michigan but before he was ... when he was known as Oxnard Petra which was his coverage and he says you know totally fake identity they made up out of nowhere for him to travel under\nUm and so we had some information about that cover identity including his birthday um where he had to pass passport issue too which is very small town in the middle of nowhere [noise]\nI'm In northern Russia so that was a good starting point\nSo talk a bit more about that process how you you've got that starting point where do you go from there\nSo we have the starting point if we can assume that he probably\nUse some of the same information to discover identity from his real identity so we looked into a bunch of databases some of them are openly available some of them are linked um Russia is a very corrupt and leaky society and because of that there's leaked databases\nFrom driver's licenses and insurance stuff and voter registration and addresses and stuff all over the Internet you can find a few years now where to look cross reference everything we could find and we found him ... about a guy named Alex in Michigan at the same birth date and it's from roughly the same village in the middle of nowhere and northern Russia\nAnd after a bunch of digging including actually sending someone to go to this tiny little village where he's from and finding locals who knew him apparently he was a local DJ on before he went to medical school yeah he was he a DJ at the local club one club I'm sure they had in a tiny village\nSo we once these hunters and these databases across represent a tiny bit of information we think would probably matched the true identity of Michigan\nI go to see some of the steps in in your process the you and your investigators really seemed to have to put your cells in the mindset of a spy\nAway I mean a lot of this is just a lot of very creative thinking thinking of um any vulnerabilities of what would leave a paper trail from a spy and Russia are so\nHe was a local DJ on before he went to medical school yeah he would be a DJ at the local club one club I'm sure they had in a tiny village so we once these hunters in these databases cross referencing the tiny bit of information we think would probably max the true identity of Michigan\nI got to say some of the steps in in your process to you and your investigators really seemed to have to put yourself in the mindset of a spy\nAway I mean a lot of this is just a lot of very creative thinking thinking of um any vulnerabilities of what would leave a paper trail from a spy and Russia so you know maybe not you can't find his birth certificate right because maybe that's all the information is hidden away forever but again these spies have real lives to they have a family they have kids\nSo you can find information that would track back to them so\nI mean yes maybe some of this kind of spy Ware but a lot of very very basic routine research on this stuff you learned and you know high school or college or you know searching looking for an interesting details cross referencing them and see what's on your matches up\nNow that you've got a name what else were you able to find out about Dr Alexander Michigan like do have evidence that he was working on behalf of the Kremlin\n[noise] yeah I mean this guy is listed his registered addresses as the headquarters of the ... which went first glance it's absolutely insane like why would a secret spy list his public\nAddress like on his driver's license to address the you know see I ... the equivalent of the CIA well he did it because uh you know if he gets pulled over in his car the cop pulls up his address and he sees the address of the you know the Russian CIA more or less and he's like oh actually no everything's me up and up you can just go you know\nYou're fine so um that we ran the address I'm at a traffic database we found is three hundred and five men all between the ages of twenty five hundred fifty\nYou all have the same register to address or just says one address in Moscow so all these men almost certainly are often you that you are you and they all lifted their vehicle registration as his address 'cause they just don't want to be a traffic fines and they get\nSee I ... the equivalent of the CIA well he did it because uh you know if it gets pulled over and his car the cop pulls up his address and he sees the address of the you know the Russian CIA more or less and he's like oh actually no everything's me up and up you can just go you know\nYou're fine so um that we ran the address I'm at a traffic database we found is three hundred and five men all between the ages of twenty five and fifty\nAll had the same register to address the gift says one address in Moscow so all these men almost certainly are often you that you are you\nAnd they all lifted their vehicle registration as his address who's I guess I Want to pay traffic fines and they get pulled over or they get hold of her drunk driving or speeding the cop just let them go right because they don't want to mess with somebody in the intelligence services so really everything goes down to laziness and I guess corruption in a way to 'em and that's how a lot of the owner ... how are you able to research this um played out\nSo the headline in the guardian on this news intrigued me it said a string of own goals by Russian Spies exposes a strange sloppy and is so what is your take on the possibility that this was not sloppy and his butt intentional that Russia want it to leak who these men were\nI mean I suppose it's always possible right because we know every time any investigation of the nation I Russia people always chime in and saying well they want you to find the right well if they want us to find a wise no one published this stuff before because you know these insurance registration for these vehicles they're looking to cheer you headquarters\nYou know they've been doing this for years and years and years and years and registering new agencies address same like Jerry you address it again it makes no sense when you think about it but it all kind of boils down to
