Mexican authority will try to negotiate with them in order for them to apply for humanitarian be says\nDaniel how do you think most Mexicans view the Central Americans passing through Mexico right now

to steal our jobs for Mexico is not so easy just to ignore or scrapped the U.S points of view in this issue\nWe are countries that are heavily dependent upon each other Fifteen hundred billion dollars

White House in Washington is certainly Danielle me young is a political consultant in Mexico city he's also a former spokesman in the government of president Enrique Pena Nieto\nDanielle thank you for your time happy to talk to you Michael\nYesterday President Trump announced that he would make cuts in U.S foreign aid for three Central American countries\nGuatemala Honduras and El Salvador they've been receiving the said since twenty sixteen and it's expected to go down by nearly forty percent in twenty Nineteen that means cutting tens of millions of dollars and financial assistance to the region we wanted to know what that eight actually goes to\nSarah appears is with the migration Policy Institute in Washington\nSo what has this aid been used for what what was it earmarked for and how was it used\nTo use very wide variety of issues I mean one of the biggest issues when you're talking specifically about the northern triangle country is the alliance for prosperity this is a program that arose out as a separate migration crisis that we had in two thousand fourteen when a lot of company in child migrants arrived at our southern border\nPresident Obama at that time and knowledge that in order to really address migration you need to go to the root cause and and look at what's going on in these countries to cause people to to flee and and really have this mass exodus the alliance for prosperity is designed\nLook at what's going on in these countries to cause people to to fleeing and really have this mass exodus\nThe alliance for prosperity is designed to increase economic prosperity in those countries and strengthen institutions because there's a lot of issues with corruption so that's one of our our major programs going into these countries and and one of the programs that the president you know in reality is threatening to to end\nSo regardless of how much eventually get stripped out of the budget line for a Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador can the Trump Administration or any other administration without approval of Congress just slash an aid package to a country\nLooking at the law as it might be possible that he has the ability to transfer maybe ten percent of what has been appropriated but no he cannot do that you know laterally and of course because Congress isn't in session now if he really wanted to to end it to these countries he'd really need to wait until they come back in session after November\n... or how political do see this movie is it something that Trump believes will play well with Republican voters prior to the midterms\nYeah absolutely President Trump ran on immigration he saw that\nIssue when in the election and I think he thinks that it is a good one for Republicans going into the midterms so this caravan effectively as a political gift to him and Republicans in that they can play this up they can play themselves up as the party that is hard line on immigration and that will\nSave the country quote unquote from this care of and\nA Trump made this announcement yesterday have you heard any news from Honduras or El Salvador Guatemala about what could happen if as much as forty percent of the state gets caught\nI think the northern triangle countries in Mexico as well are are doing a good job of trying to weed through what's coming out from the president and what's coming out\nMexico as well are are doing a good job of trying to\nWeed through what's coming out from the president and what's coming out in the press and and try to stick to what's actually happening on the ground they recognize that we have a very eminent election in the country and they're just trying to stick with what they think will will actually come so I haven't heard a lot of\nReal concern on the ground up around that aid\nAnd just because it seems so unlikely that that Congress would go through with a threat like that\nAnd what is your organization for migration Policy Institute planning in terms of strategy to to take this on anything\nFor us we're really looking at those reforms to asylum like I mentioned earlier we actually published a report last month advocating for certain reforms to the asylum system including changing asylum for individuals who are applying at our border like this care of and so that\nUm it operates more efficiently because right now if if anyone in the care of and apply for asylum they'll likely be placed in our immigration court backlog which stretches on for years so lovely waiting in the United states and the way down the line\nAnd immigration court judge will have to pick up their case and started from scratch and see if it isn't sincere asylum application\nIn reality we'd like to see it a more efficient system operating at the southern border so where we're working really hard to to kind of push out that idea and and stress the importance of granting asylum to those who merit it\nSurreptitiously policy analyst with the migration Policy Institute in

much warmer days settling by the weekend\nI market where a man this is the world lately things have been pretty tense between the U.S and China and not just over trade and tariffs earlier this month and a major speech vice president Mike Pence took aim at China's leaders\nNow contesting America's geopolitical advantages and trying in essence to change the international order in their favor under President Trump's leadership the United states has taken decisive action to respond to China with American action\nOther areas of friction include the south China Sea Taiwan human rights intellectual property not to mention President Trump accusing China of meddling in the mid term election campaign David Rennie writes the blog one column and the economy is so big question David here is this a new Cold War with China\nDoesn't have to be on China is extremely key ... that it should not be they don't even wants to trade will and they are pretty desperate to avoid one end to work out what America wants\nBought it used to be just a few hard line is here in Beijing who saw that America actually\nCouldn't be negotiated with the America wanted to contain China and still China's rise that fringe of hardliners is now spreading an awful lot of Chinese leaders look at the speech by vice president Mike Pence attacking China for a a kind of laundry list of complaints\nThey look at how Donald Trump isn't really engaging when it comes to winding down this potential trade ... and they're starting to wonder whether there was fear\nMight actually be what's happening to them which is that just as they were poised to become a kind of great super power of the top of this of economic toy simple America in its last kind of\nDying vengeance is a kind of aging heck I'm On has to ...\nAmerica in its last kind of\nDying vengeance is a kind of aging heck I'm On has to ... so that is the that is the question that Beijing leaders ... and they absolutely will not looking for this fight right now that busy trying to become rich and powerful and this has come out of out of the blue cap the\nWell the Trans Pacific partnership or TPP that was supposed to give us some leverage with some of the dishes like intellectual property rights but Trump pulled out of it\nThat's really I mean there was a a a a retard very senior American officials in Beijing last week and it was all off the record so I Can't name him but he was a kind of household name in this day and he comes to ... for business or an stokes the Chinese they take advice from him\nAnd he had a small dinner for a group of us in Beijing we're discussing what Donald Trump wants\nOn you know I was discussing having entity Trump the times about China went understood in DC I kind of put it to him and he was kind of uncomfortable but then said that maybe there's something to this that the\nProblem is that the machine in Washington has kind of systematic structural things but it wants China to do differently\nTo play by the rules to try and fix the world trade older as you say Marco to you know to what was something like the ... everyone opens their markets that bull\nDonald Trump I think is a systems kind of guy I think he has a number of very powerful very instinctive ideas and I think if you look at what he's been saying about China on trade it's almost as if\nYou know he's a real estate guy and he thinks of the American market the American economy as a fantastically valuable piece of real estate\nAnd that previous presidents and America's administrations were too dumb and to kind of kindly to charge enough rent to the rest of the world access to that market and so it's like you know Donald Trump's back in his real estate days he's he he he owns a valuable\nAnd his real estate days he's he he he owns a valuable properties this time it's called the United states and it's time to review the rent and it's not going to be pleasant for the guy on the other side of the table but\nThere isn't gonna biggest structural kind of vision of how to run the world trading older it's just it's time you pay a lot more rent I I think that's the core of what Donald Trump is up to right now what is China's vision for the world\nSo he's a really interesting saying the Chinese joined the world Trade Organization Seventeen years ago and have basically been gaming the system ever since\nUh China\nChina is very interesting world power because China has an incredibly clear vision of where it wants to end up it has a very clear and gold and you know broadly that's to be one of the world's most powerful to countries and so powerful that no one else gets to say no to them\nDoes to go how they get that\nNot actually so important that quite opportunistic if one ... they'll try another if there's too much pushback then they'll be nice for a bit that's very very kind of cross through by feeding the the Chinese kind of fries\nAnd and for a long time they would gaming world trading system and and that was how they liked it well it's really interesting about this last few months to trade tensions and you get is when you talk to the European government leaders have been talking to the Chinese visiting Beijing\nIt turns out that the one thing that the Chinese dislike more than an American led worlds trading order is no rules a tool\nAnd so suddenly the Chinese are being undermined the rules gaming the rules playing the system so I think they realize that the one thing they do want to do is to lose the system completely so suddenly the Chinese are quite in the winter of reforming the WTO no longer kind of cheating so much so there is all this kind of this one of these moving parts\nWhere you could actually see something quite positive ... the problem is\nThat's one of these moving parts where you could actually see something quite positive ... the problem is\nThat you can also see some very negative kind of forces that could feed off each other and we could go the wrong direction a an absolutely confident that the Chinese don't actually know how to play this ... because\nReasonably senior Chinese officials are now working their way down the list of people who can explain to them and they got ... down the list are also people like me and I literally have conversations with them when I say I'm going to pose a it's not my job to tell you you know how to handle the Americans but they're also ... everyone is this trade war avoidable Graham\nAllison over at Harvard coined the phrase a few cities trap tell us what that is and how the Chinese yet so she said this\nAn ancient Greek historian who wrote about when you had a a very militaristic rising power sponsor coming up against the status quo ... Athens it ended up inevitably leads into war and so he analyzed a number of occasions I have a human history where\nThe status quo power finds itself being challenged by an upstart and in a depressing number of cases that does triggered armed conflict I mean you could be an optimist and say the Chinese are busy trying to get rich\nThat trying to become more powerful they are absolutely not looking to start the Cold War they don't have time for this they don't have time even for trade will let alone a shooting war so they're just not going to stall sentencing um and actually I didn't think told Trump is a particularly militaristic\nMan I mean he's the kind of the guy who got any number of photons from Vietnam I think he's not physically a kind of war like person he's that kind of ... soft handed kind of New York real estate guy\nI'm so they think that as people it shouldn't go to war but the dynamics can get a bit away from you when you've got these two big big countries that no longer think that they are confined when when\nA bit away from you when you've got these two big big countries that no longer think that they are\nConfined win win solutions you know this does feel weirdly zero some now it feels as though the American charges that China's rise is at America's expense\nAnd that this is a kind of wouldn't before trying to get so big\nThat it's too late to stop it it's it's a window to try and ... there was this sort of thing Donald Trump said I think it was the U.N General assembly speech when he said the previous presidents such that have been ready to watch China rise to become the world's most powerful country and the on his watch\nThat wasn't going to happen quite so see that's a really extraordinary statement you know previous American presidents said\nYou know if you're going to rise let's make sure you rise in the right way you're going to rise as a responsible stakeholder remember that phrase that people used to use about China that it was going to become a kind of a member of the greats into good a pope the international order along with everyone else but for Donald Trump to say at least as a piece of rhetoric\nThis is a concern all around the globe right now like in Brazil we've been reporting on the heated presidential election runoff in Brazil this weekend\nRight wing candidate shy or both in our was facing off against left his opponent Fernando ... died this information and fake news have been huge issues in that race a lot of it is playing out on the messaging platform what's up\nWhich we should note is owned by Facebook user direct quarter of a is a Brazilian researcher now in Boston studying all this at Harvard shore instinct center she's also involved in an effort called ... over a collaboration between twenty five Brazilian newsrooms to identify and debunk fake news\nQuarter of a tells me that the fake stories she's seeing a WhatsApp are out of control\nWe make fun actually because the the misinformation campaigns in Brazil\nThey sometimes can get absurd in what way at their support in in the knees and ... years that I totally known scenes like Venezuela supported by Hezbollah or stuff like this\nAnd I was coming here and I had a discussion with a friend that teaches at Harvard she was trying to convince me that the right wing candidate was the antidote to\nAnd I had a discussion with a friend that teaches at Harvard she was trying to convince me that the right wing candidate was the antidote to present you not becoming a Venezuela supported by Hezbollah so what was his teacher Brazilian she's Brazilian\nShe's Brazilian she probably heard this thing's via\nAnd I I started to last and it was like yeah you know what listen here's the website of control over this is ally this this this is known since please you're a teacher at Harvard [laughter] but people believe this thing's\nSo is that one of the rumors that Hezbollah connection with Venezuela is that one of the rumors of spreading on what's happened Brazil\nYes this is bringing you this is fresh room or [laughter]\nThan there are the older still rumors making a comeback as Brazil's president ... seats up\nFor example we had a real more about the last candidate being the creator of something called ... which is supposed to be an educational heat to teach kids how to be gay\nWhile the implication being if you vote for the left wing candidate you're going to have gay kids in\nSchools and there will be connections with the government and a Venezuela and has a lot of the same time [laughter] and I see what you're saying but absurd\nUm just to be clear what definitive links have there been between these disinformation campaigns and either political candidate like the charges ... launched this yeah that'll legitimate claim\nThis is a rule more from two thousand twelve it's just you up in the website of the right wing candidate he created this a false information he was a a a member of the the Congress so he took this issue to the Congress and seven\nCreated this a false information he was a a a member of the the Congress so he took this issue to the Congress and several Congress person that are religious they supported him in this story and this became a monster\nBoth in our was also accused of creating another monster a big one last week a Brazilian newspaper reporter that the right wing candidate was working with local marketing firms to buy a bundle of phone numbers and use them to mask tax propaganda to Brazilians through what's up Brazilian authorities are investigating those claims in\nThe meantime people like you also do record of a are trying to put out the flames before the turn into a fake news wildfire in Brazil\nWas very interesting is that as far as I've seen of watch the news in this information\nThere is no story that is not in both platforms Facebook and ... ... what we see a different types of presentations\nSo when ... you have an all you see like there's this thing happening you have to act\nSo there's a call to action that's very strong shared this otherwise our country is going to be a Venezuelan five years share this to save our country stuff like this\nOn Facebook you have the same narrative is the same narrative but Facebook is more sophisticated they have videos they have text specialist opinions all the things that make\nPeople believe to what I see is that there's an entire system if you look just to watch that uh we're not getting all the picture\nI mean ... I I don't want to suggest that Brazil is different from any other place in the world but I mean is there a kind of a cultural thing here with the contagion\nI mean I I'm I don't want to suggest that Brazil is different from any other place in the world but I mean is there a kind of a cultural thing here with the contagion of these these fake news stories\nYes we have a a social and economic component that need to be taken into account when you talk about fake news and what what are those guys I think we have a huge inequality in poor people are left behind in in so many things including education\nWe have a level of instability that was provoked biting peach mint\nOf Duma that made people human ... a former president ... yeah uh that makes ... made people believing in and they don't believe in these situations anymore neither the government or the newspapers\nOr and I know there is no easy solutions that they would believe right now and and this is also very important when you study fake news because people tend to believe in the misinformation campaigns instead of believing in the institutions or newsrooms\nThat was just a dark quarter of a on how fake news is playing out of Brazil's presidential election\nQuarterback studies this information out of Harvard shore and seeing center she's also involved with ... a collaboration with Brazilian newsrooms and social media companies to take fake stories off their platforms the runoff election in Brazil by the way takes place this Sunday\n[noise]\nThere's a very well preserved shipwreck lying at the bottom of the black sea off because of Bulgaria it is so old how old is it it made it back to a time when Aristotle was alive hard to believe this rock was found by a team of researchers using a remote\nSo old how old is it it may date back to a time when Aristotle was alive hard to believe this rock was found by a team of researchers using a remote controlled submarine they found more than sixty shipwrecks and total deep and the black sea\nIncluding this one Seventy five foot Greek trading vessel which they estimate has been lying under water for the past two thousand four hundred years\nWhich they say might make this the oldest intact shipwreck ever discovered professor John Adams was the principal investigator for the black sea maritime archeology project\nThe ...
