preparations for his memorial after your father died in Nineteen Ninety six because the Chinese officials had their own ideas about how that offense should really unfold right\nYes is this the communist society Irish and have a clear\nHierarchy you know so he was a kick out from a Communist Party\nAnd even he was the same generation has a state leaders Chairman Mao drawn islands of people\nThey weren't together but uh but he was heavily criticized author writes has in some way against the party so your father was in that inner circle with now oh yeah yeah they're really core which is supported the ruble ocean or part of the ...\nBy the late ... of course have being kicked it on a from a party or unpaid revolution and uh spend about the ... year some ... ... not just allowed to ride towards his name's totally disappeared in the public\nSo the memorial how did that memorial first they decided to his body has to be covered by communist flack\nIs very high on there and that means you're you're part of it is a revolution but I feel ... uncomfortable you know I said you know you should not do something to somebody already passed away which you know it's me against his way\nSo I made that argument that says we don't need covers out a flak\nDid they resist ... yeah they they told me they said the you'll find that doesn't just been onto your family you know which is very good argument\nDid they resist ... yeah they they told me they said you'll find that doesn't just\nBeen onto your family you know which is very good argument and they say a recent belongs to

forty or these bubbles trapped on this lake and a bunch more nearby\nThey check all of them multiple times a week all summer long\nAnd this is all just to understand how much methane is coming off this one small area this year under these particular conditions groups of scientists art work around the Arctic studying sites that are wetter or dryer colder or warmers with more or less

food we eat and where we live is just not adapted to it\nWe don't know how close we are to a massive release of carbon from frozen Arctic soils but we do know that every bit of carbon we emit into the atmosphere gets us closer to that point\nScientists call it a positive feedback loop more carbon in the air leads to more warming which leads to the release of more carbon and the process just builds on itself\nAnother thing we know is that we don't get a second chance at this once our emissions potentially trigger this huge release of carbon we've put ourselves at the mercy of processes that we can't control and that will dramatically reshape the earth's climate and our own civilizations\nI ask your team if he thought there was any way to stop this experiment we're conducting on the Arctic
