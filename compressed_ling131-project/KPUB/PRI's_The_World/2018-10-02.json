African security correspondent joins us from Nairobi are really outstanding piece of investigative journalism Tommy what made you and the team think you could actually crack this case\n[noise] well I think first of all there was just the the shock\nThat gripped everyone who saw this video right from the beginning\nAnd it began you know just conversations across to each other with different research is reaching out and saying does anybody know whether this is as anybody have any idea\nWhat the what this terrain um links to and that's how the conversation started and lots of people talking and then the b._b._c. picked up on that and became a full on the investigation\nI mean I guess the first challenge was to figure out what country this happened in them and getting more specific details about where in that country how did you figure out the location and what role did open source technology play in that\n[noise] well [noise] I mean it parts of this whole collaboration festival looking at that that could be anywhere in the ... which is why it across west in Central Africa\nA botched with many heads put together a one of them was Amnesty International the rights of

that and you know also when people when you listen to the video and you know\nLooking at the uniforms listening to some of the dialogue in it I'm an amnesty with their research as well they suggest that\nThis was Camry when this was northern Cameroon of course that's also a vast region but over time trying to match the topography as you could see in the video there are ... distinct outlines of the mountains in the video and\nUsing those ridge lines matching them to Google or in digital globe and other imagery providers using geo location that's how you know this whole all moved on and and the location was matched\nI've found that part a little bit difficult to kind of understanding how you were able to know that that ritual on match the contours of what you found on GPS I mean that's the only rich line that has that shape and all of camera room\nIt's painstaking work it's it's not something that was very easy bought the ... so many clues put together says not just the rich line I could be any ridge land but when you have one clue when you have another clue you sort of bring them together\nAnd that narrows the results you get so for example looking at different times for example when setting buildings existed was it was when they did not so going back in time and looking at different elements of that and adding everything together so it's it's something that took\nQuite a bit of time and more than a dozen people working on it\nYeah and you also worked with Ellen cat the open source research group which is seriously experience in this\nEasy bought the ...

together so it's it's something that took\nQuite a bit of time and more than a dozen people working on it\nYeah and you also work with Ellen cat the open source research group which is seriously experience in this kind of stuff um how did you figure out who was responsible [noise] well\nOf all the government tried to deny initially that these were Cameroon and soldiers they said you know or the uniform on was not watch um the the soldiers would wear up north\nUm they said the guns and not the ones issued to communion soldiers but we did identify some of the guns one of them is a staff I Am Twenty one which is used by some divisions of the kind of Indian Army will serve on some of the the uniforms\nWhere indeed communion military uniforms and and so we were able to\nTo festival identify and co found that those were communion soldiers but then in the dialogue as well some of the soldiers were saying each other's names one of them was was referred to as Churchill or another one is called sign guy but\nAround the same time before the b._b._c. investigation came out the camera and government actually arrested seven men seven soldiers so they changed their tone and said well they had the rest at seven people in in relation to this video\nAnd ... from the BBC's own investigation were able to match these names that were mentioned in the video\nTo some of the ones that were arrested and some of those names when nicknames but on the on the official list they had the official names and so we could match that we can use Facebook as well to match some of those details of your parents\nTime before the b._b._c. investigation came out the camera and government actually arrested seven men seven soldiers so they changed their tone and said well they had the rest it said and people in in relation to this video\nAnd ... from the BBC's own investigation were able to match these names that were mentioned in the video to some of the ones that were arrested and some of

know you found church on Facebook right yes indeed um that's that's the nickname of a soldier cold ... and apart from just to Facebook you know we found a will to speak to a former ... soldier who also confirmed that this wasn't the Joe Joe so somebody who who knew him\nHave you been able to find out in the team been able to find out any possible motive for this violent crime to women to children including a baby\nAt the beginning of the of the video we see them are referring to to these uh women as Boko Haram so saying that they are members or at least affiliated with Boko Haram and there's a point where I Am I'm\nOne of the soldiers sort of a tell this child that I'm Sorry we have to do this kind of thing and and and\nUm basically saying it's it's the parents' fault or you are getting killed as well um so you know the soldiers in affording these women and children any any access to to fat trial to a fair trial or they just you know execute what they consider justice on the spot\nYou know I guess we'll see how many crimes like this are are invisible what kind of feedback or to this investigation has the b._b._c.

Africa gotten from the public like from Cameroon and Nigeria itself the\nFeedback has been overwhelming and people of all walks of life from around the world responding to this and saying you know well done on the work\nBut I think one thing that people are most fascinated by is the message\nYou know the location the use of mathematical calculations calculating for example you know the angle of the sun and using that versus the length of a shadow and using that to tell what time when exactly this happened so those kinds of things have really I'm really fired up the audiences\nI'm so there's been a lot of praise for that and a lot of people hoping that more can come out a cameraman and people in particular that had been calling for more to be done to hold their their government and their forces accountable\nThe video or you have to say is very disturbing how're you doing and the others on the investigative team\nUm it's it's not an easy video to uh to watch um [noise] you know it's it's it's difficult to you know once you've seen at festivals even believe that that happened and and and the shock\nThe investigative team um it's it's not an easy video to uh to watch um [noise] you know it's it's it's difficult to you know once you've seen it festivals even believe that that happened and and and the shock\nThe tent camp is you know pretty remote it's very far\nFrom El Paso which I think is the closest city there's not a lot of vegetation is just you know kind of think the picture's really speak for themselves as you'll there's rows and rows of those tents that are the children's living quarters or they have a couple other facilities on site dining facilities and the like but\nBut it's it you know it is remote and it and\nIt feels like you're kind of in the middle of the other\nI Know that you are at the women's refugee commission have concerns that this large scale camp makes kids more vulnerable can you elaborate on that how how does it do the\nKnow let's say that a child was moved from the facility where they were maybe thirty bad a capacity for thirty children so much more of a homey environment they have access to education so they'll receive some kind of classroom instruction and basic\nYou know basic subjects to learn some English the also have regular attention they'll have regular access to medical care to um you know mental health support psychologist a lot of these children are suffering or you know I may have experienced some kind of trauma either you know in home country is the reason we're leaving\nAnd or possibly route and so and so it's very important that these children have\nYou know the attention that they need and the access that they need to and so on\nChildren so much more of a homey environment they have access to education so they'll receive some kind of classroom instruction and basic\nYou know basic subjects to learn some English the also have regular attention will have regular access to medical care to um you know mental health support psychologist a lot of these children are suffering or you know I may have experience some kind of trauma either you know in home country is the reason for leaving\nAnd or possibly route and so and so it's very important that these children have\nYou know the attention that they need and the access that they need to and so I think in a big facility when we turn to these big facilities like tornado this emergency facility we see that um you know there isn't the same provision for education um the the kids you know we were told the kids get work books but\nThat's not a education yet not far cry from classroom education and um in terms of any kinds of mount mental health care you know emotional support anything along those lines it's really ad hoc it's really the onus is on the child to to ask for it but you know\nThey've just been transition there from a different facility they don't know anyone there disoriented you know there possibly upset about it and so I think it's really difficult in those situations coupled with being with thousands of kids you know hundreds of other kids um it's quite stabilizing\nYeah ... ... when he was like about the Thirteen to Seventeen year olds and what they're thinking legally I mean they have any legal help with that connects us [noise]\nWell that's a great question so um you know it doesn't happen in every facility but you know by and large children at the permanent shelters are provided with an you know your rights presentation um they receive screening and so in some cases some of the children are able to get legal support through those avenues\nUm you know because the children are transferred from other facilities to turn into you know my understanding is that they're not receiving any more no\nThe Thirteen to Seventeen year olds and what they're thinking legally I mean they have any legal help if they can access\n[noise] um well that's a great question so um you know it doesn't happen in every facility but you know by and large children at the permanent\nShelters are provided with an you know your rights presentation um they receive screening and so in some cases some of the children are able to get legal support through those avenues um\nYou know because the children are transferred from other facilities to turn into you know my understanding is that they're not receiving any more no you're right that tornado I'm at the ... facility and you know the access to legal services there has been very difficult so again it is concerning\nMeantime the administration and its supporters say the immigration system is broken and Congress needs to fix it um how do you respond to the\nShow I mean I think we have a system we have a a protection system in place a lot of these kids are seeking protection in this country we have that in place you know could improve short I think what's really missing is investment in the system there is a huge backlog of cases we need more immigration judges more support staff\nOr those judges I mean I think we need to really invest in the process instead of saying oh the process doesn't work because it's so slow or oh the process doesn't work for other reasons and so I think it's it's a chronic\nLack of investing in a system\nWe we need to prioritize getting kids out of getting children out of detention it's just not appropriate for them it's just not a price not a long term it's not a good solution we need to get kids out of detention and we need to continue to work on the immigration on excuse me on the immigration court system\n[noise] um or are you hopeful\nHopeful you know I I Am hopeful and the sense that I think I'm I'm I'm you know the public is engaged on this issue I think I'm Congress has been very\nInvesting in a system we we need to prioritize getting kids out of getting children out of detention it's just not appropriate for them it's just not it probably is not a long time it's not a good solution we need to get kids out of detention and we need to continue to work on the immigration on excuse me on the immigration court system\n[noise] um or are you hopeful\nMy hopeful you know I I Am hopeful and the thing that I think I'm I'm I'm\nYou know the public is engaged on this issue I think I'm Congress has been very engaged in this issue um and you know\nDoing a lot of it certainly it's a different shelters looking at this this issue holistically from from a rival to the immigration courts and so I'm hopeful there's a lot of oversight on this right now but I'm obviously\nIt's one thing to have that versus you know commitment to funding you know and and hiring more judges and you know to really think children to appropriate and safe sponsors as soon as possible\nLeah ... an attorney with the women's refugee commission thank you for your time well thank you very much\nPresident Trump's crackdown on immigration has taken many forms over the past year and nine months\nOne of the latest a proposed rule change regarding how the U.S government decides whether someone is eligible for a visa or permanent residency this change would essentially mean that anyone deemed to be at risk of becoming a public charge of the government\nBy access and government benefits like Medicaid or housing subsidies for example could be denied a visa or a green card\nAdvocates fear this could lead to families here in the U.S doing without benefits or even medical care for fear of putting their legal status in jeopardy laundry for loosely says she's already seen that happening but loosely the pediatrician and Washington and a spokesperson for the American Academy of pediatrics\nSo this proposed rule is a vast expansion of what can be used against an immigrant who was applying for a visa or for permanent residency\n... of becoming a public charge of the government by access and government benefits like Medicaid or housing subsidies for example could be denied a visa or a green card\nAdvocates fear this could lead to families here in the U.S doing without benefits or even medical care for fear of putting their legal status in jeopardy laundry for loosely says she's already seen it happening but loses a pediatrician and Washington and a spokesperson for the American Academy of pediatrics\nSo this proposed rule is a vast expansion of what can be used against an immigrant who was applying for a visa or for permanent residency\nSo what it does really from my perspective as a pediatrician is that it presents are immigrant families with an unfair choice to either keep yourself and your children healthy but risk being separated for using these services such as Medicaid or snap also called food stamps or forego those vital services\nThat include healthcare and Nutrition Assistance or your family can remain together in this country\nSo really this proposed rule is a dangerous threat to childhood family health\nSo the rule uh obviously still proposal phase but what chilling effect so are you already are seeing and hearing from families\nSo I've been seeing the chilling effect for months already with families deciding to descend roll from these vital services just in case it could be used against them in the future\nAnd this includes even opting out of programs again like snap and even wake or the women infants and children program\nAnd four months parents have been asking us if it's safe for them to access these programs and it's tough because it's a very complex proposal the draft of which is nearly four hundred and fifty pages so parents are choosing to play it safe and remove themselves from programs that they qualify for so it's a very confusing and scary time for the families I see\nI'm Wondering if you couldn't tell us about a specific conversation you've had recently with a family or a parent who is facing the dilemma you're talking about\nI'd say that one of the many ...\nOut of programs again like snap and even way or the women infants and children program\nAnd four months parents have been asking us if it's safe for them to access these programs and it's tough because it's a very complex proposal the draft of which is nearly four hundred and fifty pages so parents are choosing to play it safe and remove themselves from programs that they qualify for so it's a very confusing and scary time for the families I see\nI'm Wondering if you couldn't tell us about a specific conversation you've had recently with a family or a parent who is facing the dilemma you're talking about\nSo I'd say the one of the many situations that troubled me in particular is that more and more I'm seeing new moms with newborns who are only a few days old choosing not to sign up for these services so as recently as last week I cared for baby who was only four days old\nAnd as with many new moms I'm the mom was motivated to breastfeed what was having a difficult time doing so she's also concerned that her family was not able to afford fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods that are vital especially for breastfeeding mom\nI'm so they usually do I talked about the many benefits of federal programs that provide breastfeeding support or formula is needed or food assistance but she declined I'm and she said that she'd heard that it could jeopardize her family's chances of staying together here in the U.S\nSo I worry about this baby and many babies in similar situations who are starting their lives without all of the support that they could get if their families were not being place in the situation of fear and uncertainty and that's one child I saw last week but so many others over the last several months that I've seen in that same situation\nSo families individuals are looking at the trade off between access to medical care and a pause and possibly limiting their chances of getting permanent legal status\nRight right so they're being forced

S. for their groundbreaking work in laser research network has led to innovations in different fields including laser eye surgery\nDonna Strickland is also the first woman to win the physics prize in fifty five years the last woman to be honored with Maria ... in Ninety sixty three that's something Strickland was thinking about today\nIt's great times are changing I cited it gave me\nAnd I've read about in your life you know she didn't even get to be paid to be a scientist while she was doing research and I've always been treated like an equal things changed\nBut there's still a long way to go at least judging from what happened at CERN this week CERN is the European organization for nuclear research and it's just suspended an Italian scientist for what it called a highly offensive\nTalking about today it's great times are changing I cited\nAnd I've read about her and realize that you know she didn't even get to be paid to be a scientist while she was doing research and I've always been treated like an equal to show things changed\nBut there's still a long way to go at least judging from what happened at CERN this week\nCERN is the European organization for nuclear research and it's just suspended an Italian scientist for what it called a highly offensive presentation\nDuring CERN first ever workshop on gender and careers in particle physics professor ... said that physics was quote invented and built by men you showed charts and graphs that he said indicated that men were the victims of discrimination and physics and frequently got passed over for jobs\nDoctor just Wade is a physicist who was at the event and was shocked by what you heard the voice their concerns on social media but says she's received a lot of hate on line\nThat's an awful lot of people and not the audience and around the world you have a contract that is three years and then we'll go towards a selection committee that could have one of these kind of people and it could even have professed to see me on it\nAnd I don't want the biases that he holds against women apparently to have an impact on that grants and nice to pace and very frightened now after a night of the some trolls that that actually could have an impact on line\nWomen who are now studying physics can relate they're going into the field knowing that there'll be in the minority and not always welcome we spoke with three women today who are in the physics program at the University of Massachusetts You're in Boston we ask them what they thought of today's Nobel news\n... a Nineteen year old physics student originally from California she says she stands out when she attends talks and lectures\nWhen I Walk in I Will generally be the only undergrad which is\nAfter a night of based on trolls that that actually could have an impact on my\nWomen who are now studying physics can relate they're going into the field knowing that they'll be in the minority and not always welcome we spoke with three women today who are in the physics program at the University of Massachusetts You're in Boston we ask them what they thought of today's Nobel news\n... a Nineteen year old physics student originally from California she says she stands out when she attends talks and lectures\nWhen I Walk in I Will generally be the only undergrad which is scary and itself and often the only woman or one of like two or three\nAnother student we heard from Charlotte ... she's from Guyana in studying medical physics imaging she says that professor ... achievement today should be celebrated by women in her field\nBy pretty much a ... it will help us to become who wants to be in the fifth as well so that we don't need to wait for another fifty five years to win a Nobel Prize\nAnd I think that Saddam is above ... being a wife and their family and it might not see to me in my opinion I think\nIs ... my ... at least there will be the same field and do we help each other if they improve the level of ...\nThen there's ... to ... New York from Iran she's studying for a PHD in biophysics she agrees that this is a momentous day\nIt really matters yeah and you should really pay attention to the work that the the ... in it in a science so it's really matters that very ...\nAnd as do we enter my explained no matter what the challenges are for women studying physics is worth whatever obstacles they have to overcome\nI like working towards understanding the secrets of the universe and I also really love how weird I'd get especially when\nBoth ... then there's ... to ... New York from Iran she's studying for a PHD in biophysics she agrees that this is a momentous day\nIt really matters yeah you should really pay attention to the work that the the men do in it in the science so it really matters that Hillary Clinton I step\nAnd as do with ... explain no matter what the challenges are for women studying physics is worth whatever obstacles they have to overcome\nI like working towards understanding the secrets of the universe and I also really love how weird it gets especially when you get really big an especially really small with quantum on you get some things that you your intuition just completely breaks down\nUm and I find like puzzling through that through the language of math\nI'm just very exciting and she just it's so beautiful because it tells you about the universe is everything that ... on it is about fitness\nYeah everything that happens on earth is about physics congratulations to Donna Strickland and her fellow winters on their Nobel Prize today [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "02"}
