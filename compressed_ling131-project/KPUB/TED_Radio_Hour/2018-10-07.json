alcohol by volume Elijah crack promotes responsible drinking and from the any each case the foundation\nIt's that Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy rise in our show today ideas about who we are what makes us us\nAnd we've been talking about chemists Sam Steinberg who's been explaining how a new gene editing technology called CRISPR cast nine could make it cheap and easy to create humans who are you're basically talking like super heroes right like perfect vision superhuman strength perfect SAT scores\nRight those are the you know the I think that's that's the science fictional vision of what\nCRISPR could allow [noise]\nWe have long lists of gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person [noise] but we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable like having extra strong bones or leaner muscles\nOr lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of Cornell heart disease\nAnd as those lists continue to grow we now have a technology that could in theory\nYou allow an individual to upgrade their genome\nBut why would that be the science fiction version if it seems like the the technologies are promising like if there was a way to make a child more resilient to painter or give us a hierarchy is you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably there's a great example in the world of HIV\nWill to upgrade their genome\nBut why would that be the ... version if it seems like that that technology is a promising like if there was a way to make a child more resilient a painter or give us a hierarchy is you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably\nThere's a great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent of all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have\nEssentially masks theirselves and HIV virus can't get inside\nSo what a friend you know delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child even though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity\nWe might assume of course they would want that but it's still\nA game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just selected traits still inherit from the parents something we can already do with ... and genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would never have gotten from their parents\nIt's it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhancement or that disease prevention is you know many people see they divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of two different categories one being disease prevention\nAnd genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would\nNever have gotten from their parents it's it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhanced men or that disease prevention is you know many people see they divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of\nTwo different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think there are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity genes use your five\nThat's disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage and I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning\nBut I mean I mean a part of me wonders\nSweeping during that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of has sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up and being that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel [laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt\nSo I think this comes down to the question of of how sacred is the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone\nOf course what we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient but when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years now we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual but\nThat individuals children and their chili\n[laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt\nSo I think this comes down to the question of how sacred is the genome and is it something that should remain untouched tainted left alone\nOf course what we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient but when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years now we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual\nBut that individuals children and their children and their children and their children and so that's where I think\nYou have this very rainy issue of directing future evolution you know\nEven saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to the point where you could use him embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with higher I.
