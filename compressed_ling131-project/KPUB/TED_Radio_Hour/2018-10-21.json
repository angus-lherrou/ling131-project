ideas about food or connection to it and its power to change so much\nThe way we live I just bought a bottle of water and on the label it said gluten free interest [laughter] well and it is [laughter] versus food writer Mark Bittman Jerusalem advertising and marketing and describing how over the past fifty years corn and soy\n... says food writer Mark Bittman truth in advertising and extend describing how over the past fifty years corn and soy and wheat had become staples of the western diet\nOne thing led to another corn and wheat and soy were easy to trade and easy to ship and easy to sell an easy to process\nAnd the government through direct and indirect subsidies encouraged the growth of what we now call Monica cropping which means really really big fields or hundreds and hundreds of acres at a time\nPlanted in one crop an endless rows that are all\nCultivated an harvested mechanically um but if you look in the late nineteenth early twentieth century of it what was being grown in Iowa\nIowa was I think the country's biggest their second biggest producer of tomatoes that was a huge producer of apples I mean this is a place where almost anything can be grown and now I Know it was just in Iowa and again you can't believe that drive drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and it's nothing else but corn and soybeans\nOnce you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah so now you know the principal uses of those two crops are animal feed\nBiofuels ethanol and then corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nSo we got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contains as many Sawyer corn products as could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the tubes there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups\nBecause all of them can be bought and any store not that they are any good but they were there most bombs cook like mine a piece of royal made a quickly made salad with bottled dressing camps\nGood but they were there most bombs cook like mine a piece of royal meet a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad maybe baked or mashed potatoes or perhaps the stupidest food ever minute rice for dessert\nStore bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so I can say this now\nThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself and it wasn't all bad\nBy the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either\nSome of us reading on good restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial\nSadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma if not actually killed by the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat\nAnd spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the blend things that people were serving at home at the same time masses of women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden\nSo now you got your pizza night so you got your microwave nights you got your grazing nights you got your fend for yourself nights and so on [noise]\nLeading the way what's leading the way me junk food cheese the various stuff that will kill you\n\nGet ... and ... like what you were saying earlier are a lot of that has to do with with the fact that like today we ship food all over the world right [noise] you know I think part of the problem\nIs you know this could go back to cooking because one of the problems with the way that we think about food right now is that we\nYou know I think part of the problem is that this could go back to cooking because one of the problems with the way that we think about food right now is that we expect to have any food we want within minutes\nIf you want a mango you're gonna be able to get a mango if you want it tomato you're going to be able to get a tomato well that is really not sustainable so if we start thinking more seasonally if we start cooking at home more with ingredients that are\nUm I think appropriate might be the right word I'm and I'm Talking about more root vegetables in winter beats and turnips and potatoes and so on were really eating much more in tune with what nature is offering us and what nature is offering us is abundant it's just not everything\nSo I mean you are an omnivore you need to everything that you you are a guy that a lot of people can look to and say okay well you you've written all these books you are a food to eat like I think of ... Batman and food and so we want to know what we should kind of eat well\nI Do think you know I did this book called the ... going before six or\nA few years ago and um basically it's a strategy the more plants by saying let's be very strictly vegan until dinner time and then do whatever but I you know I think that the rules are very very simple I think the rules are one defining what food is often it's things that don't have\nLabels and you know of the head of broccoli doesn't need a label because at our broccoli we know what's in broccoli\nUm defined what food is eat only that and then within that category eat as many plants as you can as you can eat\nThat's it yeah\nWithin those rules you eat what you like to eat and you're going to have a good diet\n[noise]\nOverconsumption of animals and of course junk food is the problem\nGoing to have a good diet\nOverconsumption of animals and of course junk food is the problem along with our poultry consumption of plants now there is no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that plants and I want to make this clear and it's not the ingredients implants it's the plants it's not the beta carotene it's the carrots\nThe evidence is very clear that plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming at this point you eat more plants you eat less other stuff you live longer not bad\nBut back to animals and junk food we don't need either of them for health both have been marketed heavily creating unnatural demands were not born craving whoppers or Skittles\nWe have to take matters into our own hands not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone that's the hard part but by improving our own and that happens to be quite easy the simple formula eat food eat real food\nWe can continue to enjoy our food and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals were reduced not only calories but our carbon footprint we can make food more important not less and save ourselves by doing so\nWe have to choose that path thank you [noise]\n\nFood writer Mark Bittman you can see his entire talk at ... dot com\nI'm willing to you have to leave marks thank you thank you for doing this and I I'd say the one one of the things I really miss being paleo now for the next [laughter] who knows how long\nIs a great recipe that you put out years ago was that pasta and spaghetti or deans bread crumbs ... about the great use of sardines great how can you not eat pasta ... you can get sleep\nBread crumbs right I don't care about the great use of sardines great how can you not eat pasta why the hell you can get sweet potato pasta which is which is paleo from a housing prices gonna kill ya\nOkay some argument saying that like forty percent of stuff in grocery stores isn't real food but but if you had to estimate what what percentage of the stuff in grocery stores has added sugar\nI don't have to estimate at Seventy four percent I Seventy four percent of all of the food in the store\nHas been spiked with added sugar in some fashion [noise] is it [noise] hidden in plain sight Oh absolutely\nThis is Dr Robert ... he's a pediatrician and a researcher at the

what you're tasting the fruit you the ... the to the smoky are actually being dictated by nostrils Rob raised in his wonderful job of ... and\nThe information I get from my nose and making me believe as if it's coming from I ... this is Charles Spence a head of the cross middle research laboratory at Oxford University [noise] what is the cross motor research laboratory [noise]\nUm ... having the

chips out each time they put it into a potato chip we would change the sound they could sometimes making their own crunching ... [noise]\nSometimes crotch I sometimes boosting just certain frequency [noise]\nRebel show that as soon as you change the sound it changed the Christmas the crunches the freshness or these other attributes that\nCharles says how our food sounds even looks can change how it tastes\nOne might ... a a white wine artificially retro within ... tasteless food dye\nAddict and appropriate you'll find the experts the wind make says we'll get fooled into spelling leaving tasting what they think because of red wine [laughter] all the ... the tobacco and the dog chocolates and the stone fruits and so on even though they're actually tasting um it is to watch\nAll of this Charles has the\nThe tobacco and the dark chocolates in the state and fruits and so on even though they're actually tasting um it is to watch\nAll of this Charles says feeds into a larger idea\nThat how we experience our food is more than just about the ingredients here's Charles Spence on the stage\nOr here this morning to I'll tell you about the perfect meal\nRural convinced we can taste the food we enjoyed the flavors ... of the wind in the last\nReflect what's going on is created by the atmosphere in which we eat and drink out of the question is how to study of how to measure it and the tendency among the scientists that the New York gets thrown its its just think people like your eye and a brain scanner give them something to eat something to drink see which parts of the brain light up this is that it's going to your brain on flavor or New York astronomy\nIs one problem here which is in fact I mean the mattress off one of the brain scan is lying on your back where they had climbed stale with a Cuban your marriage that periodically ... sin ah some drink you call it can be full of your head all kind of a jolt and that will spoil that the brain scan alignment\nBut it's kind of tells you something to do something useful but it doesn't tell you about the perfect meal because no one has had that perfect meal and one of those situations [noise]\n\nWhat exactly defines a perfect meal\nI was actually a different for each and every one of us I mean it can be with something very very simple it can be a fish and chips by the seaside or it could be on your summer holidays by the beach somewhere\nThese often will stay in people's minds as as best meals but ... would I guess has to be there is um [noise] the mood you're in on the people you're with so because of social aspects of dining\nUh I Know one of the perfect meal when the fighting with up hot in the say\nPart of the thing about these kind of holiday meals that seemed to stick with doesn't resonate in then you can never quite capture when you get back home is as your moods you pretty relaxed you on hold\nKind of holiday meals that seemed to stick with doesn't resonate in the end you can never quite capture when you get back home is as your moods you pretty relaxed your holiday less stressed with their family and all these things come together to help enhance the experience and make it something sort of truly memorable\nYou think about like um how many times have you met her friend is just come back from a holiday and they say oh you've got to try this amazing red wine that I tried in Greece and then you try it and you were sort of thinking\nThat phenomenon has a name that we've all learned versions of its um I was in the province all rose a paradox ... used to describe a northern Europeans um but to Italy who gave for that so holidays to the Mediterranean\nOr not sitting somewhere or on the side of the sea sipping that arose they wind blew looking into that love his eyes [noise]\n... you can hear the sounds of the sea smells associates all out and not taste like the best glass of wine you've ever had\nSo great that you want to buy a Baltimore case and bring it back to share with your friends and show a good taste you have in that you bring it back\nAnd then you're disappointed\nAnd your friends are like this is really cheap ... yeah I can say well how is it something about when the bottles when they're playing with a cold and I you know sport the wind things not about a tool we never eat or drink no we're always somewhere in a certain environments and certain state of mind\nOn all mental state and the environment both together kind of impacts what we think we're tasting and how much we enjoy its missile in a way some\nMyths attributes I suppose some of the pleasure of the situation\nAnd put some of that pleasure into what we think about the food\n[noise] in fact is Charles these ideas about how we experience food have actually convinced some chefs to try out certain methods of flavor enhancement and you know methods that have nothing to do with the ingredients for in a good mood\nTo try out certain methods of flavor enhancement and these are methods that have nothing to do with the ingredients\nFor in a good mood food tastes good even a bad mood they never tastes good is this illusion about flavor we think we're tasting the wind the glass brain has brought me everything else the thousands of single the smell of assaulting see at the wall of the San ... all of that is play against the experience\nOn top chef capturing that inside in the dishes or\nAny of that too much than style restaurant in in Switzerland tuition and star restaurant\nA white table cloths\nWas no ... on the table was no glasses and I play nothing there's just a plastic car people wait and see what he calls me here seven o'clock hour here and everyone is here in the restaurant now I can see what will tables full nothing will happen\nUntil somebody picks up here is late ... plastic how\nI Wonder if they get up you know there is a little one euro tower and it makes it moving sound and sort of some of those type of it that will be laughing\nAnd then even guaranteed within a minute you'll have a whole restaurant full of moving fire was laughing Dina's ... is the moment when the first issue comes out because then he had successfully nothing more than one euro table in Homs the mood and he knows that will improve even the taste of a two Michelin star restaurant\n[noise] wow so like from from a neurological perspective\nDo we fully understand what's happening like why that's the case\n[noise] uh no so we didn't know that it does happen but it is the case it's all kind of a classic example of just how important the environment is what we taste I work with a young chef which is if you have here in London\nAnd he's been I'm sending our question I asked for several weeks have to ... his restaurant like say what'd you remember yeah and he said well ... flavor was the soup and people are convinced they can remember but in fact when you check was actually on the menu that kind of construction something they remember the experience but I felt about it\nAnd people are convinced they can remember in ... when you check was actually on the menu that kind of constructing something they don't have the experience that I felt about it and the brain kind of fills in the rest of the details I think they thought they reaching\nOur most chefs that you talked to are they on board with with your ideas do do they think yeah it is it is about the experience he's right or they or did they say and this is totally absurd it's all about the food and the taste the food\nUh of course there are still some chefs who say no no it is just what I was taught in color a school day is just the sourcing the preparation\nBut nothing else but he says their case so I'm In a restaurant or do you serve the food remarried plastic cutlery known as a silver isn't it and what is your restaurant exactly oh it's in the country manor house looking at it and they ... so the the saying all these things on the one hand but clearly\nYou can have as well so who just by itself it's always on something in a certain environment and there's going to contextual factors are always that it cannot be avoided [noise] so I certainly I think there are a growing number of the younger chefs who are now putting up starting\nTheir own venues who who are really thing for the first time in history saying we don't need to just about the ingredients and cooking preparation techniques we really need to know about the mind those that were swimming [noise] [noise]\nCharles Spence wrote
