radio hour I'm David Remnick\nWhen we first began learning of Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election which seemed absolutely mind boggling at the time something that just couldn't happen he was often said that Russia had hacked the election we quickly learn to more specific\nMore accurate way of putting it Russia had influence the election by manipulating political messages on Facebook and so on but they hadn't exactly gone into election computer systems an altered the results not exactly now if foreign agents could actually change the outcome of an election that would be

do that in my free time in August twenty sixteen at the height of the presidential election you started poking around Kennesaw State University's Center for election systems\nWhich ran all the elections in Georgia\nOr in the course of doing that I did a very very simple Google Search 'em I said for the ... elections stuck in a salt dot edu or Google please give me all of the PDF documents on this website\nAnd generally that turns up reports or public presentations\nAnd this this particular searched didn't\nTurn that up instead I found a very curious link and I was presented with a very long list of what appear to be a vote or names in some sort of a dinner fire next to their name and I immediately thought while that seems a little strange\nAnd then he crafted a simple program to download what was publicly accessible from the George election website and lay found in all of that data astonished him\nThese documents contain supervisor passwords\nUp instead I found it very

supervisor passwords should absolutely not be sitting around on line unprotected\nImmediately I thought to myself while this this doesn't look like sort of data they would purposefully\nPut on this Web server\nIn total lamb downloaded Fifteen gigabytes worth of data from the center for election systems this by itself will be a huge story but on top of that land also found security hole through which you could download the entire database of the state six point seven million registered voters I had access\nTo their full name their address birthday last four digits of their Social Security

Web server and used it as a beach head to get deeper into the center for election systems networks [noise]\nThis is right around the same time that the Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp rejected an offer from the department of homeland security to help the state harden the election system to protect it from hackers because Kemp said that the system was secure the way it was and that the state didn't want any help from the federal government\nIt wasn't until march of twenty Seventeen so seven months after lamb's initial finding that the system was finally patched\nThen more information started to trickle out the intercept published the NSA report that had been hacked\nAbout Russian cyber attacks election systems in the lead up to twenty Seventeen and later the more indictments found that the Russian hackers had looked for vulnerabilities to election servers in a number of states including Georgia [noise]\n\nWe have no idea if the Russians made alterations to Georgia's election

is a critical moment we know that foreign actors are interested in our election system just as we head into the midterms\nA few months ago the director of national intelligence that the warning lights are blinking red\nSome states took this seriously\nBut others seem to have left themselves wide open\nWe're in a new world now we need we understand the states need to run elections that their authority but they're not cybersecurity experts Susan green hall is the policy director of the national election defense coalition\nSo you know you and I met at DEF CON where people were hacking lots of election machines left and right\nUm so I Wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the problems in Georgia I'm with their machinery and perhaps even elsewhere since the same machines are used a cross country\nSure that the machines used in Georgia\nAre computerized touch screen voting machines\nGeorgia is one of five states that entirely has machine that don't have a paper ballot then there's also other machines which count paper about those are also computers and those machines can be hacked and have digital records changed within them and that's why\nHaving the paper ballot it's so crucial because it it's that linked to what the voter got to see and\nSince the same machines are used a cross country\nSure the machines used in Georgia\nAre computerized touch

that's how I voted and to be sure that that's what's counted correctly\nElection security folks are on the ground and people who are the vendors that these machines insists that they're not really ... because they're not connected to the Internet\nAnd I wonder if you just explain why it is that there's this discrepancy in in um the explanation for the safety of these machines\nWell many of the machines that you and I might interact with on election day at our polling location whether it's a touch screen voting machine or an optical scanner on may not be connected to the Internet\nIt has to get programming information from another machine which is essentially desktop or regular laptop computer that program here are the candidates here the races here is how the ballot should lay out that information has to go from that computer to the\nVoting machine that's in the polling location by some sort of removable media and it's well known that if the device that is doing the programming gets infected with malicious software it it can be transferred to the individual voting machines\nBut furthermore there's another factor that deep angst that assertion which is that in many of these machines that are in the polling look\nThat program here are the candidates here the races here is how the ballot should lay out that information has to go from that computer to the\nVoting machine that's in the polling location by some sort of removable media and it's well known that if the device that is doing programming gets infected with malicious software it it can be transferred to the individual voting machines\nBut furthermore there's another factor that debunked that assertion which is that in many of these machines that are in the polling location\nAre equipped with wireless modems to transmit their election results back to the county headquarters on election night and those wireless modems go over a cellular networks and those cellular networks are part of the Internet [noise]\n\n[noise] we spend a lot of time talking about hacking voting machines or hacking vote tallies but there's this new way of hacking an election and it has to do with the new restrictive voter ID laws in states like Ohio North Carolina and Georgia\nThat purge voters from the voting rolls who haven't voted in previous elections or whose names don't precisely match the name on the voter registration data base\n[noise]\nPersonally this has been a concern for me because uh on election day in twenty sixteen people were showing up to vote in Durham county North Carolina and um their names weren't on the voter rolls or they they endured county they use electronic pull books\nDon't precisely match the name on the voter registration data base\n[noise]\nPersonally this has been a
