I was a rebellious Christian\nNow you're also interested in musicals and musical theater and did you have access\nGot kicked out yeah I was ... I was a rebellious Christian [noise]\nNow you also interested in musicals and musical theater and did you have access to that or was it all through records and radio\nI didn't have access to musical theater and what else did you play as we get our Cinderella I can totally unrelated as we did a production or I went to a predominantly black a high school Latina a Latino and black high school and\nUm you've got all the lead singer I didn't actually funny where did you not get the lead the whiz I did not get the whiz I wanted to be Dorothy so\nYou're still mad about it [laughter]\nI'm I'm kind of deal but I understood it but it crushed me growing up it really crush me\nNow at what point did you think I can have a big life like something that's beyond being in high school musical something beyond being a maybe the best singer at your high school something larger than that\nI don't think I registered until I went to New York post high school I went to the American musical and dramatics academy\nAnd I started to learn more and I start to grow\nAnd when I realized that there was more potential that I hadn't tapped into there was an access potential that was there\nAnd that led me to leave I left school because I realized that I wanted to tell fresher story who we are heroes at that time Lauren Hill Lauren Hill was my biggest inspiration\nAnd I love Judy Garland yeah arguing Judy Garland were were my my my heroes those are pretty different performers why those two they were just women that I felt really use their voices you need to have a first of all unique tone\nUm and they just came across as strong I didn't know a whole lot about Judy Garland obviously I'm from\nThat first of all you need tone um and they just came across as strong I didn't know a whole lot about Judy Garland obviously I'm from Kansas and the wizard of Oz you know in her being in that\nUm I feel like she was a dreamer and she was a strong woman I Know she had a complex life\nBut Lauren Hill in particular I resonated with me as a black woman who did an album and made a career fully being herself she did not shy away from her religious belief she didn't shy away from 'em you know being a mom during a time where people say that she could not\nHave a child who were ruined her career um she she was an actress she was an actor she was a singer uh she was a producer she was a ... and that was how when the model my career\n... ... ... what's your song from an early album that's called violet stars happy hunting and this was from an album called metropolis betray sweet\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nYou know it is I haven't heard it in a long time now that sounds like something out of out of a musical is that what you said after right [noise]\nYes you know what will I wouldn't say a musical where I wanted to do was to figure out how I could sing songs\nHave concepts for them if I wanted to talk about science fiction which was a huge inspiration to me after I watched Fritz Lang Nineteen twenty seven German expressionist silent film when I watched that metropolis Oh yes it it it is\nAnd to me after I watched Fritz Lang Nineteen twenty seven German expressionist silent film\nWhen I watched that metropolis Oh yes it it it inspired all of my work really it was the birth of metropolis the money that\nBy the stars heavy hunting at that we just heard but what I wanted to do is figure out how to you take how can I take all of me on stage like am I Am theatrical I Love singing I Love ... love rock and roll 'em I Love you know dressing in his black and white tuxedo to pay homage to my family I Love\nDavid Bowie I just got into bully at that time I loved pink Floyd the ... the wall I Love a Isaac Asimov I Love science fiction how can I blend all these these ah these different elements and and innovate in in in the space of of of music\nYou had in those in those early days an alter ego Cindy may whether white it's not that you were hiding behind her but you were projecting this self which was um\nA a complicated thing which all that you are [laughter] um why use her as it were instead of being yourself and as you are now in in the in the latest um dirty computer\nWas saying that Cindy Mayweather represented represented aspirations for me that's who I strive to be more like I'm not so she is in the future and in the future she's more evolved and she doesn't have eagle all the things that\nMake me imperfect she's able to master those\n... so this is a ... a self critical expression by having an alter ego yes somewhere absolute what we're used to being self critical about in your in your younger self\nWell my younger self I just felt a misunderstood a lot of people will call me weird they relied right oh that's not commercial enough they didn't under they just did not understand how they were going to market or what it was it I was doing\nThey'd be like oh that's not commercial enough they didn't under they just did not understand how they were going to market or what it was that I was doing and just\nWhat do they want you to be [noise] I don't think it was about\nWanting me to be something I think it was really about not wanting to do the work in the development that it would take\nTo figure out how to bring something new to the industry it was like the quick thing would be well you know change your hair one change her outfits need is to actually be appealing\nAnd you said I'm I'm not exhausted 'cause I Know I\nGet to be invited back you're very very long time in a scribe that night with your members of the ... oh my goodness uh\nIt'd be invited back you're very very long time it is growing at night with your members over where\nOh my goodness of I just remember a lot of celebration but sadness under that celebration and just to think like man all the hard work that he had done and\nI was going to be unraveled in an undone and controls eat delete it um [laughter] I Do remember saying that to you and [noise]\nUm but what I Will say is I Want to focus on now and right now I'm working with an organization when we all vote to help get awareness out\nAfter studying the twenty twelve election and this past twenty sixteen election there was a seven percent decrease in the black vote imagine if we would have showed\nWhat could have happened\nYou know thank you so much ... thank you

Pennsylvania go narrowly for Donald Trump and twenty sixteen and the Philadelphia suburbs are one of those places that political consultants like to talk about is kind of a bellwether\nAlthough the larger county went for Hillary Clinton accent is heavily Republican about two thirds of its voters are Republicans and al ... is running as a Democrat for state assembly and she thinks she has a chance go rogue\nWere on a leafy suburb and straight their colonial houses which are made of brac inside and was final it's a middle class place how are you guys and Danielle is going door to door she's a suburban mom of two kids under the age of five\nShe works in marketing have you heard about running for office Daniel ... you do okay well I actually live right on Devon drive and I decided to run because for the last five years our neighborhood here have been dealing with us\nWe she's pointing to a long stretch of orange plastic fence saying that marks the beginning of the controversial pipeline which is supposed to be buried about forty\nWe she's pointing to a long stretch of orange plastic fencing that marks the beginning of the controversial pipeline which is supposed to be buried about forty feet behind all the houses on the street\nAnd fighting the pipeline for the last few years is what motivated Danielle to launch a novice his campaign for the Pennsylvania state house taking on her Republican opponent and the establishment in her own party\nUm there are one two three four five six rows of pipes\nIt's within\nFive fifty feet of my backyard like Seventy feet from my house and um we're standing right now ten feet from playground that my neighbors kids my kids play on\nYour greatest fears and now with the pipeline I mean if what how does it impact how to your fears about an impact your life um [noise]\nIt's horrible to think about a couple of weeks ago I'm a pipeline exploded in ... county in Pennsylvania and it was a snow cone pipeline that was only a week old\nAnd so\nI actually was I'm taking a nap in the afternoon shortly after that happened and I jumped out of my bed because I had this nightmare\nOf like my babies like burning in her bed and I'm I called them and I said John we have to move like you have to move we can't [noise] um\nAnd like thankfully in beaver county there are only thirty homes within a mile of that explosion and the closest family with five hundred feet away and the skates with their life but they're homeless destroyed um those things seem like national news to most people but to people like me that's like reality [noise]\nSo you know we're here trying to connect some of the dots between what's going on politically nationally\nAs well as on a state level I'm with and the pipeline\nBetween what's going on politically nationally\nAs well as on a state level I'm with and the pipeline how do you see the pipeline as relating to national politics\nJust an example of the egregious enough of what's happening at the on the national level and all of these regulatory role backs and how it really affects our daily life and how it can affect anyone anyone\nLet's put it that's why I never in my life never in my life I Would run for office never never ever occur to me it just wasn't something\nLike maybe I thought it would run for school\nBoard or something like something small local when my kids were older and I had a little more time on my hands but after all of the things we've experienced over the last few years and just the lack of humanity from are the people who represent us [noise] it's it's ... it it makes you feel powerless but I refuse to be powerless\nDaniels opponent and district one fifty five is Becky carbon a Republican has been in office is two thousand twelve I reach representative carbon for an interview and she sent the following statement I have a proven record of standing up to oil and gas companies to ensure the health and safety of our community\nThen she lifted her opposition to a number of bills which she said would have rolled back health protections standards for oil and gas wells and made it easier for public utilities to use eminent domain\n[noise] ... but here's the thing about Pennsylvania politics are both the Republican legislature and the Democratic\nTom Wolfe had signed off on the pipeline fracking is made Pennsylvania the third largest oil and gas producing state in America and and that's brought in a lot of different players including to know go and its parent company energy transfer partners which owns this\nAnd\nAnd that's brought in a lot of different players including ... and its parent company energy transfer partners which owns this pipeline project the Mariner east\nWhen we build a pipeline safety is our top priorities are highly skilled engineers environmental scientist wildlife biology and geology design on pipeline to follow the safest round with the smallest environmental footprint\nATP as a private corporation but they were able to use eminent domain to take people's land against their will in order to lay the pipeline the pipeline move natural gas liquids from the Marcellus gas fields in the west for three hundred and fifty miles to the east markets hawk outside Philly where it shipped overseas\nWe were following the root of the pipeline through Pennsylvania our second stop was a hundred miles west of action in the small town of blows or fail\nAt blooms gun shop we not Ralph and Doris blue\nNow the fact checkers at the New Yorker I don't want to brag but they have something of a reputation so when Ratcliffe want it to get a taste of what fact checking was really like it made sense for him to come by the office and try his hand at it here's Peter can be who runs the fact checking department\nSo they know wrecked cooked showed up at my office shortly after town on a Monday morning along with Michael showman who writes about theater for the New York\n[noise] [noise]\nOh well thank you very much [laughter] and he didn't look unlike under ...\nAnd I wondered whether that had something to do with his intense immersion in the play where he plays a fact checker in a mortal combat where the where the difficult writer\nBecause of because one of one of the\nPolicy to sort of the flaws in I'm In a little bit in like ... asking if I see a U.S know that it's easy differentiate between label one of our schools have things in the same job I have sort of gifts for white to everything everything\nMean the thing is people who don't are familiar with that checking mostly think things are either factor opinion or we check the facts and we leave and then fill out but to us the\nBigger the biggest thing that we work on is what I refer to as fact based opinion in other words like you have to know the underlying facts in order to correct they constructed argument I'm\nNot really a science more of an art is kind of a ... you may there are kind of having such judgments that\nNot really a science more kind of an art it's kind of a cannon to editing you may there are kind of comments that's called judgments that you make and of course that's a sort of squishy ground to make common such judgments but you know we are journalists so\nUm when we shouldn't show you how to do it because I mean for you to work on and I'm like gosh I Believe you have a phone call scheduled at a chef of a Mexican restaurant long [laughter] [laughter] yeah the ... strain and\nSo we're I mean the plan and the plan was damn Daniel bread cliff jak of short restaurant reviewer tables for two and written by hand a gold field herself a former checks and\nShe was very pleased to hear you can check your face [laughter] way he'll see gas yeah Ken's\nEconomy and it's a short of view of a restaurant the Mexican restaurant called ... when we started a new checker we sit them down with a manuscript and have the underlying it for what they think is ... fact and what's not\nWould it be right to underline to details from like the the ingredients from the males\nYeah yeah stuff with old saying what does all held by seasonings seafood seasoning on so then she wants you to track that and that's the kind of thing you could both do off the website and then check was chef yeah Austin for your call is set up with an eleven\nYear while I'm going to say that Ron I collect she lay\nBack what she lived never heard of that dissimilar to beaches soup ...\nAnd you you also when when there's kind of like a negative judgment in there you with us back off and maybe enthusiasts\nLike lava China yeah well ... yeah well we want to be telling you that\nIt was so ... it's a Green Party restaurant where the Venice Beach aesthetic the problem with that is that that's a little if he says no it doesn't have a Venice Beach for something\nSo it's ... it's a Green Party restaurant where the Venice Beach aesthetic the problem with that is just absolutely if he says no it doesn't have a vendor speak idea for some reason he's offended by that formulation it's a it's her judgment so maybe you could just say like California beaches static um\nAfter you're done with this whole set of a job interview or to switch careers\nLike they have a much easier job right out there is pressure\nAfter I saw the ... I've had a good from quick grasp on what was ... was not I walked around the corner to have them work with Parker Henry another ... one of my deputy loosen\nOur time I talked to said look I'm when\nI'm you know the\nSmash so Parker and Daniel went to the Oxford multiple website where they looked at my news prices and photos of the restaurant\nYeah right on yeah yeah and you\nKnow I'm I was ... when I Lived in California for everyone it's called were seen as I Know [laughter]\nSo just because Parker and Daniel ... has the Venice Beach five doesn't mean that that's the way the chef smoker wouldn't describe it yeah\nI Know it's a fantasy so I don't know how are you\n[laughter] you can frame\nIt like you have no idea that it actually have access\nTo them um yeah playing down his key in on any city\nThat potentially offensive or get them um yeah playing down his key in on entity\nTo actually that [laughter] I'm okay how are eleven o'clock Paul is fast approaching okay I mean we did on speaker phone in the library on my cell phone\n[noise]\n\n[noise] Hi Justin I'm Down to a New Yorker I'm Wondering if you had a few minutes to an ... system some questions about there's a review of of your restaurant and I'm just trying to fact check it and make sure everything's accurate yeah of\nCourse so first off you'll surname is spelled a B.
