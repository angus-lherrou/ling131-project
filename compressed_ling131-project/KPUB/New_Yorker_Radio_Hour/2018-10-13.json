[noise]\n[noise] someone will Trade Center in Manhattan\nSomeone in Manhattan or certainly alas covert action in the New Yorker and WNYC studio ...\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick\nWhen we first began learning of Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election which seemed absolutely mind boggling at the time something that just couldn't happen he was often said that Russia had hacked the election we quickly learn to more specific\nMore accurate way of putting it Russia had influence the election by manipulating political messages on Facebook and so on but they hadn't exactly gone into election computer systems an altered the results not exactly now if foreign agents could actually change the outcome of an election that would be and you can say this lightly\nAn existential threat to American democracy but what we've learned since twenty sixteen is\nIf somebody really did want to ... election it wouldn't be impossible not at all to help and has been writing for the New Yorker about election security and what she's found should scare us all Logan lamb is a security researcher\nIn Georgia I'm generally a curious guy I enjoy the poking around part I like to do that in my free time\nIn August twenty sixteen at the height of the presidential election you started poking around Kennesaw State University's Center for election systems which ran all the elections in Georgia\nOr in the course of doing that\nI did a very very simple Google Search 'em I said for the ... election dot canon assault dot edu or Google please give me all of the PDF documents on this website and generally that turns up reports or public presentations\nAnd this this particular\nDocuments on this website and generally that turns up reports or public presentations and this this particular searched didn't turn that off but instead I found\nA very curious link and I was presented with a very long list of what appear to be a vote or names in some sort of a dinner fire next to their name and I immediately thought wow that's that seems a little\nStrange and then he crafted a simple program to download what was publicly accessible from the George election website and what he found in all of that data astonished him\nThese documents contain supervisor passwords to be used\nOn election day there were also windows programs that are placed on electronic pull books\nYou don't need to be a cybersecurity expert to know that supervisor passwords should absolutely not be sitting around on line unprotected\nImmediately I thought to myself while this this doesn't look like the sort of data they would purposefully put on this Web server\nIn total lamb downloaded Fifteen gigabytes worth of data from the center for election systems this by itself will be a huge story but on top of that limb also found security hole through which you can download the entire database of the state six point seven million registered voters\nI had access to their full name their address birthday last four\nDigits of their Social Security number and their driver's license number and then there were also gyms databases and the gyms databases are used by the um gym server which is the central tabulate er which does the final vote count\nIf Logan lamb had been a bad guy this would have been a bonanza\nHave you later which does the final vote count\nIf Logan lamb had been a bad guy this would have been a boon to answer\nThe scariest scenario I can think of would be an attacker implanting malware on the programs that are placed on the electronic poll books were altering the voter registration databases to disenfranchise voters\nAn attacker could have compromise the Web server and used it as a beach head to get deeper into the center for election systems networks [noise]\nThis is right around the same time that the Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp rejected an offer from the department of homeland security to help the state harden the election system to protect us from hackers because Kemp said that the system was secure the way it was and that the state didn't want any help from the federal government\n\nIt wasn't until march of twenty Seventeen so seven months after lamb's initial finding that the system was finally patched then more information started to trickle out\nThe intercept published the NSA report that had been hacked about Russian cyber attacks election systems in the lead up to twenty Seventeen and later the more indictments found that the Russian hackers had looked for vulnerabilities to elections servers in a number of states including Georgia [noise]\n\nWe have no idea if the Russians made alterations to Georgia's election systems and twenty sixteen and if they did we probably wouldn't know but this is a critical moment we know that foreign actors are interested in our election system just as we head into the midterms\nA few months ago the director of national intelligence set the warning lights are blinking red some states took this seriously but others seem to have left themselves wider\nDirector of national intelligence that the warning lights are blinking red some states took this seriously but others seem to have left themselves wide open\nWe're in a new world now we need we understand the states need to run elections that their authority but they're not cybersecurity experts Susan green hall is the policy director of the national\nElection defense coalition so you know you and I met at DEF CON where people were hacking lots of election machines left and right\nUm so I Wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the problems in Georgia I'm with their machinery and perhaps even elsewhere since the same machines are used a cross country\nSure that the machines used in Georgia are computerized touch screen voting machines Georgia is one of five states that entirely had machine that don't have a paper ballot\nThen there's also other machines which kept paper ballots those are also computers and those machines can be hacked and have digital records changed within them and that's why\nHaving the paper ballot it's so crucial because it it's that linked to what the voter got to see and say that's how I voted and to be sure that that's what's counted correctly\nElection security folks are on the ground and people who are the vendors that these machines insists that they're not really ... because they're not connected to the Internet\nAnd I wonder if you just explain why it is that there's this discrepancy in in um the explanation for the safety of these machines\nWhile many of the machines that you and I might interact with on election day at our polling location whether it's a touch screen voting machine or an optical scanner on may not be connected to the Internet it has to get ...\nLocation whether it's a touch screen voting machine or an optical scanner on may not be connected to the Internet\nIt has to get programming information from another machine which is essentially desktop or regular laptop computer that program here are the candidates here the races here is how the ballot should lay out that information has to go from that computer to the\nVoting machine that's in the polling location by some sort of removable media and it's well known that if the device that is doing the programming gets infected with malicious software it it can be transferred to the individual voting machines\nBut furthermore there's another factor that debunked that assertion which is that in many of these machines that are in the polling location\nAre equipped with wireless modems to transmit their election results back to the county headquarters on election night and those wireless modems go over a cellular networks and those cellular networks are part of the Internet [noise]\n\n[noise] we spend a lot of time talking about hacking voting machines or hacking vote tallies but there's this new way of hacking an election and it has to do with the new restrictive voter ID laws in states like Ohio North Carolina and Georgia\nThat purge voters from the voting rolls who haven't voted in previous elections whose names don't precisely match the name on the voter registration data base\n[noise]\nThis has been a concern for me because uh on election day in twenty sixteen people were showing up to vote in Durham county North Carolina and um their names weren't on the\nElection day in twenty sixteen people were showing up to vote in Durham county North Carolina and um their names weren't on the voter rolls or they they endured county they use electronic pull books\nAnd people were showing up and they were being told you're at the wrong polling location or you've already voted during early voting or you already voted absentee or your name is in here or your address has been changed the vendor\nA loan them see\nMm gonna miss the snow [noise]\nI'm going to miss the B ... the things that\nI'm going to miss the the um the things that go I'm going I'm tri\n... gonna miss the sun\nUm miss the animals and I miss you ever want another way\nAnother way\nI Need to know the play\n\nWill that peas and he knows where this one seems nearly\n... I'm going to miss the\n\nSinging all this ... um well ... been kissing me so ... ... another\nAnother well\nAnother way\n\n\nThat's the beauty of beauty isn't it ... do you ever ... you say you were texting with a known about the songs that did you how much do tease out what the song is about\nOh I didn't really know why I didn't need to I mean\nChecks thing with a known about the songs that they do how much do you tease out what the song is about\nOh I didn't try I didn't need to I mean for me it for me it's mostly about climate change you know\nBut you've you've been through a certain number of political moments [laughter]\nSixties and in many moments in between ... and just how does this seem\nSimilar a different [noise] um it's just I couldn't have dreamed us up\nAll the stuff I've been through and all the countries and all the dictatorships and the you know I'm In do all that if somebody has had said can you write a story about how bad can it get I couldn't have written it nor could anybody I Know\nThat it's just you know what we are facing in the administration is evil\nAnd it's it's cruel it's there's no empathy zero embassy so um it leaves you leave me thinking how am I going to conduct my life\nIt's ... you know it's the year the bully and um to bully people now seems to be okay the lying ... no problem no perjury yeah not a problem\nUm and that that is a new normal and how has it\nChanged the texture of your life day to day waking up in the morning as yeah proceed through the day\nWell I think I mean I've heard other people say this to law oftentimes hits in the night in the form of this terrible anxiety and you realize\nThat it's real I mean it's not some neurotic anxiety [laughter] I'm anxious about the state of the world which is terrible and so one thing is to one of my things I suggest spend a lot of time in denial\nThat it will be granted valley yeah and um don't expect much I mean keep the bar really ...\nI suggest spend a lot of time in denial benefited great advice yeah and um don't expect much I mean keep the bar really low yeah keep laughing\nYou know I I was just watching a documentary you forget which one it was because the scene appears\nIn so many documentaries of using it the march on Washington and I I I just wonder how you\nVisualize in your mind moments like that in your life which are now distant and their iconic in the minds of other people but you were you're there you're holding the guitar you are in a microphone and it's kind of lousy sound system and seen it was a half million people or whatever it was [noise]\nDo you think about these moments in your past and\nYou know I think as I get older sometimes I Do or somebody to show me a photograph\nI think oh my God I was there and those people were there and Dr King said what he said um and sometimes going into a quote historic moment you know it and other times you don't know it um in that case I think by midway through the morning you know we all knew it yeah yeah\nYou you mean there's some there's some times that you were in the middle of an event that turns out to be iconic and you have no idea\nI think festival a political moment\nYeah I'm I was just thinking about Woodstock and it was a little bit of both because I took the last ... and looking down and seeing these people are like aunt you know they're just gobs of people\nAnd so I had a hand them over to this is going to be something very big but it was after the fact that you realize oh my goodness that's made a dent in people's lives forever and in yours and mine yeah\n... you know this next song that you're going to do I I went to um Charleston not just days after the shooting to write about these families and these these ... relatives with people who ...\nTo um Charleston not just days after the shooting to write about these families and these\nThese ... relatives with people who lost people in the church there in this in this slaughter\nAnd it it was extraordinary and then the funeral that followed um that President Obama a win too it seems like a million years ago it does the idea of a president I'm capable of showing empathy just such a degree that\nNot only is the crowd with him and feel they feel like allies\nBut he's able to sing the song and begin the song yeah that lift people up as opposed to issue a tweet that depresses hello [laughter] um yeah how do you remember that that terrible incident and why did you decide to I'm covered the so\nWell covering this song was a no brainer I mean it was whatever feelings I had them or in the future that song just dropped out of the sky threatened by the way Milford I did not know and most people\nDidn't know and I need to tune that didn't get to I\nMean if I was quicker and tune out in that guitar and you're killing on knocking ear hearing it loudly\nAnd just go ahead yeah okay Mm\nMm Mm Mm\nMm Mm Mm\nYoung men came to our house of\nMan they didn't\nKnow anyone brought him he was not friend he was not keen\nOh they did not ask what brought him and he was\nNot friend he was not keen but they open the door\nAnd they let him me\nAnd for an hour the strangers sees that he's set with them many seem to print but then a young man to God and killed nine\nThe ... ...\n... ... ...\nIn Charleston in the month of June Mm mourners gathered\nIn ... the president came to speak some

yeah the last line is my president which is this just switch yeah for that President and vice president he says is the only president you felt of his in that way but\nThey checked\nEach night after a long track you recall Eli give them his medical condition and his coordinates if he was ever in trouble he could call for what he referred to as the most expensive taxi ride in the world which will be a rescue plane to pull him out\nAnd\nHe also called a friend in London so he could record an audio diary of its day which could then be posted on his website and it updated listeners about what he was going through what he was eating what he was feeling\nEverybody showing off the way\nIt was like a gracious hostess [noise]\n\nHe was incredibly good looking\nHenry met his wife Joanne at a party in London in Nineteen eighty nine\nMost of my friends friends they are wild and we also that someone in special forces was very very glamorous\nLike contentious paper\nI think it's great talking to people who are adventure as\nHe had recently completed his selection course for the special ear service or SAS\nTo people who are adventure as he had recently completed his selection course for the special ear service or SAS a legendary elite commando unit\nIn many ways he enjoying a we're opposites uh she hates the cold or she could think of any more dreadful place in the world than Antarctica\nYet for all their differences they shared a similar sensibility\nReally was a tree romantic he loved parent Trey\nHe loved a T\nHe did tapestry\nHe stitched the most wonderful\nTastes legit skating across the snow\nHe loves the history of all these old explorers and\nHe glamour eyes that allied said his head\nAnd face a fit over for\nNo\n\nHenry worshipped Ernest Shackleton who in many ways it was a failure as and explore on his first expedition that he commanded some self\nHe set out to reach the south pole with three other men\nThey got within Ninety seven miles nautical miles to the poll but he feared that if he kept going his men who were already fading would not make it back\nAnd forth for my\nJob\nAnd so I made a decision that always astonished hadn't even worse Lee\nHe decided to turn to\nThe vet\nOn his other ... most famous expedition a Shackleton had wanted to walk across Antarctica he thought it was the last great price to be achieved but before even reached Antarctica his ship the difference that frozen in the eyes\nHe thought it was the last great price to be achieved but before even reached Antarctica his ship or the difference that frozen in the eyes and Shackleton found him in all his men more room on an ice flow more than a hundred miles from the closest I've been with any contact with civilization\nWhat made it so amazing was he was able to guide all the men in his immediate party\nAnd get them back all home alive\nI Know that they have a very for us I I Believe um [noise]\nWell yes I was very interesting Charles golf so your story ... ... they are is a very very devoted expeditions\nHe began to burn with this very peculiar ambition would very few share which was the kind of suffer these misery and become a polar explorer and the model that he lived by with a Shackleton family motto which was by endurance we conquer\nI should have had warning bells when he came back from a trip to says ... just stuff Dr ... and was incredibly excited because he had managed to sleep beside Shackleton grave\nIt wasn't until\nWhen he was about four to ... that he does it really talking about ... photo and Shackleton footsteps\nBy the time or Henry was talking about doing his first expedition he had two children max and Alicia initially when he decided he wanted to do something that you know how many people say suddenly wait a second I Want to go walk to the south pole or you know his kids\nThat you know how many people say suddenly wait a second I Want to go walk to the south pole or you know his kids were a little bit will dirt but a joy and it was very supportive\nOf us well huge believe as in trying to fulfill dreams and most of the time my rich still excused from fulfilling you're an individual dreams\nBecause you've feel you have to get permission from the other person and\nI felt that through my twenties I had fulfilled a lot of my dreams that had a lot of fun and he went in the army when he was Eighteen and I felt that it was his town rarely\nSo for his third trip he wanted to walk across Antarctica to fulfill the goal that his hero shocked and was not able to achieve but he wanted to do it alone\n[noise] excess of faded there was a way\nFor the time off at seven thirty in the trial or not I am\nEach day with similar I mean Henry would get up early in the morning hike up his lead that usually took about an hour the hardest will be connected to this is what I and you begin to haul it done in like a mule\nFluffy skiing for Ninety minutes taking a five minute break\nAnd he would walk with his skis burning as much as eight thousand calories than a day\nOr every craving to fish five hundred still very striking ships small chips like trying to protect X Y story\nHe would do this particular lean on task and challenge day after day there was something almost primal about a\nCold War\nSingular purpose became to just make his mom\nChallenge day after day there was something almost primal about it or just call ways\nHis singular purpose became to just make his mileage he had to achieve so many miles a day if he was the ultimately accomplished his goal\nNine blind coal ... because I was leaving everybody does in some say\nThe nine ... hard won by Carl does that long ago 'cause I just I have a ... a good\nThing or they may Twenty one and point ... was a disappointment but it's only you know from all this is all I can do the engine of twelve hours a day\nHe would track for fourteen Fifteen sometimes sixteen hours across an alien landscape is covered with a sheet of
