than that\nI don't think I registered until I went to New York post high school I went to the American musical and dramatics academy\nAnd I started to learn more and I started to grow\nAnd when I realized that there was more potential that I hadn't tapped into there was an access\nPotential that was there and that led me to leave I left school because I realized that I wanted to tell fresher stories where we are heroes at that time Lauren Hill Lauren Hill was my biggest inspiration\nAnd I love Judy Garland yeah already on Judy Garland were were my my my heroes those are pretty different

often said to be a referendum on the presidency and that's never been more true than this year in the era of Donald Trump at the same time no matter where you live there are also other issues on your mind as a voter local stuff\nThat is maybe nothing to do with whether you watch Fox or CNN or even how you feel about Donald Trump\nReporter a loss of Griswold has been spending a lot of time following races in the state of Pennsylvania and what she found is that for voters across a wide swath of the state the thing that's foremost on people's minds\nIt was in the state of Pennsylvania and what she found is that for voters across a wide swath of the state the thing that's foremost on people's minds is a gas pipeline it's already under construction and it goes through a lot of people's backyards\nAnd they're really unhappy about it one of the communities allies who visited was exton Pennsylvania in the suburbs of Philadelphia [noise]\nAccent is a place where two tectonic plates in American politics meat we saw Pennsylvania go narrowly for Donald Trump and twenty sixteen and the Philadelphia suburbs are one of those places that political consultants like to talk about is kind of a bellwether\nAlthough the larger county went for Hillary Clinton accent is heavily Republican about two thirds of its voters are Republicans and yell for al ... is running as a Democrat for state assembly and she thinks she has a chance go rogue\nWere on a leafy suburban street they're colonial houses which are made of brac inside and was final it's a middle class place how are you guys and Danielle is going door to door she's a suburban mom of two kids under the age of five and she works in marketing\nHave you heard about running for office to now excused orange now you do okay well I actually live right on Devon drive and I decided to run because for the last five years our neighbors here have been dealing with us\nWe she's pointing to a long stretch of orange plastic fencing that marks the beginning of a controversial pipeline which is supposed to be buried about forty feet behind all the houses on the street\nAnd fighting the pipeline for the last few years is what motivated Danielle to launch a novice his campaign for the Pennsylvania state house taking on her Republican opponent and the establishment in her own party\nUm there are one two three four five six rows of pipes\nIt's within\nFive fifty feet in my backyard like\nOne two three four five six rows of pipes\nIt's within\nFive fifty feet of my backyard like Seventy feet from my house and um we're standing right now ten feet from playground that my neighbors kids my kids play on\nYour greatest fear is Danielle with the pipeline I mean if what how does it impact how do your fears about an impact your life um [noise] it's horrible to\nThink about a couple of weeks ago I'm a pipeline exploded in India for county in Pennsylvania and it was a smoker pipeline that was only a week old and so I actually was I'm taking a nap in the afternoon shortly after that happened and I jumped out of my bed because I had this nightmare\nOf like my babies like burning in her bed and I'm I called them and I said we have to move like you have to move we can't [noise] um\nAnd like thankfully in beaver county there were only thirty homes within a mile of that explosion and the closest family with five hundred feet away and the skates with their life but they're homeless destroyed um those things seem like national news to most people but to people like me that's like reality [noise]\nSo you know we're here trying to connect some of the dots between what's going on politically nationally\nAs well as on a state level I'm with and the pipeline how do you see the pipeline as relating to national politics\nJust an example of the egregious ness of what's happening at the on the national level and all of these regulatory role backs and how it really affects our daily life and how it can affect anyone anyone let's put it this way\nAnd how it really affects our daily life and how it can affect anyone anyone\nLet's put it that's why I never in my life never in my life I Would run for office never never ever occur to me it just wasn't something\nLike maybe I thought it would run for school\nBoard or something like something small local when my kids were older and I had a little more time on my hands but after all of the things we've experienced over the last few years and just the lack of humanity from are the people who represent us [noise] it's it's ... it it makes you feel powerless but I refuse to be powerless\nDaniels opponent and district one fifty five is Becky carbon a Republican has been in office is two thousand twelve I reach representative carbon for an interview and she sent the following statement I Am a proven record of standing up to oil and gas companies to ensure the health and safety of our community\nThen she listed her opposition to a number of bills which she said would have rolled back health protections standards for oil and gas wells and made it easier for public utilities to use eminent domain\n[noise] but here's the thing about Pennsylvania politics are both the Republican legislature and the Democratic\nGovernor Tom Wolfe had signed off on the pipeline fracking has made Pennsylvania the third largest oil and gas producing state in America and and that's brought in a lot of different players including to know go and its parent company energy transfer partners which owns this pipeline project the Mariner east\nWhen we build a pipeline safety or kept priority for highly skilled engineers environmental scientist wildlife biology and geology design on pipeline to follow the safest wrong with the smallest environmental footprint\nATP as a private corporation that they were able to use eminent domain to take people's land against their will\nWith the smallest environmental footprint\nATP is a private corporation but they were able to use eminent domain to take people's land against their will in order to lay the pipeline the pipeline moves natural gas liquids from the Marcellus gas fields in the west for three hundred and fifty miles to the east to markets hawk outside Philly where it shipped overseas\nWe were following the root of the pipeline through Pennsylvania our second stop with a hundred miles west of action in the small town of blows or fail\nAt blooms gun shop when that Ralph and ...\nCliff wanted to get a taste of what fact checking was really like it made sense for him to come by the office and try his hand at here's Peter candy who runs the fact checking department\nSo they know Radcliffe showed up at my office shortly after town on a Monday morning along with Michael showman who writes about theater for the New York [noise]\nHi [noise] hello how are you and he didn't look unlike under ...\nAnd I wondered whether that had something to do with his intense immersion in the play where he plays a fact checker in a mortal combat where the where the difficult writer\n... because of because one of one of the\nPolicy to sort of the laws that live in I'm In a little bit in like ... and if I see a U.S know that if you can differentiate between ... one of the schools have things in life during the same job I have sort of gifts for whites to everything everything\nI mean the thing is people who don't are familiar with that second most of the things things are either factor opinion and we check the facts and we leave the finance alone\nBut to us the bigger the biggest thing that we work on is what I refer to as fact based opinion in other words like you have to know the underlying facts in order to crack they constructed argument I'm\nNot really a science more kind of an art it's kind of it and the editing you may there are kind of comments that's called judgments that you make and of course that's a sort of squishy ground to make common such adjustments but you know we are journalists so\nUm when we shouldn't show you how to do it because I mean for you to work on and I'm like God I Believe you have a phone call scheduled at a chef of a Mexican restaurant not long

is that so that if he says no it doesn't have a Venice Beach for some reason he's offended by that formulation it's a it's her judgment so maybe you could just say like California speech static um\nNephew to end with this whole set of a job interview or to switch careers\nLike they have a much easier job right out less pressure\n[noise]\nSure to switch careers like they have a much easier
