point three grand\nCanyon okay in a Q and a nine point\nStreaming at K. innate you job or\nThey're not going to be a\nOh [noise]\n[noise]\nLooking as they have to see [noise]\nFrom one World Trade center in Manhattan is just a New Yorker radio our coal production of ... studios and the New Yorker\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick\nThe big story going into the mid term elections has been the possibility of a blue wave a democratic upsurge that's notable\nFor the number of women running and for progressive candidates like ... rock in Texas in Alexandria Ocasio Cortez in New York but another story in this election is the very opposite\nThe candidates were running as extremists on the right openly white supremacist candidates even neo Nazis Andrew Moran has been covering the movement known as the old right\nAnd he's watching how it influences mainstream politics injure you've been reporting on the fringes of right wing nationalism and all the associated movements people like Mike ... for example who was involved in pizza gate\nAnd you've also written about the Nazi website the Daily Stormer which is built on disturbed Nazi lore we've seen a lot of this on the Internet but it's been many years since really far right white supremacist have been running for office in the United states of America when did this all start what did the origins of it\nIt never really not exist but in terms of the most recent resurgence of it um you know Trump has a lot to do with it I mean there there's always been dog whistle politics right and we should definitely note that Democrat\nUm you know Trump has a lot to do with it I mean there there's always been dog whistle politics right and we should definitely know that Democrats have engaging that Republicans have engaged in it but it's not even really a dog whistle anymore it's kind of just a whistle you know there's there's there's more and more openness with people just espousing white nationalist views and that has a lot to do with Trump\nWill people would point out that when Ronald Reagan was for his campaigning for president he campaigned and give it a big speech in the show but county Mississippi and he talked there about nothing less than states rights and this was at the very least a dog whistle to the far right is that something different and why because he\nVoted for tonight it when people asked him he said states rights doesn't mean that when people ask Nixon what do you mean by silent majority what do you mean by law and order he beset firstly denied it\nThey're not really denying it anymore so people like you know Steve King who is a congressman and Iowa he's not flirting with the line he he doesn't believe that these lines should exist\nSo what does what does Steve king's history what does he said and done\nSo Steve King is a congressman from Iowa he's a represented the western part of Iowa for Fifteen Years at this point he's running for re election in November\nAnd he he's very clearly into you know dog whistle racism he talks a lot about western civilization and European heritage and that kind of stuff but he always in the past would leave some plausible deniability and then just in the last couple of years partly because of Trump's and partly because he has a Twitter account\nHe um has been saying things like demographics our destiny and then he says we can't restore our civilization with someone else's babies\nThere's no way to read that that doesn't take our civilization to mean white people there is no plausible reading of it other than a white nationalist reading to see tonight well not really I mean he kinda gets called to the mat and says\nNo I don't regret saying that he doesn't take down to Haiti doesn't delete them he kinda says oh this\nHe kinda gets called to the mat and says no I don't regret saying that he doesn't take down to eat too doesn't delete them he kind of says oh this you know PC culture everybody gets called racist all the time you know you guys are always pro clutching and stuff\nBut he never walk back the actual substance nor does he ever like explain how that could mean anything other than white nationalism\nWell let's talk about what we're talking about let's listen to one of Stephen King statements about diversity this is from an interview that he gave to in Iowa radio program\nAnd when you start at the differences then you'll end up with people that are at each other's throats than adding up than a than black and he predicts there'll be a greater number that whites that America I offered this panic then the blacks will be fighting each other before that\n... what do you make of that\nOr I mean there are there are much more\nExtreme examples of his rhetoric than that but basically it's\nThat's kind of a turning the tables have saying by talking about ah you know the black voting block or the Hispanic voting bloc\nAnyone doing that is therefore the racist Paul Ryan the speaker of the house was asked where do you stand on this and he waits three days or something and then I forget how long he waited but Paul Ryan puts out this very carefully worded statement that doesn't mention Steve king's name at all that just says\nWe abhor racism so in other words it's not like he's such an outlier that the rest of the GOP can very comfortably washed their hands with him and say he's not our guy he is there a guy there not pulling funding from him at least not in a way that they're making public\nSo what does it suggest about American politics that the most powerful leader and one of the houses of Congress Paul Ryan feel they cannot afford to reject somebody like king\nIt's terrifying it's yeah it means that they've read the tea leaves and they know that this is too big a part of their support base to give up on\nYou've spent the last year marinating in the juices of what one\nTea leaves and they know that this is too big a part of their support base to give up on\nYou spent the last year marinating in the juices of what one could call a cyber predator fascism yeah unfortunately talking to a lot of people who are are the very most active players and voices in what you're going to fascism and\nWhat does it tell you about American political life\nLook I think it's not that everything has utterly transformed and you know we weren't we weren't close to the brink and now we are I mean we're closer now for sure\nBut um what is the brink well it can't happen here you know that that notion that you know yeah ... ... fascism could have happened in Europe but it can't happen here\nI think we're now all starting to see that there is no law of nature that says that the walls of the United states that we we we are in extremely flawed\nSociety with a extremely a dicey racial history\nThat I'm perhaps a uniquely so among the countries we're talking about democracy is a very delicate tricky thing right if Steve King is now going out there and just essentially saying to the people of Iowa hello I'm a white nationalist do you want to vote for me or do you want to vote for the other guy\nThere is no guarantee that they want to vote for the other guy well let's talk about the other guy his opponent kings opponent is a Democrat and former baseball player named J. D. show the show and have a chance and what are the dynamics of that race look like\nHe's much taller so that's generally a good thing about sixty six six and he's driving around the district in Winnebago and you know shaking everyone's hand and being very folksy he's out fundraising king\nHe still down in the ... I mean incumbency is a very powerful thing in house elections and king has been there for six terms what's the district thing it's deep deep red as they say and king you know it's it's you you might not know this from looking at his Twitter feed but [laughter] um racism is not his only\nIt's deep deep red as they say and king you know it's it's you you might not know this from looking at his Twitter feed but racism is not the only thing you know he also\nYou know once ethanol subsidies and he also says he wants to support farmers now he's been in Congress for Fifteen Years he has sponsored exactly one bill that passed which was to rename a post office in Iowa so he's not the most effective legislator\nNow that we live in the age of ... are there new politicians on the scene who seemed to be entering the stage or coming onto the stage in a way they might not have\nBefore yeah I think someone like course Stewart he was someone who the Virginia a GOP just thought would fizzle out and he's running for Senate he's running for Senate against Tim Kaine who will probably win but you know with this level of support he's doing better than one would expect I mean he\nHe won the primary and his whole national image is based on being standing up for these Confederate monuments\nWe can't turn them down there our heritage he was born and raised in Duluth, Minnesota so [laughter] not the heart of the confederacy out of the confederacy and Steve came by the way it used to have a Confederate flag on his desk in the Capitol building which by the way Iowa sent a lot of soldiers to die to fight against the confederacy so it's like gee I Wonder what that flag means to you\nIn New Jersey and the state of New Jersey or New Jersey congressman Seth gross was dropped by the Republican Party after saying that diversity is crap is that an outlier incident is that a very rare instance of the of the party standing up to some of its extremist voices\nI think he I think the set Grossman thing was a bit of an anomaly I mean you have even more anomalous cases than that you have\nA guy named Arthur Jones in Illinois who is literally a Nazi who stands in front of Nazi flags and give speeches and he won a GOP primary in a district where it's heavily democratic and so they don't bother to run a lot of Republicans in these in these races so he's not going to win the jets\nOne a GOP primary in a district where it's heavily democratic and so they don't bother to run a lot of Republicans in these in these races so he's not going to win the general election\nIt's very scary that a literal Nazi is is running for office in Illinois and that and that this guy Seth Grossman is running for office in New Jersey but those are outliers I mean so I don't want to paint the picture that you know this is happening everywhere all the time\nAnd then the course of that discovered that Mike Flynn who was going to be the incoming national security adviser um had been having discussions with Mr Kislyak who was the Russian ambassador\nUm essentially imploring him not to do anything in response to those sanctions\nBut then the situation got a lot worse\nBecause people in the administration starting with Sean Spicer\nBut then the situation got a lot worse\nBecause people in the administration starting with Sean Spicer and others and ultimately come the culminating vice president Pence\nUm went out and were telling the American people that there had been no such discussions we knew because we had recordings of these conversations that we weren't the only ones who knew\nThat General Flynn was providing false information ostensibly to people in the administration who were then providing false information to the American people we weren't the only ones who knew that the Russians and do that too\nAnd because this had become such a big public thing this is precisely the kind of information they would love to be able to hold over the head\nOf the national security advisor which made him potentially compromise compromise it suits or black males so what does what happened to 'em so I contacted Don McGahn who White House White House counsel 'em and told him that I needed to come see 'em right away\nTold him what we have learned that\nYou know the vice president a bit on face the nation and saying you know I've talked to a General Flynn personally and he is assured me that there were no conversations about sanctions so\nYou got the VP out there saying this step so we told 'em Mr McGahn how we knew that it wasn't true how we happen to have recordings of these conversations and why we thought it was a problem\nAnd and you go see him a second time on January twenty seven yeah he asked me to come back and ... was a different are the same or what it was it was a little\nIn the sense that um he was a bit more combative I guess I Would say in this discussion and I\nYou know testified before the sort of one of his first questions was what's it to the department of justice if one\nDiscussion and I\nYou know testified before the sort of one of his first questions was what's it to the department of justice if one White House official lies to another\nWhat did you make of that [noise] um well I tried to explain to him that it was a whole lot more than just one White House official lying to another which God that would help people would be concerned about any way but then it was more than that that the underlying conduct here that General Flynn having\nThese discussions to begin with is problematic but beyond that again it's the issue of compromise that the Russians notice it provides potential leverage and this was a problem\nAnd we also thought you know the vice President Pence was entitled to know that the stuff that he was saying when he stood in you know in front of of the public that that wasn't true so we were trying to help them\nSo your second meeting with Don McGahn is January twenty seventh also on January twenty seventh I'm an executive order is issue yeah um\nBanning travel from seven Muslim majority countries did you know anything about that until there was this you\nKnow and and that's the remarkable thing I'm sitting right there and Don McGahn office talking to him at link\nAnd he doesn't tell me that the president at this point has already signed an executive order as you said banning immigration from these countries and that the department of justice is going to have to be in court the very next morning defending this\nSo how did you find out about the travel ban um I was in the car I was literally in the car on the way to the airport\nAnd I get a call I was able to keep one aide with may want us to my principal deputy the top deputy the whole time and so ... calls me and he says after you left you know I went online I was reading the\nTop deputy the whole time and so ... calls me and he says after you left you know I went online I was reading the New York times and it looks like President Trump has issued some sort of travel ban\nWe spent the weekend I'm trying to get our arms around and communicating with the White House um what is it that you're trying to do and\nBy Monday morning I was told that we would have to take a position on the constitutionality\nOf the travel ban the next morning and in a case so we convened everybody in my conference room and it's been a very long time in there I'm Talking through what the challenges were what the White House position was in terms of the scope of the travel ban\nWe talked about the different challenges by the constitutionally and statutory early and otherwise that have been filed [noise] um\nAnd at the end of that conversation\nI was not satisfied that it was lawful or constitutional and\nWhat troubles me beyond that was it became clear that to defend the constitutionality of this I was going to have to send department of justice lawyers and to take the position\nThat this travel ban that applied just a Muslim majority countries had absolutely nothing to do with religion and\nThis was in the face of all of the president's statements that he had made both on the campaign trail and after he had been elected and\nThat did not seem like the truth to me\nBut isn't it usually been job of a department of justice to defend actions of the administration even if you personally would not have ... you know issued that order or you're the president's you're the executive branch's lawyers\nPersonally would not have ... you know issued the order or you're the president's you're the executive branch's lawyers writer why wasn't that good enough for you to say I'm going to defend this\nWell it wasn't just that I disagreed with this on a policy ground perhaps the appropriate thing then to do would be to resign if you can't be part of that um but not directed department not to defend it but here's what's different is that\nI happen to believe ... should go into court and make an argument that it's not grounded and truth but the department of justice [noise]\nI mean [noise] if\nThe OJ stands for anything it's supposed to stand for what is true and what is just [noise] so what did you do [noise]\nI knew that I personally couldn't be parked I'm defending this an argument something that that wasn't granted in ... um but you know I thought about what may be the thing to do is reside\nAnd that would have protected my personal integrity I wouldn't have been part of this um but I was like just the head of the civil division or you know some other component of the department [noise]\nI was the acting attorney general of the United states and I felt like I had a responsibility to protect not just my personal integrity but the integrity of the department of justice as well and I thought back to my confirmation hearing\nWhen I'm there were some senators including Senator Sessions\nWho they were all over me and my confirmation hearing about\nWhat I Would do if the president asked me to do something that was on Wall for wrong and I think Senator Sessions said you know even if it's just something that would bring disrupt ... to the department of justice you know you're going to be asked to do that and will you saying that\nYou know even if it's just something that would bring disrupt ... to the department of justice you know you're going to be asked to do that and will you saying that\nYou know none of them were asking me will you resign they were asking me will you say no and they were right about that it wasn't my responsibility in that position I think to resign I think it was my responsibility to sign up so how did you say no they\nI mean it wasn't like a state public statement it was just a communication\nThat we have a we had there were communications going on at levels below me and between me and Mr McGahn and I should the direct it to the department and then what happens [noise] um I was fired ...\nYou were fired by Donald Trump before it was fashionable [laughter] hired by Donald Trump\nDid that surprise you are or how did you think the story was going to end once you said you weren't going to allow the\nTravel ban to be defended look I certainly recognized there was a very real possibility for probability that I Would be fired in this in this context but I hoped\nThat maybe there was a chance that by doing this that would cause them to step back\nAnd take a breath and look at what they were doing and\nMore ... okay I Know everybody's got enough impolite so loud [laughter] and I was kind of silly now doesn't it um but you know I\nHarbor this hope that maybe they would step back they would have the kind of process they would get the kind of input on there would be real discussion about this um\nI had spent twenty seven years at the department of justice I loved that place um I did not want to have the period on my service they're being fired\nThis I loved that place um I did not want to have the period on my service they're being fired\nWhat what's your assessment of the whole series of events\n[noise] um\nI suppose you could say that the president and made a campaign promise and he was making good on that promise but beyond the fact that I Believe that particularly the first one was a lawful and unconstitutional I think it's\nAbsolutely the antithesis of who we are as a country and\n[noise]\nListening to sell you a long time Justice Department official who is the acting attorney general at the start of the Trump Administration Sally ate spoke with Jeffrey to even at the New

like\n... and and you're going to run into issues when people try to search her name is\nYeah very strong from this angle either [laughter] um yeah I Know you grow up in the DC area there was a thriving culture of music or the things you were listening to have the worst starting to perform and um to to start writing songs how did that all those influences coming together\nUm you know it's it's really weird because you know\nI feel like I'm grown up in a really ... it's an intersection experience\nI feel like I'm grown up in a really ... it's\nAn intersection only experience you know there's a lot of things going on at the same time you know I'm I'm a daughter of immigrants of African immigrants East African immigrants particularly if he opens and then there's the layer of\nGrowing up in a suburb\nOf DC I'm I'm being bussed from a you know ghetto suburb\nTo a wider suburb and what that means you know um there's a particular way that you're processing the world when your school is extremely segregated I Would say that's the case for everybody but there's a way it was happening in my school\nSo I was listening to a lot of different things you know I was obsessed with with armed be any harm the local was just that was like zero those home base\nAnd I would say before that I was listening to jazz and in world music and just you know a lot of traditional music\nAnd then I remember my ex boyfriend my first boyfriend had a Napster membership one of the first\nOh well we were all and I got now during the divorce you know I kept that membership\nFor a few years to survey every female\nVocal period I was just on a mission to just scan the world for every single type of thing and and so I just would learn music and other languages but mainly jazz you know that was the thing that I was sort of serving the most and\nUm so you know I've had different periods where I was just\nImmersed in one sound um and then after that it was sort of a really experimental\nDifferent periods where I was just\nImmersed in one sound um and then after that it was sort of a really experimental music you know so electronic and experimental music when I think about my experimental electronic music side a lot of those references are still black\nBecause I'm thinking about Jared Diamond Terry Louis or I'm thinking about both the comments or you know I'm just in her mouth Davis or Herbie herpes\nWhat was it about or and be made it sort of a\nSudden we're kinda more droughts worse in some ... some pool on you\nUm I guess it was just pop music that was you know there's a way that you know\nYou can't there's there's no ... around\nUm jazz when you get to your elementary school\n[laughter] for jobs will now where you want to be around me out and get the kindergarten and people like you know ... you know [laughter] like that so\nI'm yeah I think that is just the pool it's the thing that happens to every him is long hair and being when they see Michael Jackson for the first time or when they see\n'em you know when they hear Mariah or just any of those sort of bank huge artists will have that pull you know\nUm but you know my love for jazz never never died [noise]\n... no\nStill get\nHe\nIn the\n\n\n\n[noise]\nIn jazz is part of what you're supposed to do is reinterpret the standard you know that's how you get good so for me I always just
