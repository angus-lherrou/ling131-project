outsider to this very elite um friday\nHard drinking badly behaved relatively repercussion free\nUm social circle of extremely wealthy privileged white men who were all on paths toward immense power\nAnd the narrative of it was when I was young and irresponsible I was young and responsible boys will be boys\nRight who who amongst us has not write like that and that's it again that's about the sort of invisibility of certain kinds of a power abuses um I write about in the book and something that I've I've become kind of obsessed with and thinking both about how\nFor example a black lives matter movement has been talked about in the mainstream press and then watching the same kinds of things around the me too movement\nIt's helped me to understand a little bit about how when power is abused in the direction that is sort of natural the more powerful do something bad or harmful or even violent to the less powerful\nIt's sort of invisible right oh oh he was a drunk boy of course he did this like what young man what Seventeen year old healthy young man with a sex drive in a keg leg wouldn't have an behave that way it's like an discernible as harm in some way\nIn your

Seventeen year old healthy young man with a sex drive in a keg like wouldn't have an behave that way it's like an discernible as harm in some way\nIn your book good and mad you write very early in the book I Am a white woman who's been angry in my life and my work occasionally on my own behalf\nBut more often about politics about inequity and the grotesque unfairness of the world in this country how it was built and who would still excludes and systematically diminished and then you're off to the races [laughter]\nUm this book is in large measure about anger the legitimacy of anger the ploy men to anger historically toward toward good um [noise] what's that you often\n[noise] um it was an attempt to get my thoughts clear after the election I was um they'll take some doing oh God yes [noise]\nI didn't know I was I was wrestling with what my job was I was wrestling with what my work was how do you mean\nI was very muddy about what the story was that I needed to tell I have to say that I haven't I haven't talked about this before and\nUm there's a degree to which I was deeply obsessed by the question of the white women I was acutely aware of my identity\nUm as a white woman the the degree to which my work has been lingered by my white miss my work on feminism the degree to which I have been pushed to be better to think more clearly about race and class\nUm that's been a big part of my evolution as a writer and there was something that had happened right before the election I've been on part of a podcast\nThere's a degree to which I was deeply obsessed by the question of the white women I was acutely aware of my identity\nUm as a white woman the the degree to which my work has been blink or to buy my white miss my work on feminism the degree to which I have been pushed to be better to think more clearly about race and class um that's been a big part of my evolution as a writer\nAnd there was something that had happened right before the election I've been on part of a podcast\nWith a bunch of women and one of them had said about the white young white men who was the classic Bernie supporter like\nShe had said something like where are you guys out there trying to to persuade people to vote for Hillary because it's your guys as white men who are not voting for her\nWhere the left white guys go get your boys right that was the phrase that she'd use go get your boys right and it was not a surprise to me that white women had voted for Donald Trump\nBut I was acutely aware of this demographic and I felt some responsibility and I'm very sympathetic to the argument\nWhich is like leaving be it is not worth the investment and trying to persuade white women to be on our side there's a woman in my book just morale is who says she worked on the Hillary campaign and she was like look this was about persuading white women to not be Phyllis Schlafly and that has never ever work they're always going to be foolish off you're right I understand and\nHave sympathy you with that like just let 'em right right and they want to they want to support a system that fundamentally oppressive them and that oppressive other people great but I felt some that that phrase go get your boys without going in my own head\nAnd I think that I part of what I wanted to do was also think about white women\nAnd what impulses and messages are at work on white women\nPhyllis Schlafly and that has never ever work they're always going to be philosophically right I understand and have sympathy\nWith that like just let 'em right right you know they want to they want to support a system that fundamentally oppressive them and that oppressive other people great but I felt some that that phrase go get your boys without going in my own head\nAnd I think that I part of what I wanted to do was also think about white women\nAnd what impulses and messages are at work on white women\nAnd um I felt like it was my responsibility to examine race from the perspective of of waiting is in conjunction with looking at gender and then the anger so I I was feeling that but I wasn't sure how to do it right I I and that was the question about my work how do I do that what do I do what is my job what's ... what's the story here\nBut everything was so clouded [noise]\nAnd it was on a walk with my husband um between Christmas and New Years of that year says twenty six you know twenty Seventeen and I was trying to explain to him that despair I was feeling about like I not knowing what my role was supposed to be what it was like what was my work going to be professional professionally\nAnd um I said I just can't think straight dry is I'm I'm so mad and he was like well maybe that's what your work is\nAnd I said what do you mean and he goes well maybe that's what you need to write about is the anger and as soon as he said it he's not a writer um he was just something he was responding to and what\nBut suddenly in that in that exchange I'm not exaggerating when I said it was the first feeling of like clarity enlighten us in my head that I'd had at that point in two months\nIt is interesting that the law to the exemplar of constructive anger in the book historically a black woman I'm Shirley Chisholm Florence Kennedy who I remember well watching on public access television for hours\nMaybe that's what you need to write about is anger and as soon as he said it he's not a writer um he was just something he was responding to and what but suddenly in that in that exchange I'm not exaggerating when I said it was the first feeling of like clarity enlighten us in my head that I'd had at that point in two months since\nIt is interesting that the law to the exemplar of\nConstructive anger in the book historically are black women mhm I'm
