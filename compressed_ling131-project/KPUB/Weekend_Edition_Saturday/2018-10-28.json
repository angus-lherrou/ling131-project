coverage from NPR News I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro we're watching a press conference and was about to start in Pittsburgh this morning\nEleven people are dead at the tree of life synagogue in that city six people were injured suspected gunman Robert Ballard is in custody the department of justice is investigating it\nAs a hate crime will be joining the press conference live when it begins but first NPR's Sarah McCammon is here to discuss the case with us she is in ... in Pittsburgh good morning Hi Lou\nUh we're waiting to hear from officials oh what do we know so far about the victims well what we know is that eleven\nPeople were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told none of them were children um and also that's six people were injured including several police officers the names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed as the day goes by\nOf course the next step is funerals and memorial services I Will be hearing more about those in the days to come as well\nYeah this alleged shooter has been arrested and charged or what do we know about the motive for this crime\nWell it is being investigated as a hate crime it took place of course had a synagogue or the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media\nAnd he was taken into custody at the scene yesterday is facing twenty nine federal charges and the deaths of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the motives how it happened why it happened\nAnd what else do we know about how the attack happened\nThose eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the motives how it happened why it happened\nAnd what else do we know about how the attack happened well authorities say the shooter was at the synagogue for about twenty minutes yesterday morning this was a an as a religious service was expected to begin um he was armed with an assault style rifles were told as well as three hand guns\nAre engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene\nThis into context for us there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful pattern\nRate I mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and um well it's not the deadliest on American soil it appears to be the dead one of the deadliest if not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil I'm like in a loving people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying one of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an act of hate against us all\nThis mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America at a rate unprecedented in\nDecades yeah and we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like everyone is really um grappling with this and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning right um\nThis morning it was very quiet and still I'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue to the police tape um as far as I could could go and and you know of course there are police officers everywhere\nUp to the the edge of the synagogue to the police tape um as far as I could could go and and it you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nAre lots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun laying flowers memorials I'm just at the edge of the there's sort of a shrub a section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner\nAnd and this is you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think the point of pride in the community this neighborhood and the synagogue and uh people or\nYou know grappling as they as they do it and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were vigils last night there always are there will be another interfaith service tonight I'm ... and the the grieving is really just beginning here\nI think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding\nYeah but I didn't mention there will be a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a this of course happened out of house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opened its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want to save and comforting place\nIt's so hard to talk to children after something like this happen ... so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's um and ... and so uh that's just one small thing the community is doing to try to help families a Jewish and otherwise ah throughout this community in Pittsburgh a pope with what's happened here\nThis tragedy that's happened again and again around this country um has happened here and and people are trying to make sense of it yeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now\n\nYeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now\n\n\nYeah incredibly moving and somber\nUm what has been the response from elected officials so far\nWell it depends on what your elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accept this violence as a normal part of American Life\nAnd something that has become more and more common place in American Life nonetheless\nThe president a President Trump yesterday afternoon address the shooting a remarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside the Senate God the shooter might have been stopped and it's important to note of course that there were police on the scene very quickly and and they did engage with\nIt's a little over a week until election day coverage is twenty four seven TV is filled with ads so is everybody fired up\nYou know I don't watch educated enough to follow the politicians or something like ... where\nIn Pennsylvania to talk with voters and ... that can the latest on the shooting in Pittsburgh next time on all things considered from NPR News\nWe can do all things considered begins at five o'clock this afternoon here on ...\nFace a his daughter Ivanka and his son in law and his grandchildren are Jewish and and he spoke last night um and and called it out and said that these were anti Semitic attacks and that this was a hate crime right and and he you know he\nAnd the vice president have both said that this this cannot be tolerated a ... and said that this is he said essentially that this was uh\nRight and and he you know he and the vice president have both said that this this cannot be tolerated a ... and said that this is he said essentially that this was a you know sick thing to do 'em so he's he's certainly called it out I'm\nA ... of course that you know the thoughts about how to deal with it how to reduce the kind of crime how to respond to it there's there's a great deal of controversy about that\nWhen you walk around Pittsburgh and and you see people I'm sort of\nGrappling with this and and trying to make sense of it or what are they saying about um why this might have happened [noise] well I think\nThese situations and and I I've not been on the ground here in Pittsburgh too terribly long myself but um I think what you see again and again in these situations as I said I've covered several mass shootings now three this is my third and just the past year or so\nUm people are on the one hand uh just be well they're trying to make sense of why someone would do something like this and\nIn each case it seems like a there's a there's a search for why after the the Las Vegas shooting I did a piece about why we need to know why and and there are a number of reasons for that sometimes it's law enforcement wants to understand what went into the motive for a crime so they can prosecute and investigate and so that they can maybe try to reduce that\nThere is also a psychological need to know why you know people um grapple with why why here why me why my community\nAnd in this case there are as we've said indications that suggest that um the shooter had anti Semitic an anti immigrant of motives\nThat tells us something about why this might have happened again that still under investigation but um it is being investigated as a as a hate crime and that may be something we know more about a as a press conference get started pretty soon here in Pittsburgh\nWe are waiting I'm we're watching screens here waiting for a authorities in Pittsburgh to to address the public address the media um and\nDating and we're watching screens here waiting for a authorities in Pittsburgh to to address the public address the media um and there are a lot of questions about about why this happened and also we'd like to know more about about the victims soon\nAnd we're going to bring in a are Mara Liasson now to talk about a little bit more about the political landscape around this of course we are coming up to the midterms um and a lot of people are looking at this and feeling very on edge wondering if this is really um you know connected to the elections Mara good morning It's MORNING [noise]\nSo I set the scene for us the president's response and and basically how we are actually starting this press conference and now I'm we're going to go there live here we go\nAgency support a western Pennsylvania is blessed to have so many a law enforcement agencies that work together that train together\nUh and yesterday just showed how that

a moment to think those that spoke earlier\nThe effort that was put in across multi jurisdictions from the federal to the state to the county to the local was something that we should all be proud of\nThe fact that we were able to work together as one community suburban medics coming in voluntarily to take on different areas of our city because all of our medics we're at the scene\nOr medics

order to be able to protect others there's something when they put on that uniformed that we should understand\nThe sacrifice that they make to their family members the city will be behind in there to

world\nHatred will not have a place anywhere and we will\nFrom our nation in our world hatred will not have a place anywhere\nAnd we will work local ways to make those changes happen and we will work

Hannah Jones she covers race for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voters or the teen of voters are any racial minority\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters ... but when we talk about white voters we rarely meant and their race at all unless it's a story about race we talk about them in terms of their varied interests than there are varied\nAbout white voters we rarely mentioned their race at all unless it's a story about race we talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class\nVoters or we talk about educated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for white voters\nWhat happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not the things that concern voters of color and the voters of color or somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense right\nWhite is the default so\nI have treated frequently that when we\nSee something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white\nIn front of that statement and that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does not accurately reporting this story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about my people [noise]\nI think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this meeting up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because by ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue or that issue and in fact\nWhat the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack\nAnd in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack\nAnd so by and instead focusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say why but our invoking it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so this also I think speaks to the very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you were a person of color we got legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago\nBut white voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not\nActually reporting what everyone is Harry and what everyone knows when\nWe were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously is the most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also the sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair\nToday's can a you'd days sponsors are petrified forest national park on kids county and Gary groupie pleased to announce that petrified forest national talk without the guy did that country hikes weekends in November and December hike details on the ... website and Facebook pages\nFrom northern Arizona university this is Arizona Public radio NPR News and classical music on cayenne eight years maybe eight point seven sites that Katie you be Ninety One point seven ... paying eight eight Ninety point seven show less\nThan a dean Ninety One point seven page K.

steadily declined since deporting the country more than two weeks ago\nSome of dropped out some state in Mexico and others have been deported she reports many has landed back in the place where the

couldn't walk anymore he says the officials caught him in a group of the others middlemen he meant it was also deployed low level of sort of what I wanted to do with the original caravan but couldn't scrape up cash fast enough to him in his\nWord spread quickly through social media and cable news back on October twelve people were gathering here at the bus station ready to head north\nBy nightfall thousands were on buses out of this violence city more than a third of the country's homicides are committed here\nAnd then it says along with the violence there are also not enough jobs\nThat are like and I think a lot of us either that or the support of the buildings that are left or the middle of all I don't know if a little bit\nTo do I keep going up bus tickets go up medicine everything but our salaries they stay the same he says the poverty here is killing us he says he can't beat his four kids\nTwo thirds of Hondurans live in poverty corruption and impunity add to the rampant

the shooting in Pittsburgh the suspicious packages sent to critics of President Trump so let's take a breath for a moment and take stock\nAre we getting it getting it as an understanding or we all as Americans aware of how this moment in history is affecting us and the effect we're having on the events happening around us how are we talking to each other and what are we listening to and what is it doing to us all\nOne big factor in that is language and rhetoric thing also about the way the caravan of migrants is being discussed\nSchachter teaches sociology at Washington University in St Louis and she's been looking at how language impacts our perceptions of immigrants and Carolyn ... is the executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse and we begin with her\nShe says she sees a direct line between a politician's words and bombs in the mail\nWe want to look back actually to the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nWere in that campaign we saw the rhetoric being used to attack certain populations in the country Muslims African Americans women disabled reporters we actually saw physical attacks following the kind of ... rhetoric that we're now seeing again going into the election\nNow we came back from that precipice during the presidential campaign\nBut now here we're at that precipice again\nAnd it's similar line between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice\nBut now here we're at the precipice again\nAnd it's similar line between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that man was targeting Republicans and was enraged about the geo peas position on health care\n[noise] definitely and the Institute that I lead was created at the University of Arizona after the same kind of attack on Gabby Giffords it\nWas a clear assassination attack after the very tough twenty ten election where the hot issue is the Affordable CARE Act so we've now seen three instances in which all elected officials are targeted physically after a period of ... political rhetoric [noise]\nThere is a long history of political invective as you rightly point to um harsh sometimes hateful speech I'm stretching back even to the founders we've had moments of turmoil and thinking of you know white supremacists in the Nineteen sixties the weather underground in the seventies [noise] what sets this moment apart in your view\n[noise] the phenomena we're seeing post twenty sixteen hasn't been seen in modern political history\nWhich is once the election was over\nPeople ordinary people Americans who voted for Trump continued to demonize and hate Hillary voters and vice versa and that's still going on today two years later the national Institute has actually had calls for major U.S corporations we're

correspondent Mara Liasson good morning thanks for having me [noise]\nSo obviously I'm a terrible news out of Pittsburgh we got the names of those who I'm actually were killed by this in this attack\nYeah let's just make a few things clear this was the worst anti Semitic attacking us history it occurred just days after the largest\nAssassination attempt on political leaders in this case all Democrats and targets of the president's in us history and we're not going to have the big debate about whether extreme rhetoric including some of the president's rhetoric\nHelped insight this but the president has\nMade a lot of unifying statements he said these acts were evil he has also gone on to campaign and hold rallies kind of partisan politics as usual although he said that he's going to try to tone it down a little bit and he did\nBut just before a rally in\nIn politics as usual although he said that he's going to try to tone it down a little bit and he did but just before a rally in Illinois over the weekend he had this to say about his tone\nI Would like to be able to have its own that I have because I feel very strongly about it and I have a much different John frankly the press was\nEven handed Russia was fair I'd have a much different tone all the time\nSo in other words the press is still at fault but as I said we're going to have a big debate about whether some of the president's words helped create the climate for these kinds of attacks he's not responsible for the acts of crazy people\nBut there's what the president says and then there's what people here you know the shooter in Pittsburgh\nA posted on social media that Jews were funding the caravan Donald Trump has tweeted without evidence that George Soros was funding the caravan he talks about global is a lot and in the right wing media like Breitbart the Daily Caller global list is a synonym for Jew\n... this is a president who has not really embrace the role of United and chief\nNo he doesn't believe in that other presidents have seen their role as sort of the moral leader of the nation but he doesn't believe in that I don't think he'll change she's over Seventy years old and this kind of extreme rhetoric has worked for him he believes it energize his base\nHis closing argument in this election is based on race in fear of crime fear of immigration and it's kind of a social media business model you know the algorithms that YouTube and and other social media organizations know that more extreme content keeps viewers\nOn longer and this is what the president feels works\nNo that more extreme content keeps viewers on longer and this is what the president feels works for his base and that he might tone it down a little bit but I don't think he's going to give it up\nAs you know mid term elections are just over a week away well the events of this past week affects the elections and if so how\nI think for the most part the fundamentals of this election are set they've been very stable with the landscape for Senate races leaning towards Republicans in the house the trend seems to be leading towards Democrats I think the biggest way this might affect\nThe elections is that it crowds out talk about politics the president has complained about this he said Republicans were on a roll we had momentum now all the media wants to talk about are these in quotes bombs\nSo that might be the biggest effect\nNPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson ... thank you so much thank you\nThis morning we've been talking about the shooting at the tree of life cynical but this past week also saw\nFourteen package bombs sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump and that has been arrested in that case his or say Iraq is being held at the federal detention center in Miami for the latest on this story we turn now to NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre who is in neighboring Fort Lauderdale Florida mourning\nMourning was All right um so he's been arrested what should be ... what should we be looking for on the legal front\nWhere we expect to say opt to go before a federal magistrate a Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces\nAnd then we expect a that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will ah it seems will be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation well are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested or so\nAre there any new details on the investigation\nWell are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested a so that's a perhaps the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no resources\nAll these explosives and that put the nation on edge on CNN has reported citing a source that a parent Lee was making them in his man and there's no sign yet that any other help\nAre getting a picture of how he became this extreme\nYeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty sixteen he had a very troubled life lots of arrests but he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a soccer and body building and nightlife\nAnd then two years ago all this anger or in a political anger starts coming out in in social media one thing really struck me um he is we know lived in a van he hung out sort of on the southern edge of a Fort Lauderdale\nIn Parkland community that had that horrific school shooting this year that's only about Fifteen miles away sort of the northwest edge of a uh Fort Lauderdale\nAnd say I began making all these attacks\nAgainst David hog one of the students who survived and became a a prominent gun control advocate he was constantly going after hog on Twitter saying he was a fraud he didn't go to the school and then in fact he was an actor being paid by George Soros\nThe financier who's been in the news so much lately and in ... in fact was the first to receive an explosive package in the mail\nI understand you suddenly co workers including one who was in that time yet\n... was a manager at the new river pizza I Will say I was a delivery driver and she says they got along he was reliable um he gave her a ride home one night when it was raining and and she noticed\nSay I was a delivery driver and she says they got along he was reliable um he gave her a ride home one night when it was raining and and she noticed all these dirty clothes and food rappers\nBut she said he also openly talked about a saying that gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated um here's what he said about here's what she said about his political thinking\nWas talking about Hitler he loves Hitler Hitler and we should go back to that site with Hitler\nThat's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre we thank you so much\nThank you lose the leading up to the mid term election season we've been looking at what voters will find on their ballots the big governors' races the different kinds of ballot measures well we've just got today and one more Sunday before election day\nSo it's time to look at the too big a house and Senate will do the Senate first and we'll do it with NPR lead political editor to medical not to narrow good morning to medical good morning ...\nA third of the seats and the senator up as the constitution requires Democrats were facing some tough mass but then we started hearing about a blue wave how's that water looking\nWell look the blue wave is certainly real but it's more likely to be in the house then in the Senate and that's because in the Senate there are a lot more uh seats that are held by Democrats in red states that are up you have the worst landscape since the direct election of senators\nIn Nineteen fourteen for either party that's because you have twenty six Democrats that are defending seats and just nine Republicans so will the Republicans pick up seats then\nIt's very possible in fact a you know some handicappers are looking at a potential a best case scenario for Democrats being net even right now it's fifty one forty nine in the Senate\nAnd a more likely scenario something like two to three seats lost from when I talk to Democrats at the beginning of this cycle and through the cycle they were hoping to sort of be able to hold serve so that they could have a better landscape\nAsked for and when I talk to Democrats at the beginning of the cycle and through the cycle they were hoping to sort of be able to hold serve so that they could have a better landscaping twenty Eighteen where they could go on often\nThe best target for Democrats as in Nevada with Dean Heller and Heller is actually started to do a lot better a lot of those Republican a defense is a lot of those those Senate seats or Arizona Tennessee Texas Nevada they've all started to try and a little bit more Republican in recent weeks while Democrats like Heidi Heitkamp\nThe next time [noise]\nNext types of space is tonight on cayenne a you\nAnd the next time [noise]\nThe next

how the groups we come from\nAffect our point of view what's often called identity politics and when we talk about identity and politics wheat and yes that includes NPR can be specific about some identities and vague about others to explain and discuss we're joined now by a nickel Hannah Jones she covers race to the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voters are the voters are any racial minority\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters ... but when we talk about white voters we rarely mention their race at all unless it's a story about race\nWe talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class voters or we talk about\nEducated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for white voters\nWhat happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not the things that concern voters of color and the voters of color or somehow the only ones who engaged in identity\nTend to think that the things that concern white voters are not things that concern voters of color and the voters of color or somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default\nSo I have tweet it frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white\nIn front of that statement and that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does not accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people [noise]\nWell I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this meeting up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because by ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue where that issue and in fact\nWhat the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack\nAnd so by and instead focusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say why ... is when they talk about the past the good old days and Nineteen\nTrump into the White House another way politicians may not explicitly say why but our invoking it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so there is also I think speaks to the very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you were a person of color we got legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago\nBut white voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not\nActually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows\nWhen we were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously that most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also the sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair\nSo how did those two things then sent when you're trying to discuss some of these racial um divisions in this country\nWhen I was clearly argue we're all biased\nI think the way that we covered the election showed that biased to be very glaring we clear\nBecause we were ignoring literally what voters on the ground were saying right ... voters on the ground where say no I haven't lost my job or I don't know anyone who's lost a job to Hispanic but I Want them to build that wall anyway because they're coming here and they're changing our country like they were saying exactly how they felt\nAnd we were like no no they don't know what they're talking about it it's it's economic anxiety so that's biased\nBut also when we talk about fairness is it fair\nNo no they don't know what they're talking about it it's it's economic anxiety so that's biased\nBut also when we talk about fairness is it fair is it accurate to say you're talking about suburban voters if in fact the we're only talking about a segment of those voters were white\nTo me that is not fair it's not fair to all of the people in a country that at this point is about forty percent non white who we are rendering invisible and our coverage\nNicole Anna Jones of the New York times magazine thank
