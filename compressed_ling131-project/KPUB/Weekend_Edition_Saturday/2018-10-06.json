become too liberal to inclined to read the constitution to accommodate the outlook and philosophy of a few justices with big ideas about social and political justice\nMembers of the society of indicated a desire to revisit some of the landmark decisions of the past two generations asking\nThe question of whether or not the basis for those decisions was in the constitution or whether it was

Court\nBut the battle is become a flashpoint following allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school Megan McCarthy columnist for the Washington Post has expressed\nA diversity of views [laughter] which we welcome and she joined just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you wrote one port that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause in the Senate vote to investigate allegations\nOf sexual assault by Christian balls before it now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter] uh what's that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes\nDon't think so I think well I mean yes and now right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes or perhaps not as often as we'd like um I didn't actually\nEnough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes or perhaps not as often as we'd like um I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with as it than look to possible\nThat they should confirmed me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote you know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise]\nUm and also for you know even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all\nInformation out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also\nYou need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate the sins of the investigation do its job I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh\nUm some people say that's actually pretty normal some people say it wasn't\nA I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true on the other had both of them had testified at length\nAnd you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative by not providing she had basically two pieces of crowds I wasn't aware of that because she was well so she had basically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she told and sort of two thousand Seventeen two dozen Eighteen ... should\nPeople there basically to his cooperation were her therapists notes which would seem to say look she talked about this all they're not we have another name in two thousand twelve and the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes to the committee um\nThat she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes to the committee\n'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear but the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contacted the committee for her you know and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen\n... let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's ... Christian bushy Ford a sincere\nA book that she couldn't let her church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support right a judge\nNo the world heard from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time and as an inherently difficult crime because you know some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated to consent you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have\nNecessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible um and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in this neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy and being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews Republicans kept saying presumed innocent ... ah until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end\nGuilty beyond a reasonable doubt and you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrence\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved from people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth\nUm it's not the same as being put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it's it's way worse than what ...\nMaking the colonel thanks so much thank you [noise] ...

Wilson is one of those protesters results way west Virginian and founder of the women's activist group\nBoss babes in that state as rules and thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me and what your immediate reaction to senator Manchin Cheney intends to vote for drugs capital\nIt's devastating but it's honestly not super surprising\nYeah well yeah that it's been indicated also I mean Donald Trump got sixty eight point five percent of the presidential vote in West Virginia in twenty sixteen can the argument being made that senator mantra news just reflecting the Democratic we'll express for other people of West Virginia\nI I Do think that he is the poll showed that mostly most people at the party Kavanaugh here however um I think he did it entirely politically because he's up for reelection and thirty days and he he has under fifty percent of the polls right now so I think I think he did it to the way the Republican base\nWell but when you use a politician to being a politician or the that's not much of a surprise visit\nI think he did it to play the Republican base\nYeah we'll but when you use a politician to being a politician\nIs though that's not much of a surprise visits I mean he's running for reelection\nYeah of course and I did do that to him yesterday or on Thursday\nWe'll tell tell us about those meetings because you were you you met with him I guess for two hours on Thursday right\nYeah we did so we had a group of women who sat in his office on Monday and they were actually arrested a\nHit about nine women arrested they sat there for like ten hours listening to him they had a conference call with him on Monday\nThat didn't really go well on Thursday we had a group of about fifty go up to D.C and we met with him on a two separate occasions the first one we had probably about twenty twenty women there and twenty women men and teenagers and we told stories of\nSexual assault and ask them how they plan to vote and he their way he he was very engaging the conversation he had to step out of the room but did it I got back from like ... you you feel like you were hurt and received with respect\nAbsolutely yeah he was extremely gauge he has got a question um I Do believe that Joe mansion cares for West Virginia I just don't think that it's reflected in this decision\nDoes you're probably continue if a judge Kavanaugh is confirmed brothers to\nOur fight does continue so uh as far as the Senate goes we it he kind of knew that he had us he kind of had a because at the other options Patrick Morrisey has done terrible thing for West Virginia he's a big proponent of the opioid crisis\nAnd so he kinda runny nose and believe in opioid addiction\nHe doesn't but he was a lobbyist for big pharmaceutical in West Virginia I he's our current attorney general and he's just terrible he's got Trump's endorsement and uh he's just a bad guy and I think he knows that\nDemocrat ... vote and this is old your opinion with me underscore this is my\nOpinion do of course this is my opinion yes of course\nAnd I think he knows that Democrat or they're ... so this is your opinion with me underscore this is my\n... of course this is my opinion yes of course um\nSo yeah I think he believes that that he's still going to have the Democrat though and that he wants to get the Republicans as well well it does continue or yeah so we're working on I'm working at a statewide to change things we've got a constitutional amendment on the ballot to ban abortion and Joe Manchin that we all have to get out and vote against that which we are doing\nWell if if it sounds as if you have accepted senator mansions vote for what it is and and still support among the great many issues and I I've got to tell you this this sounds very civilized and democratic to me\nI'm trying to play the long game I reluctantly as support has because I think the I think Morsi's worst choice mansion does still support us on the AC a and tax reform

the series is going to be having seen them since two thousand four when the red Sox did the miraculous comeback coming back from three games down\nAnd obviously the red Sox and the Yankees for the first time in their history both when a hundred games in the same season and last night was a battle that I was there and it was it was one of those types of games where it looked like a blow out the red Sox are up five nothing and then all of a sudden here come the Yankees simply because this is exactly what these teams are the red Sox have the better starting pitching\nThe Yankees have the

and I think they're the best team top to bottom of the best team in the line of the best team\nWith the best combination of relief pitching and starting pitching and they're scary and all of a sudden they're starting to look like champions again even though for a lot a lot a lot of the season they weren't quite into it but they're that good that they can sort of flip the switch and they seem to have done that\nBut what about the Dodgers they to stretch shut up against the Atlanta Braves\nAnd yeah this is interesting because nobody seemed to be any good in the national league this year nobody
