Charlotte Gallagher in London thank you so much\n\nIn little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and truly local concerns\nAnd that saying something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me All right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave or what are you seeing state to state well\nIt is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of the state legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for ...\nDoesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat might have said\nThey're just gonna maybe vote just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidate\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats in any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two states are really important and twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads are the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix her car when it bumps into a particularly bad bottle\nAnd if the situation will reverse would Republicans be hammering the same issue\nYeah I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but their slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip and one or both what's his story\nIn Connecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities\nAnd it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate which is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in a state that's in as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything\nYeah the taxes are a big issue there to\nAre a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases have changed a lot of a kinetic\nThe taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about uh how a democratic tax increases have changed a lot of uh Connecticut residents away that's a common theme that I think we hear in a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nThere is something pivotal at stake here though um other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up in twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs in a lot of these states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships there'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two weeks\nAre going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nWe'd Wilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much\nThank you forty five\nYears ago this

Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU who's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized visit we reached him earlier this week and asked him to explain\nWe use identity sometimes in a in a very good way we use identity for example we use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but\nI think that we can overuse identity we can bring identities in when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them and were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other white people to different from each other\nSo that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best still matters in the world whether you're a man or woman or black or white and so on but I think we can take 'em too seriously and many political context I'm\nThe most important thing isn't that that is to say it may be that the most important thing for them as they should be able to get kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who is best for that isn't necessarily the kind of the best view on on the ground so you have to balance it out\n[noise] what is the role of identity and politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talk about it without either alienating or collapsing\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should answer your question directly gingerly carefully [laughter]\nDating or collecting I think they need I I Would say I mean I should answer your question directly gingerly castle I I think you can easily go wrong\nHere I mean one of the things that the president is currently doing is mobilizing identities in a very divisive way and that leads down a terrible road because once you've created essay racial divisions\nIt takes an awful lot of effort to heal the wounds and um it's a temptation for politicians all around the world and and you know well through the ... century they're drawing people together a through making them feel shared hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is political identities right now the labels conservative and liberal\nAre associated with sort of tribal feelings of a very intense kind it makes the country increasingly difficult to govern that means that every time\nSomebody of one identity wins everybody of the other identity thinks of themselves as having lost something profound and that means that you lose the sense that in an election we vote and then whoever wins or we sort of gather behind in order that they should run the country\nCan send to you I mean I'm hearing a real concern and identity and and the politics around it has been weaponized and certainly\nI think I think it is worrying I mean look the fact is in our country today is that we're more divided around identities then we are around policies\nSo that if we just stopped using our identity divides we could probably come to reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things immigration abortion there's a whole bunch of things where there's a sort of sensible middle ground\nBut it's not available to us because the people who are most engaged in politics I think that every concession is not coming together\nBut it's not available to us because the people who are most in ... I think that every concession is no coming together but losing\nLosing to the other side\nBut in order to get voters politicians have to appeal to certain identities because it's it's about making sure that your bases satisfied making sure that your base will turn out to the polls making sure that they are excited about the issues that are there and and that you feel like you're a part of a common cause\nHere by the question is whether you could do that with our board you co wrote me recognizing identity\nAnd I think you can I think you can talk for example more about the actual policies democracy needs the capacity for compromise and turning everything into an identity is who makes it very hard to compromise\nKwame Anthony Appiah is a professor at New York University His latest book is the lies that bind me thinking identity thank you very much for your room of\nAmerica's Test kitchen is celebrated as a reliable source of advice for home cooks they test tools techniques and recipes before making recommendations on a TV show in magazines and cookbooks now for the first time America's Test kitchen is taking that know how to the youth\nAnd the complete cookbook for young chefs NPR's Lynn Neary recently visited a young chef as she tried out a recipe with some help from an expert\nEight year old Lucy Gray is wide eyed and vibrating with anticipation when her dad Paul opens the door to greet me and Mali burned bone editor in chief\nOf the night she so good to meet you where Lewis I\nLose he likes to cook and has helped make some meals for her family but this is the first time she will cook something by herself the cookbook has more than one hundred recipes and Lucy has chosen to me\nMakes them meals for her family but this is the first time she will cook something by herself the cookbook has more than one hundred recipes and Lucy has chosen to make one pop pasta with quick tomato sauce we begin assembling everything we need olive oil crushed tomatoes in a as she takes up basal Lucy decides to taste it\nStill goes what are the\nDiesel [laughter] at\nOne point while reading the recipe Lucy stumbles over an abbreviation she doesn't quite understand\nAll this is one table\nToo that's at that says T SP which was the abbreviation for peace and this is one capital T that the people in and let me ask you something mind at the beginning of the book you talk about sort of the language of the kitchen yet recall it\nDecoding kitchen speak there's so many words and these recipes that you just don't know until you hooked on it so it is a lot about understanding the foreign language that comes with cooking\nThe cookbook lays out the basics with everything from photographs of tools and equipment to instructions on how to measure men's and chop this recipe calls for a chopped onion the first and has to be peeled\n[noise] some [noise] like let's say\nThe cookbook emphasizes safety in the kitchen which Birnbaum demonstrates went shopping the onion\nIt can be hard to make this first caught so yeah and see how my fingers are like it's all ... and that means that my fingers are never going to get accidentally under the night so this is the safe way to hold and I had a anything prep were\nFrom northern Arizona university states Arizona Public radio NPR News and classical music on cayenne a use eighty eight point seven Cy staff\nKP you beat Ninety One point seven sidestep paying eight eight Ninety seven show low paying a dean Ninety One point seven page K.

proving to be a loyalty tested the kingdom or is there any opposition in the region\nAnd governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty at many of them issuing statements supporting

role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist or without their intelligence services leaking the information it's also a major player in the middle east in American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very Calcutta the terms of how they're released information really to extract as much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they played it very smart or they are looked like the hero in this story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison or many of them are are journalists as well and activists and others and so there clearly not a the beacon of liberal democracy in the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically\nDefending a you know uh this one man driven and of course uh it really struck thing I think an important\nImportant important price or from the Saudis

Charlotte Gallagher in London thank you so much\n[noise]\nIn a little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and truly local concerns\nAnd that saying something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me All right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave or what are you seeing state to state\nWell it is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of the state legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and goes candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat\nMight have said they're just going to maybe vote just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidate\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats at any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two states are really important and twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads of the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix her car when it bumps into a particularly bad bottle\nAnd if the situation will reverse would Republicans be hammering the same issue yeah\nBecause you've got to spend the money to fix your car when it bumps into a particularly bad potholes\nAnd if the situation will reverse would Republicans be hammering the same issue\nYeah I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but their slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip in one or both what's his story\nIn Connecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities\nAnd it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate\nWhich is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in a state that's in as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yeah the taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases\nHave changed a lot of uh Connecticut residents away that's a common theme that I think we hear a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nThere's something pivotal at stake here though on other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up and twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were

weekend edition from NPR News I'm Luke Garcia Navarro good morning it's been a long road to get to this milestone in Afghanistan there were twenty five hundred candidates trying for nearly two hundred and fifty seats\nI'm Talking about parliamentary elections there first in eight years\nAnd vote has been bloody with many reports of violence at polling stations including a suicide bomber in the capital Kabul dozens or dead but the vote went on to talk about the significance for America's longest running war is a reporter Jennifer ... she is in Kabul thanks for being with us going to be here live\nSo were people able to turn out to vote in large enough numbers or did the violence keep them away\nYou know despite threats from Islamic state and from the Taliban more than three million Afghans turned out on Saturday and today there are people are lined up waiting to vote\nCertainly some people will not get the opportunity to do that right now we've really only seen numbers from the big cities and it's the rural areas where people are most it threatened maybe might feel most intimidated\nTell me a little bit about the violence what happened the\nSingle attack was a suicide bomber here in Kabul or the suicide bomber trying to get into a polling station was stopped by policemen he detonated his explosive vest outside\nOr in the north there was shelling including Jews we know

stations so not by far the cleanest elections\nThe Afghan governance announced its arrested a ... a few dozen people for fraud and intimidation they're trying to make sure that Afghans will have faith in this election\nOne of the more hopeful signs though this time around is the number of women running right over four hundred what will\nThis mean they are guaranteed sixty eight seats in the parliament for each province\nOf but I think the the real key has been the number of young people running as you said Lou there hasn't been parliamentary elections in eight years the current parliament has been a frustration to many almost a symbol of corruption and patronage that has held Afghanistan back\nAnd it was really interesting to see election observers at the polls there were four hundred thousand of them many of them there to support their own candidates to make sure that their candidates got a fair shake\nIn these elections the fact that so many young people and non politicians were willing to put themselves out there I think shows that there's a new generation of Afghans trying to change things and just\nWith the shooting and killing a police officer who was

and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region and she'll be with us\nMy pleasure or the development of this story playing out in the middle east it is it proving to be a loyalty tested the kingdom or is there any opposition in the region\nAnd governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty or many of them issuing statements supporting a both Saudi Arabia and ah and king Solomon of course uh the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of\nA lot of fear a lot of worried that the people who are activists journalists dissidents\nUm and those who may be speaking their opinion and they in fact to be threatened now are there is a real great too I think in the air amongst those are members of civil society\nTrying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist or without their intelligence services leaking the information it's also a major player in the middle east an American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very calculated the terms of how they're released information really to extract this much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they made it very smart or they are looked like the hero in this story a ironically they have you know forty thousand people in prison and many of them are are journalists as well and activists and others so there clearly not a the beacon of

this role of of basically defending a you know uh this one man driven and of course uh it really struck thing I think an important\nImportant important price or from the Saudis which has yet to be determined I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey a what would what game are they playing I mean why expose Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated debt\nOr they need they need hard currency date foreign exchange the need investment they need investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by\nOther allies or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the INS is very clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with with with liquidity\nI and and just briefly we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult uh I Believe for uh the u._s. government who wants to impose sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looks like a much more menacing actor in the region\nThat was best known many a political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so much thank you on September
