are the reason or reasons these applications are being held up\nSo these are applications Georgia's system has flagged for airs there's this controversial process here called exact match which compares voter registration applications to other government databases so basically works like this right you have\nThere's just like one letter off on your application maybe it's missing a hyphen or there's like a misspelling maybe a poll or a an election worker inputs the information wrong if something like that happens\nThen the application is frozen and people are not put on the voter registration list but I Want to make something really clear and all of this if the application is flagged if it goes on the pending list you can still vote or you can clear up the problem by going to the polling place with your photo ID\nAnd then you can still vote I mean that's about that's the bottom line civil rights groups though are saying well that's not enough you know this is going to

and they say that this violates the voting rights act and the constitution and actually last year the civil rights groups challenged a similar policy to this under ... office they made similar complaints\nAnd there was a settlement ended up ending the policy but then earlier this year Republicans in the ... the Republican controlled state legislature passed a law\nThat was basically the

incredible model and like most Americans she just had\nA rough patch and she was not comfortable talking about a lot of those rough patch she had me when she was a sophomore at Jackson State university and she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty and Jackson was home\nAnd books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life I think her from a ride on the practice that I still have now\nBut that rarely practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps and a lot of the chair that I think she probably did not want me to write into\nAnd we do have to get to that don't we go to the outside world you're\nNineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty and Jackson was home and books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life I think her from a ride on the practice that I still have now\nBut that rarely practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps an all out of the terror that I think she probably did not want me to write into [noise]\nAnd we do have to get to that don't we face up\nTo the outside world your mother or progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black when we're dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications\nUm she was in an abusive relationship she did not make much money she was dealing with\nWhat I Would call like shards of abuse and you know when I was around nine or ten\nShe started to 'em with me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looking at me because when I Would face or police or why people would be even a harsher and those beatings just I think started to get progressive Lee worse\nAnd I think that the beating my mother was taken from life from our town and her partner also started to get progressive way worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another and we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state was doing us\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the ... from your mother the ... the she endured\nAll of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you one of the things that I was going to say\nFrom our town and her partner also started to get progressive way worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state was doing a ...\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the beat in June to or from your mother the ... the she endured all of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOne of the things that I was going to say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cost just traumatic thing but I Will say the layers of\nParticular kinds of abuse really personal instructional I think led to me\nEating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bullying and a lot of other big kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and that a lot of really big women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding\n'em ending eventually I started to start as a way of attempting to hide and symptom to disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of there between of which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something right\nThe running was terrible I run two hours in a more than two hours at night and I play a lot of basketball and the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days and has a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lot of times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body and pushing my body and pushing my body I could disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police us about it kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller like I Would be okay like people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen\nThat night and I play a lot of basketball and the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days and there's a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lotta times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body and pushing my body and pushing my body I could disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police\nAs I get kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller like I Would be okay like people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years so my body broke\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how does that enter your life\nOh man I'm by the time and my body broke my body literally wrote from overused and wrote from not sleeping in a row from not eating the only thing I turn to their brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I made from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and\nIt was hard to write about that harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I talked about in the book\nBecause you were implicated in this in a way you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWell I'm definitely the perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame when we show people and tell people that\nThe money that we are able to make\nWe aren't able to keep right\nAnd especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win though I told myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home that two hours feeling absolutely\nLike trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood\nAnd so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame\nWhen we show people and tell people that\nThe money that we are able to

trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood\nMy mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually still the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse the addiction the gambling on both sides of my family is something that we still\nCan't really honestly talk about\nI don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now what do you care what she thinks\nOh I Love my mother's death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be a writer or read or a teacher at my mother and not love me enough to instill a practice at an early age\nAnd this book in some way is like her investment coming full circle she really believes that reading and writing can save and I don't know if that's true but I Know I'm a writer a norm in American reader and I wanted to use my words to try to talk to her and tried to tell her that we can be better\nWe can be better if we give ourselves a

bottom line civil rights groups though are saying well that's not enough you know this is going to create longer lines confusion and it could discourage people from voting yeah\nAnd of course will underscore this at a time when there's when there's concern about not just conventional ... vote fraud as we've known it in this country but but perhaps foreign powers somehow invading the voters

Catholic\nWell up until this point in my life it's all I had really known as far as religion goes I I Believe and most of what I was taught growing up um it always resonated with me the messages that they present to the congregation I think that having a faith has made me a better person\nAnd I think it has not effect on a lot of people\nHow did you feel when you found out this summer about the abuse of children that was going on in Pennsylvania ... not far from places you knew\nYeah it hurt reading the report\nBecause I was reading about these Paris is that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up you would hear kids joke about oh you know priests molesting kids and what not but I never knew that there was actually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion\nAnd then I didn't learn honestly until recently\nActually uh anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion\nAnd then I didn't learn honestly until recently that the abuse scandal is something that was real and something that the world is known about sense what I think it was the early to thousands whenever the Boston Globe or whatever the newspaper is broke the story I I didn't know that that was the thing\nIt wasn't something I'd ever been exposed to so I wasn't really aware of the fact that this is a problem that was going on in my church you know it's it's on ...\nAnd a church or face\n[noise] I think that's a difficult\nThing to answer I Will say that it has hurt my face in the Catholic Church I don't think it is actually hurt my personal religious faith I'm just starting to see less of a connection between what I Believe in the teachings of the Catholic Church\nMash did you grow up with anyone do you know anyone who uh\nWho has their own story to tell no I did not fortunately nothing like that ever happened to me or anybody I was close with\nDo you think the church cared more about it shelters and institution and less about the people who had been harmed\nIt certainly seems like that to me and that's one of the most disheartening things about it I Do not think that the church leadership has done enough to make up for\nRelease of disabuse seeing bishops in people whose names are plastered up on church buildings\nBack in my area hearing that they spent years pushing this stuff away and and

book heavy an American memoir\nKiss a layman who wrote the award winning novel long division and there's a contributing editor of Oxford American at a professor of English and creative writing\nAt the University of Mississippi joins us now from Oxford, Mississippi thanks so much for being with us thank you so much for wanting to talk to when someone says do you tell me about your mother [laughter] it's not a simple question is it\nOh not at all not at I look forward to it that my mother is incredible model and like most Americans she just had\nA rough patch and she was not comfortable talking about a lot of those rough patch she had me when she was a sophomore at Jackson State university\nAnd she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty and Jackson was home\nAnd books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life I think her from a ride on the practice that I still have now\nBut that ride all the practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps and a lot of the terror that I think she probably did not want me to write into [noise]\nWell um [noise] and we do have to get to that don't we face to the outside world your mother or progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black when we're dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications um she was in an abusive relationship she did not make much money she was dealing with\nFickle prognostications um she was in an abusive relationship she did not make much money she was dealing with\nWhat I Would call like the shards of abuse and you know when I was around nine or ten she started to\nUh with me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looked at me because when I Would face or police or why people would be even a harsher and those beatings just I think started to give progressive Lee worst\nAnd I think that the beating my mother was taken from life from our town from her partner also started to give progressive way worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another and we didn't really know how to talk about what the world in our state was joined us\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the baby in June to read from your mother the ... the she endured all of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOne of the things that is I don't want to say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cause just traumatic thing but I Will say the layers of\nParticular kinds of abuse really personal and structural I think led to me\nEating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bully and then a lot of other kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and that a lot of really big women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding 'em\nAny new eventually I started to start as a way of attempting to hide and the symptom to disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of there between a which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something right\nThat the running was terrible I run two hours\nThere between a which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something\nRight now the running was terrible I run two hours in a more than two hours at night and I play a lot of basketball in the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days and has a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lot of times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body and pushing my body and pushing my body I can disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police it kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller\nLike I Would be okay like people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years so my body ...\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how did that Andrew your life\nOh man I'm by the time and my body broke my body literally wrote from overused and wrote from not sleep and it broke from not eating the only thing I turn to that brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I made from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and\nIt was hard to write about that harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I talked about in the book\nBecause you are implicated in this in a way you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWell I'm definitely in a perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi and so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame when we show people into people that the money that we are able to make\nWe aren't able to keep right and especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win the white told myself that's exactly what I was going to do I was going to create\nHalf way through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win the white told myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I Want it to drive back home that two hours feeling absolutely like trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood\nMy mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually still the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse the addiction the gambling both as my family is something that we still can't really honestly talk about\nI I don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now what do you care what she thinks\nOh I Love my mother to death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be\nA writer or read or a teacher at my mother not love me enough to instill\nA practice at an early age and this book in some way is like her investment coming full circle she really believes that reading and writing can say\nAnd I don't know if that's true but I Know I'm a writer a norm in American reader and I wanted to use my words to try to talk to her and tried to tell her that we can be better\nWe can be better if we give ourselves a chance to walk honestly together and that's that's what I tried to do with this boat\nHere say lemon his book heavy and American memoir thanks so much for being with us thank
