I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't end or in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode a contains some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship is about the pressures that lead you to say no don't don't see that we have to say that we don't but we have to and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nHere on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping so we must but we ... it is on the radio yeah so she's got kids with the you may want to make someone on yeah anyway the story comes to us from producers Simon after so let's start can we start in two thousand\nThis is on the radio yeah so she's got kids with the you may want to make one on yeah anyway the story comes to us from producers Simon at her so let's start can we start in two thousand they sure about what the song yes please [noise]\n[laughter]\nSo uh December twenty seventh sunny Saturday morning a that this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo Alto and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of [noise]\nFacebook [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] it was a humble gathering is a a few dozen women and babies\nThat right there are you the organizer\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering I'm Stephanie Miller\nAnd what what are you calling me and I'm a\nNurse in as in like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken of themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would uploads those photos to Facebook in these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this they want and Facebook to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [noise]\n\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that the small\nPeaceful protest will turn out to be this morning a face off on\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that this small\nPeaceful protest would turn out to be this morning a

defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in election meddling or data breaches\nBut but rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of them free speech [noise]\nViolence against Rohingya Muslims what we can say in what we can't say\nThat again by this iconic photograph that we can see and what we can see it let Mueller right kids in front of me\nOn the Internet\n\nThank you Mr Chairman\nMr sack of arc I got to\nDo you subjectively prioritize or censor speech\nCongresswoman or we don't think about what we're doing is censoring speech but there are types\nWhat what really grabbed me was was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text documents that dictates what I can say on Facebook where you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of us can say on Facebook digital document it's about fifty pages if you've printed off\nAnd diet in bullet points and it's been statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the glow which made me wonder like\nAnd if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the glow\nWhich made me wonder like what are these rules how were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test so ah let's start back or on that morning and two thousand eight the morning that you could argue started it all\n[laughter] [noise]\n'cause in the building right behind those protesting mothers there was big group of Facebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do\nI'm cool so if I so I'm just going to switch and just\nRead so I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees when one of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nIn now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought in to read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees\n[noise] All right ready so\nAt the time when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called this site integrity team again keep in mind this was in the early\nTo thousands seismic changes this week and the Internet hierarchy this was like the deep dark path nice face time is now the most visited website in the U.S Facebook had somewhere in the neighborhood of ten million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids\nAnd so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of conference like room with a big long table each\nIn front of their own computer and things that come up onto their ... to Facebook and on Lake meaning like Iowa users saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like a reporting a piece of content that you think\nTo come up onto their ... to Facebook and on Lake meaning like Iowa user saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like a reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards\nThis is Kate ... she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing\nAnd and she says in those early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of content and then [noise] that content along with an alert would would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen most of what you were saying was either naked people blown off heads or\nThings that there was no clear reason why someone had reported because it was like a photo of a golden retriever and people are just annoying and\nEverytime something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at the computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take it out and at the time if you didn't know what to do\nYou turn your pod leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and ask what do I do at this and they would either have seen it before and explain it to you where are you both wouldn't known you Google some things\nThat really was just kind of an ad hoc approach\nWas there any sort of written standard or any common standard uh what kind of\nThey had a set of community standards that they at the end of the day they were just kind of that was one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry the guidelines were really one page long there are one page long\nAnd basically all of this page said was nudity is bad so as Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad take it down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breast feeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down until\n[laughter] rise up fight for the lights them read anything\nAnyway now a dozen or so people in front\n[noise] rise up fight for the lights that rather move\nAnyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but according to Stephanie mirrored those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who had organized ironically enough through Facebook\nSo to coincide with the live protest they just ... you know typed up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse in two for one\nDay changed their profile avatar to an image of\nBreastfeeding and then change their status\nTo the title of our group a Facebook breastfeeding is not a scene and pick caught on the social networking website is under fire for it and tell them the on photos of women threatened meeting their children taught him twelve thousand members participated and the media requests started pouring and\nA half percent benefiting and I I did hundreds of interviews for print Chicago Tribune Miami Herald time magazine New York times Washington\nThere is a floor in the building where faith but supposedly a source of content moderators itself\nAround twenty ten they decided to start outsourcing some of this work to places like manila where you just heard reporter ... as well as\nI mean I Would guess that there are people voting Dublin where we sent reporters Guerra stuck scene where they get there still is Facebook treats cooked everybody fever English and we sent\nThem there to try to talk to some of these people to for living sit at a computer and collectively click through around a million flag bits of content to pop up on the screen every day wow what we were just curious like what's what's that\nLike [noise] well I thought I'm going to ask you some questions are generally we found out pretty quickly ... none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nUm so there's a lot of reading for me happening\nA lot about the work I work at a put down a surge buddies you know sorry\nI Know your life in fact most\nPeople wouldn't even admit they work for the company like what's the is there something wrong about being in like an NDA that they find well yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing are willing to talk do you want to be named her you know\nAndy aid ... so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] are willing to talk to me do you want to be named her do you know where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather do that that's the only find you know I just landed history I don't want to have\nTo explain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to ah admit that they worked for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nAttract flew about ...\nWine several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worst so that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers and the company which if your Facebook you might want\nYeah I I signed up to monitor traffic I let us just given the nature of the job\nThat you know I really you know you don't really know the impact that that's going to have I I tell you guys are so\nThis guy I talked to he he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year he jumped to his desk every morning put on his headphones\nLike ignore ...\n... I guess I guess like a forty five ... every day it was just an edge and officials and it's just such a\nSize five thousand a day you just said yeah I was like it was a lot of case he\nHe said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every\nThree or four seconds [noise] wow all day long all day eight hours a day [noise]\n... ... if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nThat's just like that where they um it's too I told us to extradite\nClicking through he came across unspeakable things\nThey all got ... uh that's too I think the ... X rated or\nClicking through he came across unspeakable things\nHad to explain to you know get squashed by attached to you know people in cages in drought cherry like\n[noise]\nThirteen year old girl I was having sex with an eight year old boy and it's not just lots it's over I don't like over\nWhen did you did this like keep you up at night as you do that is\nAbsolutely absolutely um it can be up at night uh he'd\nCatch themselves thinking about these videos and photos when he was trying to relax you had to start voting things\nThat they were there were specific like I said I couldn't watch it was like OK says Clinton's ... life I laugh at us it was like okay I was like I had to wear exploding like nope nope I have to walk away\nAnd I just I had to I I chose to real [noise] I I saw that I it's it's classic adjusted\nDifferent moderator I spoke to described it as being the worst side of humanity\nYou see all of the stuff that you and I\nDon't have to see because they're going around playing cleanup yeah what a job well yeah and it and it's worth noting that are more and more of this work is being done in an automated fashion particularly with content like a Gore or terrorists propaganda\nOr that they're getting better automate that they got the uh through computer vision they're able to detect hallmarks of of other terrorists video or of a gory image and uh with terrorist propaganda they now\nTake down Ninety nine percent of it before anyone flags it on Facebook\nAnd uh with terrorist propaganda they now take down Ninety nine percent of it before anyone flags it on Facebook\nBut a\nMoving on to our second story here that there is a type of content that they are that they're having an incredibly hard time or not just automating but even getting their rules straight on the ... that surrounding sheet speech\nOh good more or less that's coming out well but it will be laughter really there will be comedians there will be a joke to readers hey All right okay

radiolab we're back\nWith our story about Facebook and free speech and we just want her mind you guys are those viewers tuning in this episode contains graphic content some strong language which must in order for us to make a point but but we do warn you that you if you don't want to hear this kind of thing to do with their kids in the room might wanna sit it out yeah you'll get back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook is trying to do two competing things at once\nThey're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe in ways that are fair and consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April fifteenth twenty Thirteen strike\nCorrelate Rhonda Marilyn but sorry but if I had him up thank you I mean how can break we add some breaking news uh otherwise I wouldn't cut you off so abruptly\nMonday the fifteenth twenty Thirteen just before three

several desk staring at the computer screens watching the news ...\nThis has occurred just in the last half hour or so I have\nMemories of of watching some of the coverage shelling new images just release of the Boston bombings I remember seeing the photo published on line and it wasn't long after that\n[noise] someone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the order of events here are a little fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly\nFlorida's going viral [noise]\nAnd we realized we're going to have to deal with it this image is spreading like wildfire across their platform is it appears to be way outside the rules they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together sat down in a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like should we allow it or should they take it down according to the rules are in this photo you could see you could definitely see bone\nAnd so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yep however half the ... says\nNo the other people are saying this is newsworthy essentially this photo is being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which immediately received\nBack well I was saying that what we prided ourselves on was not making those calls and there are ...\nWhich immediately receipts pushed back\nWell I was saying that what we prided ourselves on was not making those calls and there are exceptions there is either either mistakes were improvements\nWe made the guidelines for moments like this do which the other side shoots back\nOh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe is publishing this all over the place and we're taking a downed like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense here like humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nHow how do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of\nThe stuff in other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally cleared they decide to take the photo down but before they can pull the lever\nWord starts making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources and executive ... sent down in order we were essentially told make the exception\n\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason is the photo stance you're not taking this down\nYes yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook has just become a publisher ... but they don't think maybe they have but they've made a news judgment and just willy nilly they've become a news organization yeah\nAnd this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like is Facebook is sort of collective scrap book for us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you want or yeah it is it now a news organization strength parents\nLet me let me get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question\nOr yeah it is it now a news organization strength parents they let me\nLet me get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get the one final question to kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook\nIs and this question has been popping up a lot recently in fact it even came up this past April when soccer bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so which are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher\nCenter this is a I view us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology and I said you're responsible for your conscience which makes that kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and built products\nBasically ... and others that the company or arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the well Facebook\nCurrently sits on this little idyllic legal island where are they can't be held liable\nFor much of anything they're subjected to a few regulations however were were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization\nThat could change but setting that aside what what what really strikes me about all of this is is here you have a company that really\nUh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective is possible\nAnd can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound than what people find interesting or important what what people find newsworthy ...\nHe'll give and I'll give you an I'll give you a great example of this or that happened just six months out\nWhat what people find newsworthy ... they'll give and I'll give you an I'll give you a great example of this or that happened just six months after the
