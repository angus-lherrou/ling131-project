N. Y. [noise] hey I'm ... Robert Krulwich radiolab and today [noise]\nLanguage that we'd be but uh there's descriptions that may not be suitable for young children or sensitive listeners so please be for one way you\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nI'm listening to radio lab\nRadio prominently W. N. Y. [noise]\nHey I'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today to [noise]\nThey're going to start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times he's a guy we've had on the show before and say something high [laughter]\n[laughter] okay I think it's good All right\nWhere we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning Yeh started again what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nIs growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and\nKilled when that became a national\nThere was a lot of belly again and press how many people do is they killed in the United states about by the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire ants Amir arrived hasten Harris than about John become sort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble and processing now like number one\nIs there a is a trend in one way or the other or police shooting more black people and white people just very simply you know the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part\nI said that that that doesn't exist somewhere\nStruck me at the time that like what what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire near rice and Harris sand in the journal nature and will become sort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing that like the number one\nIs there a is a trending one way or the other or police shooting more black people and white people just very simply you know the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody attracts these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part\nI said that that that doesn't exist somewhere within the police for an itself in the\nPolice department it does on the local level however it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers submitted for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally\nBut everything that's done so far is incomplete\nYou know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database most of them rely on media reports so the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public consciousness that's right so Ben and his editors thought\nLet's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented\nBirth birth study had Florida it's a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country in Florida has wonderful public records loss and\nLegally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places and ... and then sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\nThree hundred and eighty eight emails asking for five years worth of paper any paper generated

demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public records loss and legally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places and ... and sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\n... three hundred and eighty eight emails asking for five\nYears worth of paper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting now\nThis involves a year of work how many police departments getting lawyers involved as as a massive thing they're both probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nLike say then put together\nThe most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of flu show that\nA lot back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times oh it's just I'm right here to check it out yeah how many how many accidents you think you have sitting on this stuff is probably five thousand pages I have a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me sit six feet tall\nWe've got um broken down by county but you can see uh\nSo a or B county\nBooker aton Boynton Beach uh all the way through the\nAlphabet and you basically just have a all these uh manila folders with tons of papers in them spread across the entire desk\nIs a combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings represent\nEight hundred and thirty one shootings\nI Hope every shooting and the state of Florida and in six years time two thousand nine to ... us some fourteen [noise]\nSo we did was go through all of this material scrape each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team [noise]\nFolders with tons of papers in them spread across the entire desk\nIs a combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings represents\nEight hundred and thirty one shootings\nI Hope every shooting in the state of Florida in the in in six years time two thousand nine to two thousand fourteen [noise]\nSo he did was go through all of this material scrape each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team\nDidn't involve a an armed suspect wizard chase all the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people were hit by those bullets than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and build a database and um [noise]\nYou know hopefully draw some conclusions some lessons some solutions\nThis all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there are lots of link to it from our website radiolab dot org highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency that keeps track of the stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest and sort of counterintuitive a line in this the the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they've steady but a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd 'cause uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it seem like this is a a new and intense problem\nThe numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category and he says you know what you see like on the most basic level are are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side\nAnd is that the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they've steady but a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd 'cause uh you know past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it seem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category and he says you know what you see like on the most basic\nLevel are are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is the case we're not taking a gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence and the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds anytime of the shooting and in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases the whole suicide by cop which is where somebody who is usually a mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally person is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door\nAnd raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a weapon\nSo it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ... this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know\nThey're the news briefs that you see once or twice a week\nBut it was new to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto frontline and dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to bend central question what do the number say about race\nI think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black and that is a that is out of whack with ah the Florida\nPeople who cover police apparently know quite well you know they're the news briefs that you see once or twice a week but it was new to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto frontline and dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to bend central question what do the numbers say about race\nI think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black\nAnd that is a that is out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics\nAnd your what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nSouthern tells much right now but the breakdown between fake ... for their same demographics and it's that they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were\nCarrying a firearm nine percent had a\nBlade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest you know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent\nYou know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty the numbers themselves don't really get you very far percent six ... he says one percent of the more you here it's just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah you ... I mean [noise] I mean what's [noise] gets me is like the I don't know it's back to\nWhere we were and why we want to start this methane gas comes I still just moved by the single cases the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is [noise] I mean they're all written in this uh supplement investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler received a call on this as to\nSix kind of ... he says one percent of the more you here it's just like yeah this is only one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah I mean [noise] I mean what's what gets me is like the I don't know it's back to\nWhere we were and why we want to start this nasty nasty stuff still just moved by the single case the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is [noise]\nYou know [noise] I mean they're all written in this uh\nIt was a horrible thing and a very you know ten ten times a hundred times worse for his first wife children than it is for me\nI think it's a different thing when you're a person has killed by another human being and that human being is returned to the streets with a gun and a badge in a you know in a position of authority\nAnd this is something you do see impacts numbers even though the numbers themselves\nThey they can't really tell you whether or not a shooting with legally justified what is clear is that over eight hundred plus shootings even the shootings where the person was unarmed only one police officer has ever been charged and so it's it's this weird sort of like double grief yeah flick past and present at the same time\nLike you can't put it away because it's every day is another insults kind of right\nTo get into cars to brown\nAnd this is something you do see impacts numbers even though the numbers themselves\nThey they can't really tell you whether or not a shooting with legally justified what is clear is that over eight hundred plus shootings even the shootings where the person was unarmed only one police officer has ever been charged ... so it's it's this weird sort of like double grief yeah flick past and present at the same time\nLike you can't put it away because it's every day is another insults kind of right and it's been it's I'm\nUs have reached out wherever it's like ... veins something happened in you know here in Florida\nSo after the event ended up the community center crystal took a bunch of the mom they all got in their cars and drove over to this little gem shop\nJust like you guys do this after every every event or you know for no just won a trip to no good ones are\nAnd has been telling everyone involved in\nThis day and it just says her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nSo no we didn't know anything about this but figure this must be part of the different types of learning as a part of just hoping ... right right we all just simply trying\nOur way is the first of all gathered like\nProbably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because she wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief\nYou can either get the um the larger stage at certain point because it was talking to these two women and she just had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like some [noise]\nSon Andrew died in twenty four team so no we didn't know anything about this but they must be part of the different types of learning part of just hoping green right right we all just simply trying to find a way it was a crystal gathered like probably Fifteen of us into this\nTiny little store because you wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief you can either get the um the larger staged a certain point because it was talking to these two women and she just had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like\nThen I open my windows and I just knew when I go through my house she says this age comes her down you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to crystal [noise]\nMid sized one story house in the land and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin\nWhere the kitchen\n\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together they like they bring with them you know their own stories these stories of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\n\nAnd the night before they'd all gone out dancing together\nFrom earth wind and fire [noise]\n\nAnd now what we're doing instead of getting motel rooms again this is Natasha Clinton's we're starting to stay over eight inches of how we see each other head of couch you know a air mattresses it becomes like a huge sleep over and the rest of the policy\nThe night before they'd all gone out dancing together\nTo the summer's wildfire [noise]\n\nAnd now what we're doing instead of getting motel rooms again this is Natasha Clinton we start to stay over eight inches of houses\nWe sleep in each other bad on the couch you know a metric is it becomes like a huge sleep over in first of the pool and asleep for up talking you know getting to know each other you know some sort of bicyclists shows resources like therapy for\nFigures let in the past but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women just really stuck with me I Believe or add\nI'm Marlon promise to\nAnd it was when crystal let some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people here in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or brother or a child and we were basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grass so we usually the video that's\nMom's house probably over like right now\nAnd then the police caught up came behind him was probably right here\nAnd then the officer they hid 'em came in\nWe came in he came right here [noise]\n\nAnd that's why we call the execution of vegetables are because\nThat I Am then 'cause I'm when a when you know when they took him away in released and sit down and type of stuff we came back at us all you can smell it\nAnd then the police car that time behind him was probably right here\nAnd then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nCame in he came right here [noise]\n\nAnd that's why we call the execution of vegetable garden 'cause\nAnd all that but I I Am then 'cause ah when they when they you know when they took him away in released and sit down to type of stuff we came back here is all you can smell what's going on and so now like when you have any like it's it's not as it's not as bad now but just the association for when I'm quite onions and you get that smell like it just\nYou get those flat mhm\nHad just brings you right back here mhm\nAnd the twelve is just kind of stood there for a minute [noise]\n'cause those guys are ... the other one that started to cry\n\nAnd then you don't want me to uh take some yeah my ...\nA lot of what about the phone to me a couple of women had their phones man\n[noise]\nAnd it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera\nWith this sort of straight face a three to one\nThree two one\nTo uh take some yeah my find to be\nA lot of what about appalling to me a couple of women enemy their phones mine\n[noise]\nAnd it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera\nWith this sort of straight face a three to one\nThree two one\nThen we all started walking back up to the cars [noise]\nSharing that with us because I Know [noise]\nIt was up to the very least once a week\nAnd I three o'clock in the morning\nWhat I remember the and I used to tell you all the time how do you live so far away\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\nMy son's greatest about Fifteen minutes ... and where\nI visit home I have to go there all the time of course yeah of course how could you not\nThen I Know what you like you want to go take a chair\nSit there yeah\nAnd it's crazy because like if a listen it's a cemetery like a little bit further out\nAnd it's crazy you know about as like a certain time every\nAnd it's just a little white man in his chair everything like that I like he literally I think he does he like go have lunch with every day\nMy dad would be [noise] I don't know if you're in the way I like going on and all of that and it's a little white guy that's always sit down\nCourse how could you not\nThen I Know like you want to go take a chair\nSit there yeah\nAnd it's crazy because like if a if a cemetery like a little bit further out mhm\nAnd his credit you can go by there like a certain time every\nDay and it's this little white man we share everything like that but he literally I think he does he like go have lunch with every day\nI don't know if you if it's a way I like going on and all of that is a little white guy that's always sit not do\nHe take his chair I Can't hold my I Would I Do\nWith um [noise]\nSo the trip to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happen to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip [noise]\nCan either repeal it was some other Sandra Bland when she spoke at the Democratic national convention one years old\nShe was on stage with Michael Brown smother Eric Garner's mother\nI watched as my daughter\nWas lower than to the ground\nAnd it was around this time of the few these women started called themselves the mothers but\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in DC [noise]\n\nChewed on stage with Michael brands mother Eric Garner's mother\nI watched as my daughter\nWas lower than to the ...\nAnd is there understand that a few of these women started call themselves the mothers of the movement [laughter]\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in DC [noise]\n\nAnd it was weird because in this short amount of time\nThis thing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nOf felt like at the time a support group\nAnd suddenly become\nComing up and put it down a cop with a gun a man with a knife\nAnd a look at the razor thin life or death moment between them so stay with us\n\n\nThis shirtless black guy\nThat's the kind of talking on the cop or anybody can end this black man goes on race pretty big knife in his hand and he's walking towards the ... once\nYou start learning from crazy [noise]\nLike it gets closer and closer and closer and finally the cop when the ... the other officer out it was a refrain is behind him was his firearm out in the\nGuy is approaching approaching approaching approaching\nMe get within like ten feet of the cops and then\n[noise] the\nGuy was camp fires the case or the guy holding the Nike falls onto his back on to this like cement driveway still got the knife in his hand\n\nAnd the cop who's got a gun out he has over a kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabs him by the hand turns them over\nAnd then he changed central four cups and then\nThere may not if it's not a smart idea to have a nice coming out of the police\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why\n[noise] the guy with\nThe camp fires the case or the guy holding the Nike falls onto his back on to this like cement driveway still got the knife in his hand\n\nAnd the cop who's got a gun out he goes over a kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabbed him by the hand turns them over\nAnd then she became central four cups and then\nThere may not have it's not a smart idea to have a knife coming out of the police\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at\nMe you were lucky you didn't just shot on your best shot you want a guy you want to die [laughter] you can't die\nHe tells the officer was um Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police bullets can't kill\nTheir fan of counseling on T.\nV. to pick 'em up walk them over to the squad car with a man and the un\nSaid this is the thing that you guys will you use this video for what ... is one of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things\nYou know and and that's the points we hit home or the officers used time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans unicorn judge that one I mean you know you have to resort to deadly force right away to use verbal command first warn them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\n\nAnd it's important 'cause there are guys partner was holding a gun and have you heard this hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest of communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind\nAll right up and the guy leans into court judge that woman you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal command first warned them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\nAnd it's important 'cause the guys partner was holding a gun and have you heard this hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking I was a gunshot and fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest and communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead I mean it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek Derek isn't just a black\nMan shirtless with a knife in his hand when there was no connection there is a lot easier to see somebody as nameless faceless and I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that and establish some kind of or a poor that made the officer think\nOf how he's going to deal with this thing\n\nAnd actually after we finished watching the video and I was packing up she told me that just a couple of months after that incident\nMight get through the neighborhood if you want to miss it on the front step waves ... what are you doing man\nDid Derek does stupid\nSon of a bitch you and how close came to be in that wouldn't be back with his medication I wasn't doing drugs and he was is completely as normal as me and you are right now [noise]\nNow again are almost kinda like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona\nAt this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left\nLast say primary election among the winners ... just released his how foolish county sheriff like she would was elected sheriff of\nCounty [noise]\nWouldn't be back with his medication wasn't doing drugs and he was is completely as normal as me and you are right now\n[noise] now again uh almost kind of like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left\nWill last say primary election among the winner stay totally just please change his now ... county sheriff like shit would was elected sheriff of\nLinn county [noise] extremely\nWhich is the county that they told them each belongs to him and the other thing to mention is that a ... long says organization called her which is decrease executive research forum\nIt's this big coalition of police chiefs and a twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for the use of force and the number one principle rather than being something law and order law and order is\nThe sanctity of human life [noise]\nYou know just a month after ... put out those principles two of the biggest policing organizations in the world the icy pie International Association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against\nThese guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job and some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive\nConversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago huh I don't know man and just thinking about this like you've got these women\nWho uh I've become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who er\nGet more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that

are\nPossibly changing way policing is done in America or at least maybe slowly but cumulatively it does\nI hesitate to use this word but it does make it does feel like reason for hope right and that sort of felt the same way too but [noise]\nThere was this experience than I had read just realized how far [noise]\nHope has to go [noise]\nThat's coming up right after this break so stay to
