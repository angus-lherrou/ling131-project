story and under whose skin it also seems to have got yeah\nIt it just made me\nNot know whether to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started\nShirking Tracey my name's Jim Tracy and I'm an award winning journalist former newspaper guy for the post ... he's\nBeen reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the Adirondacks which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eighth Nineteen Seventy three for young people ages Eighteen to twenty three three men in a woman's go camping in the outer on ducks pulled off the road a aside road off route thirty\nThey made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up two towns and went to sleep for the night\nAnd on Sunday they you know woke up and about nine AM\nTo campers hurts somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they saw was his middle aged men peering into the tent\nLooked like a conservation officer you had a door with a feather on sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck and\nVery calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he got\nThe other campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing in semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen ah of killed before and I'll kill again\nI'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get cause someone to tell you the trees and he started marching in the case\nAnd said listen or killed before and I'll kill again\nI'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees\nAnd he started marching the kids off into the woods took him into the woods near a brook impair the two with him behind them are the kids of course we're scared out of their wits he pulled out some real basically he had he had each them tie\nThemselves you know as he pointed the gun at him and then the last one he tied so after we had the ... people died\nHe went back to the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip them blue skiing because the other three kids are spread out through the forest\nThey couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise] and then they heard filled with voice get really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happening to him\nWhat was happening with the man stabbing ... with his back and I\nUsed to have been five times and the cat\nAnd when this happened three of them in their panic were able to break loose and start running neck Fiorello ran to his car Carol in ... he ran through the woods [noise]\nBut the man caught one of them David Freeman he took the boy back to the campsite and he had um lay down in a ditch next to him\nTo kind of monitor the situation I guess so Freeman in um the killer laying in the chapter then our\nMen come men that the other two Cantor's the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert locals new there they came with rifles and of a sudden they spotted done a killer and Freeman laying down in the ditch and when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun is going to shoot\nAnd the manner the gun just kind of stood up\nCalmly and Cooley walked into the forest and us began what was it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning and about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road as you can see when the man huh\nThe largest manhunt state history here this morning and about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road as you can see when the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in state police standing by it was a scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today where you've broken down on manpower into a roving patrols men\nArmed with all kinds of weapons rifles shotguns bloodhound that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods\nThey eventually find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate and it comes back with an ID\nA thirty seven year old Robert Darrow Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York as a fugitive police are looking forward to today he was an ex convict he'd been in prison for rape ... seven years now armed with a thirty thirty rifle and nice and\nThe story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday how do you feel at night when the people got panic when you're all are well one of the doors are shorter ... people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving round here but people left the area so fast I don't hear that last night and the day before that they left their tense up they left\nBarbecue smoldering they left behind coolers so that the man has done what happened was Carol was able to use those camps in that food and those drinks to survive day after day the manhunt it's about four hundred men or\nThe police following the lead and that he had stolen car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on him\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August ninth Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest of the summer\nThat day a conservation officer named ... spotted gal\nDecent freeze or got big on something of that fact and scare started running ...\nSpotted Darrow these a freeze or drop your gun something to that effect and scare started running\nLow blocked fire four times got 'em in the back\nThe arm in the foot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time I saw a girl and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there but it you know took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\n\nSo they put them in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with him there and the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing [noise]\nBut you wouldn't talk\nAnd it's at this point that the story that I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that's so fascinating about this case this law professor release alarm and again he's\nThe conflict between what a good lawyer should do and what a good person should do in the situation\nAnd we are recording and so the guy at the center of this conflict was a man named Frank our money\nFrankly each arm and he\nRan to the lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or or money that's Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and solve it they use our money but it is er money\nA couple of months ago producer Simon Adler and I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York Missouri money's now in his eighties\n[noise] my name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for Robert girl um\nRetired [noise] my name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for Robert\nGirl um\nWhere I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like what how did this whole story start for you well were there just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nAway it was a fighter I like ... flights go fights I'd like standing up for the little guy\nAnd that's partly why he became an attorney\nWhen you're fighting a cage for defendants you're fighting this state and tyranny\nAnd he was doing really well he was well respected had a good reputation\nThen he met Robert De Niro yeah life you're strong to take him out you need a forty five and a or just had the feeling that this guy is dangerous and love of things are going to happen\nThis is a year before the manhunt Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank remembers he represented him at first on two pretty small things while I'm On\nThat Susan pets was in an era event of a\nClosed up mine shaft the mine ... mine ... about an hour south of the hospital ... federally run mixture and in that moment where you scared were you excited like oh you rub ... high but you're scared you're concerned for your your food for you to do\nIn fact at one point looking in the rearview mirror they got a little bit we thought we were being followed by the state police\nSo eventually they pull over get out of the car\nWent into one bar where one of France's bell jeez I'm lady friends was hanging out\nFor about thirty minutes bells you talked to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nAnd then we went up the back door [noise]\nTook of driving that lady friends car to try to lose too\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here\nDismissed as far as we can walk up to this old abandoned mine [noise]\nOut there last February with reporter Lauren my chemistry and Tom supervisor of Mariah Tom's 'cause if Ava system a road that goes to the miners are what is your up to them on [noise] it was this sort of hidden\nProvider of Mariah Tom's cause if Ava so that them a road that goes to the miners are what is your after the minds [noise] it was that sort of hilly area off the side of the road is this a\nTrail of her own or you're just\nA very icy that day this hair is used to be an old roadway [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hill is fairly cheap there were no leaves and all the trees were\nAnd I'm very skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that Armenian this is the only way they could've came in here\nThat so here we are in our Sunday suits and here we go trudging choose for is looking for the case [noise]\n\nSpent another ... works looking around [noise]\nWe found this was her van to well\nYou see the air shaft there they find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off you carefully this has given any such yeah you don't want to fly down in there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the whole So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you hope my feet and left me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak the shoe a blue sneaker [noise]\nAnd and a leg I said to myself this the bitch does it\nBlue sneaker [noise]\nAnd and a leg I said to myself this ... does it end he yells back up to Belgium kept me out of your\nMoney back up do\nEventually algae found the other body ... body she was in a cemetery where Guerra headset he left her\nBut our money wasn't there when ... founder\nSo what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls so let's play that out what what are your options shirt so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor\nThese are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right no you\nCan't you just can't we took you know to keep your confidences over ...\nUnder the current rules which have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality umbrella so you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that that is yeah it can be or we'll be right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there is no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up when even if they have hired detectives and even if local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that but there's\nFrightened and waking up when even if they have hired detectives and even if a local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that but there's no if the if the if the people are already dead than you do the lawyers ...\nThat's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role\nIn that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is is to to play the part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates even if everybody hates you even if\nMaybe you hate yourself a little bit you have to\nDo your job in that job is to be in the role of the person that fights as hard as they can for the client the lawyer is the agent of his client\nOnly only the agent of land or also a citizen and a member of the ... and part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double murder here and families seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens right is there a ... year building on on the side of ... just tell tale\nOf course soon I knew Mr hawk from going to lose his du da da da da da da da da da da and I knew him from sturgeon\nOne if you have to be a man I'm On a few ... the parents\nOf the family and yet you have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two more morality [noise]\n\nYou're caught between the two more morality [noise]\n[noise]\nSo now what does she [noise] coming up that hard spot gets even harder [noise]\nWe'll be right back

I'm A Rod's I'm Robert Krulwich is radiolab and now we should get back to our story from producer Brenna feral and when we left it there were where they were stuck right they do they knew this thing they knew the client was very guilty of something they'd found the bodies of these two girls and a no brainer what is it what what's their next move wild\nSo they decided to put the burden plea bargain\nTake this information to the prosecutor and say\nI have information that will help you solve some cases some cases yes and in exchange they want you to give me a better deal for my clients\nTo get ... into a mental hospital instead of a prison Oso right away they are going to use this as leverage that was the idea\nYeah you're going to give the moon and you're going to take a ... well\nThat's kinda gross you know yeah he's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from Frank perspective he's got this information\nAs a person he doesn't want to have to keep that secret so if he plea bargains then that's a way for him to get some closure for the family because he can give the information to the prosecution but he's also not selling out his client so report Jim Tracy again\nI Do to make a movie\nHe was just barely getting by for a little while I think the older the stress and pressure to ... to ...\nIn fact he has a heart attack um while this is all going on\nBut eventually the criminal charges are dropped and the ethical complaint is dismissed and the reason in the opinion of the court and the the state bar is that what Belgian our money did\nWhat they did was good exactly according to the law and my view is Frank our money is a you know real life hero I always say you know people so it's Meyer Atticus Finch and the difference between Atticus Finch in Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nLisa told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven is for the American bar association\nAnd Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nAnd Lisa told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven as for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility\nAnd there were about four hundred people in the room most of them lawyers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was love\nFeast does what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed that\nI don't go was here or there was a lawyer to do this job\nA ... I was a good lawyer\nWho saw I saw so art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and bell gee did a good body is case it's taught in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what people think what if what if what if\nPeople say so I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham just stand up um\nI agree um his duties to his client represents his client's best interest if you\nAnd in sitting in on these classes and in talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely as because professors can point to it they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n...\nFrom from the moment I started thinking about this story\n\nSo from from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the families\nInvolved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing their mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan ... mother\nSusan was the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing while she was camping with her boyfriend and she's who are money indulge you found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn the story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that you knew a lot of schools are teaching and and if you had any feelings or thoughts about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nI 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical class is\nTotally and comprehensible\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes\nTo do things in an ethical classes\nAnd comprehensible to me\nAnd the first that you heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you that I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they are trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal starting their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as this was happening\nYes and only oh my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew immediately and and went to the police station and uh\nWhen we were there sitting with the police men they received the policemen at the time that we were with received a phone call that the unease my daughter's boyfriend was his body was found and that's that's\nAll we knew and we never really had any updates and nobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was\nOr some authority I Can't even remember who was um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my\nMy father as a matter of fact I even went so far as to contact a psychic that's how how important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a totally lie a lawyer\nAnd as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a totally lie a lawyer\nMaybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months of horror and [laughter] and this is what is being taught and law schools\n[noise] so anyway\nJust to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professors law students there um when they approached this is it's with\nA lot of sensitivity and they are they're struggling with the pain they I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it\nAnd so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of um but you have a chance to communicate some of that um experience\nYeah well it's impossible to really communicate and words I made forty years later I'm Still\nI I ... and it's still a struggle to discuss this because\nYou don't ever go away as long as I live so\nI don't I guess\nI'm Wondering what we've been talking a lot of I'm sad stuff I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know\nThat you would want to share I don't know you don't have to but [noise]\nWell [noise] [noise]\nWhat can I say she was she did receive her degree passed you mostly ah we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University where it was too difficult for us\nAnd um [noise]\nAnd Danny what's her boyfriend had\nWay too difficult for us\nAnd what's your boyfriend had bad just that summer and get a full scholarship to harbor any uh graduated just before too\nAnd I'm sure to children had great future ahead of true and it's just a horrible tragedy\n\nIt's a horrible you know to be in the position\n[noise] I mean how do you release whose daughter would what excuses for protecting the person to killed or\nSnow justification you couldn't just apply in my mind\nI don't expect them to accept it\nBut that's the way it is\n\nUm I'm going to get just a minute of silence I hear that's okay\n\nUm I'm going to get just a minute of silence up here if that's okay [noise] yeah [noise]\n[laughter]", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "28"}
