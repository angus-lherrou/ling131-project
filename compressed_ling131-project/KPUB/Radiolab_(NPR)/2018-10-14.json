Bach which was a a hugely influential book in certain circles are published in ...\nThe university Bloomington uh you may know him as the guy who wrote ... Bach which has a a hugely influential book in certain circles are published in Nineteen eighty nine we actually got interested in and uh things are pretty startling levy\nBecause of an obsession of his which predates that sixteen I was sixteen year Nineteen sixty one\nI was taking a French literature class one day I came across this poem a tiny little about\nThe kind of sat right in the middle of the page like a long\nStint sausage sort of all the time you know free syllables per line so it was super skinny and twenty eight lines long and mom and it was delightful it was very cute and funny I fell in love with a poem immediately and memorized that I still not by heart and at\nHome is basically a get well card it's written by this guy ... who was a poet nearly Fifteen hundred at the court of queen\nAnd he wrote the palm for uh just queens daughter she was seven or eight and she'd gotten sick the flu or something and this poem was supposed to cheer her up and and I thought it was very sweet could you said in France let's just here at first yeah okay it's called\nA ... done was that in my lab to a sick demos ... so to speak it can lead to a sec young lady\n... done a little boom through new ... ... ... ... to beat them all ... to\n... see onto the top ... to ... to ... it ... on them for you to want something done I mean\nMy God it must have gotten so many checks and you know it's really exactly the opposite\nOh my God it must have gotten so many checks when you were I was really exactly\nThe opposite I was I was a ... [noise] [noise]\nOkay so he reads the boom files it away deep in the corner of his mind that's what about Twenty years he publishes his first [noise]\nThey become very popular and the\nPublisher decides to have it translates into the number of languages including French in that process which took years it\nPut me into the frame of mind thinking what kinds of crazy things can happen when you translate crazy texts and all of a sudden one day that home\nPopped into his mind and I said there is a challenge what is it what is the challenge okay what I meant was to say well here's the thing he says you've got this home mommy none of them doesn't look\nIf you just focus on the words that basically it's just this guy talking to a younger girl saying hello my dear I'm Sorry you're sick being sick like prison says ... piece of ... to open your doors get out into the world in order to get out of bed\nEat some jam Murphy too so you don't look so pale about and you lose your plump shaped pillow dog units are like get better here's to your good health\nDue to dwell on the boat and I mean young but just saying those words in English misses the whole spirit of the ... the\nTone the light hearted mess and and this is key for dug it also ignores the bones form it's wonderfully\nCatchy little sausage shape on the page the fact that the lines rhyme you know\nA B. B. C. C. D. D. and\nUh the first line mommy and young is identical to the last line I mean young to sort of has the feel of a ... it has the poets name in the middle of the poems loan to Vermont oh and I forgot did I say three syllables Pearl oh you didn't ... yeah or it's three syllables per line I mean that's crucial and then also twenty eight lines long so all\nFor ... did I say three syllables per lawyer you didn't ... yeah or it's three syllables per line I mean that's crucial and then also twenty eight lines long so all of those things added up to a set of constraints you might say on me\nSo Doug sat down and got to work and a quickly became embroiled in the question of like how do you translate this coming along the way\nEven began to make a little grids of possibilities for different lines of the problem for example vast sea onto the taboo ... like this line that basically says don't wallow in bed\nI had a lot of possibilities and I'll just read you the a little diagonal display here instead of spurting\nBlood in bed instead of burping in your bed instead of bursting out in instead of looking in your instead of hurtling out of instead of hurting there in the dead of squirming in your own set of slurping slop in in the dead of burning up in bed instead of turning blue and bad on and on\nAnd I came up with you want me to read my ... my sweet dear I send cheer all the best\nYou're forced rest is like jail so don't ale very long just gets strong go outside take a ride do it quick stay not sick ban you were a for my sake\nButtered bread while in bed makes a mess so unless you would choose that bad news I suggest that you'd best sooner arise so your eyes will not glaze Douglas praise help being near my sweet dear\nSo clay most now Douglas clean all became Douglas and I I like the ones on jam became bread though the bread and butter butter bread yeah well\nI just figure jam and jelly they are words but the words represent concepts and the concept to have a kind of a halo around them I mean when you talk about jelly your employees\nAnd generally they are words but the words represent concepts and the concept of a kind of a halo around them I mean when you talk about jelly your implicitly talking about bread and things that you spread it on ... just stick their fingers and jelly no bread needed OK okay fair enough\nFeeling like he hadn't quite nailed it ducked sent the plume to one of the guys that translated his first book into French yeah a guy named\nOddly enough Bob French [laughter] and I said hey Bob and you do it and a Bob Said well give it a try\nFairest friend let me send my embrace quit this place it's dark halls and bank\nIn soft still regain health\nDress and fleet off with me Clement who calls from\nVery different in tone and really quite marvelous he\nGot the pale face in there you got to a gym Clements name in the middle\nBut at the same time it didn't have the lightness the tone is much more ancient\nWhich you could argue well it's an ancient pounds but Doug says no no there's a bigger problem\nWas thirty lines long so extra long and when he ate was a sacrosanct number for this just a few lines though no no no no no claim on my whole wrote a three syllable poem twenty eight lines that rhymed wonderfully and the essence of his poem was a form rather than a a\nThan a message that is the message was get well\nWhich is pretty simple but Doug would argue no it was a form that's what made the things funny charming and so the question for him was who could get the feel but nailed it for him he ended up sending the pull him out to like sixty people\nDoctoral students who my sweet I treat one regard Otis hard you're who's colleagues friends chicken de ...\nSixty people doctoral students who my sweet I treat one regard Otis hard your colleagues friends chicken D.

OK okay this is also went to his but like the twenties when he did\n... petite gals so swarmed from up some dumb bug drag you down that friends feel the urge bugs differ from the scourge you'll emerging try sound advice from Doug slash clown so smashed who's\n...\nAnd Teri and looks at him like well\n[noise]\nYou got to be kidding where I stand up in public and I and I and I say something um I I Try to be serious about it and I think the fact that I'm doing that is serious and when I raised him by name in my comments today\nI carry it sounds to me like he sort of insulted by the question and and you have to remember\nHere he is the word serious in East Africa can be translated very much in are you doing something preferably a Lincoln financial transaction right and so what this journalist is saying is when are you just talking about this or are you doing something\nMay be threatening you will be a who is withdrawing eight or strong support and Kerry says I Am very seriously talking about\nWe have previously called for the release of these individuals and that is the policy of our government and it's a serious policy thank you all very very much appreciate it\nAnd it seems to me maybe you know you can judge but it seemed like he was almost like look I don't like the most serious politician that's out there I mean I lost the presidential race in two thousand four in part because I was deemed too serious by the American public you know like\nTitian that's out there I mean I lost the presidential race in two thousand four in part because I was deemed too serious by the American public you know like what are you kidding me not being serious\nWe put it in a number of requests to speak to John Kerry or someone in the state department but there was no response\nDo you think he was aware of the misunderstanding who carry the uh this uh this film and oh yeah no I followed\nHim out afterwards [noise]\nCan you pronounce your name for me [noise]\nMy name is on or near ... he's a young guy in his twenties he's an independent journalist yeah I used to work in different newspapers and um\nI was like you know when you when you\nListen what happened there and I felt like some kind of cultural a guide me\nIs that Americans think serious means\nI'm standing here I'm not joking I'm Serious when African space is serious and I'm using a generally they say no are you going to not just speak are you going to\nDo yeah ... exactly my point are you going to take sanctions maybe going the options here do you feel that that question for you at risk\nMaybe who knows is that is a job description doing good journalism in Egypt and [noise]\nMake so much thank you thank you for me from my numbers on there [noise]\nSo that conversation was about five months ago did you know what his faith that at all I mean we found out whether didn't suffer for this question in any way no but I have his phone number so I can give them a call in and find out\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] I and then he is Gregory Gregory Warner legally I'm good I'm\nLike I reached him by Skype he told me that actually after that press conference he did get strange calls to his home and some Facebook messages from people who didn't know telling him that he better rethink what he said yeah\nAfter that press conference he did get strange calls to his home in some Facebook messages from people who didn't know telling him that he better rethink what he said\nThat I go to line up with a gun on together with them and the Arctic shipping and that the\nThey said you should line up with

Washington\nOkay\nWashington like a lot of Ethiopians he's actually got some relatives in the in the states did they hear that you asked a question to John Kerry\nYeah yeah yeah yeah I've heard that the what is your mom and say she said please don't do that ... it might be you know got to get you things like that you know mom started like that they're yeah they're like that yeah\n\nMy ass or\nA or a pony\nYeah or or ... or ...\nOr ...\nLast on\nRadiolab will continue minimum methane blondes\nHello this is talk strategy crawling hey this is Gregory Warner and spoke to read the truck radiolab

radio lab today five experiments in translation let's from number three very cold it shows a broader ... discovers the sheer would choke now you're try\nThis one or Robert Krulwich and our producers Owen we'll talk to writer Adam Gopnik about George Carlin twice George Carlin mention oh\nBecause Carlin is a wonderful sort of folk philosopher of language you're talking about the comedian for comedians yeah [noise]\nLike I say is about the English language it's about little expressions we use we we all saying the little sayings and expressions that we use all the time oh this is one of his great subject ever really seemed to examine these expressions\nAnd all the more interesting because he was he didn't even have a high school education you know so he was not something that he got from schooling and one of\nGot mixed favorite curling nurse and I really like just went to his about how Carlin hated euphemism\nI don't like words that hide the truth I don't like where's the conceal reality I don't like euphemisms and American English is loaded with euphemisms because Americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality\nAs Carlin was wonderful about things like that was about both as she calls and we have no\nWith you for Muslims because Americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality economy was wonderful about things like that was about both as she calls and\nWe I've known people in this country no more old people we ship them all away\nAnd we brought in these\nSenior citizen\nAnd he was on so that that's\nThe reason we use ... and I've just been through my father in law died four months ago and we went through those same horrible business that we all go through in intensive care ward where the doctors and nurse practitioners have a language that they've been taught\nWe just want your father to be comfortable he's gravely ill is gravely ill means he's dying right and we want him to be comfortable means can we give them enough drugs so that hill\nPass out before he dies and so and so it's certainly true that euphemism can be a repellent thing but no one is full what we're mocking is the absurdity of the effort to disguise something that you cannot disguise but Carlin's real point was that it it like Dole's our\nReactions to it that actually have like I have a negative fat and it gets worse with every generation has the whole bit it's about um shell shock becoming pie TST he goes so goes it's in four different things in the first World War that condition was called shell shocked\nThey used to call it shell shocked simple ... direct language two syllables shell shocked and then it became battle for the battle for the fourth of those now takes a little longer to say doesn't seem to hurt as much and then after it became battle fatigue then it became operational exhaustion [noise]\nHey we're up to eight syllables now than it became post traumatic stress disorder still a syllabus but we added a hyphen and then it became peachy as the\nYeah so imagine like a black screen and little tiny white dots on the ranch in line\nTo Emily was allowed to keep the brain poor device for about a year and a half and during that time the lights bright resolution of it did get better as your brain learn to speak tone it was awesome\nWhen I saw people\nIn one of the things that really struck me in our conversation was I asked her about this video that her mom it sent me showing her wearing the device and\nWalking down the street she told me they usually\nKnow now that she's blind when she's walking down the streets of New York city especially of town where the streets are a lot lighter\nShe says people see her and her white cane and walk a really wide circle around her\nSo [noise] I\nAnd where the streets are a lot lighter\nShe says people see her and her white cane and walk a really wide circle around her\nSo I uh\nI hardly ever notice other people walking around me it feels like\nI can always hear the topic and it's down to the topic but\nWhich he says would split the device on and put a sensor on her tongue [noise] the sidewalk [noise]\nCame alive I thought it was amazing like I didn't know this many people are on the street at the same time it's nice to know their um [noise] they're all there again which you describe them in a way that sounded\nAlmost like a painting\nLike really soft watches it everything was your thoughts like soft flashes of ...\nThat can move\nThere is walking and I can see their life living and I could see them their gate but I couldn't see them clear you know like I can see their teachers or\nWhether they're wearing a shirt or a short sirt\nAddress repairs age just like see their shadows and every now and and I see the light counted on them really yeah\nI've mentioned some alec underwater creatures\nUh-huh squishy jelly fish like yeah\nYeah like lady yeah [noise]\n\nYeah like that\n\n[noise]\n\nAnd that friendly is what it's like to translate the city with your tongue New York city becomes is a cheesy sea of walking fish they make their way along in the sunshine [noise]\n\n\nWe were lucky enough to get a video of Emily painting while using the brain port and you

[laughter] sure sure the here's here's the here's our quandary girl okay so what's your situation we're doing Sean ... okay so recently we sat down with a reporter and science writer Carl Zimmer to talk about\nOur name ... we were talking about something else in our name came up at the end 'cause heres why ever since we started doing this show Robert got his [laughter]\nGot his I got a little insistence as little as I just in a 'cause you're like our innate we got to learn it yes I said that are and I like what do you want to do and you're like I Want to do our name and I was like but is there a story and you're like no no I didn't\nSay that I just said that that that that if you understood what our innate does you'd realize that translation is profoundly important to our existence that's what I said yeah well as often\nHappens you or me down ... as I find let's just try it and they'll say you know\nSo we're talking with Carl Zimmer we brought it up and unfortunately I think this is a day when you were out of town and I think your your son's getting married yes he was and ah her I was doing like tech team work for me [laughter]\nOkay All right so the definition of translation and biology is taking a sequence in DNA and using the genetic code to translate it into proteins ... ... ... and the discovery\nOf this was maybe even more exciting than the discovery of the double helix structure really yeah\nWas bigger than Watson and Crick yeah well at least equivalent wow\nThe discovery of the double helix structure really yeah it was bigger than Watson and Crick yeah well at least equivalent wow so here's a quick story so what happened was\nOkay suggest to set the table here we all know the DNA is a thing in that when you're born you get half your DNA from your mom and a half your DNA from your dad and Francis Crick and and er James Watson just figured out\nThe structure of DNA that basically\nThe rest of the of DNA your recipe is comprised of four bases in a long string a T C and gee that's it but here's the problem see like we humans were more than DNA we are these flashy keen piles of muscle and bone and all of that stuff all the stuff stuff of us comes from ... yeah\nWe have like a hundred thousand different proteins and our body different kinds of pertains to the question was like how how does all that could generate it in\nThe out of this for simple base has become the assets that become hundreds of thousands of proteins that make us us\nHow do you make the transition ... people were thinking of this as just this incredibly complicated problem that might never be solved\nAnd the first person to really think seriously about this was not a geneticist as cosmologist named George gamma huh and gamma just said wait a minute this isn't that complicated this is just ...\nThis is a code problem [noise] ... thought okay I Know the DNA is contains four bases ATC and GE and ... days somehow create hundreds of thousands of protein so I just need to think\nOf a of a clever way of [noise] you know creating a little code machine where you put in the DNA\nThe ACC Duke ... if you if you take one [noise] and then out comes the protein like how what what simple code could I Do to do that and just sitting there no experiments no nothing just thinking this guy came out to side I think\nThat ourselves read our genes three basis\nJust sitting there no experiments no nothing just thinking this guy came out side I think that ourselves read our genes three bases at a time\nLike instead of a T. C. G. A. C. cannot thought maybe it's a TA CJ DCA ac aging in\nOther words whatever it was it was reading the DNA and sell maybe it was reading it in triples not parents because if you have sets of three or rather than to game I figured well that'll give mathematically would give you more possibilities and that might put you on a path to making all those hundreds of thousands of", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "14"}
