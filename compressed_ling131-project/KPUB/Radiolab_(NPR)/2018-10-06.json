I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today to [noise]\nGoing to start\nThis show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times we've had on the show before then facing the pie [laughter]\n[laughter] okay I think it's good All right where we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning yeah start again that was what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nThere is growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and\nWhen that became a national\nThere was a lot of belly aching and the press how many people do is they killed in the United states about why the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while\nLaw enforcement officer involved shootings and it struck me at the time that like ... what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire near rice and Harris than double John him over there and we'll come sort of a national story [noise]\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing that like the number one\nIs there a is a trend in one way or the other or police shooting more black people and white people just very simply\nYeah the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part and I said that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police for an itself in the police department it does on the local level however uh it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida in two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers committed for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete you know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database\nMost of them rely on media reports that the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public consciousness that is right to ban and his editors thought let's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented burned\nSo first study had Florida it's a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country\nAnd Florida has wonderful public records loss and legally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places in ... the government has been sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\nAnd three hundred and eighty eight emails asking for five years worth of paper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd build a database and um [noise] you know hopefully draw some conclusions some lessons some solutions\nThis all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there last link to it from our website radiolab dot org highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency to keep track of the stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found it initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest some sort of counterintuitive a line and this the the numbers are flat\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers of stayed steady but a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd because uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it seem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category\nAnd he says you know what you see like on the most basic level are are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is a case we're not taking a gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence and the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds anytime of the shooting and in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases they call suicide by cop which is where somebody who's usually are mentally ill\nApparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally person is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door\nAnd raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a weapon so it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ... this is something that people who covered\nBut I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ... this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know they're the news briefs that you see once or twice a week but it was new to us I mean clearly\nPolice are now like the de facto front line in dealing with mental illness in this country [noise]\nBut when it got to Ben central question what do the numbers say about race I think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black\nAnd that is a dad as out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics\nAnd your what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely\nTo be shot by police than if you're white southern tell us much right now but the breakdown between fake ... for their same demographics and it's that they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were\nCarrying a firearm nine percent had a\nBlade uh Seventy percent involve some\nForm of resisting arrest you know and we talked with in the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent\nYou know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty numbers themselves don't really get you very foreign percent six ... he says one percent of the more you here it's just like yeah this is only one\nUltimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah you ... I mean [noise] I mean what's [noise] gets me is like the I don't know it's back to\nWhere we were and why we want to start this methane gas is I've still just moved by the single cases the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is [noise]\nWant to start this nasty nasty such still just moved by the single case the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is [noise] you know [noise] I mean there are written in this uh\nInvestigations revealed that a SPIC officer Matthew Fowler received a call ... to Cato sterile police speak Fowler approach department to fifty five inch confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles armed with a knife a department to five five but household every one of these every report is at least one human life someone was either\nYou know [noise] more often than not gravely injured or killed\nDefied what is clear is that over eight hundred plus shootings even the shootings where the person was unarmed only one police officer has ever been charged ... so it's it's this weird sort of like double grief yeah flick past and present at the same time like\nYou can't put it away because it's every day is another insults kind of right then if I'm having\nTo get in the ...\nWherever insightful then something happened in you know here in Florida\nOr so after the event ended up the community center crystal took a bunch of the Mondale got in their cars and drove over to this little gem shop\nJust like you guys do this every every event or no no this one is on track to no good ones and has been telling everyone about\nThis dinner just with her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nYou know we didn't know anything about this but it it must be part of the different types of learning as part of just hoping ... right right we all just simply trying\nOur way is a crystal gathered like probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because she wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with\nMy grief you can either get the um the largest age as they are going because it was talking to these two women and she had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like\nThen I open my windows and I just knew really I go through my house she says the same age comes her down you know I'm just [noise]\nI go on my house she says his age comes her down you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to crystal [noise]\nMid sized one story house in twins and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin where the kitchen\n\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together like they bring with them or their own stories you stories of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\n[laughter]\nThe night before they'd all gone out dancing together\nFor the summer when a fire [noise]\nAnd now what we're doing instead of getting motel rooms again this is Natasha Clinton's we're starting to stay over eight inches of houses\nWe sleep in each other head on the couch you know a mattress is it becomes like a huge sleep over and the rest of the Ford asleep or talking you know getting to know each other you know some sort of by shows resources like therapy for\nIn the past but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that really stuck with me\nMarlon promise to\nWin crystal let some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people here in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or a brother or a child and we basically just in someone's backyard just walking\nAnd about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or a brother or a child and we basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grad so we usually the video that\nMy house probably over like right now\nThen the police car that came behind them was probably right here\nAnd then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nWe came in he came right here\n[noise]\nAnd that's why we recall execution a vegetable garden 'cause\nAnd all that but I I Am then 'cause ah when they when they you know when they took him away in released and sit down and type of stuff we came back at us all you can smell what's going on and so now like when you have any like it's it's not it's it's not as bad now but just the association for when I'm quite onions and you get that smell like it just\nYou get those flat ...\nFinish brings you right back here mhm\n... was just kind of stood there for a minute [noise]\n... some of the other one that started to cry\n\nThen you don't want me to uh take some yeah my find the best\nCouple of women enemy their phones man\n\nAnd then handed me the phone my\n\nAnd it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera\nWith this sort of straight face\nThree to one\nThree two one [noise]\nAnd we all started walking back to put the cars [noise]\nSharing with us but I Know [noise]\nIt was a set of ... we saw that last week\nAnd I three o'clock in the morning [noise]\nWhat I remember the and I used to tell you all the time how do you live so far away\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\nMy son's greatest about Fifteen minutes tops and where\nI visit home I have to go there all the time of horror Maggie yeah that would force how could you not\nThen I Know what you like you want to go take a tear\nSit there yeah\nAnd it's crazy because like if a listen it's a cemetery like a little bit further out\nAnd it's crazy you can go about it as like a certain time every\nAnd it's this little white man his share everything that I like he literally I think he does he like go have lunch with every day\nI don't know if you're in the way I like going on about and all of that and it's a little white guy that always did not do\nYou take his chair I Can't go home I Would I don't know but um\nAnd all of that is a little what got us all waste it not no\nHe take his chair I Campbell holes I Would I Do um\n[noise]\n\nSo the trip to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happen to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip\n[noise]\nAre you a ... who was some other ... she spoke at the Democratic national convention one years old\nChewed on stage with Michael Brown smother Eric Garner's mother I watched as my daughter was lower than to the ...\nAnd understand that a few of these women started call themselves the mothers but\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in DC [noise]\n\nAnd it was weird because in the short amount of time\nThis thing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nOf felt like at the time a support group\nAnd suddenly become\nAnd down the cop with a gun and men with a knife\nAnd look at the razor thin life or death moment between them\nAnd you got to get so stay with us\nThis is Christopher calling from South

like ... feet at the cops and then hey hey hey hey [noise] the\nGuy was campfires the case or the guy holding the Nike falls onto his back on to this like cement driveway still got the knife in his hand\n\nAnd the cop who's got a gun out he goes over a kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabs by the hand turns them over and then he's\nAttained central four cups and then\nThere may not have it's not a smart idea to have a nice coming out of the police\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me you\nWere lucky you didn't just shot on your best shot I see you want to die I Want you want to die you can't die\nHe tells the officer was of Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police sports can kill\nA fan of counseling on T.\nV. to pick 'em up walk them over to the squad car with a man and the un\nSaid this is the thing that you guys will you use this video for what it is one of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things you know and and that's the points we at home or the officers use time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans into court judge that one of them you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use mobile command first\nAdvantage they didn't pull right up and the guy leans into court judge that one I mean you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal command first warned them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\nAnd it's important 'cause the guys partner was holding a gun how do you heard this hot you might have to leave reacted thinking I was a gunshot and fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest and communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead them and it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek Derek isn't just a\nBlack man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there's no connection there is a lot easier to see somebody as nameless faceless and I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that in established some kind of a report that made the officer think\nOf how he's going to deal with this thing\n\nAnd actually after we finished watching a video and I was packing up she told me that just a couple of months after that incident\nUnlike us through the neighborhood that you might miss it on the front step wisdom hatred what are you doing man that Derrick does stupid but but you don't have close came to be in bed wouldn't be back with his medication I wasn't doing drugs and he was is completely as normal as me and you are right now [noise]\nNow again are almost kinda like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left\nWill last say primary election among the Fenway interstate ... just released his how old is she ... she would was elected sheriff of\nCounty [noise]\nShe has now militia county sheriff like shit would was elected sheriff of Linn county\n\nWhich is the county that Daytona Beach belongs to him and the other thing to mention is that a job with long says organization called her which is decrease executive research forum\nIt's a big coalition and police chiefs and it twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for the use of force and the number one principle rather than being something law and order law and order is\nThe sanctity of human life [noise]\nNow just a month after ... put out those principles two of the biggest policing organizations in the world the icy pie International Association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against\nThese guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job and some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive conversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago\nHuh I don't know man and just thinking about this like you've got these women\nHave become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who are\nPossibly changing the way police things done in America at least maybe slowly but cumulatively it does\nI hesitate to use this word but it does make it does feel like reason for hope\nRight and that sort of felt the same way too\nThere was this experience than I had read just realized how far [noise]\nThere was this experience than I had read just realized how far [noise]\nThat's coming up right after this break so stay to [noise]\nThis is Ryan ...

I'm Robert Krulwich this is radio ... we had been discussing police violence and raise mostly in Florida we met the mothers who gather from all over the country and we met the police chief in Daytona who who's trying out some different things so I was thinking maybe\nMaybe yeah maybe there's a little bit hopeful yeah it's the feeling we had a but then you realize hope it's a funny difficult thing because well ...\nTaken from here we are here to see the top ... Clemens Tosh Clemens the mother of Rodney Mitchell\nSo the topic of the woman who you heard earlier I'm back at the community center I met ... other mothers who lost their children are that's actually when I first met her bed and had been reporting on Natasha for like a couple of years by this point and we were there because Ben what's going to hand a ton of documents over to the top ... on her son Romney's case shouldn't have any\nAnd I was there because we set up a short interview Natasha but when we got your doors [noise]\n\nShe just started shopping [laughter]\n[noise]\nAnd\nThen I just had no idea what\n\n\nBut then she had just turned the tape recorder off what was what was happening in that moment well okay so to back up so meeting somebody like a chip would you know I'm like there is a sort of hoping that I Believe but\nThe thing about a chip would um share of the police chief is that\nThe only have the power to fire a police officer and that's really about it after that it goes into the court system and so for Natasha I'm her son Ronnie twenty three years old unarmed was shot and killed by two police officers during a traffic stop\nAfter the shooting a judge ruled that the two officers had done nothing wrong it acted in accordance with the law\nAnd it just so happened that forty five minutes before that and I showed up at her door she just got an email from her lawyers saying that the appeal that she'd filed\nAgainst that decision I had just been rejected and so we sat there in ... department for a while we actually even left for like an hour eventually came\nKind of just hit reset on the whole thing [noise]", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "06"}
