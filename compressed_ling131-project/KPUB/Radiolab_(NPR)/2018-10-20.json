Ron I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't end or in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode a contain some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no don't don't say that we have to say that we don't we have to and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping [laughter] so we must but we know is it is on the radio yeah so she's got kids with the you may want to make someone on yeah anyway the story comes to us from producers Simon ... so let's start can we start in two thousand they sure about what the song yes please ...\n\nSo ah December twenty seventh eighth sunny Saturday morning ah this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo Alto and are seeing and swaying directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of\nA middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo Alto and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of [laughter]\nFacebook [laughter] yeah\nIt was a humble gathering is a a few dozen women and babies that right there are you guys are\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering I'm Stephanie newer\nNurse in as in like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be disciplined and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken up themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would upload those photos to Facebook\nIn these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for uploading um pornographic content and people were really getting\nTheir backs up over this [noise] they want to face but to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [laughter]\n[noise]\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that the small\nPeaceful protest would turn out to be\nThis morning a face off on Facebook\nOne of the opening shot Facebook triggered hordes now and what would become a loud\nFacebook ... rockets\nAnd global battle\nEmbattled Facebook CEOs today playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in the election meddling or data breaches\nBut but rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of those\nFree speech\nBut rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of those free speech\nViolence against Rohingya Muslims what we can say in what we can't say that again by this iconic photograph what we\nCan see and what we can see I'd let Mueller right kids in front of me\nOn my\n[noise]\nMr sack of arc I got to\nDo you use objectively prioritize or censor speech\nCongresswoman we don't and global for doing of censoring speech but there are types\nOf what what what really grabbed me was was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook where you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of us can say on Facebook to digital documents it's about fifty pages if you've printed off\nAnd diet in bullet points and if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the globe which made me wonder like what are these rules\nHow were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test so ah let's start back a on that morning in two thousand in the morning that you could argue started it all [laughter] [noise]\n'cause in the building right behind those protesting mothers there was a big group\nFacebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do I'm cool\nBehind those protesting mothers there was a big group of Facebook employees sitting in a conference room\nTrying to figure out what to do I'm cool so if I so I'm just going to switch and just read so I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees when I'm One of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nIn now neither of these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought into read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees\n[noise] All right ready so\nAt the time when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again keep in mind this isn't nearly two thousand seismic changes this leak and the Internet hierarchy this was like the deep dark path and ice may Scott ...\nIs now the most visited website in the U.S they still had somewhere in the neighborhood of ten million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids\nAnd so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of conference like room with a big long table\nEach of them in front of their own computer and things that come up onto their ... to Facebook\nAnd on Lake meaning like Iowa user saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like our reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards this is Kate chronic she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing and and she says in his early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of content\nAnd then [noise] that content along with an alert would would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen most of what you were saying was either naked people blown off heads or things that there was no clear reason why someone had reported because it was like a photo of a golden retriever\nThings that there was no clear reason why someone had reported because it was like a\nPhoto of a golden retriever and people are just annoying and Everytime something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at that computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take a doubt\nAnd at the time if you didn't know what to do you would turn near pod leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and ask what do I do with this\nAnd they would either have seen it before and explain it to you or you both wouldn't known you Google some things\nIt really was just kind of an ad hoc approach was there any sort of written standard or any common standard uh what kind of they had a set of community standards that they at the end of the day they were just kind of that as one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry that that the guidelines were really one page long there are one huge long and basically all this page said was nudity is bad\nSo as Hitler and um if it makes me feel bad take it down and so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breast feeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down until\nRise up fight for the lights are\nBetter anyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but according to Stephanie me are those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who had organized ironically enough through Facebook\nSo to coincide with the live protest they just ... you know typed up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse and two for one\nChanged their profile avatar to an image of\nBreastfeeding and then change the status to the title of our group a Facebook\nBreastfeeding and then change their status\nTo the title if I cook a Facebook breastfeeding it's not [noise] and it caught on the social networking website is under fire for any pollinate on photos of women threatened leading their children down in twelve\nThousand members participated and the media request started pouring in the face of a bad thing is not I didn't and hundreds of interviews for print Chicago Tribune Miami Herald time magazine in New York Times Washington Post\nThere is a floor and the Celtics where faith but as far as his content moderators itself\nAround twenty tend they decided to start out sourcing some of this work to places like manila where you just heard reporter or a home and draw as well as I mean I Would guess what they're saying\nSort of thing some of this work to places like manila where you just heard reporter or a home and drop as well as\nI mean I Would guess that there are people\nDublin where we sent reporters Guerra stack\nScene where they get their dishes Facebook treats cooked everybody fever English and we sent\nThem there to try to talk to some of these people to for a living sit at a computer and collectively quick through around a million flag bits of content to pop up on the screen every day wow well we ... I'm just curious like what's what's that like\n[noise] well I thought I'm\nAre generally we found out\nPretty quickly ... none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nUm so there's a lot of reading I mean happening\nLess certain about the good work and [laughter] so now I don't I start to\nI Know you're lying in fact most\nPeople wouldn't even admit they worked for the company like what's a is there something wrong about being in like in India that they find well yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] are willing to talk to me do you want to be named her you know where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather that that's the only find you know I ... I got\nTo explain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements dating they weren't allowed to uh admit that they worked for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nAttract a lot of racial arch\nMoore in several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worst so that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers and the company which is your Facebook you light\nIt couldn't be gamed or at the same time it creates a third of separation between these workers and the company which if your Facebook you might want well\nI I signed up to monitor traffic has just given the nature of the job that you know I really low impact\nThat that's going to have I I tell you got so\nThis guy I talked to he he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year he jumped to his desk every morning put on his headphones ignored ...\nPlus I just I guess I was hired as taco test every day I was just a niche as associate and it's just such a\nSize five thousand a day you just said yeah I was like it was a lot it's also yeah he\nHe said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every\nThree or four seconds [noise] wow all day long all day eight hours a day [noise]\nWell ... if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nI Do laugh that's just like that where they are that's true I told us to extradite\nClicking through he came across unspeakable things\nFederal has expert able to you know just a little squashed by attached to a ... like\n[noise] still actually golf I had no facts quite a lot just lots of all over\nWhen did you did this like keep you up and then as you do this is\nAbsolutely I'm up at like a\nCatch himself thinking about these videos and photos when he was trying to relax he had to start voting things\nLike that were never specific like I said I couldn't watch it was like OK says ...\nWhen he was trying to relax he had to start voting things\nSpecific like I said I couldn't watch is why like cases also a new life I lost a C. S. I. S. like has exploited Los Los I have a lot\nI just I have to I I as children as well [noise] I I saw that [noise] ah it's it's classic adjusted\nThe different moderator I spoke to describe it as seeing the west side of humanity\nYou see all of the stuff that you and I\nDon't have to see because they are going around playing cleanup yeah which I don't know ... and ... and it's worth noting that are more and more this work is being done in an automated fashion particularly with content like a Gore or terrorist propaganda\nOr that they're getting better automate that they got the uh through computer vision they're able to detect hallmarks of of of a terrorist videos or of a gory image and uh with terrorist propaganda they now take down Ninety nine percent of it before anyone flags it on Facebook\nBut a moving on to our second story here that there is a type of content that they are that they are having an incredibly hard time or not just automating but even getting their rules straight on\nAnd that surrounding hate speech oh good that's coming out of there will be laughter oh really there will be comedians there will be jokes in reader's hey All right okay so we take

but uh it instead of seeing her normal loose feed a there was this message that pops up\nIt says you posted something that discriminated along the lines of race gender or ethnicity group\nAnd so we moved the coast and so I'm like\nRace gender or ethnicity group\nAnd so we've removed that post and so I'm like\nCan I possibly opposed it I really I I thought it was like a glitch but then she could

I'm Robert Krulwich has radiolab we're back\nWith our story about Facebook and free speech and we just want our minds you guys are are those who you're just tuning in this episode does contain some graphic content some strong language which must in order for us to make a point but but we do warn you that you're you if you don't want to hear this kind of thing because we were kids in the room may want to sit it out yeah okay back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook is trying to do two competing things at once\nThey're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe in ways that are fair and consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April fifteenth twenty third ticket ...\nHey Rhonda Merrill aside but sorry for them to get up thank you I mean how can break we asked them\nApril fifteenth twenty Thirteen ...\nHey girl at Rhonda Marilyn thanks but sorry my my aunt had him to get up thank you I mean how can break we asked them breaking news uh otherwise I wouldn't cut you off so abruptly Carl\nMonday the fifteenth twenty Thirteen just before three in the afternoon [noise]\nTo pressure cooker bomb\nThe finish line Boston Marathon\nHave sort of does begin to settle\nAre springing into action\nOr just one man in a cowboy hat sees a spectator who who's been injured picked him up rose him in a wheelchair\nIn as they're pushing him through the the sort of ash cloud that there's a photographer there any snapped couscous\nAnd the photo shows that the runner in the cowboy hat and these two other people pushing this man who uh his face is Ashton from all the debris and one of his legs is completely blown off\nAnd the second one is blown off below the knee other than the femur bone sticking out and then ... skin and muscle and tendons it's it's horrific\nMeanwhile CBS VW a studio on the other side of the country is fine I remember snippets of the day\nFacebook employees are clustering around several desks staring at the computer screens watching the news during\nThis has occurred just in the last half hour or so high up\nMemories of uh watching some of the coverage chilling new images just release of the Boston bombing I remember seeing the photo published online and it wasn't long after that [noise] someone had but\nCoverage chilling new images just release of the Boston bombings\nI remember seeing the photo published online and it wasn't long after that\nSomeone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the order of events here are a little fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly voters going viral [noise]\nAnd we realized we're going to have to deal with it this image is spreading like wildfire across their platforms it appears to be way outside the rules they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together and sat down in the conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like\nShould we allow it or should they take it down according to the rules are in this photo you could see you could definitely see bone and so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yep however have to ... says\nNo the other people are saying this as newsworthy essentially this photos being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which immediately receives\nPush back well I was saying that what we prided ourselves on was not making those calls and there are no exceptions there is either either mistakes were improvements we made the guidelines for moments like this do which the other side shoots\nBack oh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe is publishing this all over the place and we're taking it down like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense here like humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nHow do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of the stuff\nThat in other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons\nAny of the questions about any of the rest of the stuff that in other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally cleared they decided to take the photo down but before they can pull the lever\nWord starts making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources and executive ... sent down in order we were essentially told make the exception\n\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason is the photo stance you're not taking this doubt\nYes oh yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook has just become a publisher ... but they don't think maybe they have but the major news judgment and just really knew what they've become a news organization\nYeah ... and this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech\nLike is Facebook is sort of collective scrap book for us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you want or yeah it is it now in news organization trends parents here let me\nLet me get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question to kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook is\nAnd this question has been popping up a lot recently in fact it even came up this past April when ... was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so\nWhich are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher\nCenter this is a I view us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology and I said you responsible for your content which makes that kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content\nWe do is build technology and I said you're responsible for your content which made exactly the kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and built products\nBasically ... and others that the company are arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the well Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where uh they can't be held liable for much of anything they're subjected to a few regulations\nHowever were were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization\nThat could change but setting that aside what what what really strikes me about all of this is if you're you have a company that really uh up until this point has has been crafting\nA set of rules that are both as objective as possible and can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound\nThan what people find interesting were important what what people find newsworthy ... he'll give and I'll give you an I'll give you a great example of this or that happened just six months after the Boston Marathon bombing when this video starts being circulated out of northern Mexico", "year":
