wonderfully\nCatchy little sausage shape on the page the fact that the lines rhyme you know a BBC CD and\nUh the first line non union is identical to the last line I mean young to sort of has the feel of the Palin drove it has the poets name in the middle of the poem ... the one I did I say three syllables per lawyer didn't ya yeah or it's three syllables per line I mean that's crucial and then also twenty eight lines long\nSo all of those things added up to a set of constraints you might say on me\nSo Doug sat down and got to work and a quickly became embroiled in the question of like how do you translate this come along the way\nEven began to make a little grids of possibilities for different lines at the problem for example vast beyond the tub boost you sort of like this line that basically says don't wallow in bed\nI had a lot of possibilities and I'll just read you the a little diagonal display here instead of spurting\nBlood in bed instead of burping in your bed instead of

same time it didn't have the lightness the tone is much more ancient\nWhich you could argue well it's an ancient pounds but Doug says no no there's a bigger problem\nWas thirty lines long so extra long and twenty eight was a sacrosanct number for the new lines though no no no no no claim on my whole wrote a three syllable poem twenty eight lines that rhymed wonderfully and the essence of his poem was a form rather than a a\nThan a message that is the message was get well\nWhich is pretty simple but Doug would argue no it was the farm that's what made the things funny charming and so the

said that are and I like what do you want to do and you're like I Want to do or nay and I was like but is there a story and you're like no no I didn't say that I just said that that that that if you

that that if you understood what our innate does you'd realize that translation is profoundly important to our existence that's what I said yeah well as often\nHappens you or me down ... as I find let's just try it and they'll say you know so when we were talking with Carl Zimmer we brought it up and unfortunately I think this is a day when you were out of town not secure your son's getting married yes he was and how it's doing like tech team work for me [laughter] okay\nAll right so the definition of translation and biology is taking a sequence in DNA and using the genetic code to translate it into proteins ... ... ... and the discovery\nOf this was maybe even more exciting than the discovery of the double helix structure\nReally yeah it was bigger than Watson and Crick yeah well at least equivalent wow so here's the quick story so what happened was\nOkay suggest to set the table here we all know the DNA is a thing and that when you're born you get half your DNA from your mom and a half your DNA from your dad Francis Crick and and er James Watson to figure it out\nThe structure of DNA that basically the rest of the of DNA your recipe is comprised of four bases in a long string a T C and gee that's it but he's the problems he like we humans were more than DNA we are these flashy keen\nOf muscle and bone and all of that\nAt least equivalent wow so here's the quick story so what happened was\nOkay suggest to set the table here we all know the DNA is a thing and that when you're born you get half your DNA from your mom and a half your DNA from your dad Francis

problems he like we humans were more than DNA we are these flashy team piles of muscle and bone and all of that stuff all the stuff stuff of us comes from ... yeah\nWe have like a hundred thousand different proteins in our body different kinds of pertains to the question was like how how does all that get generated like out of this for simple base has become the assets that become the hundreds of thousands of proteins that make us us how do you make the transition ... people were thinking of\nThis as just this incredibly complicated problem that might never be solved and the first person to really think seriously about this was not a geneticist as cosmologist named George gamma huh and gamma just said wait a minute this isn't that complicated this is just ...\n[noise] this is a code problem [noise] ... thought okay I Know the DNA is ... four bases ATC and GE and ... days somehow create hundreds of thousands of protein so I just need to think\nOf a of a clever way of [noise] you know creating a little code machine where you put in the\nDNA the ACC Duke ... if you\nGo ahead [noise] and then out comes the protein what what simple code could I Do to do that and just sitting there no experiments no nothing just thinking this guy game out decides I think\nHundreds of thousands of protein so I just need to think\nOf a of a clever way of [noise] you know creating a little code machine where you put in the\nDNA eighty the agency did you keep going and then\nOut comes the protein what what simple code could I Do to do that and just sitting there no experiments no nothing
