I'm ... which is radiolab and today we have a legal case\nWell it's actually it's ... it's really more than just a legal\nCase this case it's it's um what my husband and I refer to as a mental magnet once you start thinking about it it won't go away it it gets under your skin and this is Lisa learning I'm a law professor at Catholic university\nHappy Columbus school of law where she teaches legal ethics and she sat down not too long ago with me and our producer Brenna federal who brought us the story and under whose skin it also seems to have gotten yeah\nIt it just made me not know whether to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started\nSearching Tracey my name's Jim Tracy I'm an award winning ...\nNot know whether to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started\nShirt in Tracey my name's Jim Tracy and I'm an award winning journalist former newspaper guy for the post starring Glenn falls he's\nBeen reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think there is and he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the Adirondacks which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eighth Nineteen Seventy three for young people does Eighteen to twenty three three men in a woman's go camping in the outer on ducks pulled off the road a aside rode out through thirty\nThey made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up two tenths and went to sleep for the night\nAnd then Sunday they you know woke up\nAnd about nine AM to campers hurts somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they saw for this middle aged man peering into the tent\nWho looked like a conservation officer he had a door with a feather on sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck and\nVery calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he got\nThe other campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing in semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen ah of killed before and I'll kill again\nI'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees and started marching the kids off into the woods took them into the woods near a brook compare the two with him behind them\nThe kids of course we're scared out of their wits he pulled out some ropes basically he had he had the each of them tie themselves you know as he pointed the gun Adam and then the last one he tied so after we had the four people tied he went back to the first boy Eighteen year old\nThe gun at him and then the last one he tied so after we had the ... people died he went back to the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip them blue ski and because the other three kids are spread out through the forest they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise] and then they heard filled with voice get really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happened to him\nWhat was happening in in ... with his back and I\nUsed to have been five times in the chest\nAnd when this happened three of them in their panic were able to break loose and start running Nick ... to his car Carol Ann ... ran through the woods [noise]\nBut the man caught one of them\nDavid Freeman he took the boy back to the campsite and he had um lay down in a ditch next to him to kind of monitor the situation I guess so Freeman in um the killer laying in the chapter then our men come men that\nThe other two campaigns the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert locals are new there they came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted dumb killer and Friedman laying down in the ditch and when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun is going to shoot and then enter the gun just kind of stood up\nCalmly and Cooley walked into the forest\nAnd us began\nWhat was it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning and about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road as you can see when the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in state police standing by\nIt was a scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today with a broken down on manpower into a roving patrols men\nArmed with with all kinds of weapons rifles shotguns bloodhound that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case\nGuns flood homes that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods\nThey eventually find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate and come back with an ID eight\nThirty seven year old Robert Darrow Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York as a fugitive police are looking forward today he was an ex convict people dying in prison for rape tips seven years now armed with a thirty thirty rifle a knife and\nThe story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday how do you feel at night when people got panicked when you're all are well one of the doors are shorter ... people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving around here but people left the area so fast that I'm aware that last night and the day before that they left their tense up they left\nBarbecue smoldering they left behind coolers said the man has done what happened was Carol was able to use those camps in that food and those drinks to survive day after day the manhunt it's about four hundred men now\nThe police follower lead and that he had stolen car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on it\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August ninth Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest of the summer\nThat day a conservation officer may ... spotted gal\nSaid please or got big on something of that fact and Guerra started running\nBlack fired four times got him in the back the arm and the foot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time they saw Darrow and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead 'cause he was just laying there but\nThey you know took his paws and everything and he was certainly\nGirl and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there but but you know took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\nSo they put them in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with them they're drilling and the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for\nA girl who's gone missing [noise] but you wouldn't talk to this point that the story that I'm\nInterested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case and I think one of the things that's so fascinating about this case this law professor lethal Armand again is\nThe conflict between what a good lawyer should do and what a good person should do\nIn the situation okay and we are recording I saw the guy at the center\nOf this conflict was a man named Frank our money\nBreakage army\nBrenda the lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or or money that's Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and solve it they use urban but it is er money\nA couple of months ago producers Simon Adler and I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York is our money's now in his eighties he's retired [noise] my name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for Robert girl um\nWhere I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like what how did this whole\nStory start for you well were there just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk away or ... or like ... flights go forwards likes\nHe said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nAway it was a fighter I liked ... fights physical flights I'd like standing up for the little guy and that's partly why he became an attorney when you're fighting a cage for or defend it you're fighting this state and tyranny\nAnd he's doing really well he is well respected had a good reputation\nThen he met Robert De Niro yeah like a strong man to take him out you know forty five and a or to head the feeling that this guy is dangerous and love of things are going to happen\nThis is a year before the manhunt Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank remembers he represented him at first on two pretty small things one on\nClosed up mine shaft the mind and ... about an hour south of the hospital in federal run next in that moment were you scared where are you excited like oh ... years up it's a high but you're scared you're concerned yes fear your food\nIf you do in fact at one point looking in the rearview mirror they got a little bit we thought we were being followed by the state police\nSo eventually they pull over get out of the car\nAnd went into one\nBar where one of France's bell jeez I'm lady friends was hanging out there about thirty minutes don't you talk to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nAnd then we went off the back door [noise]\nTook of driving that lady friends car to try the news too and so they got back on the highway and drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here this may be as far\nAs we can walk\nUp to this old abandoned mine [noise]\nI went out there last February with reporter Lauren ... and Tom supervisor of Mariah Tom's cause a father so that some a road that goes to the miners are what is clear to them on [noise] it was that sort of hilly area off the side of the road is is a\nTrail of her own or you're just\nBecause I'm very icy that day this hair is used to be an all road [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hills fairly feet there were no leaves and all the trees were\nAnd I'm very skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that are mania\nFairly the there were no leaves and all the trees were\nAnd I'm Sorry skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that are mania and this is the only way they came in here\nSo right up there so here we are in our Sunday suits and here we go tragedy choose for is looking for the case [noise]\nBut lovable worse looking around [noise]\nFrom this when her well\nYou see the airship after they find this air shaft which it was just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off the carefully at this as any such\nYeah they don't want to fly down in there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the hall So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then they'll see how my feet and left me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak a blue shoe a blue sneaker\n[noise]\nAnd and a leg and I said to myself the son of a bitch does it end he yells back up to ... get me out of the year\nBoom ... backup that\nThey'll gee found the other body ... body she was in a cemetery where Carol headset he left her\nBut Armani wasn't there when the algae founder so what ensued was a very ...\nHad said he'd left her\nArmani wasn't there when delta G founder\nSo what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls so let's play that out what what are your options shirt so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor\nThese are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right\nNo you can't you just can't we\nTook her to know to keep the confidence is over ... under the current rules which have developed quite a bit since the time this happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality umbrella so you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain death or a substantial bodily harm\nThat will be ... that is yeah it can be or will be okay right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's low future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up when even if they have hired\nDetectives and even if local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that but there's no if if if the people are already dead than you do the lawyers shoe\nThat's right\nA really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role in that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what year\nAll in that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is is to get to play the part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates them even if everybody hates you even if\nMaybe you hate yourself a little bit you have to\nDo your job in that job is to be in the role of the person that fights as hard as they can for that client the lawyer is the agent of his client only only the\nAgent of land or also citizen and a member of the ... and part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double murder here and families seeking to find out what happens in hell knows what happens right if we cheer building on on the side of tell just tell tale\nOf course yes when I moved to hook from booming [noise]\n'cause his du da\nDa da da da da da da da da and they knew him from church and\nWhat not to be and then I'm On a few big pushes the parents\nOf the family and yet you have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two more morality [noise]\n\nSo now what is he [noise] coming up that hard spot gets even harder [noise]\nWe'll be right back [noise]\n[noise]\nThis is

I'm Robert Krulwich is radiolab and now we should get back to our story from producer Brenna feral and when we left it there were where they were stuck right there when they knew this thing but it is a client was very guilty of something they found the bodies of these two girls and a no brainer what is it what what's their next move well\nSo they decided to put the burden plea bargain that take this information to the prosecutor and say I have information that will help you solve some cases some cases yes\nAnd in exchange I Want you to give me a better deal for my client to get Guerra into a mental hospital instead of a prison also right away they are going to use this as leverage\nThat was the idea yeah you're going to give a moon you're going to take it a little well that's kinda gross you know yeah he's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from Frank's perspective he's got this information\nAs a person he doesn't want to have to keep that secret so if he plea bargains then that's the way for him to get some closure for the family because he can give the information to the prosecution but he's also not selling out his client so report Jim Tracy again they called a meeting with Andrew McCabe investigator from the state police\nI Do to make a movie\nHe was just barely getting by for a little while I think the older older to stress and pressure searches true to all in fact he has a heart attack\nUm while this is all going on\nBut eventually the criminal charges are dropped and the ethical complaint is dismissed and the reason in the opinion of the court and the the state bar is that what Belgian our money did\nWhat they did was good exactly according to the law and my view is Frank our money is a you know real life hero I always say you know people so admire Atticus Finch and the difference between Atticus Finch and Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nAt least it told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven as for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility and there were about four hundred people in the room most of them lawyers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was a love feast\nDoes what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed that I don't go with this\nIn the midst of the hardest part no\nNever dreamed I don't go was here or there was a lawyer the donors draw up a ... I was a good lawyer ... through\nArt everybody um and now running over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money in Belgium did a good body is case it's taught in law schools across the country everybody teachers the case it's like a touchstone what people think what if what if what if\nYou will face so I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham just stand up [noise] um [noise]\nI agree um his duty is to his client who represents his client's best interest if you\nAnd in sitting in on these classes and and talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely as because professors can point to they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n...\nFrom from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the families\nInvolved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls\nOne of the victims and she initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing her mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan ... mother\nSusan was a girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing while she was camping with her boyfriend and she's who our money and build you found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn the story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that that you knew a lot of schools were teaching and and if you had any feelings or thoughts about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nUh 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and to think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical classes totally and comprehensible to me\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes and it was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you that I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they're trying to defend but what about the victim and I think that that should at least be an equal thought in their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um that that that you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was\nA greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um the did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all this was happening\nYes and only oh my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew immediately and and went to the police station and up\nWhen we were there sitting with the police men they received the policemen at the time that we were with received a phone call that the unease my daughter's boyfriend was his body was found and that's that's\nAll we knew and we never really had any updates and\nNobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was or some authority I Can't even remember who\nWas um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later\nIn the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact I even went so far as to contact a psychic that's how\nHow important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did\nIt was a totally lie a lawyer maybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months of\nOf horror and [laughter]\nAnd this is what is being taught and law schools\n[noise]\nAnyway just to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone law professors law students there um when they approached this is it's with a lot of sensitivity and\nInvolved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professors law students there um when they approach this as it's with a lot of sensitivity and they are they're struggling with the pain they I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could\nAny of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it\nAnd so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of um but you have a chance to\nCommunicate some of that um experience\nWell it's impossible to really communicate and words I made forty years later and skills I I ... and it's still a struggle to discuss this because\nYou don't ever go away as long as I live so\nI don't I guess\nI'm Wondering ... we've been talking a lot of I'm sad stuff I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know\nThat you'd want to share I don't know when you don't have to but [noise]\nWell [noise] [noise]\nWhat can I say she was she did receive her degree posthumously ah we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University where it was too difficult for us and um [noise]\nAnd Danny what's her boyfriend had been just that summer and he had a full scholarship to her and he graduated just before and so to live and I'm sure the other two children had\nGreat future's ahead of them too and it's just a horrible tragedy [laughter]\n\n\n\nIt's\nHorrible you know to be in a position\nTo have to live [noise] I mean how how do you really lose your your daughter you know what what excuses for it to protect you the person to kill her\nNo justification you couldn't justify my mind\nI don't expect them to accept it\nThat's the way it is [noise]\n\n\nUm and then you get just a minute of silence I tear if that's okay
