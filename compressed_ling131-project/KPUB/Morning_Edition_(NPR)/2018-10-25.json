David Greene and I'm Noel King good morning the u._s. stock market looks ready to recover some of yesterday's dramatic losses when Wall Street opens this morning most Asian markets were down overnight the Nikkei that hangs saying but the Shanghai stock exchange was stable which was unexpected because\nChina stock market has fallen thirty percent since January and its currency is falling to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly two years NPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai good morning Rob you more into our with thirty percent drop for China's stock markets\nNearly two years NPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai good morning Rob good morning Noel I spent thirty percent drop for tainted stock market sounds pretty darn bad what's going on\n[noise] well China's economy has been lagging for the last few years the government's dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debt spiraling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble\nAnd through all of this Beijing's making painful changes in how China's economy runs moving from an economy based on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn in China stock market this year reflects that\nBut it's important to remember here that when China stock market drops by thirty percent like this year it isn't going to have as big an impact on the economy like if the ... the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans\nAre invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is edited weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\n[noise] well what's interesting here is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing [noise]\nYears ago China used to weaken its currency to make exports cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that the u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\nChina is doing a China doesn't want its currency to depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now so if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and China\nAre these terrorists that prison\nThe UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and China\nAre these terrorists that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a kind of I'm speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chains to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war\nAnd that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U. S. China's economy was already vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost\nNPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks up to ...\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change\nSilicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes blocks chain that technology behind crypto currency like bitcoin is the latest solution coming from big tech\nMember station KCUR December net has more\nUntil about a year ago hardly anyone in climate science is talking about watching but at the recent global climate action some in San Francisco it was all over the place there were panels papers people were talking about how he can help mitigate climate change in all sorts of\nWays led agriculture harvests oils frustration our\nSometime and coaches the climate change coalition he came to the conference to spread awareness about ... [noise] so what is it\nA chain or distributed electric technology really references a larger system of technology [noise]\nOkay [noise] think of it like a lot\nOr distributed electric technology really references a larger system of technology [noise]\nOkay [noise] think of it like that [noise] ... is like an accounting book everyone can see a distributed ledger it's a record of transactions that isn't held by a central authority like a bank but instead on the computers of everyone on the block chain\nTransparency as its main advantage tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency block Jane to solve all sorts of problems everything from curing cancer to ending human trafficking and now even climate change\nIts it's our intention to build the infrastructure to make it possible to reverse climate change\nBall game all used to be a software product manager he's working on climate change now but he's still makes the grand tech world pitches he's a CEO of a new Silicon Valley company called ...\nNor is a black chain based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credits distance the total number of carbon possible to admit is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting end to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nNow the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch you want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy because a researcher at UC Santa Barbara\nYou said the danger of silicon valley's big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution the things that fix climate change are going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop\nJust there's a quick and easy solution that things that fix climate change are going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars to pollute the call I said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data the hot new things\nAnd these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nBecause it could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees the company has planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mocking a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of miracle cure\nIt's essentially can kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place the solutions that are actually more important to make the entirety of the problem something that solvable\nWith a clock ticking on climate change ... there's no

college basketball um in in total because what happened here was a pretty isolated incident um but what it does is it exposes the recruiting practices have been going on in a big time college athletics and football and particularly in basketball\nFor as long as I can remember and that is basically the channeling of money from a one source\nUm to the families of talent um to ensure that

markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting end to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nNot a company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch you want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy because a researcher at UC Santa Barbara\nYou said the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution the things that the climate change are going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars the pollute\nThe call I said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data were the hot new things\nAnd these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and started talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nBecause as watching could help with things like counting carbon

Republican Party had it says the group has about a million dollars in private donations their touring the country ahead of the mid term visiting more than thirty congressional districts chosen in part based on their religious makeup\nCongressman Ted Lieu of the Democratic congressional campaign committee has informally advised the group and event in San Antonio this week Tracy good rich who is

arguing that evangelicals should put more energy into reducing abortions and trying to criminalize them and should vote against politician to support Trump's agenda\nChristian Hawkins who runs the anti abortion rights groups students for life is a former evangelical who converted to Catholicism she says she's heard this argument before and doesn't think most conservative Christian voters will buy it because of how they view abortion\nThere are certainly a lot of issues that Christian care about when they go to vote but at the end of the day we know that there is a human rights atrocity happening inside of our country not atrocity is abortion\nHowever the issues are framed poster Robin Jones of the public religion research Institute says moving white evangelicals away from the G O P would be an uphill battle\nOnce you have several generations that are voting eighty percent Republican I'm it's less what they're doing that because of one particular issue and more than it has become in many ways a kind of tribal identity\nPublic and um it's less that they're doing that because of one particular issue and more than it has become in many ways a kind of tribal identity that's just

Studio now highly hey good morning to you\nSo I Want to get to the weekend in just a moment but first let's recap what's been a a wet and kind of a wild start to fall this\nFar it certainly has really you know this October has been one for the record books across much of Arizona will just start with Phoenix because it's there are the most impressive that out of October it five\nPoint three five inches in Phoenix that's nearly their yearly precipitation total but it is the third\nWettest month ever recorded not only October third met wettest month of all time ever recorded in Phoenix it over a hundred years and here in Flagstaff where just over four inches which I Believe puts us that uh the seventh or six the wettest\nOctober of all time\nJust over four inches which I Believe puts us at uh the seventh or six the wettest\nOctober of all time so it has been a cool and wet month for sure it seems like we went right for monsoon into the beginning of this month when we had some hurricane moisture all through that we had a fall storm and even some mountains snow across the region it's been a mixed bag\nAround here this October but that things are changing here going into\nThe final days of the month not to mention we had a tornado as well touchdown so much doubt outside of winds low last week and just over a rural area very a week kind of wrote tornado but you know not totally unusual October's the month that we usually see tornadoes\nPeople maybe recall I think it was back in two thousand twelve the big tornado outbreak out towards ... might have been two thousand nine\nIt's escaping me right now but there was like eight confirmed touchdowns\nSo now we shift into more fall like whether this weekend final you know it took us like you know for weeks to food for it to feel like ...\nOr mild fall whether we should say I mean it was some wet fall weather and a little on the cool side and we'd have certainly been accustomed\nTo some mild October's around here in recent years this October was a special kind of treat but ah we're moving into some very mild weather here as something we haven't talked about recently high pressure\nActually building into the region and an extended period here of some actually above normal temperatures and ah all sunshine OK\nNow let's move ahead a little bit here because we just got the confirmation from climatologist that uh El Nino appears to be forming in the Pacific\nOr no it just released an El Nino watch warmer than average editorial Pacific waters are forming and there was a Seventy seven\nRight ah no it just released an El Nino watch warmer than average editorial Pacific waters are forming and there was a Seventy Seventy five percent chance we move into an El Nino winter here it is forecast to be a week\nEl Nino which is typically not a huge deal across the southwest but it's still tilts our odds\nTowards a a wetter than average winter just slightly tilted\nTowards a a wet winter versus you know when no what comes out the climate Prediction Center comes out with our ah winter outlooks and they just did for the three month outlook period\nOf November December and January and they have Arizona in a thirty three to forty percent chance\nOf wetter than average it doesn't mean it's gonna be super what that means we're slightly tilted towards wetter than average let's say we were a forty percent chance of wetter than average that still leaves at sixty percent", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "25"}
