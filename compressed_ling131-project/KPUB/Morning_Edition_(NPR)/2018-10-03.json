been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington while when the Senate refused to remove Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with them over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice a forge us up to chief also failed in the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWhile the other part of our question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my

to write books and make speeches then the man President Reagan named after work a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because he had to legally smoke marijuana but he stayed on the

committee cars that caused them to be removed\nWould be highly unlikely the way you remove the Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate that was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for\nThomas Jefferson wanted them off the court because he disagreed with them politically he

types of chemicals and enzymes by inserting an element of randomness ... of the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by you know using logic and trying to design right the enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties\nShe started trying to improve the performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme up putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzyme and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display it uses a virus to infect bacteria\nAnd it can be used to evolve new proteins and including antibodies that is what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and apply to to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create anti bodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI

some earlier ones including a Nineteen eighty seven showdown\nBetween Democratic senators and them federal appeals court judge Robert Bork who'd been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy ... attack\nIn Robert Bork some Erica there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court\nFor Robert Bork the Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination at the Ventura Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place\nBut also contentious Senate hearing last week recalled some earlier ones including a Nineteen eighty seven showdown between Democratic senators and them federal appeals court judge Robert Bork who'd been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy lead the attack\nIn Robert Bork some Erica there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court\nFor Robert Bork the Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination and eventually Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat that as being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about how politics and the government work hike okay I see here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process has ended how does it affect their legacy or not well out of a hundred and\nSixty three nominations that presidents who sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five and been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSo we don't have the means that it's not controversial and that at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen had been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington was when the Senate refused removed Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice aid for deceptive chief also failed in the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWell the other part of our question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses around but\nAnd while when the Senate refused to remove Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice Abe Fortas up to chief also failed and the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWhile the other part of our question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resign from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then demand President Reagan named after work a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because it illegally smoke marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until they took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found but he lived in front of the Senate Judiciary committee because that caused them to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely or the way you remove the Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate that was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for\nThomas Jefferson wanted them off the court because he disagreed with them politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric John Randall off in the house of representatives had hit wiped the floor with chase a so this nastiness is hardly know\nUm but then the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing a justice for political reasons\nThat leads to another question Hi this is Kelly my her from birth or Connecticut I was wondering do other comparable countries have lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now if so what was the result is that what is it worth these lifetime appointments well lots of\nJohn Randall off in the house of representatives said hit wiped the floor with chase a so this

then you could screen those to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display it uses a virus to infect bacteria\nAnd it can be used to evolve new proteins and including antibodies that is what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and apply to to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create antibodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how did that

S. sand in developing countries and working to inspire and enabled the next generation of inventors more information is available at ... dot org and from the any each case the foundation\nThis is MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nI'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep let's recall a Supreme Court battle before the one we're living through no judge Brett Kavanaugh as contentious Senate hearing last week recall him earlier ones including a Nineteen eighty seven showdown\nBetween Democratic senators and then federal appeals court judge Robert Bork who'd been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy led the attack\nIn Robert Bork some Erica there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court\nFor Robert Bork the Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination at the Ventura Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat\nThat it's being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about our politics and government work hike okay I see here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process has ended how does it affect their legacy or not well\nOut of a hundred and sixty three nominations residents of sent to the Senate hundred and twenty five uh been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSome ways and means that it's not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nAbout a dozen have been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington was when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he just\nTo be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process offended how does it affect their legacy or not well out of a hundred and\nSixty three nominations that presidents who sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five uh been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSo we don't have the means that it's not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen had been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington while when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice Abe Fortas up to chief also failed and the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWhile the other part of her question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then demand President Reagan named after Bork a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because either legally smoke marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until they took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found but he lived in front of the Senate Judiciary committee because that caused them to be removed\nWould be highly unlikely the way you remove the Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate that was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh
