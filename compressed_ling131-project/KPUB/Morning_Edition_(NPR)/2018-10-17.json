teachers documentary film production and history at the University of Arizona she joins me on the line hitter Lisa Hi Aaron so we can you give us a feel for what it was like to follow these teachers and and what sir typical day like how hard it do they work\nWell I think one of the biggest misconceptions the teaching profession is that teachers work part time you know they work until three PM they have weekends off they have summers off and\nFrom what I learned following these teachers for over six months is just could not be further from the truth all of the teachers that I followed\nWork well into the evenings there up at the crack of dawn they work on the weekends and then all of them work in the summer um and then on top of that a lot of them have second jobs\nArizona just sounds like such a difficult place to teach as far as the the people you interviewed what is the silver lining what makes them stay on the job\nOf the teacher so I got to film I saw that they were really committed to their students and their school communities and I think that part of the job is really rewarding\nBut the other thing that I saw really strongly was how committed these teachers work education in general so\nIt's not about them you know it's about making the education system better and I think these teachers and a lot of other teachers I'm sure in Arizona are very committed to their\nProfession and I think seeing some change 'em this year I think has been very rewarding\nLet's hear from one of those teachers this is ... sees a husband and father of three\nReally rewarding

the professionalism and and the Kurdish season raises and those are things that come with that is really discouraging\nI don't want to give too much away now but Nathaniel actually contemplates moving to another state for a higher salary how common of thought is that among the teachers you talked to\nSo Nate situation sadly is the norm and not the exception from what I found every teacher has a plan B contemplating either leading the classroom or leading Arizona or just leading that education profession altogether\nThis film will definitely hit home with all of the Arizona teachers out there

Liberian curls its founder is an American woman named Katie ...\nShe has thousands of social media followers they're mile or tell stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad a girl who was on the streets selling herself at eleven years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there should be no girls are still on the streets when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who was a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me\nI'm On the streets selling herself I don't live in years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water street when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who is a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's set more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me and particularly its undercut the mile or had an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present the story level really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pockets and think that the individually but taking a small steps are making a difference\nSo who is Katie mylar why did she start this organization\n... a woman from New Jersey who had a long background in doing various forms of yeah community help volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on an evangelical internship\nAnd then from there to continue their relationship with the country and she started up which are the first registered in two thousand it\nShe didn't have a lot of nonprofit management did she\nKnow in ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this was an incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start this organization on the ground in Liberia was a man named Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nSix on an evangelical internship and then from there she continued their relationship with the country and she started ... first registered in two thousand and eight\nShe didn't have a lot of nonprofit management ditching\nNo and ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this wasn't incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start disorganization on the ground in Liberia was an army Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental and the starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nAnd he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment of girls that he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with Katie ... and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie minor the founder of the organization now what he was doing\nWell that's something that we ask ... and ...\nPerson for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ... and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power according to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie minor the founder of the organization now what he was doing\nWell that's something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my mother had an intimate relationship with him but she conceded in an interview but that same year and twenty eleven\nThere was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who [noise]\nWho says that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that he loves the children but she didn't didn't really get it\nNow my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd heritage but she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that he had HIV right\nIt was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nAnd as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to reports on to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nAnd more potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually are willing to ...\nAnd after that it was revealed that he had HIV right\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nAnd as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to reports and to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nAnd more potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually we're going to bring a case they were re tested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the piece Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for this says\nYou know where are your schools where the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to the city is that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had in the charities leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nAnd Liberia still allows the organization to operate schools there\nWell the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and then also the local local donor community I think I'm a local community the sense of ...\nDouble thing that happened in the early points that organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nIn Liberia still a lousy organization to operate schools there\nWell the the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the\nBuilding up as an organization like the sea of local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local the local donor community I think I'm a local community had the sense of\nA lot of people had a feeling that something had gone wrong in this in this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has not just a a fool investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case\nUm and they're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we how what's the process for credit thing these organizations have we help them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids policy was was followed and the school\nThe condition is known as the cutest lasted my light is or a a ... for short it can start with symptoms such as the eye lands and

pointed out that this is not polio\nRight now we know that polio virus is not the cause of these apps and cases CDC is tested every little specimen from math and patients none of this stuff and then

teaching in Arizona follows three educators as they balance their love for the job while living on some of the lowest teachers' salaries in the country at least some ... directed the film and teachers documentary film production and history at the University of Arizona she know joins me on the line who they're Lisa\nHi Aaron\nSo we can you give us a feel for what it was like to follow these teachers and and what is your typical day like how hard it do they work\nWell I think one of the biggest misconceptions the teaching profession is that teachers work part time you know they work until three PM they have weekends off they have summers off and\nFrom what I learned following these teachers for over six months is just could not be further from the truth is all the teachers that I followed\nWork well into the evenings there up at the crack of dawn they work on the weekends and then all of them work in the summer um and then on top of that a lot of them have second jobs\nJust sounds like such a difficult place to teach as far as the the people you interviewed\nYou know they work until three PM they have weekends off they have summers off and\nFrom what I learned following these teachers for over six months is just could not be further from the truth all of the teachers that I followed\nWork well into the evenings there up at the crack of dawn they work on the weekends and then all of them work in the summer um and then on top of that a lot of them have second jobs\nArizona just sounds like such a difficult place to teach as far as the the people you interviewed
