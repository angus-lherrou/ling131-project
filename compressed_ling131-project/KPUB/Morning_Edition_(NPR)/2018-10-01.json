individual market a whole host of new options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option these are a niche product always have been that started badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIt's simply another choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products of build on the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years is stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage\nMore than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges\nCare standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage more than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk people who think\nThat they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want to backstop they may want something and they may buy these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA policies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some\nAnd they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care\nAnd generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that the duck double as met so people have something called health insurance [noise] um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs these policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out the government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people Alison Kodjak NPR

but not to the point where you would ah endanger Israel\nNow this is a very odd to think where the Palestinians are actually demanding something that would collapse their own authority and their own government but it's not the first time that they do so so I think we have to be realistic\nAs long as the you know we have the middle east and reformed and pockmarked with so much violence so much radicalism so much terrorism this is the best of my age what we could we could have\nAnd you you believe in any circumstance that Israel should be able not only that security control but to arrest

interesting thing is their opposition parties including one that didn't even exist in the last elections five years ago it's aimed at young people\nAnd it looks like that party at least will do well here's an election observer named ... from the opposition ... party and older party explaining why he thought voters were rejecting those traditional parties\nThe most of the fun of people you have to be implemented in reality but fortunately for using the walkers and making things ...\nInside the multi almost lost huh\nAnd by then he means that he and a lot of voters I talked to frankly are frustrated over the lack of opportunity the fact that the party's control of the jobs lack of freedom for people not connected with those big parties\nSo what does that mean to ... was turn out good as a result of this frustration you were at polling stations right yeah\nThat was a really interesting thing because we went early in the morning and we stayed and we did not see a lot of people but the results that they're citing are\nActually pretty high I'm One of the big fears has always been fears of fraud there were allegations of widespread fraud in federal elections here in may in fact one of the party headquarters was attacked after\nSo one of the biggest parties the u._k. immediately said it was rejecting all the results but then they rescinded that\nSo here's one of the problems media were only allowed in a very few polling stations we got in one one of the approved polling stations and we were able\nTo watch them start to count some of the ballots so there is an election

results in question\nRight so I mean we've heard for generations how the Kurds have been wanting their own state right so there is an ... an innate tension between the Kurdish regional government and the central government in Baghdad so what how how could the new government in essentially Kurdistan\nAffects the the relationship with Baghdad\nAbsolutely that you've hit the nail on the head because they had a referendum last year saying do you want independence and the vast majority of Kurds said yes so the U.S says of course that it warned them not to hold this and there were serious repercussions after that\nThe Iraqi government sent in tanks so they're going to have to repair relations with Baghdad and a lot of other things on their plate as well the economy is so it's all quite

that is it's a coin flip as to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream\nChatty and his colleagues that opportunity insights a research and Policy Institute located at Harvard why to improve those thoughts so they've partnered with the U.S Census Bureau to develop an online program\nIt works a lot like a Google Map you can see the whole country or you can zoom in to local

already exceeded his expectations I think the key thing that has happened is\nThe fathers for the Carolinas have brought a lot of partners to the table to think about how to act on these data and I think that's the power it's in the community collaboration that community partnership\nCharlotte's effort to improve upward mobility is already taking shape at such field middle school it's located in a majority white neighborhood not far from downtown Charlotte but assistant principal Eric heartfelt says the schools students are mostly black and Hispanic\nSo we have forty eight point nine percent

field middle school it's located in a majority white neighborhood not far from downtown Charlotte but it's just in principle Eric heartfelt says the school students are mostly\nBlack and Hispanic so we got forty eight point nine percent are Hispanic forty four point five percent are African American four percent are white\nIt's not unusual for a public school in Charlotte to have a student body that's largely minority that's because many white students attend private schools or public schools outside their neighborhoods\nThat segregation hinders upward mobility James e for the former North Carolina teacher of the year is working with such fields administration to make the school more racially balanced\nFor now an education consultant says to local elementary schools have already emerged for that reason\nEventually something similar is going to pay the demographics you're going to shift quite a bit this majority black and brown now\nBut we're in the coming years that it changes are starting to look more like the neighborhood\nBut there's another challenge here beyond segregation it's the lack of social networks minority children need to succeed\nThe ... neighborhood is more

now doing worse than their counterparts from South side park\nFord says that might surprise some people\nWe may soon because the areas of flu like that's a high opportunity area when the truth is that

from making really smart and really intentional decisions so that twenty Thirty years not allowed to look and say yet that was the right call\nCharlotte is already taking significant steps in that

discoveries have led to a revolution in cancer treatment\nAnd nobody on the family have to fight the war to soften a Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine join the shame\n\nOf cancer treatment called immune checkpoint inhibitors with us in the studio to tell us more NPR science correspondent Richard Harris going Richard good morning so who are these two winters\nWell the prices being shared of course by James Allison he's a Seventy year old biologist who's now with the empty Anderson Cancer center in Houston and by ... at Kyoto University in Japan he's Seventy six now you know how some years the Nobel Prize comes it's a complete surprise not this year these names are on just about everybody shortly\nOK so not such a big shock uh but what exactly did these two scientists do\nWell I'll start with Jim Allison and back in the Nineteen nineties who was working at UC Berkeley and he was studying the immune system that's the system that keeps us healthy by attacking threats like bacteria viruses and even cancer so they came across a part of the immune system that actually holds the system and check sort of think of them is the brakes on the immune system\nAnd it occurred to him that if you could release the brakes may be the immune system would be more effective and attacking cancer and that indeed turned out to be the case here\nShock but what exactly did these two scientists do\nWell I'll start with Jim Allison and back in the Nineteen nineties he was working at UC Berkeley and he was studying the immune system that's the system that keeps us healthy by attacking threats like bacteria viruses and even cancer cells I came across a part of the immune system that actually holds the system and check sort of think of them is the brakes on the immune system\nAnd it occurred to him that if he could release the brakes maybe the immune system would be more effective in attacking cancer and that indeed turned out to be the case his observations led to in fact what's been called the revolution and cancer treatment\nIt would lead to a whole new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors you may her now that we've talked about them a fair amount on our air and today they're used in melanoma lung cancer a whole bunch of other cancers and the list is growing and growing and growing\nOkay so that's Jim Alice and the other scientists who is winning that's word ...\nYesterday and now that him oh hunter work independently of Jim Alison but he was also exploring the same biology molecules that put the brakes on the immune system response\nAnd he came across another set of molecules that do the same thing in his discovery he discovered these molecules called pd one and ... one of which have become prime targets for these checkpoint inhibitor drugs\nOne example one of these drugs that you may have heard about is a drug called ... true to nuts that goes on a attacks these things so it was a very similar line of reasoning and sort of biology but he found a different set of of of targets to attack and in some ways they're more effective\nTarget fascinating so how did these two independent but related discoveries ended up changing how ... how we think about cancer ...\nWell before the scientists made their discoveries cancer treatment was focused not entirely but more or less on killing or removing cancer cells and tumors so that could be with chemotherapy or surgery or radiation and all these treatments are still used and in many cases are still very effective treatments but there are many instances in which they don't work and these new\nOur line of reasoning and sort of biology but he found a different set of of of targets to attack and in some ways they're more effective target\nFascinating so how did these two

options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option these are\nNiche product always have been that's Doug badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIt's simply another choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products with them on the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years is\nBenefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak they're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to get people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option these are\nA niche product always have been\nThat's Doug badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIt's simply another choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products available in the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years is stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage\nMore than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which badger says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk\nPeople who think that they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want a backstop they may want something and they made by these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA policies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often\nNeed to use much medical care they may still want a backstop they may want something and they made by these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some and they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care and generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that the duck double has met\nSo people have something called health insurance um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs\nThese policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out the government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people Alison Kodjak NPR News [noise]\nSupport for your health comes from exact science is offering color guard for average risk adults over fifty a non invasive colon

quo you know there are two main parties here that have existed for decades and they will continue their control but the interesting thing is their opposition parties including one that didn't even exist in the last elections five years ago it seemed that young people\nAnd it looks like that party at least will do well here's an election observer named ... from the opposition ... party and older party explaining why he thought voters were rejecting those traditional parties\nThe most of us it's not just on a fever you have to be implemented in reality but fortunately sipping fought using the

those traditional parties\nThe most fun of people you have to be implemented in reality but fortunately for using the walkers and making things ...\nInside it must be almost lost\nAnd by then he means that he and a lot of voters I talked to frankly are frustrated over the lack of opportunity the fact that the party's control of the jobs lack of freedom for people not connected with those big parties\nSo what does that mean to ... was turn out good as a result of this frustration you were at polling stations right yeah that was a really\nInteresting thing because we went early in the morning and we stayed and we did not see a lot of people but the results that they're citing are\nActually pretty high I'm One of the big fears has always been fears of fraud there were allegations of widespread fraud in federal elections here in may in fact one of the party headquarters was attacked after\nSo one of the biggest parties the u._k. immediately said it was rejecting all the results but then they rescinded that\nSo here's one of the problems media were only allowed in a very few polling stations we got in one one of the approved polling stations and we were able\nTo watch them start to count some of the ballots so there is an election officials taking out each paper ballots [noise] because they decided not to do the automated valid counting because they think that leads to

violations or serious enough to put the results in question\nRight so I mean we've heard for generations I Hope the Kurds have been wanting their own state right so there's an ... an innate tension between\nThe Kurdish regional government and the central government in Baghdad so what how how could the new government in essentially Kurdistan affects the the relationship with Baghdad\nAbsolutely you've hit the nail on the head because they had a referendum last year saying do you want independence and the vast majority of Kurds said yes so the U.S says of course that it warned them not to

individual market a whole host of new options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to get people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option these are\nNiche product always have been\nThat's Doug badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIt's simply another choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products with them on the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years that stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage [noise] more than ... eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Penn\nThe Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies can find coverage more than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk\nPeople who think that they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want a backstop they may want something and they may buy these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some\nAnd they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care\nAnd generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that deductible is met so people have something called health insurance um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs these policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out the government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people\nAnd generally
