and I'm Rachel Martin it would be understandable if executives and Kentucky bourbon industry said they need a drink bourbon whiskey as the target of tariffs in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nNo coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a heart\nFor President Trump and the homeless Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world's greatest sources at the same reason we have the world's greatest bourbon\nKentucky system lump sum shelf that shell filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world's best whiskey how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nAnd oh it it it's getting to the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past seniors you're probably are global sales have been out\nPacing your domestic sales wow and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market navy officer\nFrom distorted a sealer but yes I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global market has really increased ever since we started with a free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements today well a nasty and the EU agreements\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem but at the same time we you know ... are starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate mhm and that's the point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what is\nThe same time we you know ... are starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate mhm and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and\nWell uh we don't like the options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks there's no doubt about it\nSo you're either going to pass along those costs a consumer and hopefully you know have people did you converted from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back a which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so the lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any other\nState of the obvious this is a state that voted for President Trump has voted for Republicans a lot that ask 'em when you have conversations with people do you run into people who were having conflicted feelings\nOr [noise] I think we all understand that there are no winners or a trade war and you know we're we didn't have for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why we know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much\nAh it come up as an issue yet you made an issue like an election yeah it has come up I mean congressman Barr has been very helpful to us in the past few months he\nSet up a meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky and the spring how does the vice president respond he you know being from Indiana he knows ... decades or he will not for the non geographically minded right across right across the river yes ah in in he told us he understood exactly that this would this mean for us\nBourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else\nYou can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called Burman thinks that that's a federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four Congress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States\nUnlike you know highly David sandwich announce it can move some production overseas we can't do that with bourbon you've got to make\nLucian declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States\nUnlike Harley Davidson which announced it can move some production overseas we can't do that with bourbon you've got to make it here\nIn American if he wants to sell you better making a\nBeginning of next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this hasn't been a yeah I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers or they'd be converted over the last few years suddenly if they start looking and from my standpoint if\nThe bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before you know we might lose people for our industry and if we lose them now than we might lose him for generations Eric\nGregory of Kentucky distillers association\nNext we turn to the effort to total damage from hurricane Michael which had Florida's panhandle last week NPR's Camila Domonoske reports since hurricane Michael hit impassable road than non functional phones and made life difficult for residents and rescue teams and for insurance adjuster ...\nJust on the outskirts of still forty miles across\n... works in the fried division of tower hill a Florida homeowner's insurance company over the weekend he caught a cell phone signal near Panama City there were still places it wasn't safe for his team to travel\nFor a situation like that we're relying aerial shots at ... at the site or look at it\nAnd it wasn't just buildings that were devastated by the storm\nA lot of areas for the last generation of temper poultry farms are hit pretty hard and the car industry is just devastated\nChris Chandler isn't adjuster with alpha insurance and Alabama he's been working in Houston county\nCaught was ready to be picked last week and a sixty Seventy a hundred miles per hour winds just blows it away but last April source of income\nScott was ready to be picked last week and a sixty Seventy a hundred mile per hour winds just blows it away but last April social drinker\nOur livelihood early estimate suggests this hurricane caused billions of dollars of damage Fitch Ratings says the insurance companies will have substantial cost but Fitch also says the industry has quote well positioned to absorb the losses\nAnd yeah that's what insurance companies are supposed to do but in Florida in particular every big storm raises worries that the industry will just fail\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to many companies went bankrupt or backed away from covering coastal areas so it's good news analysts say that's not likely to happen now the communities are still facing a long difficult recovery Chandler in Alabama says the damages upsetting\nYou wish that you could just snap your fingers and like everything\nBack to normal obviously that's not going to happen or you know when you're you're talking to people that houses have destroyed all their belongings showed her pictures no amount of money is going to get an image back of your of your patients that are passed away your child first birthday\nWhile some things are lost forever he says communities are already working together to start to rebuild Neil Diamond asking NPR News\n[noise] this is NPR News\n... across the country prison discipline comes down harder on winning you can get written for not closing your doors you get written up for jumping on the phone without permission and those low level infractions can have severe consequences like more time\nJust the way the Democrats in Congress President Obama's legislative agenda die the minute canter and his fellow Republicans took over when they won the house in twenty ten\nLike it's no fun to be in perpetual minority I can tell you that and especially in the house where a simple majority gives you almost absolute power\nTo again sets the agenda and get bills across the floor that will greatly affect the willingness for some who have been at it for a long time and make the decision whether maybe they should retire or not\nCantor things more Republicans will head for the exits if they lose but Karl Rove former top advisor to President George W. Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and um\nThe President George W. Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and embolden there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be over because what if the Democrats taken by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts at opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks and Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump being base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently at forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause he's at eighty or Ninety Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nFirst thing they'll say the morning after the election as we are dedicated to luxury election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding gal and if they mandates\nThe first thing they'll say the morning after the election is we're dedicated electric re election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding go\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern\nThat means funding of all replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security accomplishments that are looted them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrow

Steve Inskeep kind I'm Rachel Martin Newt Gingrich will tell you he saw something and Donald Trump early on and made him believe Trump could win the presidency\nAnd that's something Gingrich saw\nHas a lot to do with how he sees himself the former speaker of the house made a name for himself by breaking a lot of political norms and refusing to compromise with the other side\nMuch like President Trump the Atlantic magazine's McKay cop and spend some time with Newt Gingrich recently for profile he did it is called Newt Gingrich says You're welcome the cake up and says in our studio this morning thanks for coming in thanks for having me\nSo you went to spend some time with Newt Gingrich\nAnd he suggested suggested that you do so at the Philadelphia Zoo\n[laughter] that's right how come well he is a famous uh animal lover or he's you know donated disease around the world he loves animals but I think also what became clear to me as I got there\nIs that he sees animals as useful metaphors for him as we were kind of touring the zoo he was you know pointing out the lions and saying you know this is what the lions teach us about gender politics and this is what a crocodiles teach us about uh about the way that we should pursue change\nWhat was most interesting to me though at one point he was talking about chimpanzees or and\nKind of how how vicious they are or how aggressive they are and you know I said I didn't really know what to say so I said you know oh there's the viciousness of the animal world a new kind of\nCaught me off and was very stern and said it's not vicious it's natural right and and I think that he draws those parallels with how he abused politics and how he abused human affairs in June\nStern and said it's not vicious it's natural right and and I think that he draws those parallels with how he abused politics and how you've used human affairs in general\nAnd he likens himself to other conservative leader she basically described to you for waves of contemporary conservative politics a Barry Goldwater responsible for one of 'em Ronald Reagan Gingrich himself and now President Trump does he see each of these waves that's connected to to the previous well he does\nBut what's interesting is that when you press them on that you know why why how are all of these connected because you could make a case that philosophically they're all quite different\nUm what he said to me was you know basically they're all anti liberal which I think actually illustrates a broader point about the politics that Gingrich helped create which is\nIt's tribal in nature partisan and nature and driven especially by negative partisanship it's about a desire to beat the other team more than it is accomplished some unified goal\nIt is a zero sum it's totally versus them President Trump was on sixty minutes last night talking about what a nasty place Washington DC is the back stabbing the duplicitous and almost in the same breath he said I feel very comfortable [laughter] uh was was Gingrich as comfortable swimming in this one he\nWas I mean a lot of ways he created the swamp that the Trump now says he's trying to drain right\nI'm ... and you know I think that this is actually one of the things that Gingrich likes most about Trump when\nYou try to get them to talk about Trump is andme or or the brand of conservatism that the president stands for what he talks about most is the personality and the larger than life style and how how cutthroat he can be that's what Gingrich likes about Trump and I think that says a lot about his worldview\nTo what end though I mean where Democrats a poor the idea of what Trump has right in terms of our political discourse erosion of norms undermining of institutions does Gingrich see all this as a long awaited political break through\nYou know totally I think\nScores erosion of norms undermining of institutions says Gingrich see all this as a long awaited political break through\nYou know totally I think that in in the big scheme of things she actually likes that our politics has gotten more tribal and more vicious and has kind of shed a lot of these civilized and traits he thinks that it should be two teams you know duking it out and ... and that's how he or she sees the world and he's happy that it's gotten to where it is\nFunding for K. and hey you comes from Humphrey some it's

he got a flu shot for NPR News I'm Bram Sable Smith\nIf you step on the sidewalk outside the NPR headquarters you may have to be careful not to trip over an electric scooter sitting there waiting for

San Francisco general and an assistant professor at UC SF California has welcomed e scooters even changing the law so writers don't have to wear helmets whereas other places like the city of Seattle are concerned enough about injuries that they're not allowing them at all\nWhen they enter the sector of transportation that's also entering the sector public health so it becomes a different ball game and we need to make sure that we're doing it safely\nIn San Francisco Juilliard as part of the city's injury prevention collaborative which is collecting data on each other injuries are they happening at particular intersections our people fracturing goals or sprained ankles or are some types of scooters more dangerous than others\nSo you have to look at the patterns to see where the the trends are and where the low hanging fruit are\nAs a trauma surgeon Juilliard has seen the dangers but she also sees the potential because San Francisco is a city dealing with a lot of car traffic and

home\nBut Portland wants to make sure these innovations meet all of the city's transportation goals moving people efficiently cutting emissions and making each trip as safe as possible\nFor the same time we're seeing a rise in injuries but we also see that people are getting out of their car and potentially helping to relieve congestion you know is that a trade off\nSimple if at the same time we're seeing a rise in injuries but we also see that people are getting out of their car and potentially helping to relieve congestion you know is that a trade off from a public agency standpoint that we think is a good one I don't know we don't know yet\nPortland of course does not want the rise and injuries they're handing out free helmets and doing a public education campaign [noise]\nBut you only have to look at the ... going by to see that this is a big change cars and scooters are still learning how to be around each other and not many people are wearing helmets cities and physicians

Inskeep\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin it would be understandable if executives and Kentucky bourbon industry said they need a drink bourbon whiskey as the target of terrorists in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nSame reasons why we have the world's resources at the same reason where the world's greatest bourbon\nKentucky system lump sum show\nThem I'm show filters out the water\nTakes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world with how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been ah we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six countries so at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry\nNow than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nOr it it it's getting to the point where it's it's more than ... percent of of the bigger players um but uh in the past seniors you're probably global sales have been out pacing\nYour domestic sales while and just to just to be clear on that fact that you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over\n... from the ... but yes I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements well a nap to any you agreements\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem or but at the same time we you know ... are starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate mhm and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and\nWell ah we don't like any options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks there's no doubt about it\nSo you're either going to pass along those costs a consumer and hopefully you know have people that you've converting from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back a which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any other\nState of the obvious as a state that voted for president that has voted for Republicans a lot could ask 'em when you have conversations with people do you run into people who were having conflicted feelings\nAre I think we all understand that there are no winners or a trade war\nSessions with people do you run into people who were having conflicted feelings\nAre I think we all understand or know winters are a trade war and you know we're we didn't have for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why you know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much ah it come up as an\nIssue do you mean an issue like an election yeah it has come up I mean congressman Barr has been very helpful to us in the past few months he\nSet up a meeting with a vice president Pence when he came to Kentucky in the spring how does the vice president response he you know being from Indiana he knows ... Kentucky or he will note for the non geographically minded right across the river yes ah in and he told us he understood exactly that this would this district mean for us\nBourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else\nYou can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thanks and that's a federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States unlike Harley Davidson which announced it can move some production overseas we can't do that with bourbon you've got to make it here in America if you want to sell you better making jak beginning of next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this hasn't been\nA I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they start looking and from my standpoint if the bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink\nAnd what they were drinking before you know we might lose people bar industry and if we lose them now than we might lose him for generation Eric\nGregory Kentucky distillers association\nWe turn to the effort to total the damage from hurricane Michael ...

Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and emboldened there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be emboldened because what if the Democrats take by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts in opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere will be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think\nOccasions director for the RMC it could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump the base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently at forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause he's at eighty eight or Ninety or Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning after the election as we're dedicated to the luxury election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding gal\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern that means funding of all replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security\nAccomplishments that eluded them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrow majority making

Goldwater responsible for one of them Ronald Reagan Gingrich himself and now President Trump does he see each of these waves that's connected to to the previous\nWell he does but what's interesting is that when you press them on that you know why why how are all these connected because you can make a case that philosophically they're all quite different\nUm what he said to me was you know basically they're all anti liberal which I think actually illustrates a broader point about the politics that Gingrich helped create which is it's tribal in nature partisan in nature and driven especially by negative partisanship it's about a desire to\nUh the politics that Gingrich helped create which is it's tribal in nature partisan and nature and driven especially by negative partisanship it's about a desire to beat the other team more than it is accomplished some unified goal\nIt is a zero sum it's totally versus them President Trump was on sixty minutes last night talking about what a nasty place Washington DC is the backstabbing complicity and almost in the same breath he said I feel very comfortable uh was was Gingrich as comfortable swimming in this one he\nWas I mean a lot of ways he created the swamp that the Trump now says he's trying to drain right\nI'm ... and you know I think that this is actually one of the things that Gingrich likes most about Trump when\nYou try to get them to talk about Trump is andme or or the brand of conservatism that the president stands for what he talks about most is the personality and the larger than life style and how how cutthroat he can be that's what Gingrich likes about Trump and I think that says a lot about his worldview\nTo what end though I mean whereas Democrats a poor the idea of what Trump has right in terms of our political discourse erosion of norms undermining of institutions does Gingrich see all this as a long awaited political break through\nYou know totally I think that in in the big scheme of things she actually likes that our politics has gotten more tribal and more vicious and has kind of shed a lot of these civilized and traits he thinks that it should be two teams you know duking it out and ... and that's how he uh he sees the world and he's happy that it's gotten to where it is\n\nMORNING EDITION on Arizona Public radio news headlines are coming up in Ninety second\n[noise]\nFrom northern Arizona
