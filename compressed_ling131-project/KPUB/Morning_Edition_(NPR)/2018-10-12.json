absurd flippers and this awkward mask\nAnd does her research by reading the book of net is right and then finds this ladder that's always hanging off the edge of this boat and she goes down to this watery world this really unknown place and it takes so much courage for her to go survey this rack but\nThe thing about the pollen that is so beautiful aside from the water imagery which is lovely\nIs the hope uh that comes out at the end you'll notice that at one point the narrator becomes hole and this poem is is a hopeful for that reason because I feel like the more we hear and break the silence around sexual assault or\nThe more hopeful I Am anyway ah that that things will improve both a bone diving into the wreck version of having read the book I met\nUnloaded the camera and check the edge

black I'm blacking out and yet my mask is powerful it pumps my blood with power\nThe sea is another story\nThe sea is not a question of power\nI have to learn a loan to turn my body without forcing
