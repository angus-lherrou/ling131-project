nationwide election more than two thousand five hundred candidates for two hundred and forty nine seats in parliament\nCandidates of all all flavors uh and philosophies ah there was lots of excitement about the election but also lots of concern and worry partly because of threats by the Taliban which has now come through\nA and partly the widespread of widespread charges on that there was going to be massive fraud\nSo you've seen a lot of a positive uh campaigning lot of new fresh faces a lot of enthusiasm\nBut also a great deal of of worry a A N and an anxiety at the same time\nSo you've been

both sides of the aisle that really do want to work together that this divisive mess I really want to believe that that's not who we are as a nation\nBecause it's it's amazing just as a journalist who watches these debates from afar um it seems like so quickly\nYou're labeled as someone who just wants to protect immigrants in this country doesn't care about the safety of people and people on the other side are labeled as racist and there's just no way to to actually build bridges\nThat is how it looks if you're reading things on the Internet but if you're out there in the community and you're walking with us you'll see that there's far more than it does bring us together than divides us\nAnd so you'd be ready to to to settle people down who were just calling the president racist and say

Congress to propose the voting rights act he outlined some of the bill's provisions\nFinally this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting\nBut even though when it comes to voter registration laws there is a good deal of confusion and in some cases controversy here's Noel King with commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions about how politics and the government work\nAhead of this year's election some states have already closed voter registration while other states allow people to register at their polling places on election day what is the deal with this patchwork system what is the deal is going to jail All right here's our first listener question\nThis is claiming a heart from San Francisco California I'd like to ask Cokie whether voter registration laws were controversial before the voting rights act in Nineteen sixty five how was the last changed since the Supreme Court granted black citizens the right to vote of white citizens' based barriers to voter registration\nBasic answer is yes voter registration laws were controversial at first people staffing the polls were just expected to know everybody didn't in their neighborhood\nBut then in Eighteen hundred Massachusetts instituted the first voter registration\nAnd as the century moved on it became more widespread partly in a move to make sure that non citizen immigrants didn't vote by the late Nineteen early twentieth century is a rural dominated state legislatures impose registration on city voters again it was named immigrants and at fraud by ...\nLate nineteenth early twentieth century is a rural dominated state legislatures impose registration on city voters again it was named immigrants and at fraud by big city political machines\nAnd what about the rest of her question there what about the effects on black citizens versus white citizens' well\nOf course black men were given the right to vote in the fifteenth amendment and Eighteen Seventy but at the Jim Crow laws and the south effectively\nStripped African Americans of their voting rights in terms of rights of course white women and black women couldn't vote nationally until the nineties amendment and Nineteen twenty but you know before the sixty five ... a lot of whites in the south couldn't vote either just because the registration frozen the roles they didn't want anybody new voting\nAll right we have a couple of questions about current controversies\nMy name is Rachel ... from Shaker Heights Ohio why as a candidate for governor allowed to purge voter rolls shouldn't he recused himself a secretary of state while he's a candidate\nBut I assume this is in reference to Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp who is the current secretary of state and this and thinking about refusing himself he's provoked a lawsuit by buddy more than fifty thousand new voter applications on hold for minor inconsistencies\nThe lawsuit charges discrimination saying eighty percent of those applicants are members of racial minority groups\nThough they can't vote early or by mail they can still vote if they show up the right polling place with the proper ID\nOkay that that idea of proper ID that gets right to our next question Hi my name is Amy ... and I live in Omaha Nebraska\nWhen I heard about the Supreme Court ruling the ideas for voting would need to have a street address it didn't faze me then I heard that a lot of Native Americans on reservations only have a post office address how is that going to affect their ability to vote\nThey're complaining about it this has to do with the recent Supreme Court decision upholding in North Dakota voter id law does require a current residential street address Native American groups say that\nCourt decision upholding in North Dakota voter id law does require current residential street address Native American groups say that off and on reservations they don't have those and

thought of Trump because we haven't talked about that so is this the first time yeah and I have a surprise 'cause then I'll have a conversation about the other stuff that he does against the media\nAgainst like just civil society we grow up knowing how on democratic Vietnam is the crackdowns on freedom of the press on basic human rights\nWomen don't have the same rights there and to see some of that happening now in America you know in some factions of government is scary because that was something that I never would imagine\nWe will be in a situation where we have a president basically calling to press the enemy of the people like we hear that from communist Vietnam but we don't hear a you know I Would never have imagined that would be reality here today\nCould you say that you're dead and yeah I'm just I just wonder why when Trump calls the media enemy of the people what your reaction to that\nMenu ally like all gold gold and yelled out you know ...\nTo ... to ... talk about what these changes\nBut they don't care about the food and\nYou're just has so yeah CNN or didn't drum riff off for both him\nSo they're not there by us yeah Fox News clearly is by it and I

conversations that yeah the go really badly in I mean people get it from the table yeah it I mean this is it doesn't seem to be happening in this\nNo because I don't think our country should be torn apart because of one person\nI clearly have strongly against you know what the president stands for\nBut I also believe it's important to me I respect my parents I Know what their experience has been and and we came here so that we can have the freedom to have different views to have these kind of conversation because they don't happen in Vietnam and so the fact that my dad has a different view from me on this particular issue that doesn't bother him because we have that freedom that's why my parents let Vietnam to be here in the first place\nEverybody\nGot to go to vote yes you both for

that are run attack that left to senior officials dead including a top police chief\nPamela constable covers Afghanistan for the Washington Post and she's on the line walking to the program\nI'm Glad to be with you I guess we should figure out what was supposed to happen this weekend what is the original plan what's at stake and what's the campaigning bin Laden\n[noise] um the original plan was to have a very\nNationwide election more than two thousand five hundred candidates for two hundred and forty nine seats in parliament candidates of all all flavors and philosophies\nAh there was lots of excitement about the election but also lots of concern and worry partly because of threats by the column on which has now come true awe and partly widespread of widespread charges on that there was going to be massive fraud\nOn which has now come true well and partly\nAs widespread of widespread charges on that there was going to be massive fraud so you've seen a lot of positive uh campaigning a lot of new fresh faces a lot of enthusiasm but also a great deal of of worry a and and and anxiety at the same time\nSo you've been reporting in Kandahar Province really large important province the voting will be delayed for a week broke his nose rings a question what is possibly going to be any different a week\n[noise] right and we don't know that obviously this is a a a measure of taken on an emergency basis um just to to sort of calm things down I mean kind of hard to very large province which is just lost\nIts police have its intelligence chase and its governor has been gravely wounded um there's a huge security vacuum people are very nervous and worried so I think this is obviously a measure designed for short term relief of that\nI'm obviously decision will be made later on I I Would think and hope that that elections can be held there because it's a as you say very populist lots and lots of voters um but let's let's see what happens tomorrow um let's see if there's violence elsewhere or not\nUm and to what extent that happens how how bad it is I suspect a generally speaking out they're going to be taking famous one day at a time here\nDoes you'd feeling the rest of the country ... like a democratic process ... do you feel like you're in the middle of a reelection campaign where the people's will my ...\nI Do it does a it's been it's been a a a nice experience so to

loudspeaker trucks but you have not seen a massive public rallies a few have been held in the provinces and some of those have\nBeen attacked I'm so and and as we mentioned earlier that you had

from NPR News I'm David Greene and I'm Steve Inskeep in Nineteen sixty five when President Lyndon Johnson went to Congress to propose the voting rights act he outlined some of the bill's provisions\nFinally this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting\nBut even now when it comes to voter registration laws there is a good deal of confusion and in some cases controversy here's Noel King with commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions about how politics\nGood deal of confusion and in some cases controversy here's Noel King with commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions about our politics and government work\nAhead of this year's election some states have already closed voter registration while other states allow people to register at their polling places on election day what is the deal with this patchwork system what is the deal is going to jail All right here's our first listener question\nThis is ... heart from San Francisco California I'd like to ask Cokie whether voter registration laws were controversial before the voting rights act in Nineteen sixty five Howard last changed since the Supreme Court granted black citizens the right to vote of white citizen ... barriers to voter registration\nThe basic answer is yes voter registration laws were controversial at first people staffing the POWs were just expected to know everybody didn't in their neighborhood but then an Eighteen hundred Massachusetts instituted the first voter registration\nAnd as a century moved on it became more widespread partly in a move to make sure that non citizen immigrants didn't vote by the late Nineteen early twentieth century is a rural dominated state legislatures impose registration on city voters again it was named immigrants and at fraud by makes any political machines\nAnd what about the rest of her question there what about the effects on black citizens versus white citizens'\nWell of course black men were given the right to vote in the fifties amendment and Eighteen Seventy but the Jim Crow laws in the south effectively stripped African Americans of their voting rights in terms of rights of course white women and black women\nCouldn't vote nationally until the nineties amendment in Nineteen twenty but you know before the sixty five bill a lot of whites in the south couldn't vote either just because the registration frozen the roles they didn't want anybody new voting\nAll right we have a couple of questions about current controversies my name is Rachel ... from Shaker Heights Ohio why is a candidate for governor allow\nAll right we have a couple of questions about current controversies\nMy name is Rachel ... from Shaker Heights Ohio why is the candidate for governor allowed to purge voter rolls shouldn't he recused himself a secretary of state law he's a candidate\nBy assume this is in reference to Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp who is the current secretary of state and this and thinking about ... himself he's provoked a lawsuit by buddy more than fifty thousand new voter applications on hold for minor inconsistencies\nThe lawsuit charges discrimination saying eighty percent of those applicants are members of racial minority groups\nThough they can't vote early or by mail they can still vote if they show up the right polling place with the proper ID\nOkay that that idea of proper ID that gets right to our next question Hi my name is Amy payment chart and I live in Omaha Nebraska when I heard about the Supreme Court ruling the ideas for voting would need to have a street address it didn't faze me\nAnd I heard that a lot of Native Americans on reservations only have a post office address how is that going to affect their ability to vote\nWell they're complaining about it this has to do with the recent Supreme Court decision upholding in North Dakota voter id law which does require a current residential street address Native American groups say that off and on reservations they don't have those and pointing icy irony that the nation's original residents are being questioned about their

really they their lives or hear their communities here they go to a Vietnamese math they go to their customers are meeting these are our ... our diverse\nNow I realize my experience as an American very different from my dad\nThese generational differences extend into politics older Vietnamese Americans have tended to vote Republican many of them fled communism and they see Republican presidents from Reagan on as being tougher on communist leaders some younger people like ten term trends have been leaning more democratic and that is one reason\nThe party believe they can unseat the Republican

didn't realize how he he thought of trying to we haven't talked about that is the first time yeah and I had a surprise 'cause then I'll have a conversation about the other\nStuff that he does against the media\nAgainst like just civil society we grow up knowing how I'm democratic Vietnam as the crackdowns on freedom of press on basic human rights women don't have the same rights there and to see some of that happening now in America you know in some factions of government is scary because that was something that I never really a match as\nWe would be in a situation where we have a prize said basically\nIn America you know in some factions of government is scary because that was something that I never would imagine we will be in a situation where we have a president that basically calling to press the enemy of the people like we hear that from communist Vietnam but we don't hear a you know I Would never have imagined that would be reality here today\nCould you say that you're dead and yeah I'm just I just wonder why when Trump calls the media enemy of the people what your reaction is to that\nMenu Hawaiian like all the whole goal and yelled out GM degrees\nOr some time to press talk about what these changes\nBut they don't care about the truth and\nYou're just has CNN events drum riff off so both him\nSo they're not there by us yeah Fox News clearly as fire and I don't know if you're does is\nThe al ... defend a law I think it allows apple I'm Trump boxes like try to you know make a phone [laughter]\nYou think you think the media\nIs too negative about Trump that\nHe's not fair\nTo say that Russia interfered in through the election in this country mhm\nBut when they know that was said oh I shouldn't before the election [noise] the way until room both elected in the

happening in this\nNo because I don't think our country should be torn apart because of one person\nI clearly him strongly against you know what the president stands for\nBut I also believe it's important to me I respect my parents I Know what their experience has been and and we came here so that we can have the freedom to have different views to have this kind of conversations 'cause they don't happen in Vietnam and so the fact that my dad has a different view from me on this particular issue that doesn't bother him because we have that freedom that's why my parents' lead Vietnam to be
