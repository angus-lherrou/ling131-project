percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area\nEven if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nI just did the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than this patient as being left with to pay out of pocket so the ... still doesn't make sense to me in the end\nThis entire bill and only slightly more than this patient as being left with to pay out of pocket so the mass still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand

says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'd be worth it for ... five star hotel maybe not\nOr that reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such inexpensive to Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for our partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin\nTest [noise] uh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nOut of sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advising you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive\nTo live well no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are\nWhich is just inexpensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems\nIn the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so with everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think well the allergy tests\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain\nTo say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars\nSo I think we have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news

party candidate Fernando ... so comprehensively I should say the most amount of himself insist the survival dumped democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted and afterwards he read out part of the constitution to

is a kind of test out of sophisticated level that you could do at a more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with\nSophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more ...\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems in the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead\nBasically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so with everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain\nTo say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much\nThings [noise]\nSupport for NPR health\nAll of Kaiser Health news thank you so much\nThanks

what's important to round the world\nAnd Georgia the most populous state with strict voter ID laws has the most transgender people at risk of this confusion about twenty thousand that's according to report from the Williams Institute at UCLA Jody Herman is one of its authors\nTrans people are in a unique position that there is a whole administrative system governing how trans people are able to get accurate IDs\nEach state handles gender and name changes differently in Georgia a judge has to approve a name change to change the gender marker on your driver's license you needed doctors letter saying you've had gender reassignment surgery\nThe problem is that there are different kinds of transgender surgeries and some trans people don't get any surgery at all Chanel Haley works for Georgia quality which advocates for the L GB teach community she says the Georgia process leads room for objective interpretation by judges and DMV employees\nThat's where the robot will come in mostly and so if you want to get even more people to that that is really more about your passport\nHaley and a coalition of Georgians are lobbying to change the driver services policy [noise]\nTransgender woman\n... is studying to be a social worker in Kennesaw north of Atlanta she and hundreds of others gather for the transgender march in Atlanta Pride earlier this month\nManaged to change her name after finding a judge he knew was trans friendly but not her gender marker since she didn't get the surgery she says that won't stop her from voting and November\nSometimes I can just show someone my ID and had my finger over the gender marker and they don't even look\nI Am very fortunate that some people can't tell that I'm trans\nFinger over the gender marker and they don't even like\nI Am very fortunate that some people can't tell that I'm trans\nSo sometimes I can just resign\nElections officials in Fulton County where Atlanta is safe poll workers aren't supposed to check for gender but every county trains coworkers differently there is a workaround for gender markers getting a passport because the federal government does not require the surgery\nThat's another hurdle though and costs time and money Christian O'Neil is a transgender woman from Atlanta who was also at pride at Georgia judge rejected her name change even though she's been living as a woman for years\nIt's going to be really difficult to to save up any money which sucks because like I Love to have a name that actually matches when I go by and like\nI Love to have a gender like or that matched what I Am\nBecause of that mismatch she sometimes faces skepticism and hostility and she has to show ID\nIt hurts a lot and then you definitely do feel like a like Georgia doesn't really care about about a chance to be cool\nBut despite the difficulty O'Neill still plans to vote in this election for NPR News I'm Emma hurt in Atlanta\nAnd let's look ahead to all things considered later this afternoon

deep into the night yesterday after the retired army captain sailed to victory in yesterday's runoff election he will take office on the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy\nAnd let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and they ... for the restoration of national pride\nAnd I think that it helps explain why both not defeated the workers' party candidate Fernando ... so comprehensively\nI should say the most amount of himself insist the survival dumped democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution but\nHe is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty read out part of the constitution to reporters about the need

it's a young democracy and it's a central issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an an corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not as home Andrea\n... rainy on that he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any races and I don't believe that I think he's really good guy\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as he's promised to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said does he have a game plan to do that when\nHe wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force than they do they were ready\nPeople hit David are sick of robberies and the sky high moody right yet the prospect of more guns and more police violence those are concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a federal court or senior last night which is a sprawling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are especially the poor people than minority\nOkay so both concern and

Arizona Public radio can you know you at seven forty five on Monday October twenty ninth I'm Aaron ... things for tuning in now a report from the United nations Intergovernmental Panel on climate change says the planet has already warmed by one degree Celsius\nResearch found it was due to human activity since the industrial revolution and it's on track to get even hotter thousands of experts contributed to the reports which warns the world's carbon emissions need to reach net zero by the you're twenty fifty\nTo avoid catastrophic environmental changes Cain used most assuming he spoke with northern Arizona university scientist Christina ... about the findings\nSo what kind of changes are we seeing from climate change here in Arizona\nA match and if you have any more days in Phoenix for example the temperatures go at that one hundred degrees Fahrenheit and there will be even more when it goes about scientific team so we have this already now sometimes in the summer and it's not pleasant and if we have even more you have\nReally skyrocketing\nIt's already now sometimes in the summer and it's not pleasant and if we have even more you have\nReally skyrocketing air conditioning costs for example\nAnd other aspect is that the water supply and Arizona is going to change drastically and it's going to become very unreliable every place we'll see some form of climate change it will not be the same in every location but there's literally no one who will not be affected by climate change\nSo we're talking about um things that affect our economy um things that affect tourism for example um but also some of these things are potentially life threatening things like heat waves\nYes he drew it can be very life threatening and the problem with that is that you can have your car air condition and you has air conditioned but it will cost you a lot more in the future and not everyone can afford that and I think that's a really important aspect of climate change as well there is this so called climate injustice\nWhich means which people can probably cope with it to some extent better than those that have very little money\nRight yeah the report really emphasized but not everybody's going to feel the effects of climate change equally\nThat is very true and that\nI also think it's important to say that here in Flagstaff we may not be affected so much by sea level rise but there are millions of people worldwide that are affected by sea level rise and they often are\nAmongst the poorest yeah the climate injustice topic is very difficult on there is a moral aspect to it I think\nThis issue has kind of a sense of urgency because of that do you think we can make the changes we need to make by twenty fifty\nYes we we can make the changes\nWe have to make them soon he needed late basically and I think what is important is to you know it's not a geophysical impossibility so we can still do it but\nIt needs a joint effort of governments\nImportant is to you know it's not a geophysical impossibility so we can still do it but it needs a joint effort of governments industry and society and we cannot rely on others to do something we have to do it ourselves\nWhat we're talking about these are really big processes and I think a lot of people when they are here about climate change it feels like it's too big of an issue like there's just nothing they can do how do how do you personally deal with that\nI sometimes feel despair as well and I'm sometimes also overwhelmed by the topic but then I also realize just\nBeing depressed about it it's not going to change anything and there are things that every person can do that if we all do it it actually it really makes a big difference and stuff for example I tried to bike to work and ah I

where and then they use some kind of medical tape and they tape these plastic capsules to your back that's it Winston left and then came back two days later and they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nTurns out Winston was allergic to eleven substances they test it she was so relieved to have answers but then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in

insurer Anthem Blue cross agreed to a negotiated rate of fourteen thousand dollars the company says it tries to strike a balance between affordability and provider choices\nBut ... says that's still really high the math just doesn't add up ... says the customary charged for this test is thirty five dollars that includes a twenty six percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area\nEven if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nOr just do the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than this patients being left with to pay out of pocket so the ... still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she hated that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nI Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano oh and on this last visit I saw mano grams embroidered pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases\nEmbroider pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases and that grand piano\nWinston says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'd be worth it for ... five star hotel maybe not\nOr they're reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive through Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief or partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\n[noise] uh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is the kind of test\nAt a sophisticated level that you could do at a more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems\nIn the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so with everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nNot about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position\nHigh prices they all get away with charging high prices it's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do well there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive\nAsk what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain\nTo say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much\nThanks [noise]\nSupport for NPR health coverage
