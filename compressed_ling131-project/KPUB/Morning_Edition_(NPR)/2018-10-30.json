Inskeep\nA group of migrants is moving slowly through Mexico toward the U.S border this President Trump plans to move roughly five thousand troops to that border\nAt rallies for Republican candidates the president has explicitly put the distant caravan at the center of the election campaign and election theme he continued last night on Fox\nThousands and thousands of people in the bridge when you looked at that bridge loaded up with maple that's called an invasion of our country\nThe president was apparently referring to a bridge more than one thousand miles outside the United states\nWith that said there is a group of several thousand migrants and there are varying descriptions of the group's size and purpose so let's check on the latest facts yesterday on this program we heard from Mexico's ambassador to the United states who said the group was smaller than otherwise reported\nAbout thirty five hundred people he said with some of them accepting asylum offers\nTo stay in Mexico we've next called journalist David ... who was recently with the group to ask what the proper number could be\nNobody knows for sure the obviously the official number that was given at the time the last week was thirty six hundred with a and just yesterday the interior minister said about Eighteen hundred Ninety five people\nHad applied for asylum another five hundred asked to go home voluntarily mirrors along the route had put the number it closer to six thousand or not which is based because on the number of people that they were serving a because they're obviously providing a lot of food and uh obviously assistance for the migrants so nobody knows for sure but it would probably be higher than\nUh okay so it may be higher than thirty five hundred of according to the best information that you have I guess\nSo nobody knows for sure but it would probably be higher than\nThe okay so it may be higher than thirty five hundred of according to the best information that you have I guess the next question is how many are truly determined to pass on to the United states given that they have this Mexican offer of asylum\nEveryone at a I spoke with was determined to reach the United states of all the people I spoke with only two said they were interested in staying in Mexico one person couldn't cross the border and just wanted to be closer to the U.S children or the others were wanting to work in northern Mexico\nYou mentioned that you did not encounter very many people accepting this offer of asylum the Mexican authorities have given a fairly substantial number of people who have accepted the offer it could be that you would not have run into those people because they've already left the caravan\nThat's possible I mean one thing I I came across for example in in in one city the city of weeks that was closer to the border with bought him all the people\nAre I remember the mayor saying that they had a people who'd accepted trips to to go home again voluntary repatriation and\nAmong that group it was people who just found that their children were unable to continue with the trip [noise] um [noise] but ... it just seems like those numbers in in every destination when we would ask the mayor's would say is just a small number it was always less than\nA usually less than a hundred that would that would take up this offer of of leaving the trip\nAnd what makes them determined to reach the United states as opposed to safety in Mexico\nUm interesting question that everyone says that are in the United states they can get ahead faster people they they say multiple factors for leaving violence poverty [noise]\nAh and also family reunification so there's a combination of people that their parents or their children are in the United

in my wallet and I confronted him about it and he of course denied but it got to the point where he would hug me good night and then with one hand going back per se you know I'll let you know as I was reading in bed you know it was very heartbreaking at that point when I realized what was\nGoing on was there a rock bottom for him\nNot right away I Know this went on for a while my father had passed away during this time period and through getting through the grief of that I didn't realize that my son knew my dad's ATM password and emptied out the bank account\nUm while you're ... and his grandfather my father's yeah because I was the executive tricks at that uh\nThe state and yeah he was just whatever he could get his hands on at that time he was just\nGoing full bore so he ended up moving to Baltimore from Florida right\nI had friends in Hagerstown, Maryland where we had ... for short period of time and he agreed to go into rehab and they said the best help would be in Baltimore and that's how we ended up in Baltimore because they had a lot of programs for people\nAnd after I dropped him off he didn't even the last two days and he got kicked out because he was combative he did not want to be there and he ended up on the street he was homeless yeah he was homeless for almost three years\nAnd you know there's only so much one person can do but I felt if I gave up on him and he would have nobody\nIt was the lowest point of my life with my child I mean I I was losing him and I could tell I was losing him and then somewhere along the way I heard something that just resonated with me it said\nLosing him and I could tell I was losing him\nAnd then somewhere along the way I heard something that just resonated with me it said a mother can only be as happy as are unhappy is child\nAnd I told them are of that and he cried and I think maybe that planted a seat because after that I could see that he wanted to do some things to get better he's actually enrolled into a methadone program\nAnd I honestly don't even know what that catalyst for this whole thing was what it took for him to want to say enough is enough buddies health fees gained thirty pounds\nHe
