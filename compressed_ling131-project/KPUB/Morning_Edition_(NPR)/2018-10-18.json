mentioned for another portion of the northern Arizona have seen some pretty significant snowfall including the San Francisco piece which just looked beautiful uh and they are at six plus inches of

think there's any\nCorrelation here with a with what's going to happen in winter well I think it's definitely\nA good sign that the storm track is active and uh\nDon't know how correlated they actually are you know I mean\nI'm it would be interesting to look at a hundred years I'm does a wet fall lead into a wet winter um but I don't have that data set my feeling is that they probably are correlated somewhat but it does not for sure I mean we're going into a wet winter in fact you know this\nFirst very active half of the month with storms is are gonna fade away we have one more little store system this weekend with uh some showers and thunderstorms it's a mild storm not going to bring any snow fall the region or anything and temperatures are actually going to be warmer than where they are or the next couple of days under sunshine\nBut we will see some showers and thunderstorms but then going into the second half of October things really quiet down for us here so ah which it does\nNext couple of days under sunshine but we will see some showers and thunderstorms but then going into the second half of October things really quiet down for us here so uh which doesn't mean anything about winter either and you know we are going into a week El Nino\nType a pattern here going in a winner which would kilter odds a little bit towards I a wetter than average winter and so we'll hope for that but it's hard to predict that stuff because I mean we've had an El Nino is just in in in recent memory where\nIt's been dry during an El Nino oh you're so right I mean we had the
