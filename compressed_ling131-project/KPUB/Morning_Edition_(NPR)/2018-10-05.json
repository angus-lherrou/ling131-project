in the United States Senate to end the debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court clears that hurdle the final vote would likely be sometime tomorrow\nSenators are giving some closing arguments now we'll go to one of those and just a few seconds but first NPR's Scott Detrow who's in our studios and who covers\nCongress this year and Scott would you just remind us what the vote tally is so far as anybody knows\nTherefore key votes here who have not said whether whether they're going to vote yes or no that's Republican Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin we know that Joe mansion isn't going to announce his vote until he's on the Senate floor we're hearing indications that is the case for Susan Collins as well\nAnd one key thing to keep in mind is that this is not the final vote the Republicans especially may vote yesterday but not necessarily not not necessarily yes over the weekend could vinyl say\nOkay fine I'll end debate but I'm not going to vote for this guy and it sounds like if there is for key votes this is going to be close they're going to guess forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one maybe fifty two at the absolute most ah let's go back to Dianne Feinstein she is the California Democrat who is the senior\nAnd we know that Joe Manchin isn't going to announce his vote until he's on the Senate floor we're hearing indications that is the case for Susan Collins as well and one key thing to keep in mind is that this is not the final vote the Republicans especially may vote yesterday but not ... not necessarily yes over the weekend could vinyl say okay\nFine I'll end debate but I'm not going to vote for this guy and it sounds like if there's four key votes this has gotta be close they're going to guess forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one maybe fifty two at the absolute most\nAh let's go back to Dianne Feinstein she is the California Democrat who is the senior members senior democratic member on the Senate Judiciary committee and she used to living her closing argument let's listen to her\n\n\nUp okay we're going to try to get back to the Senate floor in a moment Dianne Feinstein is delivering her speech there oh she's just concluded her remarks as a matter of fact\nSo we're now going to hear in their entire already over the next few minutes from two more key players here one is Charles Schumer of New York he is the Senate Democratic leader and he is a senator who vowed very early on the Democrats would oppose this nomination but everything that they had\nThe other senator we'll hear from is the key player in so many historic debates over the last decade and a half really Mitch McConnell the majority leader the Republican leader in the United States Senate and someone who has been absolutely central\nTo the Supreme Court battles of the last few years it was Mitch McConnell who said that President Obama's last nominee to the court would not even get a vote\nIt was Mitch McConnell who then steered President Trump's first nominee Neil Gorsuch to confirmation\nIt is Mitch McConnell who has repeatedly said during all the drama of the last few weeks that he intended to guide Brett Kavanaugh through and so we'll hear from Charles Schumer and Mitch McConnell in the next few minutes Nina Totenberg is with us here in the you know what's on your mind\nWell Mitch McConnell is\nSenate and someone who has been absolutely central to the Supreme Court battles of the last few years it was Mitch McConnell who said that President Obama's last nominee to the court would not even get a vote\nIt was Mitch McConnell who then steered President Trump's first nominee Neil Gorsuch to confirmation\nIt as Mitch McConnell who has repeatedly said during all the drama of the last few weeks that he intended to guide Brett Kavanaugh through and so we'll hear from Charles Schumer and Mitch McConnell in the next few minutes needed Totenberg is with us here in the you know what's on your mind\nWell you know Mitch McConnell is not what you would call a riveting speaker and neither is Chuck Schumer who will also be speaking they're sort of doing the final cleanup hit for their sides at but don't\nBe fooled by their boring presentation Mitch McConnell is a brilliant strategist he has done amazing things for\nA matters that he wanted to advance whether it's his agenda on the courts or getting through a budget when lots of his more conservative members wanted to just block everything and this was true he negotiated with a vice president Biden during that\nThe Obama administration and they got budgets they got you know funding for the federal government through when it really served the Republicans politic larger political interests very well although there were a minority of Republicans who didn't want to do that and Chuck Schumer\nYou know he's not the majority leader so we can't see if he's a brilliant strategist yet but but but he is there a guy he's their point man\nHe's been marshalling the Democratic troops to the extent that he can let's get a sense of the scene as we await their speeches because Brakkton Booker NPR's Brakkton Booker has been outside the United states Capitol today it's an area where there have been many protests over the last several days and Brecht and what's the scene like this morning\nWe'll Steve there are some crowds out here not is\n... very well although there were a minority of Republicans who didn't want to do that and Chuck Schumer you know he's not the majority leader so we can't see if he's a brilliant strategist yet but but but\nHe is there a guy he's they're pointing it he's been marshalling the Democratic troops to the extent that he can now let's get a sense of the scene as we await their speeches because Brakkton Booker NPR's Brakkton Booker has been outside the United states Capitol today it's an area where there have been many protests over the last several days and Brakkton what's the scene like this morning\nWe'll Steve there are some crowds out here not as big as we've seen in previous days but the day is still young [noise]\nAh there is a group of speakers that are standing up to the side of me maybe a a fifty yards away or they have had a number of people come up and share their stories a lot of people who have survived a sexual assaults actual trauma and the sharing the story is basically saying\nWe cannot put a Supreme Court you cannot\nElevate someone to the Supreme Court who's been accused of such prime\nDirective that been founded what what they're saying hits it one of the central tensions one of the things which really divided the country and the last several days [noise] as well we'll talk about that a little bit more a mom and apparently Charles Schumer has now gone to the Senate floor let's listen to the Senate minority leader\nSorted chapters in the long history of the federal judiciary\nThe well was poisoned from the outset when President Trump selected judge Kavanaugh\nFrom the list of names pre approved by hard right special interest groups\nFor whom the national interest isn't trifling concern\nCompared to repealing roe v Wade cutting people's health care\nAnd achieving a partisan majority\nOn the Supreme Court\nThe rock worsened when there were ...\nChapters in the long history of the federal judiciary\nThe well was poisoned from the outset when President Trump selected judge Kavanaugh\nFrom the list of names pre approved by hard writes special interest groups\nFor whom the national interest as a trifling concern\nCompared to repealing roe v Wade cutting people's health care\nAnd achieving a partisan majority\nOn the Supreme Court\nThe rock worsened when the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee\nShielded the bulk of judge Kavanaugh's records from the public\nDiscarding decades of bipartisan precedent\nAnd forwarding norms of transparency and fairness\nAnd finally the dam broke\nUnder the weight of credible allegations\nThat judge Kavanaugh\nCommitted a sexual assault\nIn twenty Eighteen\nThe Republican majority conduct at a hearing\nThat made the Anita Hill hearings and Nineteen Ninety One\nLook fair by comparison in this hearing there were no corroborating witnesses on either side\nNo independent investigation of the facts to inform the questioning they even hired an outside counsel\nTo put a witness Dr Ford\nOn trial [noise]\nOnly at the eleventh hour urging a breakaway members of their caucus Republicans submitted reluctantly\nTo a one week investigation of the allegations\nInvestigation which was then severely ... scribe by the White House\nOur Republican friends blame us for this process\nInvestigation of the facts to inform the questioning they even hired an outside counsel\nTo put a witness Dr Ford\nOn trial [noise]\nOnly at the eleventh hour urging a breakaway members of their caucus Republicans submitted reluctantly\nTo a one week investigation of the allegations\nInvestigation which was then severely ... scribe by the White House\nOur Republican friends blame us for this process there always finding a straw man\nBut nothing could be further from the truth first they blame us for delay\nThat majority leader McConnell has complete control\nOf when nominees are brought to the floor\nLeader McConnell could move this nominee two weeks ago\nOr one week ago\nDemocrats had nothing no say\nWhen it comes to who comes to the floor\nBut in each case leader McConnell couldn't move the nominee forward\nBecause he was blocked by fellow Republicans not Democrats\nIt comes to complaining about delay\nTwo words never come\nFrom our Republican friends lips\nRepublicans are also saying we engaged in quote a smear campaign\nWhere the politics of personal destruction\nWith this nomination in reality again using Democrats as a straw man\nBecause what they're really talking about is what Dr Ford said\nDemocrats did not end do sort of come forward her conscience dead and\nFrom our Republican friends lips\nRepublicans are also saying we engaged in quote a smear campaign\nWhere the politics of personal destruction\nWith this nomination in reality again they're using Democrats as a strongman\nBecause what they're really talking about is what Dr Ford said\nDemocrats did not end do sort of come forward her conscience did and our Republican friends\nAre are are Republican friends accusing Dr Ford\nAnd her deeply held memories of what happened to work\nOf a smear campaign are they using Dr Ford of a smear campaign\nOf engaging in the politics of personal destruction\nBecause that is who they're actually blaming their decrying her testimony and then trying to blame Democrats\nI don't blame them they have a flawed nominee they don't want to focus on the nominee when future Americans look back at these proceedings let them draw no lessons from the Senate's conduct here\nLet them look back on this chapter\nHe's now on the line Mr Axelrod mourning mourning what are you hearing there [noise]\nWell look I think uh there is a lot of a sound and fury on both sides about this nomination but there's only one thing that matters which is how a a a very few number of senators are going to vote and\nTo be the indications are that a judge Kavanaugh will be justice Kavanaugh by by the end of this weekend\nOK bottom line there now Mitch McConnell has taken to the floor of the Senate majority leader so let's bring that up and give a listen to that thanks to\nToday the Senate has the opportunity to advance his nomination\nEvery one of us will go on record with one of the most consequential votes you ever cast in the Senate now the stakes are always hot far Supreme Court nomination\nBut colleagues the extraordinary events of recent weeks have raised them even higher this time when we vote later this morning we will not only be deciding whether to elevate a stunningly\nWell qualified judge show our highest court not anymore out after all this United States Senate will also\nBe making a say\nNow the stakes are always hot for Supreme Court nomination\nBut colleagues the extraordinary events of recent weeks have raised them even higher this time when we vote later this morning we will not only be deciding whether to elevate a stunningly\nWell qualified judge show our highest court not any more not after all this the United States Senate will also\nBe making a say\nWithin the states that partisan politics can override the presumption of innocence\nOr will reaffirm that in the United states of America\nEvery one is innocent until proven guilty will either state the facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside when politically inconvenient\nAnd signal that media bullying and mob intimidation are valid tactics for shaping the center the mob can attack\nAnd the Senate case\nAll set up and say that serious thoughtful fact based deliberation will still define this body\nWill either give notice it totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough\nTo destroy an American flight\nOr will declare that our society cannot and must not will not set the bar so low\nSo madam president today as a pivotal day and the nomination process of this excellent judge but it's a ...\nWell still define this body\nWill either give notice it totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough\nTo destroy an American flight\n\nOr will declare that our society cannot must not will not set the bar so low\nSo madam president today as a pivotal day and the nomination process of this excellent judge but it's a pivotal day for us here in the Senate as well\nThe ideals of justice that have served our nation\nSo well for so long\nOr on full display\nSo let's get back in ... through the choice moments\nThat the Senate and the American people have been treated to during the disgraceful absolutely disgraceful spectacle\nOf the last two weeks the very not\nJudge Kavanaugh was so now says the president's choice\nWhere are the junior senator from Oregon declare that this nominee would pave the way they're tearing it\nCrowds of far allowed protesters\nStill filling out in the blanks on they're picking side there weren't quite sure who the nominee was going to be yeah\n\nHeard the junior senator from New Jersey to describe judge Kavanaugh's nomination as a great moral struggle\nIn which they are just two camps\nYou're either complicit in the evil\nOr you're fighting against it\nWe've heard the junior senator from Hawaii argue that her personal disagreement with judge Kavanaugh judicial philosophy admit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeer drinking references oh no\nOur colleague was quite positive there must be some other hidden or sinister meetings at play until of course a number of judge Kavanaugh's last night I said I'm straight\nShe'll stop and consider the snap shots\nThe absurdity the absurdity the indignity\nIs our approach to confirming\nA Supreme Court justice\nThis is the Senate contribution the public discourse\nBefore the end of dried on justice Kennedy's retirement our democratic colleagues made it perfectly clear what this process\nWould be about\nDelay obstruct\nAnd resist\nAnd before the anchor dried on judge Kavanaugh's nomination colleagues across the aisle including democratic members of the Judiciary Committee\nWere racing to announce they'd made up their minds are more totally opposes confirmation\nMirror hours after judge Kavanaugh was nominated\nMy friend the Democratic leader promise quote I Will oppose him with everything I've got to be set hours after he was nominated it was clear that his number one political goal was to defeat the nomination\nBy any means\nIt was right there from the beginning madam president a clear declaration plain as day nothing nothing good yet most Democrats are considered is nominated with an open mind\nIt would be delaying tactics obstruction\nResistance\nHours after he was nominated\nIt was about a clearer that his number one political goal was to defeat the nomination\nBy any means\nIt was right there from the beginning madam president a clear declaration plain as day nothing nothing could get most Democrats are considered is nominated with an open mind\nIt would be delaying tactics obstruction\nResistance until the final vote\nFor a fair wage their average played out along the lines that sadly have become somewhat ordinary\nAround here\nThere were excuses for delay those fell flat there were gross distortion to judge Kavanaugh's record that were better down by outside about Jeffers\nAnd there were all the usual phony apocalyptic pronouncements that are shouted whenever a Republican president Derek denominator Supreme Court justice ...\nHospital the vulnerable people\nHospital workers same old tricks\nThe old players weren't working\nThe distortions were being literally drowned out\n\nSenators received an reviewed more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination then for every previous Supreme Court nomination\nWe read judge Kavanaugh's twelve year record of judicial rulings from our nation's second highest court\nThree hundred plus opinions\nAre sworn testimony written a couch from hundreds of character witnesses from all stages of judge\nDistortions were being literally drowned out\n\nSenators were saved and reviewed more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination than for every previous Supreme Court nomination\nWe read judge Kavanaugh's twelve year record of judicial rulings from our nation's second highest court\nThree hundred plus opinions\nWere sworn testimony written a couch from hundreds of character witnesses from all stages of judge Kavanaugh's life and career\nAnd the picture painted by these facts\nWas nothing like the character\nNothing like the character\nSo it was clear mind president the old taxes weren't working\nWhat I'm going to get the job done\nThe resistance demanded more\nTry something new they said well we all know what happened next\nUncorroborated allegations of the most sensitive\nMost serious or were quickly sharpen\nInto political weapons\nOne such allegations shared by Dr Ford and coughing and two of the Democratic side of the Judiciary Committee\nMysteriously found its way into the press\nWell chairman Grassley admittedly set out on a sober focus search for truth the committee collected test and all they organized a new hearing and most recently asked for the supplemental FBI background investigation\nJudge Kavanaugh's seventh seventh\nInvestigation by any first entered the facts the actual facts proved to be straight\nFound its way into the press\nWell chairman Grassley admittedly set out on a sober focus search for the truth the community collected tested all organized a new hearing and most recently asked for the supplemental FBI background investigation\nJudge Kavanaugh's seventh seventh\nInvestigation by and embarrassed that are the facts the actual facts proved to be straightforward\nNo corroborating evidence not not\nWhat's produced a support any of the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh\nNo corroborating evidence from the FBI inquiry\nNothing\nWell that wasn't enough for our democratic colleagues of course the facts were not exactly the point after always sort of get it by now\nAugust mentioned either way mentioned by the way it was ... went to the hearings and sat dish or hours of testimony Brett Kavanaugh\nJust today than looking again at the FBI report looking at every detail that he possibly could I'm just trying to keep count here a little bit Scott Detrow if a ... yes at least on cloture if Collins is aghast at least on cloture doesn't it looked like the Republicans have fifty which would be the bare minimum\nAnd just today than looking again that that FBI report looking at every detail that he possibly could I'm just trying to keep count here a little bit Scott Detrow if a flake is yes at least on cloture if Collins is aghast at least on cloture\nDoesn't it look like the Republicans have fifty which would be the bare minimum fifty one if vice president Pence had to break a tie there there is that correct\nOr two no votes sink the nomination if if either Murkowski or mansion votes for cloture then yes this advances too is that okay\nSo we're still one vote short as they are still one vote short that is the situation\nThat's right and this vote may drag out but this is a more formal vote than usual you see the senator sitting at their desk standing up and announcing their votes which very rarely happens in the United states give a listen to some of that\nLet's bring that up and give\nA listen ... and\n\nMr Murphy\nOkay silence on Murkowski because she's not there yet or\nUnclear if he's not there yet most will vote if their names are called in this more normal setting but are these votes can drag out again I go back to that ... vote to repeal Obamacare way down with lots of last minute drama if you know you're in the deciding vote you may let it play out before you cast your deciding\nAbsolutely and we do see a number of senators that they're ... very often this voting period as a time when you see senators looking quite college or there'll be standing in knots of people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people you had to close conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense the sobriety of this moment doesn't it\nAbsolutely even before all of the controversy over the last few weeks voting for us\nThese votes can drag out again I go back to that he voted to repeal Obamacare way down with lots of last minute drama if you know you're in the deciding vote you may let it play out before you cast your deciding\nAbsolutely and we do see a number of senators that they're ... very often this voting period is a time when you see senators looking quite college or there'll be standing in knots of people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people that are close conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense the sobriety of this moment doesn't it\nAbsolutely even before all of the controversy of the last few weeks voting for a Supreme Court justice is one of the most formal you know historical things than I Do\nNPR's Ron Elving has seen many of these votes in the past and Iran I Want to ask about one of the many characters in this drama we just heard a moment ago from Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader\nHe has made himself central a two one historic debate after another for close to two decades now across the administrations of several presidents and if he manages to get this nomination through to confirmation it would be another significant move from Mitch McConnell\nYes and to some degree it would make up for the narrow defeat he suffered a year ago when John McCain cast that an addict thumbs down vote yeah on the repeal of Obamacare of this would be the culmination for Mitch McConnell of off a lifetime\nReally of campaigning for a change to federal judiciary and let's just this little listen to a little bit more as that goes through the rules are killers\nMister Kenny Mr Udall\nMr Van Hollen Mr Warner\nOkay Mark Warner of Virginia is a no vote ... Scott Detrow we're seeing that Lisa Murkowski voted no on cloture okay deal OK so Lisa Murkowski is a nurse\nA lifetime really of campaigning for changed federal judiciary and let's just this little listen to a little bit more as they go through the rules are killers\nDistrict to me Mr Udall\nMr Van Hollen Mr Warner\nOkay Mark Warner of Virginia is a no vote ... Scott Detrow we're seeing that Lisa Murkowski voted no on cloture okay deal OK so Lisa Murkowski is a no um and so does that mean it's all up to to Joe mansion\nOr at the moment it appears to be I should point out uh a clarification that we always make during Senate votes were hardly ever broadcasting them live the vote is ... is is fluid entail its final senators can change their mind so and do you see that's right or you can't have a sperm sent the final vote goes until they banged the gap\nAnd there could also be a senator whom we have assumed as a yes or of assumed as a no who just at the last moment does something different and we're\nOn a knife edge here where a single vote one way or the other could make a difference what we should all Jeff Flake we're now told was a yes vote voting yes for cloture again that doesn't assure that flake would vote for the confirmation but he appears to have voted for\nClay de telegraphed really even when he made the compromise with ...\nAnd ... of the Delaware has gotten into Delaware I went to ... to have a one week investigation he said I'm a conservative I Want to vote for Brett Kavanaugh but I also don't want to blow this process up over this let's have a one week delay and barring anything really new he said I'm going to vote for this guy\nSo Jeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin when you said going to read that FBI report the Senate has only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among them\nChris Coons of Delaware has got to Delaware in ... to have a one week investigation he said I'm a conservative I Want to vote for a cabin up but I also don't want to blow this process up over this let's have a one week they'll lay and barring anything really new he said I'm going to vote for this guy\nSo Jeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin when you said going to read that FBI report the Senate\nHas only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among themselves and they have been a and the ruined is it are they in a secure facility that's normally used for intelligence matters for classified information and Joe Manchin has been in that room looking at a report today even as he considers how to vote\nNPR's Scott Horsley is at the White House which he has covered for years Scott what is the view from the White House as this Senate vote continues in the capital down the street\nJust even the White House spokeswoman told you earlier today they are confident that they have the votes to advance this a nomination\nOr that would be a huge victory for Mitch McConnell who has been laser focused on putting conservatives on the bench it would be a huge victory for White House counsel Don McGahn who's been sort of the architect of\nA President Trump's make over of the federal judiciary moving the bench and a conservative direction for President Trump I think he also sees a a political advantage here he's been talking\nA at his various campaign rallies in recent days about the energy that this\nConfirmation process is generated on the right or helping to close and enthusiasm gap that Republicans had been suffering a relative to Democrats that according to our polling this is now more or less closed\nRepublicans are just as focused on the November elections as as Democrats already were and you know the president has\nThe bench and a conservative direction for President Trump I think he also sees a a political advantage here he's been talking\nA at his various campaign rallies in recent days about the energy that this\nConfirmation process is generated on the right or helping to close and enthusiasm gap that uh uh Republicans had been suffering a relative to Democrats that according to our polling this is now more or less closed Republicans are just as focused on the November elections is as Democrats already were\nAnd you know the president has been very critical of this this morning on Twitter of what he ah the people who have been who've been protesting this nomination he he tweeted this morning the very rude elevators streamers are paid professionals only looking at only ... senators look bad\nNo evidence that that is a correct description but I Want to mention Joe Manchin of West Virginia when we were just talking about has now voted by a Scott Detrow again with an asterisk that it's not over till it's over it looks like a three of the four swing votes at least have gone in favor of Kevin that's right\nBrett Kavanaugh is very likely going to advance a advanced is keep procedural vote or there will be a final vote over the weekend but as of right now it looks like this was going to be a fifty one forty nine vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination or you had Jeff Flake and Susan Collins voting to advance a cabinet along with Joe mansion\nAnd Lisa Murkowski voting now Joe mansion isn't a really tough spot here he is one of the many Democrats up in a deep red state the cycle he's been a head in the polls really out performing how Democrats are in West Virginia\nHe's under a lot of pressure to vote yes for Kavanaugh given the makeup of the state but also if he is the key deciding vote and it's a Democrat and\nHe's the only Democrat voting for Brett Kavanaugh you are going to see a lot of liberal blowback on mentioned in the final month\nHe's raising a difficult situation\nOr you had Jeff Flake and Susan Collins voting to advance a cabinet along with Joe mansion and Lisa Murkowski voting no Joe Manchin isn't a really tough spot here he is one of the many Democrats up in a deep red state the cycle he's been a head in the polls really out performing how Democrats are in West Virginia\nHe's under a lot of pressure to vote yes for Kavanaugh given the makeup of his state but also if he is the key deciding vote and it's a Democrat and he's the only Democrat voting for Brett Kavanaugh you are going to see a lot of liberal blowback on mentioned in the final month\nHe's raising a difficult situation but he is a yes at this time on ending debate that test vote in a sense and just to remind people or maybe joining us this vote is not the final vote there's another one sometimes senators would go the other way on the final vote that would be expected to be\nA coming on Saturday you are listening to special coverage from NPR News and we'd like to bring another voice here as we await the final tally but not quite final tally at this moment on Brett Kavanaugh although it appears he's gotten up to fifty one votes which would be sufficient\nAlex

Republican strategist and he's on the line Mr Conan welcome back to the program\n... could be with him\nSo what are you thinking about as far as the political significance presuming that Kavanaugh is on his way through and we can't say he's there but it looks like he's on his way\nWell it's like it's going to be a big win for Donald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell\nAnd you know continue to give Republicans some momentum and some energy heading into them in terms of the terms are barely a month away that's the big ... big deliverable for our base that frankly you know I think it was

he's there but it looks like he's on his way\nWell looks like it's going to be a big win for Donald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell and you know continue to give Republicans\nSome momentum and some energy heading into them in terms of the midterms are barely a month away this is a big way in a big deliverable for our base that frankly you know I think we're looking for something\nTo get him to the polls in November we we'd we'd been really lacking in the enthusiasm there'd been a doozy has them gap has a lot of the surveys have shown and as NPR's surveys show the earlier this week that you really arrow to be in part because of the whole fight over Brett Kavanaugh to have it when I think it's just really going to be encouraging to Republicans\nHaving been through political campaigns Alex would you put a lot of credence in that apparently gain and enthusiasm right now we're in a month out from the election and Democrats except in this moment had been far more energized\nAbsolutely look ... mid term elections are all about turning out your voters as ... and that was the challenge for us going into the midterms it's why the out of power party normally does very well in midterms because when you're when you're out of power when you're in the resistance your voters are going to be more amped up then the people\nThat are kind of fat and happy but now after this fight with Brett Kavanaugh and we've seen in the way that the Democrats from Republicans perspective have basically engaging in character assassination Republicans feel like they're not just attacking Brett Kavanaugh they're attacking\nConservativism and Republicans as a whole and Republicans are United and fired up in a way that we just have not been in the Trump era and I think to win to to succeed is just sort of a nail in the coffin in terms of locking down for\nAlex Conan's I Want to ask about the timing of this vote or Republicans had been perceived as rushing to\nBut now after this fight with Brett Kavanaugh and we've seen the way that the Democrats from Republicans perspective have basically engaging in character assassination Republicans feel like they're not just attacking Brett Kavanaugh they're attacking conservativism\nAnd Republicans as a whole and Republicans are United and fired up in a way that we just have not been in\nThe Trump era and I think to win to exceed is just sort of the nail on the coughing in terms of locking down for all of these yet\nAlex Conan's I Want to ask about the timing of this vote or Republicans had been perceived as rushing to get the vote done before the election because they were afraid they might lose the Senate it might be far more difficult to get a replacement nominee through because it was probably almost certainly be after the election\nThat there was no corroborating evidence against him that many of the charges were nonsense and he told senators this is one of the most consequential votes you've ever had and it's a vote

Washington DC where a dramatic vote has just taken place\nIn the U.S Senate and the nomination to the Supreme Court of President Trump's choice Brett Kavanaugh it was an extremely close vote and a West Virginia senator who was the presiding officer today Republicans a choose choose the presiding officer and was Shelley Moore capital of West Virginia let's give a listen\nOn this about the age of fifty one that knows are forty nine the motion is agreed to\nFifty one to forty nine as the gavel goes down almost as close as it could be if it had been a fifty fifty tie we presume that vice

today Republicans ah choose choose the presiding officer and was Shelley Moore capital of West Virginia let's give a listen under\nThe age of fifty one that knows are forty nine the notion is agreed to\nFifty one to forty nine as the gavel goes down almost as close as it could be if it had been a fifty fifty tie we presume that vice president Mike Pence would have come in\nAnd broken that time fifty one to forty nine almost entirely along partisan lines the one Democrat\nWho voted for Kavanaugh is Joe Manchin of West Virginia the one Republican who voted against Kavanaugh is Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and we should emphasize before we begin our discussion here this is what's called a cloture vote this is not the final vote this was a vote to end the debate a kind of test\nBut not an absolute test because senators could choose to vote differently if they feel moved to do so when the final vote comes tomorrow\nNPR's Nina Totenberg has covered the United States Supreme court about as\nLong as well as anyone and she is in our studios here along with NPR's Ron Elving has covered politics for very long time as well\nGood morning to get both in mourning mourning so you've thanks for joining us throughout the morning here and uh Nina I Want to start with you let's just back away from the drama of the last couple of weeks and talk about the historic consequences of this choice\nPresuming that Kevin gets through as he got through the vote today how is the U.S Supreme Court to different court than it would have been a with a different nominee or than it was before he came\n[noise] well it was going to be much more conservative court regardless whoever Donald Trump pick from his famous list it was going to be someone way more conservative than Anthony Kennedy the man that is being replaced and that will\nJust a back away from the drama of the last couple of weeks and talk about the historic consequences of this choice presuming that Kevin all gets through as we got through the vote today how is the U.S Supreme Court to different court than it would have been a with a different nominee or than it was before he came\n[noise] well it was going to be a much more conservative court regardless whoever Donald Trump pick from his famous list it was going to be someone way more conservative than Anthony Kennedy the man\nThat is being replaced and that will kill the court that was sort of like a balance sport sometimes mainly going in the conservative direction but about a quarter of the time and some of those very big cases going the other way\nTo the liberal side now in almost every case that is a closely contested one where the voters five to four I think you can expect the conservatives to win\nAnd they may\nMove on an agenda to increase executive power to decrease actually congressional power in some ways to\nAnd to um to take on legal questions that have only been sort of on the wish list of hardcore conservatives for fifty to a hundred years\nNow it's interesting you use the word agenda I think that if some conservatives ah we're listening to you they might object to the word agenda and argue the conservative judges or just applying the law as they see it but it is an agenda in the sense that it's a very different way of viewing and reading the law correct this would be well\nEven this term which is so far pretty doggy term frankly with not very compelling big hot sexy cases even this term so far with a half the docket agreed to in the rest yet to come\nThere is three cases asking for reversal of very longstanding precedence so you could see a lot of a lot\nThat if some conservatives ah we're listening to you they might object to the word agenda and argue that conservative judges or just applying the law as they see it but it is an agenda in the sense that it's a very different way of viewing and reading the law correct this would\nBe a good heart even this term which is so far pretty doggy term frankly with not very compelling big hot sexy cases even this term so far with a half the docket agreed to in the rest yet to come\nThere is three cases asking for reversal of very longstanding presidents so you could see a lot of the law changed quite dramatically and some of it would not make headlines you would only\nSee it when you went to do something and found you could no longer do that whether you're on the right or the left you could be blocked or you could be suddenly find as people are now finding for example that the court in recent years has on the question if arbitration\nSaid to people you can't bring a class action challenging a clause in it and when you were hired that says any dispute over salary or anything else has to go to arbitration you can't bring a class action suit in court challenge that ...\nThat example because it reminds us that while Kavanaugh's nomination has been viewed through the lens of roe versus Wade of abortion rights there is an almost infinite variety cases\nIn which presuming he is confirmed on the final vote tomorrow he would have an opportunity to rule and they would include abortion rights and a lot of things short of overturning roe versus Wade and they would include labor rights and\nAnd and many other things let's also remember that there was a relatively true statements made by Charles Schumer the Democrat from New York when he gave a speech shortly before the vote and he said Democrats have been accused of delaying the nomination Democrats have not he said and what he means is Republicans\nIn a variety of cases in which presuming he is confirmed on the final vote tomorrow he would have an opportunity to rule and they would include abortion rights and a lot of things short of overturning roe versus Wade and they would include labor rights\nAnd and and many other things let's also remember that there was a relatively true statement made by Charles Schumer the Democrat from New York when he gave his speech shortly before the vote\nAnd he said Democrats have been accused of delaying the nomination Democrats have not he said and what he means is\nRepublicans have had the majority Republicans reset the Supreme Court rules so that a so that a minority cannot block a action and so if there's been any delay it's been been because of division and the Republican ranks there've been a number of Republicans who have been uncertain votes\nOne of them Lisa Murkowski who ultimately voted no on this test vote here this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nAnother one being Susan Collins of Maine who\nIssued in a sense a partial decision and let's listen to the words that she spoke to reporters a little bit earlier today we're not going to hear Susan Collins of Maine but what you said out to ... to a scrum of reporters a group of reporters out on the floor\nIs that I'm voting yes voting yes on cloture however uh I Am not going to announce until a little bit later on today what I'm going to do later what I'm going to do in that second vote which is the way it works right Ron Elving\nIs but it let's let's be Frank it it's pretty rare for people to vote for cloture and then turn around and vote and why ... why would you do that\nWell that the justification that people put forward as they say I Believe in fairness to both sides we should have some more floor debate and we should hear all the arguments as though we haven't and at the end of that we should be fair enough to this candidate to give him a final vote on the floor now I plan to vote no but I think he should have\nDo later what I'm going to do in that second vote which is the way it works right Ron Elving\nIt is but it let's let's be Frank it it's pretty rare for people to vote for cloture and then turn around and vote and

on the floor she has not said that let's be you know she did and I say that\nAnd and I think there'd be an awful lot of folks who'd be very surprised if tomorrow she votes no but she has that option she may I don't think she's actually\nWell who knows whether or not she's enjoying the amount of pressure that he's on her and she does not seem to be having a good time but there was a time when the\nRules were different when that sort of thing would happen you'd get sixty votes for cloture and then maybe only fifty two votes to pass\nAnd then you had a principal and the principal was I don't believe we should block this person from getting a final vote and win the majority clearly favors this person I don't favor the person but I also don't favor cutting off their chance to have a final vote with a filibuster\nOkay so we've talked about Republicans who have been doubtful Lisa Murkowski of Alaska was a no vote at least on cloture\nSusan Collins of Maine who was a yes vote on cloture but it's held out at least for a number of hours today her decision on the final vote and then there is a Republican who was never expressed any doubt about that nomination and let's listen to a little bit of today's speech on the Senate floor from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\nEvery effort was made to ensure that the factory verdict of the mob and the media would wet out over the actual evidence\nMade sure the mob prevail\nWho was a no vote at least on cloture Susan Collins of Maine who is a yes vote on cloture but it's held out at least for a number of hours today her

uncorroborated mud and the partisan noise and the physical intimidation of members here in the Senate will not have the final say around here\nThe Senate will have the final so\nThe Senate is not quite had the final say but they got a step closer to date with this fifty one to forty nine vote\nThat we have been covering and then we will continue covering here and special coverage from NPR News let's bring another voice into the conversation now ... is executive director of the Georgetown Institute of politics and public service a veteran democratic strategist did I pronounce your name

Senate the vote was fifty one forty nine the fifty one goes in favor of Brett Kavanaugh President Trump's nominee to serve on the Supreme Court he's not quite there yet this was a vote to end debate\nAnd then the final vote comes tomorrow we would anticipate a final vote that may go exactly the same way fifty one forty nine but senators are by no means obligated to vote the same way and sometimes they do\nVote differently on final passage than they would on ending debate as a matter of fact one senator\nSusan Collins of Maine has specifically said that she voted yes this morning to advance the nomination but that she would give a different statement sometime later today perhaps around three o'clock as to what her actual vote would be on the floor\nTomorrow so there is still some degree of doubt but it appears that Brett Kavanaugh is on his way\nA vote that Senator Mitch McConnell the majority leader on the Republican side said was one of the most\nTimes they do vote differently on final passage than they would on ending debate as a matter of fact one senator\nSusan Collins of Maine has specifically said that she voted yes this morning to advance the nomination but that she would give a different statement sometime later today perhaps around three o'clock as to what her actual vote would be on the floor\nTomorrow so there is still some degree of doubt but it appears that Brett Kavanaugh is on his way a vote that Senator Mitch McConnell the majority leader on the Republican side said was one of the most consequential votes\nBut the Senate has ever had that's the way that he framed this vote Charles Schumer the Democrat of New York said that this was a vote for a justice who has a record of hard right conservative jurisprudence who was a doubtful nominee even before there were allegations of sexual assault\nAnd then Schumer considered those to be credible allegations of sexual assault which caused the damn to break into Schumer's word in terms of doubts about this nominee doubts that were reinforced by his harsh and partisan\nTestimony of some of those same charges Senator Mitch McConnell said they were largely nonsense and there was no corroborating evidence of the claims by Christine Blasey Ford who described a sexual assault said she was sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh as a friend looked on and perhaps participated\nWhile they were all in high school in the Nineteen eighties so fifty one to forty nine is the vote and let's discuss some of the meanings of this NPR's Dominican months' NARAL can start us off here in this segment of the of the special coverage He's NPR's political editor is is anything a surprise to you here to medical\nI think Lisa Murkowski coming out and voting no uh certainly shows you know the kind of independence she shown over the years this is somebody who won an election state wide\nBy Brett Kavanaugh as a friend looked on and perhaps participated\nWhile they were all in high school in the Nineteen eighties so fifty one to forty nine is the vote and let's discuss some of the meanings of this NPR's Dominican amongst NARAL can start us off here in this segment of the of the special coverage He's NPR's political editor is is anything a surprise to you are here to medical\nWell I think Lisa Murkowski coming out and voting no uh certainly shows you know the kind of independence she shown over the years this is somebody who won\nAn election state wide as a write in candidate in ... the the odds of doing that anywhere are nearly impossible now allow much Alaska well I mean Alaska is a little bit easier obviously because it's she's a very well known names and yeah and not as many people as a you know some of the other states\nSo she was able to pull that off my point about that is that she doesn't old Republican leadership anything so when a lot of people were looking around thinking who would be the profiling courage she's somebody who a lot of people thought\nCould be that person more so than Susan Collins or Joe mansion ah because of the politics of\nEither their caucus a with a Collins or of their state with Joe ... and when\nWe say profile in courage were just defining that from the Democratic prospect somebody representing the state well let me last time that I'm not a fix what's their ... and I mean that not as a Democrat that pro democratic same I mean that as somebody who would bucket do with their voting rights go against their base so\nWhen you think about um what we what we have left though given that Murkowski voted no on cloture it's almost certain that she's going to be a no on the floor later when it comes to the actual final vote that leaves us with the pressure really built on Jeff Flake of Arizona Susan Collins of Maine\nAnd Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nThese three two of those three\nI mean that's one that I'm not a fix would suggest that not as a Democrat or pro democratic thing I mean that as somebody who would ... go with orange they're voting rights go against their base so when you think about\nUm what we what we have left though given that Murkowski voted no on cloture it's almost certain that she's going to be a no on the floor leader when it comes to the actual final vote that leaves us with the pressure really built on Jeff Flake of Arizona Susan Collins of Maine\nAnd Joe Manchin of West Virginia these three two of those three would have to vote with the Democrats in order to block mentioned\nThanks for reminding us one could peel away and it wouldn't be you know there'll be fifty votes it'd be a fifty fifty time Mike Pence the vice president would break the tie there were many people who had something to say around the United states Capitol over the last few days and they include not just senators on the floor but protesters\nOutside the capital occasionally inside the Capitol there were protesters who confronted Jeff Flake and an elevator famously a little more than a week ago there were protesters who confronted Orrin Hatch of Utah\nIn an elevator just yesterday and must listen to some more of the sounds of continuing protests around the United states capital as Kavanaugh's nomination went forward\n\n\n\nExplicit statement there about the election to come and Nina Totenberg as we listen to those protests I'm reminded\n\n\nExplicit statement there about the election to come and Nina Totenberg as we listen to those protests I'm reminded of one of the excruciating\nConflicts here or you have women especially insisting on the rights of women insisting on the reality of the continuous abuse of women in countless cases and we've heard countless stories\nSo we have the broad issue and then the specific question of whether a specific individual can be held to a certain standard of proof of having been guilty of that of the kind of act\nAnd we're not in a trial although I'm sure the judge Kavanaugh feels that it's a trial for his good name but this isn't it a trial for somebody's liberty this is a confirmation hearing\nFor somebody to be promoted to the highest court in the land and there there is a difference and and there was a moment today of\nThe bitter is to pill I think for the Democrats and what it says about our politics in a way and it was when um minority leader Schumer said when it comes to delay two words never pass\nMitch McConnell's lips Merrick\nGarland and of course right after Justice Scalia died Merrick Garland right away said we are not going to hold even hearing any Mitch McConnell said Mitch McConnell said we're not even going to hold a hearing for anybody to President Obama nominates with\nBitter is pill I think for the Democrats and what it says about our politics in a way and it was when um minority leader Schumer said when it comes to delay two words never pass\nMitch McConnell's lips Merrick Garland and of course right after Justice Scalia died Merrick Garland right away said we are not going to hold even hearing any Mitch McConnell said Mitch McConnell said\nWe're not even going to hold a hearing for anybody to President Obama nominates with just about a year left in his presidency\nAnd he McConnell lean on people whenever they got sort of a ... on that subject in his own caucus and made that happened and never bat an eye led and and and Obama had thought he was doing a I'm a\nA reasonable and generous thing to try to get somebody confirmed that is pick the lottery he picked a moderate liberal uh of ... and the person he picked the person that Republicans have been saying for years is the person he should pick Merrick Garland no longer really young in his mid sixties\nWho had a real reputation of of moderation on the court is the chief judge of the DC circuit everybody loved him democratic and Republican appointees and that nomination was the oh hey where's my hand whole month at that\n... that you feel the reverberations of that still even though there was only one reference to Merrick Garland today\nAre Ron Elving NPR's Ron Elving is listening to this and as I listen to Nina I'm thinking of an analogy of sorts Ron I'm because we also are going on NPR News frequently cover the

Elving NPR's Ron Elving is listening into this and as I listened to Nina I'm thinking of an analogy of sorts run a because we also a on NPR News frequently cover the middle east and\nEvery debate about the middle east tends to turn on history and it depends on what you want to pick your starting point if you say that one side that something terrible day the answer will come back well guess what happened in Nineteen sixty seven guess what happened in Nineteen Iran\nAnswers that I've just only thing we have which is that there were people in the Democratic party who said listen President Obama you shouldn't take a moderate you should pick somebody we can really go to war over\nAnd he didn't do that and the ... and and so now the the question is is is the lesson here you have to go to war every time\nWhich is what Republicans certainly have done but what I'm getting at Ron Elving is it depends on where you start the history to get started and I do sixty Seventy started Nineteen forty eight it seems like Supreme Court nominations are going the same way no it depends on what what a beginning point you want to want the set for when the story started to go wrong yes there are some similarities here and\nAnd will continue covering that train crash whenever and wherever it might happen you are listening to special coverage of the cabinet vote from NPR News\nFunding for

advance the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the\nAlso Republican Senator Susan Collins voted yes Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted yes and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voting no\nTo send the nomination to the full Senate like voting yes those were the for lawmakers who had not reveal their decision until this morning\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where the United States Senate has voted fifty one to forty nine to advance\nThe nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court a final vote is expected tomorrow there was a handful of votes that we work closely watching about four senators\nWhose votes runs certain heading into the action this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska Republican voted no the only Republican devote no against Kavanaugh or at least have to vote no against uh on on uh on on the debate\nJeff Flake of Arizona voted yes Susan Collins of Maine voted yes Joe Manchin of West Virginia the only Democrat to vote yes uh put his vote down things could change in particular we know that there's at least a possibility that Susan Collins could change your vote\nWhen the final vote comes tomorrow because she said she was voting yes but she'd give a final answer on the final vote a little bit later on today NPR's to medical ... still with us and has been covering Susan Collins of what\nWhat evidence do we have to go on as to the way she's leading\nWell look like you lay out here everyone's watching this quartet you know the final four voters are and there is a possibility that people vote differently for cloture at than the way they do on the Senate and the final vote now one piece of evidence for why that's a possibility for Susan Collins\nAnd she's already done it this Congress she did it on the nomination of that the device for education secretary in fact she wasn't a cloture vote it was a committee vote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial coverage from NPR News ... executive vice president for policy of the Leadership Conference and she was once and advisor two Democrat ... there was one of the senior Democrats on the Senate Judiciary committee which of course considered ... nomination ...\n... so what are you thinking about this ...\nWell I'm thinking it's interesting that ... that there's bipartisan opposition to even proceeding or ending the debate on break Cavanaugh I think that is very revealing about how widespread the concerns are about his conduct\nAnd I know one of your earlier guests said that there was not a hint of misconduct but that's just simply not true the American public saw\nSerious allegations of misconduct brought forth when Dr. Christine lazy Ford testified in front of the committee and that was watched by so many American household\nIt's just not correct ... say there was no evidence because there's the evidence of someone sworn testimony and considerable detail but let me push back on something that you just said there you said there was bipartisan opposition to continuing debate\nThere was one Republican one Republican outta fifty one who voted no ah this has been a very very partisan voted ... equally part it's among the Democratic side is not\nWell I don't think I think it is bipartisan by by the nature of having Lisa Murkowski vote no enclosure and voting against voting against cloture voting to end debate is a very a serious thing for Republican senator to do\nUh usually people uh want to at least allow the vote to proceed or the nomination to proceed so for her to say no today as opposed to just saying no tomorrow when was the confirmation vote\nIsn't really strong signal about how troubled she is buy this buy the nominees fitness to serve on our highest court so I Do think it's ... ...\nOn against cloture voting to end debate is a very a serious thing for a Republican senator to do a usually people uh want to at least allow the vote to proceed or the nomination to proceed so for her to say no today as opposed to just saying no tomorrow when it was the confirmation vote\nIt sends a really strong signal about how troubled she is\nBy this by this nominees fitness to serve on our highest court\nSo I Do think it's remarkable I think that is very unusual and I do think later this afternoon we'll hear more from Susan Collins about how she will ultimately vote on the confirmation vote\nBut I think this nomination is in trouble and so today's procedural vote is just the preview for uh the the consequential vote which is a confirmation vote currently scheduled for tomorrow\nYou don't presume that this was settled I don't need a Totenberg\nSo you know there's been a lot of criticism of the way the Democrats and in particular a ranking member Feinstein handled the Christine Blasey Ford letter in early July\nI'm an ... you you were a senior staff member for Senator Leahy when he was either the chairman or the ranking member I don't remember which ah Christine was shifts both [laughter]\nSo ah ... you know and and Dianne Feinstein who said well I was just protecting her confidentiality but is there a third way this could have gone\nIt it was there a better way for the Democrats to have handled it realistically now\nSo I think it is it's in retrospect I'm sure people have different views but what how I think Senator Feinstein as ranking member handled this as she handled it as a you know the woman who came forward wanted her confidentiality protected did not want to become public\nAnd I think Senator Feinstein honored her wishes\nDianne Feinstein said well I

confidentiality protected did not want to become public\nAnd I think Senator Feinstein honored her wishes\nAnd I think that's admirable but other people think it is less admirable but uh you know I think in retrospect I'm sure people have many different views but I think Senator Feinstein showed that she really understands what the whole me too movement is about\nWhich is when you are a survivor of sexual assault it should be up to you to decide when to tell your story if ever you decide to tell your story\n... I'm thinking about that was it impossible for her to tip off your yard to mention it to someone so there could be very quietly looked into\nWell I think there's an interesting story that hasn't gotten much attention where Senator Whitehouse referred a you know a tip someone had come forward from Rhode Island or to the chairman staff and the chairman staff\nReleased the person's name\nUm so I think that's just an example of this fear that there wasn't the kind of trust that you could\n... you know share it with other members and still preserve confidentiality or share it even with the FBI and still preserved confidentiality so I view it as I don't know if I'm really was respecting the survivor here and I think that's actually something to be praised not criticizing\nI suppose we should mention of the confidentiality wasn't held the memo was leads to a publication called the ... have been accused of doing that I Believe she denied it\nUm so I think that's just an example of this fear that there wasn't the kind of trust that you could you know share it with other members and still preserve confidentiality or share it even with the\nFBI and still preserve confidentiality so I view it as Senator Feinstein really was respecting the survivor here and I think that's actually something to be praised not criticizing\nI suppose we should mention the confidentiality wasn't held the memo was leads to a publication called the intercept Feinstein or stuff has been accused of doing that I Believe she denied it there are other people that could have been there was another lawmaker at least one of the lawmaker who uh had possession of a letter we don't know who else might have been told\nAnd in what way but in the end it leaked do you believe it all to ... we had to lick was barren option where nobody ever found out about this allegation which had been on corroborated I'm Better at an individual will do more to go on the record\n[noise] well I I don't know who leaked it but I think that what this experience has shown and many centers have been confronted with us over the past week is\nThere are thousands and thousands if not millions of women who have stories of sexual assault who will never tell anyone or who will suddenly confessed to a senator or they're interrupting in in an elevator\nI think what this last couple of weeks has shown America is how many women\nHave experienced sexual assault and there are thousands of reasons why they don't report it don't tell anyone and part of the big reason is they don't think people will believe them they don't think that it will do any good\nAnd I'm I'm really worried that ah Christine Blasey Ford's treatment and President Trump mocking her to laughter at a campaign rally\nSense exactly the wrong message to those survivors everywhere that they won't be listened to they won't be taken seriously and there'll be mocked\nLet me ask about one thing along those lines\nMany women have experienced sexual assault and there are thousands of reasons why they don't report it don't tell anyone and part of the big reason is they don't think people will believe them they don't think that it will do any good and I'm I'm really worried that\nChristine Blasey Ford's treatment and President Trump mocking her to laughter at a campaign rally\nSense exactly the wrong message to those survivors everywhere that they won't be listened to they won't be taken seriously and there'll be mocked\nYou know let me ask about one thing along those lines from our colleague David Greene spoke earlier today with Julie ... she's a journalist for the Atlantic who wrote a long article a touching on some of the issues that you just mentioned and she described herself as a victim of past sexual assault when she was in her teams", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "05"}
