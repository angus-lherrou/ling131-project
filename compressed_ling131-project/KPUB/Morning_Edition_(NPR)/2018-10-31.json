L. dot edu\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin election day is coming November six voters will go to the polls to cast their ballots but they will also on that same day take care of a sick relative of a difficult conversation with a loved one maybe start a new career basically live their life\nThis week we're bringing you personal conversations that illustrate the ways in which that lived experience affects how we vote today we'll hear from a young woman named Alexa groom and she's twenty four years old from a family of Democrats in Minnesota at a recent job is changing her political identity\nDid I hear that you've been taking online quiz is to figure out where you actually live in the U.S\nBecause I Do too I\nI I just feel stuck somewhere in the middle and generally it it feels pretty hard to talk about it\nThe middle is not such a comfortable place for a lot of people I mean are you feeling not as both parties going to move to extremes\nYeah I almost feel guilt that I no longer a line with some of my my previous ideas and and I think that's part of the problem is that it seems like if you want to appear as a as a liberal and society you either have to believe everything on the table\nOr you're out you're out of the group and there's so much going on but I feel like I Can't speak up because you're just asking for people to come after you did you grow up in a in a family that talked a lot about politics\nOh we talked a lot about politics [laughter] I was fortunate that my whole family lives nearby we would go to my grandma's house every Sunday and the kids go play but I like to sit and listen to you know my parents and my aunts and uncles talk and it was generally about you know politics social\nSunday and the kids go play but I like to sit and listen to you know my parents and my aunts and uncles talk and it was generally about you know politics social issues that we were always encouraged to voice our thoughts and growing up in Minnesota which is pretty ... pretty democratic that's what I grew up hearing [noise] as\nYou started to develop your own political identity and how did\nThat take shape short it was after the twenty sixteen election I felt man I Need to get more involved and that's what led me to working in immigration because I saw all these families who were being deported and it broke my heart and I I got a great opportunity to help a lot of people but\nEverything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these\nThese evil people who don't care about these families and they don't want\nPeople coming to our country and and some of the most and lightning moments I had were when I did work with us when it would go pay bond or go down to the government center\nAnd what I saw is and it sounds kind of silly now saying out loud but they're not evil people there people who are looking at the same problem as me and believing that there's another solution that there's a different solution [noise]\nSo I guess it it gave me a lot more compassion towards the rights that I hadn't had before in my personal development yes I still feel like I have my roots in liberalism but\nI I feel like we should be listening to each other a little bit more 'cause I I had thought before that I had been listening and I I found out that I hadn't been [noise] I\nYou also watched the Supreme Court nomination hearings of Brett Kavanaugh really closely I did how did those\nHow did those hearings shape how you're thinking about politics or the election\nI did how did those\nHow did those hearings shape how you're thinking about politics or the election\nIt's an issue that hits very close to home I have personally experienced sexual assault um people in my life were very close to me has been rates so it's it's not something that I take lightly whatsoever [noise] um I\nBelieve doctor for it and I believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I\nThere was just not quite enough evidence brought forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't know\n[noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people in in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of bullying\nAnd and I guess some people would disagree with me and say that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere you don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side I think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just\nWhining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for voted for Clinton I I don't like Trump I think you know going\nAbout President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for voted for Clinton I I don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nI guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angered\nI guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it so you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump's correct and\nBecause it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on strictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic check boxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least\nGone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a Republican and upcoming election [noise] have you talk to your family about your\nAbout your evolution I have [laughter] than avoiding it you know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before they hear it on the radio\nAnd I I don't think that they would ever think less of me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things and go why would you say that so I just [noise]\nIt's it's taken me some time because I'm Still trying to work it out myself so [noise] I'll do my research and whoever I think is you know best for the job then you know that's where I'll put my check mark and that's where all focus my optimism\nElectric ruin thank you so much for talking with us

there last week and one child asked about um when I go back and we're going to have to see the bullet holes in the scores\nBuried in Monroe says she directs teachers to listen first and ask questions before giving answers just say what are you know about it and find out where they're coming from usually it's a much simpler place in the adult she says teachers are not only helping students process tragedy there also teaching them that it's there\nUsually it's a much simpler place me adult she says teachers are not only helping students process tragedy there also teaching them that it's their

understand the motive\nThat's not the case with last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh according to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism\nBut critics say his division of rhetoric contributes to a climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses that argument\nSay his division of rhetoric contributes to climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses document\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are malevolent out to control the world Jeffrey her a historian at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operate behind the scenes and are enormously powerful an enormously\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produced fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nDon't go to a person gets paid by sorrows or somebody that\nFrom a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism it seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Geoffrey ... that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a bias Trump is personally promoted as he did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nHere the smartest me [noise] you know what are they talking about they talk about\nThe early ...\n\nThey talk about they talk about the lead you ever see the elite and I mean\nYou are the only [noise] says\nWhen people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThe danger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent it whether it's Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows is controversial his own daughter and son in large Jewish and Herve is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people know\nSo then what's the connection\nHe wants to win and he has a special talent of knowing how to appeal to the resentments and hatred that his base in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy than he is perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual anti Semite school might have been very isolated but now have these platforms when they can find other people that share their views and urge them on and it's fostered an accelerated a climate of heat and anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidence has risen sharply\nOver the last two years Tom Gjelten NPR News [noise]\nThis is the time of year when once

last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh according to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism\nBut critics say his division of rhetoric contributes to climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses that argument\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are malevolent out to control the world Jeffrey her for his story at at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operated behind the scenes and are enormously powerful and enormously evil\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produce fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nThey'll go to a personal you know so I don't get paid by Soros or somebody that\nA rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana now George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely large things\nMontana now George Soros happens to be Jewish that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Geoffrey ... that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another dozen bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a biased Trump is personally promoted as he did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nYou're the smartest me you know they talk about they talk about the early ... they're not\nSays when people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThe danger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent whether it's Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows his controversial his own daughter and son in large Jewish and Herve is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and he has a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people\nKnow so then what's the connection\nHe wants to win and he has a special talent of knowing how to appeal to the resentments and hatred that his base in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy than he is perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at\nWhen he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then is perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guy semi who might have been very isolated but now have these platforms

that same day take care of a sick relative of a difficult conversation with a loved one maybe start a new career basically live their life\nThis week we're bringing you personal conversations that illustrate the ways in which that lived experience affects how we vote today we'll hear from a young woman named Alexa groom and she's twenty four years old from a family of Democrats in Minnesota at a recent job is changing her political identity\nDid I hear that you've been taking online quiz is to figure out where you actually live in the Bible\nBecause I Do too I\nI I just feel stuck somewhere in the middle and generally it it feels pretty hard to talk about it the middle\nIs not such a comfortable place for a lot of people I mean are you feeling not as both parties going to move to extremes\nYeah I almost feel guilt that I no longer a line with some of my my previous ideas and and I think that's part of the problem is that\nIt seems like if you want to appear as a as a liberal and society you either have to believe everything on the table or you're out you're out of the group\nAnd there's so much going on but I feel like I Can't speak up because you're just asking for people to come after you did you grow up in a in a family that talked a lot about politics\nAll we talked a lot about politics [laughter] I was fortunate that my whole family lives nearby we would go to my grandma's house every Sunday and the other kids who go play but I like to sit and listen to you know my parents and my aunts and uncles talk and it was generally about\nYou know politics social issues that we were always encouraged to voice our thoughts and growing up in Minnesota which is\nYou know politics social issues that we were always encouraged to voice our thoughts and growing up in Minnesota which is pretty ... pretty democratic that's what I grew up hearing [noise]\nAs you started to develop your own political identity and how did that take shape short it was after the\nTwenty sixteen election I felt man I Need to get more involved and that's what led me to working in immigration because I saw all these families who were being deported and it broke my heart and I I got a great opportunity to help a lot of people but\nEverything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these\nThese evil people who don't care about these families and they don't want\nPeople coming to our country and\nAnd some of the most and lightning moments I had were when I did work with us when it would go pay bond or go down to the government center\nAnd what I saw is and it sounds kind of silly now saying out loud but they're not evil people there people who are looking at the same problem as me and believing that there's another solution that there is a different solution [noise]\nSo I guess it it gave me a lot more compassion towards the rights that I hadn't had before in my personal development yes I still feel like I have my roots in liberalism but\nI I feel like we should be listening to each other a little bit more 'cause I I had thought before that I had been listening and I I found out that I hadn't been\n[noise] I understand you also watched the Supreme Court nomination hearings of Brett Kavanaugh really closely I did how did those\nHow did those hearings shape how you're thinking about politics or the election\nIt's an issue that hits very close to home I have personally experienced sexual assault um people in my life\nIt's an issue that hits very close to home I have personally experienced sexual assault um people in my life were very close to me has been rates so it's it's not something that I take lightly whatsoever [noise] um I\nBelieve doctor for it and I believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I\nThere was just not quite enough evidence brought forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't know [noise]\nSo how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people in in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and say that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere you don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know there are just\nWhining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year what do you think about President Trump\nI'm not a fan I voted for voted for Clinton I I don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous I guess I I don't\nI think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous I guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angered\nI guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump's\nCorrect and because it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on\nStrictly party lines and and rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic check boxes I\nI Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least gone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a Republican and upcoming election [noise] have you talk to your family about your\nI have [laughter] than avoiding it you know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before they hear it on the radio\nAnd I I don't think that they would ever think less of me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things and go why would you say that so I just\nIt's it's taken me some time because I'm Still trying to work it out myself so [noise] I'll do my research and whoever I think is you know best for the job then you know that's where I'll put my check mark and that's where all focus my optimism\nAlexa grooming thank you so much for talking with us I think you know\nThis\nIs NPR News [noise] hundred is why women are running\nThank you know I mean this is NPR News\nHundreds of black women are running in federal state and local elections this year black women

to help her students understand religious identity and cycles of persecution\nHer students have a sense from justice they've been active and marches for refugee an immigrant rights she says they're now connecting those movements to their own Jewish history\nThey have felt very strongly about this because they know from studying the Holocaust how the doors are shut on\nAvi Baron Monroe is the

family goes right it was there last week and one child asked about um when I go back and my going to have to see the bullet holes in the scores\nBuried Munro says she directs teachers to listen first and ask questions before giving answers to say what do you know about it and find out where they're coming from usually it's a much simpler place in the adult she says teachers are not only helping students process tragedy there also teaching them that it's their job to make the world a better place\nIn Hebrew is to put on them which is basically repair of the world\nSuch tragedy there also teaching them that it's their job to make the world a better place\nIn Hebrew is to put on them which is basically repair of the world so from a very young age we the families and the school share and
