this relationship with this one thing we know from Trump or it would really be confusing for him to allow human rights abuses at a in another country\nTo stop him from trying to take advantage of a pretty good relationship\nUm UC what he's been saying about the north Korea and\nSupreme leader for example in the same interview that you are earlier a presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist and Turkish soil or I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying they would have to be hell to pay isn't that going to increase pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure well I mean you know the the the media was more outraged I think about Trump's individual meeting\nWell I'm not sure it will I mean you know the the the media was more outraged I think about

talking about that anymore I'm looking at you and I can say that it is horrific\nUm for the most popular Saudi journalist to be what looks like pretty clearly um killed 'em in a consulate abroad in in American allies conflict abroad by the way but I don't think that means that Trump is going to be pressured what what is interesting of course is the ability of the Senate\nAnd others to constrain Trump's foreign policy when they feel that he's acting beyond the pale is significant and in the same way that we've seen I'm sick it increases in sanctions against\nThe Russians that Trump has attempted to slow walk 'em I think the same thing is likely to occur\nThese heavy Saudi Arabia and and that's going to be very interesting to watch over the coming months especially because Trump is putting so much pressure on Iran after pulling out of the nuclear deal the about enemy of Saudi Arabia and Congress has been played on board with that so these two things are going to come together\nIs the government known for intimidating as citizens who live abroad that did that surprise in some way\nUm it again it's it's gotten worse certainly um but he's been threatened before\nUm you know he was forced out of his job um he was defending a lot of his friends who were opponents of the Saudi regime or he has a lot of friends in the United states in high places but there's no

Asia and also\nAcross Europe let's bring in NPR's Jim Zarroli who's in New York either Jim Hi David so how are the markets looking at the moment\nYeah it looks like another volatile day I mean we had a brief period where stocks were positive right after they open but now they're dropping again I've it continues this will be the sixth straight day\nThey're asking the five hundred is down um you know we would seems like the ... the mood in the market has really changed investors are trying to come to grips with with some of the big issues on the table yeah what what what has changed what investors coming to grips with\nWell one of the important things that interest rates the fed has been raising rates for a while now you have the central banks in Europe and Japan doing it as well uh when that happens it makes borrowing more expensive but it also when rates go up a bonds become more attractive to people take\nMoney out of stocks and put it in bonds also this continuing trade tension with China that that's certainly a factor um you know we have this new agreement with Matt Canada and Mexico but it doesn't even really looked like the like we're talking with China so I think invest a lot of American companies do business in China\nAnd will be affected by that um how badly we they are affected we should see in the next few weeks because this is the time of year when ... companies begin stay how they did in the third quarter so we will learn more but right now\nRight now I think a lot of investors are just nervous they're seeing what's happening with our with trade with China and that's being reflected in the markets\nYou know when that when um the stocks are doing well President Trump likes to point to it to some sort of indication of the economy ... what does this say or not say about the state of the economy\nWhile the stock market is not the economy so\nTo it to some sort of indication of the economy ... what does this say or not say about the state of

put out of state yesterday after that big sell off saying the fundamentals of the economy are quote incredibly strong however it's important to remember you know stock stock market investors are always looking ahead so they can sink that conditions are good right now but but\nYou know ... not be so sure about the future and clearly the markets are worried about interest rates and trade and the president is worried too because he\nAgain yesterday criticized the fed for raising interest rates you said I think that the fed has gone crazy or Larry Kudlow who directs the national economic council tried to walk back some of the criticism today on on CNBC but the president clearly doesn't like what the fed is doing\nAll right NPR's Jim Zarroli giving up a little bit on the ducks are and
