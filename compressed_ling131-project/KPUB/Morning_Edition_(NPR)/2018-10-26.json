don't know how like that got races hollow why\nNow NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting that the network has dropped Kelly from the today show line up and the cheap\nThat raises a hollow why now NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting that the network has dropped Kelly from the today show line up and that she appears likely to leave the network because of the fallout from those comments the morning David\n... okay so this is not the first time that making Kelly has made controversial comments about race here she is in twenty Thirteen when she was an anchor on Fox News for all your kids watch at home than it and just as white and she says it was a white man to tell us about her history of making racialized comments\nWhile these aren't uh the only examples of their number I remember back in twenty and the Santa Jesus comments back from twenty Thirteen she later said she'd been joking and last year claimed that she she regretted those remarks but\nI remember back in twenty ten um she spent a fair amount of time on a tiny tiny heat group black hate group called the new Black Panthers a one I Believe them ultimately a face criminal charges related to voter intimidation she spent over three and a half hours in a three week period focusing on it as though it was a threat to the Republican\nIndeed as one of her former colleagues were counted basically yelled at a white liberal a strategist for about ten minutes who she felt was failing to take it a sufficiently seriously\nOr one more example among several uh she keeps kept inviting the a former LA up a homicide detective mark ... farm in on the air to talk about a ... a\nCriminal justice issues and to talk about the question of are African American relations with police officers he of course had to admit on the stand he had said racist things over the years during the OJ trial um many people saw that as a as discredited things she welcomed him on the show\nDo you think that history played a role in NBC's decision to let her go\nI think it's played a strong role in uh the reaction of NBC's colleagues particularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American journalists are outraged who her remarks about ah which he felt was the acceptability of blackface\nParticularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American journalists are outraged to her remarks about ah which he felt was the acceptability a black face\nYeah NBC's nightly news with Lester Holt did a whole segment about this controversy on its OWN Network which seems to suggest something about making Kelly's colleagues and their attitude toward her\nWell for you and me it might be an admirable exercise and transparency and I think it was that I think it's worth pointing out also Lester Holt the only African American anchor ah of any made of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was saying we're not going to protect the starting with we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces and TV news\nWhich is really interesting the fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the way the network has handled these comments see something bigger about the way networks and companies are are tolerate it tolerating racialized or racist comments\n[noise] well it's hard not to look at this in light of a you know the reaction at times very slow of major news organizations to the me too movement which was something that for a significant time making Kelly embraced a sheet accuse her former boss at Fox News of sexually harassing\nHer I also think you can't divorce it from the fact that making Kelly I received very tepid a welcome from her colleagues NBC News should to displace him popular colleagues\nAnd that her reading some cells were mediocre and that even before all this happened uh she's been discussing with a network another role there because she needed to get out of that show now the show's gone and she's a negotiating her eggs as

reporting that the network has dropped Kelly from the today show lineup and that she appears likely to leave the network because of the fallout from those comments the morning David ... okay so this is not the first time that Megan Kelly has made controversial comments about race here she is in twenty Thirteen when she was an anchor on Fox News\nFor all your kids watch at home than it just is white Jesus was a white man to tell us about her history of making racialized comments\nWill these aren't ah the only examples of of their number I remember back in twenty and the Santa Jesus comments back from twenty Thirteen she later said she'd been joking and last year claimed that she she regretted those remarks but I remember back in twenty ten um she spent a fair amount of time on it\nSaid she'd been joking and last year claimed that she she regretted those remarks but\nI remember back in twenty ten um she spent a fair amount of time on a tiny tiny heat group black hate group called the new Black Panthers a one I Believe them ultimately a face criminal charges related to voter intimidation she spent over three and a half hours in a three week period focusing on it as though it was a threat to the Republican\nIndeed as one of her former colleagues were counted basically yelled at a white liberal a strategist for about ten minutes who she felt was failing to take it a sufficiently seriously or one more example among several uh she keeps kept inviting the a former LA up a homicide detective mark ... farm in on the air to talk about a ... a\nCriminal justice issues and to talk about ah the question of are African American relations with police officers he of course had to admit on the stand he had said racist things over the years during the OJ trial ah many people saw that as a as discredited thinks she welcomed among show\nDo you think that history played a role in NBC's decision to let her go\nI think it's played a strong role in uh the reaction of NBC's colleagues particularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American journalists are outraged to her remarks about ah what she felt was the acceptability a black face\nYeah NBC's nightly news with Lester Holt did a whole segment about this controversy on its OWN Network which seems to suggest something and making Kelly's collie an attitude toward her\nWell for you and me it might be an admirable exercise and transparency and I think it was that I think it's worth pointing out also Lester Holt the only African American anchor yeah uh uh of any made of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was saying we're not going to protect the starting with we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces and TV news which is really\nInteresting the fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the way the networks handle these comments safe something bigger about the way networks in ...\nI think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the weight and network has handled these comments see something bigger about the way networks and companies are are tolerate it tolerating racialized or racist comments\nWell it's hard not to look at this in light of a you know the reaction at times very slow of major news organizations to the me too movement which was something that for a significant time making Kelly embraced a sheet accuser foul balls at Fox News of sexually harassing\nHer I also think you can't divorce it from the fact that Megan Kelly I received very tepid a welcome from her colleagues NBC News she just play some popular collies\nAnd that her ratings themselves were mediocre and that even before all this happened uh she's been discussing with a network another role there because she needed to get out of that show now the show's gone and she's a negotiating her eggs that as well\nNPR's David Folkenflik Thanks David you bet\nIt's friday and time again for storing Horton today a mother talks with one

New Jersey senator Cory Booker the other two former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nNPR's national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson has been following this fast moving story I carry hire new well so what do we know about the person now in custody\nWell not much a law enforcement source tells me it is a man based in Florida we don't yet know his name or his background or importantly whether he acted alone we also have to know whether this person was motivated by politics are personal reasons or some other reason\nThe Justice Department says it's going to hold a news conference at two thirty pm eastern time to provide more details on this unfolding case only this morning investigators found a package\nAddressed a former intelligence chief James Clapper in New York and also disclose that they had found a package in Florida addressed to New Jersey senator Cory Booker\nWell a lot of attention in this case it focused on Florida overnight a local police their search to mail facility what were they looking for\nNight authorities were searching a package sorting facility and Florida in ... near Miami the operating fury with some of the packages went through that facility and through the u._s. mail they were looking for more devices but also any other clues and local TV in Florida is now beaming images of us\nI went through that facility and through the u._s. mail\nThey were looking for more devices but also any other clues and local TV and Florida is now beaming images of a strong law enforcement presence in plantation Florida at a site that appears to be connected to the suspect in federal custody a lot of manpower has been deployed nationwide though the postal inspectors\nThe FBI the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives have been on the case as well as local police I'm\nIn the Miami Dade County area and also of course the New York city police department to\nAnd there's also some ongoing activity in Virginia right yes\nIn Virginia the bulk of the investigation there is that the FBI lab in Quantico which has been analyzing some of these devices which look like homemade pipe bombs they've been looking for clues for\nHow the bombs were constructed and they've also been looking for DNA or fingerprints the bomber may have left behind no word yet on whether anything they found in that analysis has helped lead them to the suspect in South Florida\nOh that's interesting we'll have to wait and see I suppose so I mean one notable thing this whole time is that none of these bombs that actually exploded and so there's been some speculation that maybe they couldn't explode they didn't have the capacity what investigators said about that theory\nOn the record police sources and the FBI are declining to answer questions about whether the these bombs couldn't presented a lethal threat to anyone on background overnight in earlier this morning I was hearing\nA law enforcement was inclined to think they did not present a lethal threat there could be a reason for that some former bomb analyst at the ATF has raised questions about whether these devices included a key component that would have set them off that would have detonated them it appeared\nFrom the photos that were made public that perhaps these devices lacked that key component\nBut nonetheless police had been advising folks as I had the FBI to be\nThat perhaps these devices lacked that key component\nBut nonetheless police had been advising folks outside the FBI to be very careful when they were looking at any manila envelopes or any suspicious packages because uh they needed to be considered a potential threat\nAnd they law enforcement right now even as advising people to call authorities call police called the FBI facing anything suspicious now we know that the New York police commissioner James O'Neill son last last afternoon\nThat the device they've recovered in New York that was addressed to the actor Robert Deniro did not pose a biological threat to not\nUm contain anthrax or any material like that but that authorities were still treating all of these parcels as potentially dangerous and the analysis may not be done yet as to what's in all of these uh these bombs potential well so law enforcement officials still have a long way to go here\nAnd PR as justice correspondent Carrie Johnson Carrie thank you so much

race in a former Republican stronghold against Democrat Dan McCready NPR's Kelsey Snell has more on how major shifts in North Carolina politics mirror changes across America\nFor more than fifty years voters in the Knight congressional district in North Carolina have been sending Republicans to Congress but things are changing\nThis year Harris a conservative Baptist minister is living in the polls

from other states and other countries are flocking to jobs in places like Raleigh Durham in Charlotte young generations of farmers are doing it too he says like the rest of America Democrat in North Carolina dominate the cities and suburbs but things change the further out you go\nYou look at the political fine for them and you can almost see other county law and the shift between the Democratic signs were on one side of the county line and you're moving to another county more rural county and all of a sudden it's Trump country\nThe line isn't so clear in other areas like Polk County where the view of the political trend line depends on who you ask county commissioner ray gas ... says the areas about sixty percent Republican but he's the only elected a Democrat\nAnd well he sees his party dominating in statewide offices in the future that doesn't mean the entire state is turning blue\nWhere ... ... ... or ... rule which for him to go much more Republican\n... county Republican
