your is your quiz master ...\nIt comes from political scientist John ... at the University of Nebraska he's going to describe two towns and you have to guess which one is liberal and which is conservative here's ten number one the schools would\nStress you know patriotism and respect him it would be a very rules based uh educational system but how is this would be fairly similar the lawns would be a very nicely kept in a beautifully green and mode of the town of be quiet with lots of\nChurches All right and here is town number two\nThe schools would be based more on experience are all kinds of things rather than than rote memory people would prefer older houses with wooden floors or rather than wall to wall carpeting um they would keep the yards natural\nMemory people would prefer older houses with wooden floors or rather than wall to wall carpeting um they would keep the yards natural lots of bars and community theaters and foreign films are more of those than churches\nThis quiz was probably pretty easy for you and to explain why we're joined now by NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam Hi Shankar I Know so the first time I'm guessing was conservative and the second one was liberal right exactly\nNot hitting is drawing on fairly traditional stereotypes about liberals and conservatives conservatives prefer author and rules liberals prefer experiential schools and community theaters now those are stereotypes which means that they're going to be liberals who hate community theaters and conservatives who despised churches but the question that hitting and others are asking is\nHow come these stereotypes are so often accurate\nIf being liberal and conservative is all about our political views how come these labels describe all kinds of other things about us from the kinds of food we prefer to eat to the kinds of poetry we laugh\nTo where we want to hang out so he is arguing that our political views spring from something deeper than just our beliefs about big government or small government\nPrecisely he's arguing that political preferences at least in part\nCome from a psychological and biological predispositions\nThe most compelling evidence for this comes from studies involving large numbers of twins some of whom are identical and some of whom are fraternal\nIdentical twins share the same genes fraternal twins share fewer genes identical twins to not to have more political preferences in common than fraternal twins do even though each twin ... presumably shared the same family and bringing\nHeight for example turns out to be about eighty percent a heritable when you're subject to the same kind of design personality traits are about fifty six percent political views thirty to forty percent\nThirty to forty percent so he's saying some part of our political beliefs come from biology yes and of course\nPolitical views thirty to forty percent\nThirty to forty percent so he's saying some part of our political beliefs come from biology yes and of course that conclusion upset a lot of people\nAnd they tended to over interpret those results and make it sound like we were saying that everything was was genetic but you know if it's thirty four percent genetic that obviously is you know fifty sixty Seventy percent comes from the environment so all we're saying is that that genetic component is not zero but apparently that was enough that that some people were upset about that\nWhat he and his colleagues are saying is that biology and psychology play a role in our political preferences snow all\nLiberals and conservatives in the United states often accused one another or stupidity or malice but hitting and his colleagues outright one reason we might not see the world the same way is because we simply not lie at the same way that is a nice way of looking at it indeed offer some compassion for the other side\n... done to miss hosted the hidden brain podcast where you can learn more about how psychology
