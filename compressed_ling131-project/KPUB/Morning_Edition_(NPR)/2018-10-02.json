of the women who were planning a women's march it was also anger at some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the interim ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march\nAnd it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history\nAnd it obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious\nAnd it was really dismissed and a lot of quarters as being about the cats the Pussy hats you know a bunch of women getting together and there's a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's march seriously what are these women gonna do not just running for school board down the road but

inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government\nSo they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women\n[noise] you referenced the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out are condemned to in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outsized penalty for women of color who do so\nDo you think those voices are being heard loudly enough in this moment\nI think it's almost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and\nSo marginalized for so long and in fact it's women of color who have been the leaders and the leading thinkers have so many of our social movements in ways that have remain invisible to us so when we think about me to one of the things that gets lost\nIs that the definition of sexual harassment stems from cases that were brought in the seventies by

civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases of having in many cases have been brutally sexually harassed and their workplaces\nIn Nineteen Ninety One it was a need a hill his testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea that sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter]\nIt's Toronto Burke who in two thousand six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement Iraq's\nI think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience with the reality of the harm they sustained but in fact\nAll of that is for grounded by women of color whose stories so often get lost or kind of erased\nAs the author of a book called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [noise]\nThat's true but that could have been true of so many other weeks of the past ... years although\nWe have to say there are plenty of women who

country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this is part of a long process social movements take a long time and the kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around Kavanaugh\nIs going to be part of a far longer story that's going to extend deep into our future\nRebecca Traister is the author of the book good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger is

problem now you're just giving them a whole other mechanism to keep people in\nThe ACLU and more than a dozen other legal groups have raised similar concerns the bill also mandates the use of pre trial assessment tools essentially it's a computer program that aims to measure risk after putting in a raft and conviction history and other data\nThat algorithm gives the bill of near of objective science attorney rifling says but in fact becomes a kind of feedback loop merely reflecting social biases\nIs a pretty well documented fact the police stop search decaying arrest black people more than white people poor people more than wealthy people\nAnd the courts treat people of color and treat poor people worse or that it's very factors that the risk assessment tools are looking at to judge who's higher risk\nIt's not yet clear just what data would actually go into the algorithm the bill doesn't say\nSharif's fan over dean CEO of a nonprofit pre trial justice Institute admits the

the bail industry which would be put out of business under the new law hopes to overturn it at the ballot box an industry coalition is currently collecting signatures to try for a statewide ballot

A. B. B. E. L. dot com this is MORNING EDITION\nFrom NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep one woman found a way to attack high health insurance prices\nAnd that's news because it's hard for any one person to do if you go to the hospital the hospital charges your insurer which passes the cost on to you and it's hard to negotiate a better price and that system Marshall Allen of the nonprofit newsroom ProPublica has been investigating high health insurance costs\nAnd he has the story of a woman who used her power to hold them down either Marshall\nGood morning Steve who is this woman we're talking about sixty eight year old grandmother named Marilyn Bartlett and Maryland Bartlett took over the Montana Employee Benefit plan in twenty fourteen\nAnd when she took over the plan which covers about thirty thousand state employees and their families that plan was in deep trouble it's self funded so the employer paid all the health care bills and it was projected to lose about fifty million dollars in the coming years and basically go broke\nSo the classic situation here that people in all sorts of insurance arrangements face where they're basically told healthcare is really expensive gets more expensive every year and we're short of money we need more from you\nExactly and if people hadn't noticed the cost of your health care benefits is rising there's about a hundred and fifty one million of us who get our healthcare benefits through our employers and part of the problem is our employers have been deferring to the medical industry when it comes to the cost of health care and so the industry\nIt was projected to lose about fifty million dollars in the coming years and basically go broke\nSo the classic situation here that people in all sorts of insurance arrangements face where they're basically told healthcare is really expensive gets more expensive every year and we're short of money we need more from you\nExactly and if people hadn't noticed the cost of your health care benefits is rising there's about a hundred and fifty one million of us who get our health care benefits through our employers and part of the problem is our employers have been deferring to the medical industry when it comes to the cost of health care\nAnd so the industry keeps raising the cost and basically those costs keep getting passed on to the workers what did Marilyn Bartlett do differently\nShe had spent Thirteen Years working in the insurance industry\nAnd so she knew a lot of the games she was also kind of a math nerd who knew how to follow the money and so working with our team is she compared what her plan paid each hospital in the state the bigger hospitals to what they were paid by Medicare and Medicare publishes its prices and so she could see\nThat her health plan was paying hospitals in the state anywhere from two times what Medicare gets paid to five times what Medicare gets paid\nWow and so she said that was too much\nIt was too much I mean the plan is going broke her charge was to get things under control and so she had to do some really hardball negotiating and why she decided to do which is kind of a revolutionary idea in the health care world as she decided to set her own prices and set the plans prices\nNow in this case she had some leverage and actually all employers have this leverage because the health care industry really does need our money\nSo she said look you hospitals that are five times and Medicare rate you're going to need to bring your prices down to about twice the Medicare rape\nWonder if hospitals simply had to accept

brutally sexually harassed and their workplaces\nIn Nineteen Ninety One it was a need a hill his testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea that sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter]\nIt's Toronto Burke who in two thousand six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement Iraq's\nI think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience with the reality of the harm they sustained but in fact\nAll of that is for grounded by women of color who stories so often get lost or kind of erased\nAs the author of a book called good and bad the

by the left so as women think are only a productive force if it's done in the service to a progressive partisan agenda\nNot at all it is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still\nI think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this is part of a long process social movements take a long time and the kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around Kavanaugh\nIs going to be part of a far longer story that's going to extend deep into our future\nRebecca Traister is the author of the

his or her determination whether a suspect is a low medium or high risk for flight or to public safety routine believes this will dramatically expand the number of people who will be detained pre trial\nHe points to one section in particular deep in the bill section Thirteen twenty that Eighteen a sub section five that section so broadly worded booting argues it could encompass anyone for any offense that he says will kill the power ever more into the hands of prosecutors police and judges\nUnder SP ten now prosecutors can seek detention for virtually any crime regardless of whether it's violent or involves weapons or whether the person accused as a prior history or under this law\nProsecutors have the discretion to seek preemptive detention of a person with no criminal record charged with a low level misdemeanor\nAnd then there's its impact on the deals currently across the U.S more than Ninety percent of criminal cases are settled in a plea deal that could include dismissal or a diversion program not a trial\nJohn rape playing with human rights watch says he's deeply concerned this bill simply replaces one course of tactic for another bail for pre trial detention that if he

day the new Dell reform law in California does not address that problem now you're just giving them a whole other mechanism to keep people in\nThe ACLU and more than a dozen other legal groups have raised similar concerns the bill also mandates the use of pre trial assessment tools essentially it's a computer program that aims to measure risk after putting in a raft and conviction history and other data\nThat algorithm gives the bill of near of objective science attorney racing says but in fact becomes a kind of feedback loop merely reflecting social biases\nIs a pretty well documented fact the police stop search detain arrest black people more than white people poor people more than wealthy people\nAnd the courts treat people of color and treat poor people worse or the various factors that the risk assessment tools are looking at to judge who's higher risk\nIt's not yet clear just what data would actually go into the algorithm the bill doesn't say\nSharif's fan over dean CEO of a nonprofit pre trial justice Institute admits the new law is far from perfect but she says some of these concerns are a bit alarmist fan over the notes that discretion to detain or release pre

new law she thinks will simply help judges get it right more consistently\nAll that and we'll hear how quite make it should also right people being identified as a threat to public safety and it shouldn't melt in your people being needlessly incarcerated ending trial\nMeantime the bail industry which would be put out of business under the new law hopes to overturn it at the ballot box an industry coalition is currently collecting signatures to try for a statewide ballot initiative\nThat may put bail bondsmen in an awkward de facto alliance with scores of progressive legal groups who
