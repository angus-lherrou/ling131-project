out of ... gave us two options either be a victim and don't do anything or become a protectionist into the lives of these kids\nI talked with a million Kramer about his reporting earlier this week\nCan you introduce us to the women you met so you go to Brazil to try to follow up on the children who were born out of this week a crisis and you meet this network of mothers\nYeah that's right I mean it was a cart remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds on educated men even very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm typing with what

this network of matter\nYeah that's right I mean it was I was quite remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds uneducated many of them very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm typing with what happened\nBut they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I when I was that um they were very very they get it they were very tight group loss of solidarity very to time and women some of them I'm wearing caged in you know political campaigning\nUm they certainly didn't take any known since from us that it was a ... a a degree of skepticism towards the press because they feel like the press was involved in their lives and then kind of just forgot about them um they are pretty skeptical about doctors as well which is kind of common to special needs parents\nSo they were quite a strong set of women I mean obviously very different ... the leader of this group which is called the anointed mothers of angels\nOr this is a group in ... states which is a sort of\nIt's a ... one of the states which was was affected by the ... the leader of that group is ... and she is you know really quite a powerful personality or she doesn't mean I was you know she's one of these people that just give you a look and you sort of just stopped talking\nA but also very charming and you know she's made a lot of friends with politicians

people that just give you a look and you sort of just stopped talking\nA but also very charming and you know she's made a lot of friends with politicians sympathetic ... people have started to try and campaign for the women\nWhat is the health status of these children who were born with the guy I mean you write that in the beginning these mothers were getting a horrible process that their children may not even survive beyond a year so I'm well how are they doing\nWell that's right and so around ten percent of them have died most of those so that's about three hundred and twenty children most of us children probably died very soon off the bus\nOr a few of them are cut things up chest infections through breathing food in when they were learning to wean but on the other hand there are children who are actually doing pretty well I mean this is actually this is one of the things that fascinated me the most as\nThey they were very mixed group of children so there was some children who can walk to can stand there was some children who got what we can talk\nI'm Still maybe a little bit behind ... is it you know at that age but then there are other children who you know they can't roll over and that the fed through achieve into that told me that that much much more um you know disabled\nSome of the children who are more physically disabled or actually talking to the left side and some of the children who are more cognitively disabled cannot stand up and and walk around\nIt's an incredibly mixed thing\nNot so much so that you actually tell the story of twins or the girl who was born

turned off him who he was acting just like you would expect it to an offer a boy to act [noise]\nJumping up and down and climbing on his mom and I know I Know this kind of thing um so they didn't really understand they didn't know why it affected one twin and ... ... ... it's it's quite possible that it was because of genetic differences between them so that they now know that\nSome people seem to have a sort of genetic defense against the cap\nYou write that the fact that families are at a turning point why it's such an important moment in in their story\nIce or is that the families are really thinking about the social aspect so while they're largely going to be like like [noise]\nWhat school are they going to go to ... and how would they be able to access to school um will moms be able to go back in and work again what they're going to do about child care and and\nSo we're able to join um the actress ... she went around the some of the more deprived parts of northern Brazil
