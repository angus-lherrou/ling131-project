in Florida where one of the hottest races in the country got a little more heated yesterday\nThe Tampa Bay times reporting that attacks shows the Democratic candidate for governor Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum was given free tickets to the Broadway show Hamilton as a gift from an FBI agent posing as a developer something Gillum still fiercely denies he\nIs one of the breakout star of this election season leading the Republican candidate former congressman and Iraq War vet and President Trump's favorite Ron dissent is by as many as twelve points in the polling the two had a contentious to our debate on CNN on Sunday and we invited both men to sit down with us this week only Gillum accepted he\nIs the first African American democratic gubernatorial candidate in Florida as history probably is most progressive he supports hiking the state's corporate tax rate to fund education raising the minimum wage and he is for a single payer health care system\nWill have more in a minute on the new reporting on alleged gives to Gillum against something he denies and what he told us about the accusations but first we started our conversation with him this week on his stand on Medicare for all\nI said I've endorsed a Medicare for all at the federal level and I encourage them to move diligently to get that done Florida could not go there alone we would need a federal solution here in at the very least we would need\nA conservative states coming together to negotiate a prescription drugs\nAnd others on behalf of its citizens and so what is within my power however is to expand Medicaid or which is what we've committed to doing for over eight hundred thousand of the most medically needy people in my state\nRight now I'm a Republican so refused to expand Medicaid for that group costing the state six\nThe needy people in my state right now or a Republicans have refused to expand Medicaid for that group costing the state six billion dollars that we could bring down from the federal government that right now is being given away to other states\nWhile we've got one in five people in my state going to emergency rooms to access healthcare that's unacceptable I mean Mr dissent has said that a cancer patient when asked how she was supposed to get access to health care is that you could always go to an emergency room\nThat response in my opinion is disqualifying for any one running for governor of the state of Florida\nLet's talk about crime you are the mayor of Tallahassee which is the biggest city in Leon county that is right which has the highest crime rate in this state we were traveling in a young African American who is also coming to Tallahassee as we were flying here said to us you know I I I think this is a problem he's in\nTallahassee is the eight largest city in the state of Florida and were twenty eighth in crime\nMy city is experiencing a five year low in our crime rate\nMr dissenters described ... community as one where people are sheltering themselves in homes in avoiding the streets and he's he clearly has never spent any time in Tallahassee regular everyday working people in my state recognize that communities are going to have crime they know that\nThe question is what if communities do about it and what we've done about it in my city is Wi Fi or fifty new law enforcement officers over the past four years we brought down our crime rate we instituted restored of justice practices created reentry program so that folks who are returning citizens to our community get\nThe opportunity to reenter society and have dignity around their work this categorization of a high lawless or you know ... this is Trump the in politics it is not based in reality I Want to see that President Trump you know in\nDebate with Ron dissent is you said he was just too much for the president you may know both about how you felt about pets\nI Want to ask you about President Trump you know in your debate with Ron descent as you said he was a student for the president you may no bones about how you felt about President Trump and his loosen is without acts of leadership well an absence of leadership as you as you put it\nPresident Trump's pulling numbers they have bumped up is it may be a mistake in a state like Florida to call your opponent astute first of all that you know the kind of language that we expect from others\nWell I'll tell you I Will take my chances I Am sick to my stomach or at the national at the state at the local level people normalizing the behavior that comes out of Washington DC I refuse to do with\nAh I'm teaching my kids what it means to the golden rule to treat people like you want to be treated our president goes around making fun of handicapped individuals\nReferring to women and all kinds of vile ways objectify women and I have a daughter and so uh I'm prepared to take my chances calling the president out for what I Believe\nIt's completely inappropriate behavior and Mr descent as he is sucking up to the president he does a consider himself and apprentice Donald Trump if we're ever going to restore decency and commonsense to our body politic more people have to join me in decrying this kind of Davis if\nA racist Xena phobic and sexist language out I'm never going to make apologies but trying to create a kind of society and a kind of a community or where my kids will be proud to grow up in Iran\nJust answered says if you're this strongly speaking out against the president as governor how do you work with the ministry and how all this money on many for the environmental plans that you have for the state\nUnfortunately for most of the center of this is not Russia or we don't bow down to the president we work with a check for instance under governor Rick Scott he disagreed vehemently ...\nThe dissenters this is not Russia or we don't bow down to the president we work with a take for instance under governor Rick Scott he disagreed vehemently with President Obama President Obama in spite of that vehicle that disagreement\nTried to send the state of Florida two point eight billion dollars to build high speed rail governor Rick Scott said no thank you we don't believe in Obama stimulus money\nAs much as I disagree with the conduct and the qualifications of this president if he tries to send Florida two point eight billion dollars I'm going to take that money and I'm a put that money to work for everyday Floridians when I'm governor my differences aside from the president he's going to find a willing partner in me who's willing to\nHelp him on infrastructure help on transportation Rick Scott Knight who again don't agree on a lot politically\nDuring this last storm hurricane Michael we spoke every day on the phone\nTalk a little bit about the environment which has been hammering your region your opponent Santa's is now positioning himself as a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist he says he wants to build reservoirs to restore water flow and prevent those toxic algae blooms he supports a ban on fracking drilling off the coast\nCertainly different from your Republican sitting governors Scott\nMy opponent can say anything he wants to in an election year but I have to measure him by his six years in Congress someone who voted to undermine the environmental protection agency someone who voted against the clean Water Act thirty three times\nAs the mayor of photos capital city we broke ground on a one hundred and twenty acre solar farm tripling the amount of solar energy that we produce and the city of Tallahassee where we sit above the ah Florida an aquifer\nAnd where we noticed through our spray field operations that we were contributing to hire nitrate levels and what color springs we took the necessary steps to begin treating that water at the new church she every level almost portable level to reduce\nAnd what color springs we took the necessary steps to begin treating that water at the new church she every level almost portable level to reduce the number of nitrates going into ... when we get elected governor we're going to have a governor who believes in science\nPut some teeth back into our department of environmental protection where we have deregulated across that agency allowing the biggest polluter to write their own rules\nIs they're going to come a point where people like you have to say to people we can't afford to have you wiped out time after time\nWell listen you go to a issue that is going to be hugely at the top of our agenda\nWe recognize that we are highly susceptible to the impacts of global warming and sea level rise\nAnd so we've got to start building are more resilient state and yes that in some cases will mean that there are parts of our state we're not going to be able to continue allow growth to take place already insurance an actuarial studies are showing some of these areas that are going to be under water\nThat's Andrew Gillum mayor of Tallahassee democratic a gubernatorial candidate here in Florida ... thanks so much for speaking to us of course take care\nPart of our talk with Andrew Gillum this past Monday and as we said yesterday the Tampa Bay times reported that attacks from Guillaume his old friend and lobbyist Adam Corey\nShows that a man they both thought was a developer\nHad Broadway tickets for Gillum and others including ... brother now the tax for Cory reads Mike Miller and the crew have tickets for us for Hamilton tonight Gillum replies awesome news about Hamilton Mike Miller turned out to be an FBI agent part of an

exciting races to watch we've talked about the governor's race between the Democrat Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum and the Republican former Congressman Ron dissent is there's a tight race as well for a Senate seat\nNot on the ballot but on people's minds Donald Trump in a hurricane here's some of what we're hearing [noise]\nBecause he had the Democrats\nI'm a Republican so I'm going to be voted\nCandidates or agree with [noise]\nI get a job\nThat Wendy Alaska is in Miami also with her Miami their rosy Patel let Jake Bernstein an Alexander Trujillo healthcare President Trump can the sitting governor or the Republican Rick Scott unseat longtime Senator Bill Nelson is luckily not to let convene are Florida politics round table\nTo talk about it all and make Acevedo\nUnseat longtime Senator Bill Nelson has a lot going on to let's convene are Florida politics round table\nTo talk about it all and Ricky Acevedo an anchor for Univision special correspondent for fusion joins us from W ELL are in in Miami hiring gay Hi Robyn I'm getting closer to you I'm In your state I'm Glad [laughter]\nAnd we're the here in Tallahassee Ryan daily a reporter for WFSU Hi Ryan Robin from young well we want to start with you because we want to get to that governor's race um the Democrat Andrew Gillum as we said\nHas been fending off these charges that he took tickets are handled it I mean Hamilton makes it into this race and his share of of vacation at a couple of friends took\nA you know just one trip that he took these as gifts from developers it turned out to be an FBI agent and a and a U.S an ethics commission investigation he is not the subject of that investigation now the Tampa Bay times yesterday broke the story of the text\nIn which a Gillum his friend a lobbyist told him about this Hamilton ticket that this developer had for them Gillum responds awesome but he is insisting it even today he thought his brother paid for that ticket\nIs is this going to hurt us this sticking his far ahead of dissent is in some polling\nRight yeah I think it's important to remember that this is part of that state ethics board investigation I talked with a Gillum lawyer Barry Richard back in September who said he he doesn't expect this investigation to be concluded by the time people have gone to the polls anyway\nSo I think what it's all going to hinge on when it's all going to come down to and you'll see this tonight in the gubernatorial debate here who order\nThat or it's going to come down to how Andrew Gillum answers these questions I mean almost undoubtedly the dissenters camp is going to try to use this to point to uh dishonesty to inconsistencies in the story I think I think if you are um\nTo try to use this to point to uh dishonesty to inconsistencies in the story I think I think if you are I'm On the Gillum team you are hoping that he uh you know sticks with his story um and again it's going to come down to how he answers the question\nAnd it's really an important race because uh you know they couldn't be more different he's a progressive I'm a bit here and dissenters on Fox News earlier this month\nYou know I have a positive relationship with the president tape people in the administration Florida has a lot of needs from our military footprint our transportation or water resources which been a big problem here and we need to work constructively with the federal government\nAndrew Gillum is running on impeaching Donald Trump I don't know what for 'em but I don't think he's going to be able to do anything productive way with the federal government and and I will be able to do that\nAnd Ryan so how is President Trump laying out and say well\nI mean I think you need to look no further than the Florida Republican primary um to to you know get a sense of how Trump affects races here in the state um you could say the same just got the Trump bump so to speak in fact there is a pretty good sound bite of Trump's and ah\nYou know I'm slightly paraphrasing here but I sent that tweet and being being the sand is was up by you know however many points and and I I was actually a downtown where the Gillum campaign was are awaiting their primary night results\nThe Republican primary was decided\nWell before the Democratic primary that was coming down to the wire so I think any time you know we've seen that President Trump can be a wildcard stepping into races tweeting support\nFor a candidate Enrique as they don't let me bring you in here because the president also has pulled a wildcard in these couple of weeks leading up to November six elections and that's this and he calls it the caravan of uh some say refugee some say undocumented immigrants making their way through Mexico\nKind of a some say refugees some say undocumented immigrants making their way through Mexico to the U.S border they are going something like twenty five miles a day at this rate they will not even reached that border till December the number who reach it but the president has been positioning this as a you know almost an attack\nOn the border how's that resonating where you are in Miami\nThink he's been able to position this as an attack on Democrats blaming them for what's happening with the Caribbean and same they're all for open borders I think this is one of those um ... it's certainly a politically charged caravan are they very convenient time for the president\nBush said the the issue of immigration front and center which already was to be honest uh in in this election along with health care and and the economy\nUm I Do think it could be one of those X factors coming to the election Robin and I'm ... would really see the impact all the garbage and all the attention describe and has had in the last couple of days and they will have a in the run up to your mid term election\nUh we'll see about ... ... depending on the turnout both parties I think I read it as a turnout election\nWell and not to be clear this is a cat and that a reporter was organized by a church is that it happens quite often it's it's just that this one has come up on the radar and the last one that was of this size\nA group of people um you know organized again by churches to try to seek refugee status in the United states in the last ... made got so much attention that CNN is reporting that just three people\nOr were accepted into the country so there is that but I just just to underscore this Enrique we we you know people are Latino Hispanic voters do not all vote in a block\nUm you will have people who will be of you know coming from the same countries will resent people who are coming across the border and we've been talking to construction workers or builders who are desperate\nThe ... of you know coming from the same countries will resent people who are coming across the border and we've been talking to construction workers or builders who are desperate for some of those people they're seeing on the screen to come work here\nAnd that's an excellent point in Florida it's a great example Robin you see a Cuban American community a traditionally a very conservative a very broad Republican there they have been very pro Trump\nOr from one state in two thousand and sixteen now you have Puerto Ricans and many of them who are already in Florida before money about all the ... over the Puerto Ricans I have seen a coming to Florida and that are\nUm some of them have read registered to to be part of this midterm election and and they will certainly play a role in the result\nUh for for the governor's race in in in the Senate race so it's it's very interesting and yes the Latino community is not a monolithic community different interests and and different agendas\nI Want to turn out to the Senate race or the Democrat Bill Nelson the incumbent has held the seat since two thousand one but some polling shows that a sitting Governor Scott has a shot the two candidates had a debate earlier this month on Telemundo fifty one let's listen to a little of that first Governor Scott\nCenter Nelson\nThey like high taxes um\nAndrew Cuomo said he wants to raise taxes forty percent [noise]\nCenter Nelson voted for tax increases are higher taxes over three higher taxes higher taxes over three hundred times\nAnd Here's Senator Nelson responding\nWell the governor keeps coming out with one whopper after another\nUh apparently you never got your mouth washed out for soap after telling a lie because\nYou keep on going on on every part of my record\nHigh daily from because he had his you here in Tallahassee I always counsel\nAnd going on on every part of my record\nHigh and daily from WFSU here in Tallahassee always colorful but who's the edge here and I especially with\nThe hurricane that just hit I every time I turn the TV on icy Governor Scott in a little kept visiting you know some terrible you know disaster where a school's roof has been ripped off I mean he is seemingly everywhere so who's who's got the edge you know I I mean", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "24"}
