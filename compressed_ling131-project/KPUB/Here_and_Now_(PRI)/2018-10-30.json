Krueger combination of not what the fed is doing which remember short term interest rates and that's what the market itself is doing for the ten year treasury note on through the thirty year treasury bond very moved up treatment for some reason\nWe also asked him whether the tax cuts it already had their impact on the economy or whether there was more to come\nTo impact has been really quite significant but it's already completed\nHe did say the and back to the tax cuts on the deficit is concerning and could lead to inflation we also talked with him about the economy more generally he writes about it in his new book capitalism in America a history which he co authored with Adrian will drudge I asked Alan Greenspan if there are two economies in America\nWho have more of them to\n... it's more directly related to a structure boots on me for example the so called rust belt who's populated largely by industries which are very old\nFor example the so called rust belt is populated largely by industries which are very old Silicon Valley for example is a classic case of a very new\nThere are very different pockets of economic growth and various degrees of stagnation\nThrew out the country and it depends obviously whether Iran you Gregory in areas where it was sort of being prices mean something or whether you're on the west coast\nOr the issue of high tech stock prices a little one everyone talks about so the one thing about this country it's very diverse and it depends where you are\nYou right in your book that the growth surge added this country experience from Nineteen Ninety eight to two thousand for it increasingly looks like a brief interruption of a much longer term decline rather than the dawn of a new era of tech driven growth why do you say that\nWell when you look out into the future all we're slowing down our rate of growth and productivity flying uh well basically because\nFear you know when to deal with fear it is very difficult to classify it\nBut you can you can look at the consequences of it and the consequence is basically a suppressed level of innovation and therefore of capital investment and uh just inclination to take risks\nIn the book instantly I might add discussing whether the law at the long term outlook is all about\nHow we say that the issue the aging of the population and its consequences on entitlements as having a significant negative deterioration over the long run\nAnd its consequences on entitlements as having a significant negative deterioration over the long run\nThe reason for that is what the data on a critically show is that\nIn title ... which are mandated by law\nA gradually and inexorably driving out gross domestic savings and the economy\nDollar for dollar and so long as that happens we have to borrow from abroad which is our current account deficit and uh we're now built up in a trillion dollar debt to foreigners\nBut what this is causing this\nIs largely the demographic issue the fact that the population is aging right now the official actuaries of the Social Security system say in order to get our Social Security and retirement funds\nAnd balance they'd have to cut benefits by twenty five percent indefinitely into the future to do you think they should do that [laughter]\nFirst of all do I think it's going to happen I don't know but this is one of the reasons why inflation is the major problem out there\nSo long as you don't do it it could cause the debt overall total government that go over a rise indefinitely and that is an unstable situation where\nYou say inflation ... it's a big problem out there and we've been talking about this for years that inflation is actually remain very low for the last many years\nThat's correct and in fact it's been at the lowest in American history\nAnd that's all the more reason to be concerned about uh for example interest rates since fifth century bc Greece when not terrible\nAnd that's all the more reason to be concerned about uh for example interest rates since fifth century bc Greece when not terribly different from wherever they are today\nSo the presumption is that interest rates will rise if for no other reason that they're below the long term human nature to determine stability\nWhat do you say to people who say that you kept interest rates to low or during the dot com boom or right afterwards and that that helped lead to what we saw back in two thousand eight\nRecent we kept rates low as ... on employment rates so what's the fact that productivity was rising at a very rapid pace than the dot com boom was no moving through the economy the latter part of the nineties\nSo the reason we did move is that we didn't feel that the signals were there and indeed the unemployment rate kept falling oh well below a brief usual expectation of like four percent\nBut with productivity rising as rapidly as it did it change the numbers and indeed uh the unemployment rate kept falling below four percent with no impact on information\nSo if does low interest rates were not a a cause of the financial crisis in your view what was what do you think led to that in two thousand\nI think that what we specifically learnt strangely for the first time in two thousand and it is there a two conditions as quiet for a crisis\nOne is there a toxic assets like a secure dies two mortgages but the critical issue is how those mortgages and finance\nOf like a security has two mortgages\nBut the critical issue is how those mortgages and financed and one of the finance or by leverage that that's the dangerous signal\nYou see anything like that right now no not in any area\nWell general I don't know that that was a very extraordinary period court narrowed it would've been wholly inappropriate for the Federal Reserve she breaks down during the period of very low unemployment that was what the period was\nI was having a conversation with somebody in the banking industry recently who said\nThat one of their concerns was that unemployment is so low right now I'm that they're going to be a lot of people who are hired\nA for jobs and paid more than they should be paid and they're not actually qualified because it's a job seekers market right now that that the people that want to hire are having a difficult time in many cases hiring people and that that is going to lead to lower productivity and potentially inflation what do you think about that\nWell basically it's not lower productivity but it's an issue when you get the sort of tight labor market\nWage rates ... hours of necessity\nAnd it's for wage rate rises which affect the cost of production and hence induce corporations to start raising prices basically because their costs are going up that's where the problem was that hasn't really been growing up\nI Want to ask you about one more big thing that you talk about in your book or an as the issue of creative destruction um first of all explain what that means\nOr creative destruction\nBut in your book or an as the issue of creative destruction um first of all explain what that means\nA creative destruction is a process by which people do two things they continuously invest but the investment is displacing older equipment but more importantly it engenders unemployment and uh\nAnd the next trash shared Jonah him because they are super that money

hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh which has been in the news because of this tragedy it's leafy streets and historic houses much of the population is Jewish but it's also Mr Rogers actual neighborhood it's we're Fred Rogers lived when he was making a show\nA show we wish we had to help us through a week like this\nWere British ... is executive director with the Fred Rogers center she's with us from ... Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh that's where Rogers was foreign uh he moved to grow hill when he got married uh Roberta thank you for joining us and you knew Fred Rogers what can you tell us first of all about his time in squirrel hill\nWell then this is really sad day in the neighborhood [noise] um I Know that I'm afraid enjoyed the community that diverse than the diversity in the community and square all hell\nAnd um he loved walking down the streets and I'm noticing the trees and then the various temples and synagogues and churches\nUm that all made him feel at home um that bakeries that delicatessens and he often commented that he could hear yet ... Hebrew and it doesn't have a language is spoken as he walked down the street in fact community\nHe actually learned ... pay get yes well do you think that part of the Mr Roger's neighborhood that we saw on television was based on squirrel hill\n[noise] um they didn't just neighborhood I think I'm certainly had some of the philosophy of the squirrel hill neighborhood um you know I think that it it was a fantasy neighbor that the neighborhood of make believe but I think what came through with it\nWe're all hell neighborhood um you know I think that it it was a fantasy neighborhood the neighborhood of make believe but I think what came through with the way people cared for one another which certainly I think with reflected to him is through the ... community and probably also taken the lead probe community where he grew up\nDuring the time he made his show there were not mass shootings are in the news the way there are today but there was certainly violence or we're reminded of Nineteen sixty eight after Robert Kennedy's assassination or that word assassination came up in a special that Mr Rogers\nI did and the puppet Daniel tiger I had this question for lady ...\nWhich is that the nation me\n[noise]\nHave you heard that word a lot today [noise]\nAnd I didn't know what it meant\nIt means\nSomebody getting killed in a\nSort of surprised way that's what happened you know men killed that other men\nI Know and a lot of people are talking about it right now\nToo many people are talking about it a lot of people are\nSad scared about it you know [noise]\nI'd rather talk about some other day whenever you like [noise]\nSound a courtesy of the Fred Rogers company late ... lady Evelyn goes on to change the subject to a picnic but Daniel tiger says he doesn't feel like a picnic a she says that's okay what do you think Fred Rogers taught\nDaniel tigers says he doesn't feel like a picnic a she says that's okay what do you think Fred Rogers taught kids about how to handle difficult emotions like the ones that I'm sure many are experiencing right now after what we just saw in Pittsburgh\n[noise] well I think one of the things that he taught us all if that it's All right to have these feelings to feel sad and to feel angry and to be afraid that there's nothing wrong with those feelings but that it does help if we can talk to someone so for children the message was that\nA grown ups are there to listen and I think that the message to grown ups were\nIt's listening to the children is very important and letting them tell us what they understand about it and helping them to learn to make sense of what they see and one of the things that Fred often said was that his mother always told him in times of crisis\nOr to look for the helpers and I think certainly in the Pittsburgh area what we saw where all the helpers the the emergency response team the police officers the firefighters the ambulances the doctors the nurses everyone\nUm have surrounded this community with caring and that's one of the things I think we can help children recognize and identify with that they identify with\nThe helpers and not those who who uh cause destruction\nI've seen a line a lot on Twitter in the last couple of days looked for the helpers yes\nAs part of that same special that aired in Nineteen sixty eight Fred Rogers actually address parent's directly about violence locals and\nI've been terribly concerned\nAbout the graphic display of violence\nWhich the ...\nI've been terribly concerned\nAbout the graphic display of violence\nWhich the mass media has been showing recently\nI played for your protection\nOf your young children\nThere is just so much\nA very young child can take\nWith out of being overwhelming\n[noise] what do you think for Rogers would be telling parents um right now to do with their kids\nWell I I think one of the things that it probably is helpful is for all of that is to find time and space to be together away from media where we can talk\nAnd share um are comforting of each other so I think that's an important thing but I also think one of the messages that Fred Rogers gave was that we have to figure out how to make it less attractive [laughter]\nI think that um dwelling on on the violence of course undermines that message so looking for the helpers help to see the good that is still around us\nFred Rogers said that we have one life to live on this earth and we can spend that time encouraging people to demean this life and be hateful or we can spend that time creating a encouragement and spaces where children ... and others can use this life\nI'm In very meaningful and creative way\nWere British ... what do you think Fred Rogers new new Fred Rogers before he died in two thousand three what do you think that you would think of what happened in his neighborhood over the weekend\nWell I think he would be horrified\nIn two thousand three what do you think that you would think of what happened in his neighborhood over the weekend\nWell I think he would be horrified by what happened and and he would he would be concerned about the children she would be concerned that they may be afraid and they may be angry and they may see these reactions in the adults\nAnd so it's important for us to help children learn that the feelings on normal and manageable but find ways to talk about it and find ways to express anger and find ways to express sadness I'm In ways that are not harmful to other people um\nAnd I you know I think that that comforting neighborhoods um I think he would also say we need to turn to our neighbors and neighbor in the greater sense of the world and everyone who lives on this planet is a neighbor\nUm and reach out and and to provide support to our neighbors to people of all backgrounds from all faiths of all races I'm so that we can live together on this earth and very productive ways", "year": "2018",
