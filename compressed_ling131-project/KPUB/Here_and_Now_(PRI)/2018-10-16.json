and when you left the White House or did you have any idea that you would become more part of the public conversation\nNot at all it's it's just something that as the days and weeks and months went by and twenty Seventeen\nIt became apparent that I had a voice\nWhere uh I and I needed to use it in a way just to demonstrate what is happening is not normal and I thought I was able to do that on Instagram using my photographs and commentary and how did it start\nIt started somewhat accidental I had seen a picture of the new Oval Office like on January twenty first there twenty second and it was ... you know golden ornate and I thought it looked like a Saudi palace more than\nThe oval office so I posted a picture of a President Obama with the the red curtains behind him and I wrote a caption that just said something like\nKind of like the old curtains better\nGraham using my photographs and commentary and how did it start\nIt started somewhat accidental I had seen a picture of the new Oval Office like on January twenty first there twenty second and it was ... you know golden ornate and I thought it looked like a Saudi palace more than\nThe oval office so I posted a picture of a President Obama with the the red curtains behind him and I are wrote a caption that just said something like\nKind of like the old curtains better [laughter] and I guess it was a double meaning in my mind but I didn't know how people would react whether they would get it and in that very first post someone a said that I was throwing shade on the new\nOr the new president you didn't even know what that term it I didn't even know what that term in after you know I started a post them more and then I heard the term shade again and I and I figured I better look it up\nYou also posted when when President Trump made a lot of news talking about how his inauguration crowd was the biggest in history and a lot of people showed photographs to prove that that was not the case you posted on January twenty first twenty Seventeen the biggest crowd in history was really an January twenty two thousand nine\nHuge in all caps with a picture of the national mall with a lot of people on it I mean a kind of picture says it All right right in that case maybe more than any other that that that the picture was what prove what was true yes\nDo you get any negative feedback on your Instagram feed\nA a little bit very very few though I mean if you go through the commentary there's a very rarely is there\nA negative feedback and and what's interesting to me is if I'm if there is uh my uh it's kind of followers or have\nHuge in all caps with a picture of the national mall with a lot of people on it I mean a kind of picture says it All right right in that case maybe more than any other that that that the picture was what prove what was true yes do you get any negative feedback on your Instagram feed\nA a little bit very very few though I mean if you go through the commentary there's very rarely is there\nA negative feedback and and what's interesting to me is if I'm if there is uh my uh it's a grand followers are have my back and they they end up coming back to the sea and they often point out to me\nAre people that that they feel or just bought maybe I don't know if they're rushing bots but people trying to stir up trouble not really interested in my Instagram feed just and saying what they want to say\nA in this book or you've got a often either Trump tweets a alongside your Instagram post or a news story alongside your Instagram post there's one\nI'm looking at right here a President Trump said on may six twenty Seventeen the reason I'm staying in Bedminster New Jersey a beautiful community is that staying in New York City is much more expensive and

it makes no sense to me so that was sort of just a you know tongue in cheek right hook poke I guess\nThe one that you're most proud of that you like I Can't believe I thought of that [laughter]\nIn

[laughter] I after I correct myself up sometimes when I when I come up with just the right picture in the right comment I guess\nYou know a Trump is always saying you know it's a witch hunt and it's a witch hunt I don't know how many times he's he's written that an exclamation points and all caps a ... in regards to the FBI and investigation um [laughter]\nAnd I and I found a a picture of a a a young girl dressed as a which had a at a Halloween party\nAnd I just I think I wrote um you know another kind of which I I have to admit that I correct myself up [laughter]\nThere's another one uh where you've got a picture of President Obama giving the state of the union on the same theme of a President Trump saying that the more people that have been operation and he said forty five point six million people watched the state of the union his state of the union the highest number in history Fox News ... every other networking you Instagram\nForty eight million people watched the twenty tends to the union address on television just saying\nYeah and that was one where I ... it didn't sound right when I saw his tweet and so I had to kind of look it up [laughter] uh and and and and verified it with a two or three sources that in fact President Obama's was a two thousand ten state of the union\nGiving the state of the union on the same theme of a President Trump saying that the more people as an aggression and he said forty five point six million people watched the state of the union his state of the union the highest number in history\nFox News ... every other networking you Instagram forty eight million people watched the twenty tends to union address on television just saying\nYeah and that was one where I ... it didn't sound right when I saw his tweet and so I had to kind of look it up [laughter] uh and and and and verified it with two or three sources that in fact President Obama's was a two thousand ten state of the union was the largest and in history\nSeems like there's another theme in here which is that President Trump has gotten into a lot of high profile fights with world leaders and when that happened you show a photo of President Obama very happy with these other world leaders having a nice conversation with them\nA yeah I mean that's been pretty easy to [laughter] but especially you know you mentioned uh another one that I really liked it I cried myself up over it was\nWhen he started I'm tweeting about Kim Jong ... and ... and calling him little rocket man and rocket man and you know my button is bigger than your button all this kind of stuff [laughter] and I posted a picture of President Obama with a gun right and I said there's only one rocket man\n[laughter] what is President Obama think of what you're doing\nUm you know he didn't know I was doing a book because I didn't want people to think that I you know I was doing this in\nA coup boots with him or that he was going to have any input I just saw him a week or so ago and now that the book is actually printed um I told them that I was doing this book and you just you know he he didn't say that much about it\nOr at least that you can repeat to me on the air\nThere's only one rocket man [laughter] what is President Obama think of what you're doing\nUm you know he didn't know I was doing a book because I didn't want people to think that I you know I was doing this in a

he didn't say that much about it [laughter]\nOr at least that you can repeat to me on the air\nOr no he he really didn't say that much about it I think he knows what I'm up to\nDo you have ownership of all the photos that you took when you were in the White House or do you have to clear these by somebody else before you post amongst around\nNo these are all a pictures that were previously made public honoring the administration so they are considered public domain so anybody can use them there was another guy that has a\nHas a book out of all Obama pictures and they're all mine and but he's allowed to do that so\nSo what do you want to do next who do you want to photograph next or do you want to have a job like you had when you were taking pictures every day of President Obama or do you would you want to do something else [noise]\nNo I Want to do something else that's sort of the theme of maybe my next project is trying to figure that out a search for what kind of photography do I want to do but I definitely want to do\nNew photography and I want to move away from 'em at least us politics for sure how come\nI don't think that I'll ever have the kind of situation that I had with

by race this year the little red schoolhouse or progressive private school in Manhattan decided to end an experiment of grouping all seventh and eighth grade students of color together in home room\nAfter the parents of the minority students objected he'll Casson is director of the little red schoolhouse Philip first what was your thinking and trying this\nAh we know that there are ways in which being a student of color in a predominantly white school is a challenge and if there are ways where we could create a larger group of students of color within a a classroom where there were white students and students of color that that would be supportive of them and that ultimately it might help with their academic achievement\nWill you said that are part of this was based on you know research this wasn't at a temp to isolate these minority students it was an attempt to give them what some feeling of almost ...\n[noise] I don't know about special in his foot um our white students are comfortable in their classrooms looking around and seeing themselves in the schools teachers\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school or that felt supportive of their academic experience\nWell you refer to this and the schools handbook which says research points to the academic an emotional benefits to being in a classroom with others who share racial ethnic linguists\nWhite students are comfortable in their classrooms looking around and seeing themselves in the schools teachers\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school or that felt supportive of their academic experience\nWill you referred to this in the schools handbook which says research points to the academic an emotional benefits to being in a classroom with others who share racial ethnic linguistic and cultural identity what what's that research\nThere there's research and this is a working with um some of my colleagues at the school that shows that\nUm those students who feel that there is some sort of stereotype threat I'm so there are some assumptions being made about them based on their identity and then as they are getting older and their their sense of self their racial identity is developing\nThat being part of a larger group having colleagues um is supportive of their development of their academic success\nThat's hard to argue but why not do it in the way many colleges do and have an African American club or an African American society or you know something like that that they could go to\nSo we have affinity groups um for students and for parents to things about that one you have um students who have to choose between going to an affinity group that matches their identity or some other activity with a broader group of friends and it puts them in a tough spot and that's really hard for school age kids\nAnd I think that we shouldn't minimize the impact and the energy that it takes\nFor a let's say an African American students who is one of a few African American students in his or her class\nTo feel fully a part of that\nThey could go to so we have affinity groups um for students and for parents to things about that one you have um students who have to choose between going to an affinity group that matches their identity or some other activity with a broader group of friends and it puts them in a tough spot and that's really hard for school age kids\nAnd I think that we shouldn't minimize the impact and the energy that it takes\nFor a let's say an African American students who is one of the few African American students in his or her class\nTo feel fully a part of that group and they're devoting a lot of energy to being fully there as opposed to just focusing on the academic or intellectual experienced or having\nLook research also suggests that when teachers and students have different cultural experience and let's say the teachers are white and the students are black\nThen they have different schooling experiences and that affects the minority students negatively it at home all the place where it's it's much uh you know there's much lighter exchange between the teacher in the student isn't that a place for each to learn from each other\n[noise] so it is and some ways what you're talking about is the real tension for us right there are benefits to a diverse conversation and they're also benefits to these affinity experiences and our job as an institution is to find ways to me both those in even though there I'm sort of at a conflict with each other from time to time\nYeah this is an unheard of in twenty love in a public school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania this is a high school\nHad its junior classified itself for several minutes everyday along racial or gender or language lines probably the same reasoning that you were giving for people to feel a sense of not being other you know being with\nBut you know any time there's a grouping of minorities in particular it just feels like segregation literally\nAnd is is ludicrous\nYou know we should say the little red schoolhouse founded in Nineteen Twenty one always seen as a progressive school [noise] so what happens now a huge drop the homeroom experiment so how do you move forward\nWe will be doing what we have done and quite frankly what a what a lot of independent schools do which is to have race be one of the\nComponents of the students identity that we think about when we're putting class placement together and we've entered into a community conversation with faculty and parents and students alumni\nTo continue to look for the best way to meet the needs of all of our students students of color included so that we can have all of
