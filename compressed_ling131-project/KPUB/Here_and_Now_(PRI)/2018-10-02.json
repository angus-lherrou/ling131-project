born in the war\nAnd then we grew up in the fifties which was a time in England weather was rationing of everything a betcha she she'll go beef so there's very great shortages London was filled with bombs science everything was blitzed and horrible what\nWas interesting is that that generation mess they matured became teenagers invented everything rock and roll photographers became wonderful photographer you there was ... because there was nobody else that\nYou know they they don't have been in the army or just coming home so that wasn't anybody ahead of us so in a way that was a

Smith who a Ford says was there a includes drinking and it is on a weekday which Kavanaugh sort of tried to downplay the extent to which are his friends got together for beers on weekdays there all these ways in which\nAh that event reinforces even if that wasn't the day on which\nAn incident had occurred it reinforces that such things did happen over the course of that summer\nFight is that there's a lot of gray area around a lot of this\nBut yes that July first gathering specifically includes mark judge to whom I just referred a guy named PJ ... Smith who a Ford says was there a it includes drinking and it is on a weekday which Kavanaugh sort of tried to downplay the extent to which a he has friends got together for beers on weekdays\nThere all these ways in which a that event reinforces even if that wasn't the day on which\nAn incident had occurred it reinforces that such things did happen over the course of that summer\nWhich is something the cat and I went to great pains to deny\nKevin as your book has also become the focus of scrutiny this is Senator Sheldon Whitehouse reading from Kevin as your book entry have you I don't know if it's ... or ... how do you pronounce that our first of flatulence sixteen okay [noise]\nAnd so when your friend mark judge said the same put the same thing as your book page back to you at the same meaning it was flatulence\nI don't know what he did but that's my recollection and we want to talk about flatulence ... age sixteen hundred year book page on 'em game\n... ... ... ... that's not what proved means\nWell it's sort of unclear what booth means in that context right I mean I I I'm not really a booth truth or if you will on this particular subject I mean there's you know in high school you have little terms that you use with your friends and and they can very pretty wisely\nBut it seems pretty clear that the broader effort the Kavanaugh was undertaking there was two each time there was a pretty obvious that a reference to drinking\nThose maintenance of your book he tried to redirect away from the fact that they were talking about drinking heavily you know he he said that the beach week Ralph club which is pretty obviously right they reference to him drinking Latin and vomiting was a function of him having a weak stomach so whatever the definition of booth is ... however\nI mean there's you know in high school you have little terms that you use with your friends and and they can very pretty widely\nBut it seems pretty clear that the broader effort the Kavanaugh was undertaking there was two each time there was a pretty obvious a reference to drinking\nThat was made in your book he tried to redirect away from the fact that they were talking about drinking heavily you know he he said that the beach week Ralph club which is pretty obviously right a reference to him drinking Latin and vomiting was a function of him having a weak stomach so whatever the definition of booth is ... however it relates to drinking\nThe fact is that the euro country makes very clear the drinking was a big part of his high school experience\nWell and just by the way I mean of course it's crowd source but the Urban Dictionary says the move to reverse the anal sex or this is Sheldon Whitehouse later talking with Kavanaugh about another term and is your book devil's triangle here is devil's triangle\n\nDrinking game as it played three glasses and a triangle\nAnd\nYour plate quarters you know okay it's a quarter skiing\nWhat about that one and again I'm going to refer to Urban Dictionary uh and it says now because of what's happened in the last few days that ah the devil's triangle is made up game of quarters with three cups arranging the triangle the rules are unknown because the inventor of the game Brett Kavanaugh could not explain them under oath\n[laughter] right so uh this is again this this is a bit of flying it's not really clear what the intended usage was at the time they are all sorts of a sudden ... about it but one thing that I Will notice I went back and I looked at Google has the tools allows you to search\nA books that they have indexed I went back and look to contemporaneous news reports you know news ... likes to talk about flying high schoolers are using I saw no indication of either booth or devil's triangle that the way in which Kavanaugh alleges they were used\n... I went back and look to contemporaneous news reports you know news ... likes to talk about flying high schoolers are using I saw no indication of either booth or devil's triangle that the way in which Kavanaugh alleges they were used were actually contemporaneous uses of those terms\nSo we're we're we're diving pretty deep into\n... in an area that sort of hard to evaluate a objectively and categorically a but it seems pretty clear that no one besides Brett Kavanaugh says the devil's triangle is the thing that he said it was which is sort of ironic given that the whole thing is meant to reviewed an allegation that he says only one person had me\nI Want to play one more clip from the hearing this is senator Amy club which are pressing cabinet and his assertion that he never had memory lapses resulting from drinking\nOr you're saying there's never been a case where you drank so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before are part of what happened if\nYou're asking about yeah blackout I don't know if you\nCould you answer that question judge it just so you that's not happening is that your answer\nYeah and I'm curious if you have I have no drinking in order to why okay thank you so Chad\n... who's a former classmate of Kevin ... says Kavanaugh has not told the truth about his drinking at Yale or is it plausible for him to tell senator club which are that he's never had memory loss from drinking a ...\nI I mean it is it plausible I suppose theoretically it's plausible but we have a lot of contemporaneous evidence from people that knew him at the time who said he drank a lot too when he drank they're oftentimes in which he appeared to be incapacitated\nA and there are lots of suggestions or from people who knew him then that it is hard to believe that he never would have been blackout drunk given how much he drunk and I'll heavily drank and of course this is the central central point if it was the case that he with some regularity and high school\nThere were often times in which he appeared to being a past hated\nAh and there are lots of suggestions ah from people who knew him then that it is hard to believe that he never would have been blackout drunk given how much he drunk and I'll heavily drank and of course this is the central central point\nIf it was the case that he with some regularity and high school I got drunk to the point that he can't remember his actions that may influence the story that he says which is that he doesn't\nHe never I I did what Ford alleges it's quite possible he doesn't remember what doing what for legit so it's very important for him to establish that he never got blackout drunk because if he can establish that then that bolsters his defense of this event never happens well\nAnd also you know this is a person who wants to be a a justice on the Supreme Court and\nThere are big questions here about whether he was telling the truth under oath to these senators this is a Jeff Flake the senator the Republican senator from Arizona and Chris Coons a Democrat on sixty minutes over the weekend a talking with Scott Kelly of CBS\nIf judge Kavanaugh is shown to have lied to the committee nominations over", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "02"}
