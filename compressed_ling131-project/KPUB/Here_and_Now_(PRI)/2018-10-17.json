and Trump ... saying that the press was unfair to them to him and would treat him or to literally by merely covering\nOr what he said we would get into lively discussions about this and I said well that's the press his job candidate says something and the press is supposed to report it and they said no no you really making too much of a hall of blew out of you know the Access Hollywood tape and we know what he meant that kind of thing and so it was a way of\nApologizing for him and trying to make his rhetoric a understandable [noise] what\nAbout religion this is a place that is very Catholic um and it's also a place that used to be big in the coal industry that that's gone away but how much does religion play into how people view President Trump\nIt's still predominantly Catholic not majority so there's a rising evangelical population\nTrump's um evangelical vote was off the charts he carried a eighty percent of the evangelical vote so I I talked to I'm a woman for whom Trump was

is a place where there's not a lot of opportunity there also a lot of drug overdoses going on I mean this is ... you could go there and just do a book about the opioid crisis in this area\nThe opioid crisis is really bad they're really bad and it's affecting the entire county\nEven if you don't have someone in your family who is a an addict I'm the ripple effect is a widespread and or the county

there's not a lot of opportunity beyond maintenance and uh working in warehouses a minimum wage jobs\nAnd do they think that things have gotten any better under Trump\nMaybe at the margins the unemployment rate has gone down in the county as it has a nationally and perhaps it's a little bit better there but a lot you know a lot of the economic promises that Trump made during the campaign\nHe hasn't really followed through on you know he said he would repeal and replace Obamacare\nOr the individual mandate has been repealed but he's been really uh sabotaging Obamacare and there is no neither Trump or the Republican Party have come up with an alternative plan\nHe said that he would reduce the deficit by in his first eight years\nAgo not the budget he filed in February or a shows a seven trillion dollar increase so you know the Republican Party doesn't seem to care\n... ... what about these voters do they care about those things they don't hasn't been able to do
