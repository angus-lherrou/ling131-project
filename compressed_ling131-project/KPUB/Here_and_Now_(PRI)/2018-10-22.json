provoked worldwide reaction including from first lady Michelle Obama who had this to say the following month\nLike millions of people across the globe my husband and I are outraged and heartbroken

released in October twenty sixteen and in May of twenty Seventeen eighty two more were released\nTheir stories told in the new HBO documentary stolen daughters kidnapped by Boko Haram it airs on HBO tonight and joining us now is writer producer Karen Edwards welcome\nHigh and producer ... with us as Well hi Sasha ... he said the girls that we first meet in your ...\nEdwards welcome high and producer Sasha Achilles with us as Well hi Sasha ... so the girls that we first meet in your documentary are the ones who were released by Boko Haram and living in a compound apart from their families\nAnd their captivity was the one thing the government didn't want you to ask about wasn't it\nYeah it was a part of the condition of the access we always see secure the access with the government's consent is the only way to do it\nBut they were adamant that we shouldn't speak to the bells about what happened to them during the three is that they were held by Boko Haram why am partly a\nI mean they was you know the government's his cane that they control the narrative but also we the girls were released in may we started filming with them in that governments safe house in early July\nSo it was they had only been out of captivity [noise] for about six weeks\nSo it was quite well they um with still processing what had happened to them\nSo that was part of it it wasn't for us we're not counselors to push them into reliving and telling his what had happened that we tried to give them the ... in the space to if they wish to\nBut he couldn't be any time we were alone with the girls the government minders and security shut them down quite quickly so it's twofold I think the government also I wanted to manage how\nThe rest of the world on Nigeria see the ... time in captivity because they were held a three is the full ... down and they were released\nWell what do we know about their time in captivity what would what it was like\nThey they um they was free to speak to his they did give us that diaries discreetly it and they kind of\nWell they they um low they was free to speak to his they did give us the diaries discreetly ... and they kind of make it clear that life wasn't goods that they were forced to marry if not they would have the\nWhat they called us and the full Boko Haram treatment ... uh and in the film when we do is the uh the girls that you book goes who have taken was actually just the tip of the iceberg there were thousands of girls in Nigeria have taken by Boko Haram\nWho are free to speak and they do tell us\nWalked the Boko Haram treatment is so through the testimony we get a sense of what happened to the to the book goes as well\nSo such a let me bring you in because uh you know the idea that they were forced to marry there's one girl in your film who was married had a kid ah with\nSomebody from Boko Haram and it's sort of difficult to tell the emotions that she's dealing with with this kid she's I still love love my son he's he's my baby but he's even though he's a Boko Haram baby\nYeah say what we were told by a a lot of the goals that we interviewed who and all and the film is that you kind of had two options in the forest either you marry a soldier for you become a slave\nAnd if you're a slave then you know life is not taught us or it's a question of kind of survival and in a way even if you end up marrying a soldier or the golf felt like they you know we're rights\nAnd and we're supposed to be that why it say she as she says I was two months pregnant when I ran away and when we first met had like she\nShe did tell us I don't love\nHi when I ran away and when we first met ... like she she did tell us I don't love my baby as much as I Love the two little boys my baby of reminds me of what happened to me\nNow you mentioned the boys we we we see these two boys in the film who actually were kidnapped as well er and ended up being made into child soldiers\nYeah say one of the untold stories is the number of boys and men who have disappeared who have either been kidnapped or killed during this will\nSay well ... has been conducting children but also older men and uh some of them are forced to pick up arms and fights\nAnd then when the military engaged with ... and they tried to take back territory they will kill and harassed or people who look like soldiers and so a lot of men have been killed in this fight in the process of trying to eradicate Boko Haram\nIt's kind of amazing watching\nHow terrible the situation is and and as you report so many people have not been cannot but they've just flooded their towns out of fear of book around they're living in these tent camps um that this isn't getting more attention globally\nYeah it is functioning I think all the focus has been on Syria and yet the famine in the north east of Nigeria\nIs just terrible it's a very widespread and high level and they all will running two towns and these they call them id Pete comes a intently displaced people\nAnd that's why they have to run to his Boko Haram you know they don't just could not then button and destroyed villages and it's just not safe to live up there anymore even though places like my degree which is kind of a one of the the main town\nThen the and destroyed villages and it's just not safe to live up there anymore even though places like my degree which is kind of a one of the the main pounds is incredibly dangerous producer safety by numbers on that whether the food aid is going to see how if you want food and you want to live that's why you have to them\nAnd their their outcomes but then a lot of the uh loves internally displaced people end up living within the community so\nDespite the fact that the ... there is some fair towards people who have escaped Boko Haram but they will have been incredibly welcoming to the number of displaced people who have come tomato Goree\nWell let's talk about that the the people who have managed to escape from captivity by Boko Haram they tried to go back into society and everybody thinks that they're somebody that they should be suspicious of\nYeah I mean I'm made a gory is in a kind of normal front line will would say in it that it's it's controlled its miniaturize control the Nigerian military and\nTheir constant infiltration of suicide bombers to come into the city so when we with that like the second to last night that happened to be the end of Ramadan\nThat was sick suicide attacks in one night and you just never know\nWho to trust because Boko Haram uses young mostly young women as suicide bombers they stopped them up and send them you know towards checkpoints where they manage to make it into bits of the city\nAnd say there is a lot of fear because unlike a kind of normal front line ... ... you just don't know why this right it's coming from and where and when I said there's a lot of mistrust\nWhat about the girls who are now out of captivity and looking to the future and and try to have a hopeful future or the government\nThose who are now out of captivity and looking to the future and and trying to have a hopeful future or the government is making it possible for some to attend college including a some who managed to escape let's listen to one of them from your film\nI Know him when he doesn't eat everything has changed my life [noise] now out of the nation I mean ... even though right ... [noise]\nDo you see a bright future for some of these girls yes\nI think ah for the ... girls who are are in a un if the American university that you're not the American University in Nigeria which is well older but girls who were released a negotiated full and uh the escaped goes who on the nights that uh\n...

the networks new experiment in advertising Fox replaced most of the three to four minute commercial breaks in prime time with nine sixty second breaks in a pair\nFox replaced most of the three to four minute commercial breaks in prime time with nine sixty second breaks in a pair of five and a half minute blocks of branded content here's a promo for a block of branded content that ran after Family Guy ...\nMore on Fox has only ... what do we fought for skin they listen to ... take on prime time with a five minute we can't we can't say whether they live for Sunday Sunday edition sponsored by Google ...\nHearing now media analyst John Carroll joins us now John that we just heard there that ad sounds like pretty much any commercial that I Would hear on TV so what what's going on with ranking behind us\nRight that's an ad for an ad basically it's promo for a block of brand the content of the overall thinking here Fox believes in many people do that audiences are allergic to advertising so they're trying to do two things they're trying to reduce the number of traditional spots\nAnd they're also trying to reform at some of the advertising into branded content which is marketing package as entertainment or new ...\nRight let's take this first change Fox is calling it the night and he's nine second sixty seconds ... nine sixty second breaks jazz pods jackpots what's that mean\nThe jazz is just a and Z which means traditionally the first and last commercials in a regular commercial pilot so what they're doing is they're basically putting these in sixty second units which are actually eighty second you're does have got a promo in there but they've got a countdown clock to make it a to ease the pain of watching it\nIs that also the goal of this branded content because people don't like watching the ads that they're trying to ease the pain\nRight so brand new concept is really adds in sheep's clothing so last night for instance after Bob's Burgers there was a six minute block of brand that content there were these spooky vignettes sponsored by Skittles and M. and m's and uh and other Mars candy ... brands and and basically it's just\nThe spooky vignettes sponsored by Skittles and M. and m's and ah and other Mars candy ... brands and and basically it's due to a website with more of that kind of content\nIt's OK Fox says the new format reduces commercial time in primetime by fifty percent but then when you start to add in that brand new content that you just talked about over all the marketing starts to float back up again so what's what's the financial model for this sort of\nFinancial model is to charge more for the jazz pod so they could be double or triple the standard rate for a Sunday night at a they're hoping that that will make up for the reduction in in volume advertisers like this they're not sure yet they have they they believe that having fewer ads on the air\nIs worth something they're not sure how much it's worth\nSo this is still pretty tentative right now\nOkay so traditional TV spots might be decreasing on Fox but advertising is not going away as if we ever really thought it would\nRise right as they say the sports broadcast you can't stop advertising you can only hope to contain it's All right\nJohn Carroll here and now media analyst thanks very much I get so is Fox re thinks the future of advertising Americans are also rethinking their relationship with the automobile ride sharing and now car sharing have disrupted the taxi and rental car industries\nThey're also pushing some people to reconsider car ownership altogether and that is the goal of our next guest Sam ... is founder and CEO of a company called get around it allows you to rent your own personal car to other drivers\nAnd he joins us now from San Francisco for our latest installment of view from the top conversations with business leaders\nSam your company wants to build up a rental market for under utilized cars and that's because for most of us are cars just sit unused for most of the day in a parking lot\nWell I mean if you look at the dynamic for example here in the United states we have ...\nCars just sit unused for most of the day in a parking lot\nYeah well I mean if you look at the dynamic for example here in the United states we have almost two hundred fifty million passenger vehicles and they sit around for pretty much twenty four hours a day\nAnd so get around really allows us to address this problem of car overpopulation by using the cars we already own so instead of buying a car you can rent one from someone living nearby\nSo what's your goal I mean do you hope that someday there will that old cars will be shared\nYeah we fundamentally believe that that has to happen needs to happen and that you know where we are today with personal car ownership that the entire ecosystem needs to be disrupted and and that will move to a world where personal private ownership is actually no longer the majority but the minority and that every car will be assured car\nOkay so let's talk about this specific how get around works are right now it's available and what Seventy cities around the country correct you get an app you see what cars are around you and then what\nYes so you ... you can look at the cars around you you can find that when you like to rent for anywhere from an hour or two you know multiple days you pick that car we run a real quick check instantly to make sure that you know your driver's license is valid and then instantly you have a car you locate it from the phone\nOn lock the doors and Dr ... and you can rent some pretty nice cars by the way yes you can you know you can get anything from a previous to attest led to a Porsche people share all sorts of course\nWell let's talk about the competition because there is a lot of it there's ... ah which has one point seven million monthly active users car to go as something like eight hundred thousand there's your company and then there's the old man of the group Zipcar which has been around probably the longest do you think the markets too crowded\nNo we think this is a mass of opportunity to disrupting a trillion dollar market which has car ownership and so the main competitor here is people buying cars the more you can shift people away from ownership towards acts\nDollar market which has car ownership and so the main competitor here is people buying cars the more you can shift people away from ownership towards access the more this market grows for all players\n... well some of your competitors might also be something like ... or lift um Cox Automotive recently did a survey that said\nThat those companies sought customer's increase by Seventy seven percent since two thousand and Fifteen but car sharing only increased by Seventeen percent what do you what do you think about that I mean are people really that eager to rent their car from a stranger when they could just jumping to lift\nYeah so I don't know the methodology on the Koch study um I I certainly know what we've seen in and it's been much much higher than Seventeen percent increase in businesses twenty Fifteen\nSo you know I think that the way we think about that and what we hear from our customers\nIs that people are looking at moving away from ownership but they can't rely purely on ride sharing um they can't rely on car sharing they need a combination of you know public transit car sharing and Roger to really allow them to live car free in fact we have a very public partnership with over a where they've heard the same thing from their user base and so\nThat's why we came together as two companies to offer a more complete set of solutions to the marketplace so you believe people really do want to live without a car I think if you offered them mobility an equivalent level as you get today from ownership does absolutely true yeah\nThis summer you got a big injection of cash three hundred million dollars from softbank the Japanese from what's your plan for that money\nIt's pretty straightforward I mean we plan to continue doubling down on expanding into new cities are both the United states and her nationally and then you know we've been very fortunate to partner or some some great companies like to over so it was continue investing was partnerships and expanding our roster partners\nWell speaking of labor and Toyota I mean these are companies also that are looking into self driving cars right so what kind of opportunity do you have if cars are driving themselves is a great question and something\nThat are looking into self driving cars right so what kind of opportunity do you have if cars are driving themselves\nIs a great question and it's something that we've since day one than sort of very aware of in fact that I taught him was cars that drove us to the idea of getting around which is if\nYou're going to drive itself would you really park at twenty two or twenty three hours a day you'd probably the other people use it and this maybe you'd start with friends and family are colleagues but eventually strangers just makes sense\nSo we really see the rise of autonomy as it begins to become a more prevalent as something that makes our marketplace more fluid allows those cars to be used by more people different use cases and in fact as autonomy comes around it actually opens a lot more opportunity as to what can be done\nThrough a you know a marketplace get around or checking people or owners of vehicles with um you know companies and individuals that need access to them\nI'm just thinking how that would work let's go Fifteen twenty fifty years down the road a ton of vehicles are here and they're here to stay [noise] would I just call a vehicle from somebody's parking space that isn't being used to have it come to me then drop it off and then they would go somewhere else\nYeah I think you can imagine that but I mean in the world were for fifty years out and autonomy as sort of a mainstream technology I think you think you're actually in a world where", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Flagstaff", "day":
