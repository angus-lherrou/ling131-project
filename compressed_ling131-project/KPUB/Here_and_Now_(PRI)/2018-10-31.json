is the only state that has this kind of commission which bundles together a number of issues into one yes or no question Danny Rivero of W ELL RN explains\nIf you live in Florida on election day you'll get the option to ban offshore drilling and also been vaping in the workplace\nOr you can vote to change the state college system and also give more deaths benefits to the families of first responders and members of the military these two items on the November ballot or the product of the Florida Constitution revision commission\nAnd the voter has to make a terrible choice\nEllen freedom was on the rivers and commission Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight\nDo I vote for the thing I don't like in order to get the thing I Do like and that's just not fair and not acceptable\nI think that what the constitution and vision commission did is it packed things that they thought would be popular along with things that they really wanted but thought wouldn't be popular\nIs it packed things that they thought would be popular along with things that they really wanted but so I wouldn't be popular\nThat's held Broward county's top administrator Bertha Henry sees it to particularly on a question that would do three things at once mandate a State Department of veteran affairs mandate estate anti terrorism office and something Henry is not happy with force every county to have five elected government officials including sheriff in supervisor of elections\nThe amendment that's on the agenda it's sandwiched in between motherhood and apple pie\nThe commission has been putting seemingly unrelated questions together on the ballot since it was first formed in Nineteen Seventy eight but the way freedom and some legal experts at this time is different\nTwenty years ago the decision about who would be on the commission came from a mix of Democrats and Republicans that men in almost even split between the two parties says Ellen Frieden\nAnything that got passed through that constitution revision commission had to be seriously debated compromises had to be made and it had to be something that was agreeable on a bipartisan level\nBut this year every appointment was made by Republicans are Republican appointed officials and that can make things look political even if they're not Anna Marie cameras was on this year's commission on the committee that helped write the language voters will see she says politics were not play just plain logic\nSo when we first started meeting we all came to the table with ideas of how things might be grouped and everything really had in a somewhat of an access or natural connection\nGame is offers the example of amendment nine which would ban offshore drilling and vaping at work\nIf you look at it from a let's make our environment more friendly and and and protect our state and protect our citizens I think that you can kind of see why they would have fit together I Can't say that\nLet's make our environment more friendly and and and protect our state and protect our citizens I think that you can kind of see why they would have fit together I Can't say that personally I agreed with all of the group beams and my voting record would speak to that but for the most part I did and I thought that we put things together in a way that just it made sense\n... says there's another reason for grouping amendments in some places ballots are nearly twenty pages long this year so the commission want it to stop voter fatigue just make the shorter and easier for people\nThere's just one rule the commission has to follow according to the floor of the constitution the title and the summary of the amendment need to be clearly understood by voters\nTimothy McClintock is a professor of constitutional law at the University of Florida\nThat it needs to clearly state chief purpose it needs to be comprehensible and so the more you unfold some different disparate subject that can really be a challenge there\nThe Florida Supreme Court already ruled that one bundled amendment was not clear enough for voters there was about charter schools and it didn't use the phrase charter schools so that was removed from the ballot three other amendments were in jeopardy of being tossed off the ballot until this month when the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that they would stay\nJustice Barbara party in the road the questions were improperly bundled and they didn't give voters a clear choice of what they are voting on\nBut the legal filing that was used to make that argument was the improper vehicle Justice Party into had two words for people looking at these questions on the ballot voters be where for here and now I'm Danny Rivero in Miami\nYou're a voter in Florida or another state you may also have ballot measures to weigh in on on election day this year there are a hundred and fifty five statewide ballot measures in thirty seven states sixty four of them are citizen led initiatives there an example of direct democracy letting\nFive statewide ballot measures in thirty seven states sixty four of them are citizen led initiatives there an example of direct democracy letting voters rather than legislatures\nDecide policies and laws joining us now is Josh all take who's the project director for the ballot measures project at ballot PDF Josh welcome\nYeah it's good to be here thank you and how does the number of statewide ballot initiatives this year compared to other\nYears overall the total number of measures has been decreasing over the last decade or so there's been a trend towards fewer and fewer button twenty six twenty Eighteen there's been a resurgence specifically in citizen initiated measures measures they get on the ballot through a senior trip petition signed by registered voters\nAnd in those citizen initiated ballot measures if they get past do they become law or is it something that than just gets referred to the legislature to make a decision about\nThose have gone to the ballot for a final approval from the voters on there a couple of exceptions for example in Nevada there's a measure that has to get approved again and twenty twenty if it passes and twenty Eighteen um but these measures are going to the voters and voters have the last day on them\nSo what kind of issues are we talking about here I see that a lot of them have to do with elections and voting\nYeah that's one of the the biggest trends are seeing in twenty Eighteen or things like redistricting systems are adding commissions are changing the requirements for redistricting\nMarijuana is another topic that's been on the ballot a lot you know in recent years has been a trend and it's sort of continuing this year ... other election policies related measures things like voting requirements voter id campaign finance an ethics is another big issue in North Dakota South Dakota Missouri\nHow difficult is it to get some of these initiatives onto the ballot\nThat process varies by state the number of signatures required is usually based on a percentage of voter turnout either for the president for um the governor for me to secretary of state and the total number\nBased on a percentage of voter turnout either for the president for um the governor for me to secretary of state and the total number varies from a little over Thirteen thousand in a small state like North Dakota to over half a million in California this year the costs on average was a million dollars a little over a million dollars and twenty eight for these initiatives\nSo does that mean that it is mostly big organizations who get behind these things and get them on the ballot or it could have just be Jane Q voter\nThere are a few sort of really true grassroots volunteer efforts but for the most part if these things are crossing over a million dollars either have to have a rich individual and industry or a special group it a national interest group that's behind you to provide the funding to get these on about\nI can imagine that in some cases state legislators would be happy that something is put to the voters so they don't have to make the call themselves and in other cases they might not be happy because it ties their hands\nYet in general implicit in the initiative process is a conflict between citizens or are registered voters and the legislature the the backers of these initiatives generally use the initiative process as\nA sort of a method of last resort if they're not getting what they want done in the legislature and they see an opportunity that voters might approve a policy that the legislature has either not acted on or has opposed um but there's always some exceptions that prove that rule and there are cases where\nPolitically connected people go to the initiative process and that could be for for a variety of reasons but for the most part the citizen initiative process used when the policies are being approved in the legislature\nSometimes the voters decide on something and then the state uh either dragged its feet or decide that doesn't want to go through with it or in Maine last year sixty percent of voters approved a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid to cover tens of thousands more people but the governor there ... page has blocked implementation and there's an ongoing legal battle over\nIt was approved a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid to cover tens of thousands more people but the governor there ... page has blocked implementation and there's an ongoing legal battle over it or how often does that kind of thing happen\nAs you see the initiative process habits resurgent so as you see more initiatives you see the number of instances where that conflict I was talking about implicit boils to the surface\nThe response to twenty sixty initiatives was in many cases to either repeal or um changed the initiatives if possible and some states allow that some don't or to pass restrictions on the process\nAnd then the sort of a third response we've seen is an effort to compromise and twenty eight team with an issue proponents instead of letting it go to the ballot and letting it be the sort of hard battle trying to find some sort of deal they can make where initial prominence withdraw and the policy still gets at least some sort of advancement if it's not the full effort that the addition opponents want it what\nAnd the next fresh air how the Supreme Court became so politicized\nHow the court looks now with the Trump appointees and the chief justice who's considered the most likely to swing vote we'll talk with David Kaplan author of the most dangerous branch he was the legal affairs editor at Newsweek join us\n\n\nFresh air is coming up at one o'clock

in the twenty sixteen elections or possible collusion with the Trump campaign\nIt's about allegations Mueller's office has referred to the FBI that women were offered money to make fun of sexual misconduct claims about him\nNPR national security editor Phil Ewing joined us\nThat women were offered money to make fun of sexual misconduct claims about him NPR national security editor Phil Ewing joins us now feel this is weird though what do we know so far about this story\nIt's a very weird story it if it's a hoax that appears to be a hoax within a hoax so are there were these allegations that came into inboxes in Washington of reporters including NPR\nFrom someone who calls herself a woman in Florida who had allegedly been offered money to make these false charges against Muller and what may be the cases that woman actually\nDoes not exist and that those false charges were in fact false charges about false charges what isn't clear is whether this was intended to embarrass the special counsel's office or just to embarrass the journalists who had been sent this email as they tried to investigate and report on it\nOr is it possible that these women because I Want to be clear this woman was trying to alert um did they needed was to that she was trying to alert and all his office that someone was trying to take him down\nWe're not aware of any contact but between the women involved here in the special counsel's office that it it's all been done through journalist intermediaries and they've reached out to the special counsel's office to ask about this and when it became aware of those uh outreach attempts then that's what it refers to the FBI and\nWell there are two conservative media personalities capable and jak Berkman who I said to be linked to the story to tell us more about that\nRight wall is the young man who writes for the website gateway pundit Berkman has a show on Newsmax TV which is owned by President Trump's friend and supporter Chris Reddy and what they've said is the special counsel investigation is itself a hoax that it's illegal and that it's unfounded\nAnd they want to expose what they call the crimes or the finality involving the special counsel's office and Miller himself and that is the background for these accusations or a legit accusations this week involving ...\nBeing the special counsel's office and Miller himself and that is the background for these\nAccusations or a legit accusations this week involving putative misconduct by Mahler um they appeared in these emails to news organizations and also on gateway pundit yesterday Tuesday in the form of a so called intelligent ... intelligence report\nThat was linked to a so called a intelligence agency which in its way was kind of a parody of the Steele dossier a which by the way is partly unverified a because no one knows which things in it a true in which things are not\nAnd it became clear to people looking at this on line that this alleged intelligence agency was made up of a series of suspicious linked in pages and the profile pictures of the people who had those pages where people like actors in models not real human beings\nOkay well now my head is officially exploded and we have a lot less than a minute left so I ... is the speculation that these conservative personalities might have been behind paying these willing to say something about Muller and he what ... what is the possibility here\nThere may never have been any women at all and those are payments are those accusations were themselves just a trap\nTo try to get reporters to talk about them or none of that is clear however we do know the special counsel's office has this has asked the FBI to get to the bottom of this and if it does and there are criminal charges or there is some kind of report from the FBI we may learn what the real story was that was taking place\n... in other words if somebody was masking masquerading as a woman saying that there was sexual misconduct allegations about Miller and she was with the money and exact and someone had made that up\nThey would be in trouble NPR national security editor Phil Ewing in Washington we will follow this thank you thank you well know email earlier this month a federal judge in California block the Trump administration's plans to end the temporary protected status TPS for immigrants from Sudan El Salvador Haiti\nIn California block the Trump administration's plans to end a temporary protected status TPS for immigrants from Sudan El Salvador Haiti in Nicaragua\nThat ruling men that an estimated
