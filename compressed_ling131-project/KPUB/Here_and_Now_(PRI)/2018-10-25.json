have a healthy oyster population that scientists will tell you guess while you're going to find out you've got healthy fishy about healthy crowds you got healthy shrimp and so when you see this\nChallenge without wasters guess what you're going to probably find out you got challenges going on with your other parts of your system\nYou're the river keeper you're charged with the keeping of this river just your thoughts about the emotional importance of having a healthy river\nI Would sound very selfish if I was to say I was the only person in love with this river and really get why it is incumbent upon us to protect and take care of it this is the one of a kind of place I could rattle off all the special environmental ecological designations for you\nBut you can just walk around town and talk to people and ask them what the river bay mean to them and you will get you will get many stories of why people love this place in our fiercely protective of it\nAnd they include scientists and researchers say\nWe've retreated to the river keepers office of boats have had to be called off the bat whether Dr Felicia Coleman director of Florida state's coasts and Rene love her\nColleague Dr Sondra brook and Roy ogles recently retired from the state's department of environmental protection join us I start by asking Dr Coleman that question we started with why do we care about this\nI'd say the most spectacular fishery collapses have occurred worldwide on rivers that have had tremendous re diversion of water\nBecause that that water bringing all his nutrients is not coming down into\n... said have had tremendous read diversion of water\nBecause that that water bringing all this nutrients is not coming down into the salad needed water and not coming down anymore such a really important component I think that's overlooked well and talk more about that Dr brook because it's not just that it's encouraging the fish growth\nIt's discouraging the growth of the creatures that might pray on things like always just like the conch which like the saltier water yes\nWhen the balance of salt and fresh changes then different things happen the problem with soldiers that encourages these marine credited such an oyster drills and ...\nAbout these oyster drills that sounds like a horror film duct duct tell us more they latch onto the oysters and they like come out\nThey sit down on an oyster and then all of a sudden they always to his this scrape scrape scrape and eventually they'll scrape through the shelves and tickets for buses in and basically consume the always to from within and there's not a whole lot the always to can do about it it is rather horrific\nYeah check it out on YouTube it's [laughter]\nIt's like a bad movie what else can be done I mean some people wonder why the bay wasn't just shut down so that it could replenish\nStart with the day and\nA an ecosystem because if we don't address the problems with the ecosystem if\nWe're constantly reacting one of the things that happened in the wake of the oil spill was at the fisherman were allowed to go out and harvest all the oysters the fear was that the spill would come in and ... a couple of years later and there was no brood stock left there\nTo re populated I think about the function the set oyster surface is beyond\nThe economics like clean water they also offer refuge for a number of juvenile species that live inside the crevasse\nAnd the economics they clean water but they also offer refuge for a number of juvenile species that live inside the crevices\nThey help protect it from storm surge you can't have this industry without that resource you can't have good sea grass beds without that the oyster race stores you can't have high water quality you've got to restore all those things\nBut you have to do it in a deliberate fashion\nOne of the problems with a day over the last few decades has been\nReaction reaction to the oil spill reaction to a water flow planting coach out there and if that culture is that oil stir shell what they larval oysters settled on\nIt without a plan you might as well be casting it all into the when what\nWould you recommend I mean we haven't even mentioned climate change and the droughts that have been a part of the fresh water coming in from the river drying up ... you say it has to be deliberate what does it have to be\nTheir particular types of research that could be done that could\nRelatively quickly and the next couple of years make some very good decisions about how we restore the bay the fisherman really understand what she needed but they want their livelihood restored so there's a tendency to go for whatever looks like the quickest fix closing the best probably not a terrible idea and I think\nYou would find fishermen that fully support that full Dr ... research and really committed effort instead of throwing short term solutions what about in desalination plant I think\nThere are more problems\nIn the bay unjust salinity you know they had the drought back in two thousand seven and nine and since then we've had decent rainfall but the always just haven't come back so usually when a
