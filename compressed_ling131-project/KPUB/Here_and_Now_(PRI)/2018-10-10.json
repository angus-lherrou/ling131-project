couple of years ago yeah it was just really tough being there I became separated from the county when I got my uh medical retirement\nSo I'm On my own with medical and doing things and we just decided we wanted that kind of a smaller town a safer atmosphere and I'm just quieter call my life\nAnd what do you mean by your on your own with medical\nWell once I separated from the county and like I was

to wait for the county to approve any kind of treatment\nAnd oftentimes they would deny and that's really that's like a punch to the guy that takes a wind out of sales so I Would rather take care of

the victims will help you out do do you feel like you didn't get that help\nAbsolutely that's correct our county was saying we were county family and that you know they'll take care of us were county

came through Flagstaff a couple of weeks ago we had lunch\nGroup and what do you tell people when you go around and talk about shootings\nSo we tell them our experience they want to know what they can do better and there's a few things that they learned each of us\nHad such a different perspective in that room I'm where I was shot one of my best friend she's the one who made one of the first nine one one calls my supervisor who's doing this also he was our our chief of our department and he\nGives his perspective from a supervisor position watching the entire thing but also feeling responsible for everyone in the room so each person sort of has their own niche of\nOf what they experienced and what was running through their mind and\nHow law enforcement and really how they can improve their responses for the victims side I Know quite a few of my co workers all they solved with law enforcement they're boots\nAnd in their mind they thought this was the bad guys coming to shoot them and so you know the law enforcement hadn't really thought about that that just the shoes someone sing issues alone would make people assumed they were bad\nAnd what they experienced and what was running

Scott\nHey Jeremy and with me in the studio at Cape BCC in Pasadena as Mary Plummer whose political correspondent for Cape PCC Hi Mary ... so let's start with the governor's race Jerry Brown is not able to run again because of term limits the race is between his lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom\nA Democrat and Republican businessman John Cox Scott you just moderated the first and possibly only debate this week on ... D let's listen to a little of what Gavin Newsom said first\nThe California Dream is predicated on social mobility\nThe richest and the poorest state we have to mind that gap we have to address the issue of cost of housing we have to address the issue of affordability broadly we have to address the issue of homelessness and we have to tackle\nThe vaccine issue of health care and the issues related to health care that are devouring the state budget and here's Republican John Cox\nA vision of this state being affordable unlivable for people or I think we can do that if we get rid of the special interest influence in Sacramento or the interest groups that have habits Sacramento a benefit from the status quo the status quo isn't working for\nWe have to address the issue of cost of housing we have to address the issue of affordability broadly we have to address the issue of homelessness and we have to tackle the vaccine issue of health care and the issues related to health care that are devouring the state budget and here's Republican John Cox\nI have a vision of this state being affordable unlivable for people or I think we can do that if we get rid of the special interest influence in Sacramento or the interest groups that have habits Sacramento a benefit from the status quo\nThe status quo isn't working for average working California's they can't afford to live here and that's why they're leaving\nSounds like they both agree that California is getting to be an affordable for a lot of people ah Scott knew some has a big lead in the polls is Cox have a chance\nWell it's tough the math is tough for him of the last time a Republican won a statewide race in California two thousand six his name was Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd the Republicans have just seen their share of the electorate shrinking there now literally a third party and California Democrats are about forty four percent of the electorate\nA decline to state independent voters no party preference voters twenty seven percent in the GOP now down to about twenty five percent just a quarter of the electorate so in order for somebody like John Cox when he has to have a lot of appeal to independent voters in some conservative Democrats\nAnd so we just really haven't seen that yet in the polling I mean it's just a tough\nPlace California is for Republicans to win state wide\nIt's new some wins a merry will it be basically like another term for Jerry Brown or different\nKnow I'm kind of her brand has been very aggressive against many of President Trump's policies\nAnd indicated he'd take a similar approach especially on issues like immigration healthcare environmental issues and use them support sanctuary cities for example he backs California to coming at zero carbon emissions state and that there are a couple of years\nSo we just really haven't seen that yet in the polling I mean it's just a tough place California is for Republicans to win state wide\nIt's new some wins a merry will it be basically like another term for Jerry Brown or different\nYou know I'm Governor Brown has been very aggressive against many of President Trump's policies and using indicated he'd pick a similar approach especially on issues like immigration health care environmental issues I knew some support sanctuary cities for example he backs California becoming a zero carbon emissions state\nAnd but there are a couple of areas where he's indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily than brown has\nAnd one of those areas as early childhood and during the recession the funding for programs like infant toddler care and pre school was severely cut and those funds have not been restored under governor Jerry Brown news and has indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily there and we're seeing that issue reflected in TV ads that he's running as well\nWas as you mentioned Jerry Brown has gone up against President Trump the the state has sued the Trump Administration more than a dozen times over everything from environmental issues to immigration President Trump's slam California right back here he is earlier this year at an event touting his plan for a border wall\nYou know I think the governor's doing a terrible job running the state of California and you know they have property in California I Will say I don't think too much about my property anymore but I have great property and go what is the taxes are way way out of whack\nBefore there was such a move British than if you don't have safety meeting if you don't have this kind of wall the drugs are pouring through in California that do it\nScott a there are several congressional races in California that are up for grabs this year how is President Trump playing in the state as voters or prepare to go to the\nNext month well in like a lot of blue states\nPretty California I Will say I don't think too much about my property anymore but I have great property taxes are way way out of whack\nBefore there was such a move pretty soon then if you don't have safety meeting if you don't have this kind of war the drugs are pouring through in California that do it\nScott a there are several congressional races in California that are up for grabs this year how is President Trump playing in the state as voters are prepared to go to the polls next month\nWell in like a lot of blue states Jeremy a Donald Trump is not popular in California I mean Hillary Clinton got more than three million more votes\nThan Donald Trump did and he's still way underwater last statewide poll showed him in about thirty percent approval rating maybe a little higher among likely voters so uh I don't I'm not sure the Republicans who are running the incumbents running for reelection or the challengers or the newcomers running for open seats necessarily want Donald Trump out here\nUh their problem and these really close races is going to be appealing to independent voters and Donald Trump does not do well with them he was not going to be helpful to these Republican candidates are in persuading them to vote for for the Republican and he's congressional races\nAnd Mary ... what are the issues that those independent voters are thinking about this is a state that at like the rest of the country right now has a pretty low unemployment rate if anything the problem is people can't find the workers that they need to fill the jobs it's not like that that that's a major issue but obviously affordability is big well what else\nI Ford ability homelessness here in the LA area we're dealing with a massive a homeless crisis that's an issue that we've seen play out in the governor's race and also in the congressional races\nAnd you know there are just issues and affordability that I think a lot of these new party preference and others at which is what we call the unaffiliated voters here in California I care really deeply about uh let's talk about this\nPretty low unemployment rate if anything the problem is people can't find the workers that they need to fill the jobs it's not like that that that's a major issue but obviously affordability is big well what else\nAffordability homelessness here in the LA area we're dealing with a massive a homeless crisis that's an issue that we've seen play out in the governor's race and also in that congressional races\nAnd you know there are just issues of affordability that I think a lot of these are new party preference voters at which is what we call the unaffiliated voters here in California I care really deeply about\nUh let's talk about the Senate race in California that's going on long time Senator Dianne Feinstein is facing another Democrat because in California the top two vote getters face each other and the general election state senator Kevin daily own is the one facing Feinstein and Feinstein is weathering some criticism for her handling of the Kavanaugh\nHearings she's the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee here she is a during the hearings\nThis isn't a political battle for power as some that said this is a serious undertaking with serious allegations Scott ... ah\nMaybe [laughter] certainly she's been ahead and every poll she won every single county in California during in the June primary uh you know I think\nKevin deli on just hasn't been her challenger the Democrat from LA just hasn't really gotten a lot of traction he doesn't have a lot of money the media aren't paying a lot of attention to this race Feinstein so far has refused to debate to give them sort of a platform to get some attention\nA ... and so it's it's really hard that said you know I haven't seen her above forty four forty six maybe forty seven percent of the polls\nSo uh and and and because there's two Democrats at the top of the ticket a lot of Republicans may skip this race altogether and a vet I'm not sure it's going to help Feinstein because uh those are people who if they had to pick one of these two Democrats they would\nCrowd from LA just hasn't really gotten a lot of traction he doesn't have a lot of money the media aren't paying a lot of attention to this race Feinstein so far has refused to debate to give them sort of a platform to get some attention\nUh and and so it's it's really hard that said you know I haven't seen her above forty four forty six maybe forty seven percent of the polls\nSo uh and and and because there's two Democrats at the top of the ticket a lot of Republicans may skip this race altogether and a vet I'm not sure it's going to help Feinstein because uh those are people who if
