T. Barnum had one had originally started out being exhibited in coffee houses in London as well and I know that there are two in regional museums in the u._k. that was made as a pet\nAs a male and female and that being reunited this year I think in some special expedition\n... and it's not what one would imagine these were all going on because of the way they were actually fake and put together but can you have a description of the one that you write about ... can you read a little bit of that for us so we get a sense of what people were talking at show captain\nEasiest to Congress away and at

[laughter] she's the one that people can't take their eyes off off and as you said it becomes a golf in for you the object to kind of draws the U.S into this story I you know this is your debut fiction but you come to riding\nThrough an academic background and working and museums and a student of archaeology mhm yeah\nThat's right so my undergrad I studied um archaeology and anthropology an art history so I definitely kind of came in from the sun goes looking objects and trying to understand how they could shed light on people's stories will place they taking people's lives\nGive us some examples of that and how you put that in the book I think\nBe among affects ... it'll have subsequently being told in the clues that people especially the women's rights to I really felt that someone like Angelica Neal is quotas on main character of mine\nI studied a lot of Eighteen century dress to kind of torn understand her how she would feel in her clothes this idea that like you might ... the

close in and out you'll stay in and out as he gained weight or lost it and do you give ... says it is I kind of thing like\nIt says something about a possible that values are and how they live and I really felt on delicate\nExpressed herself for hepatitis thing so that was certainly wanted this\nAbout a possible that values are and how they live and I really felt the Angelica expressed his ... things so that was certainly one of the things\nWill you treat objects the way you were taught when you worked in museums and studied art history\nYou were taught not to look at the oil painting directly but look around at what's the frame made of and it sounds like that's how you are approaching you're writing and it feels like this was something that was born when you were a child and there was another you know kind of oddity is it oh let's see how do you pronounce it\nOh yeah see that was my first love they see the of five thousand year old mummified cool that was dug out of a ... in about Nineteen Ninety One I think and they must have made a TV documentary about too when I was quite I Would say between the age of five and seven\nAnd I remember watching and just been completely turned six and drawing pictures of him over and over he was a shepherd up in the mountains\nAnd he had with him everything that he needed to let's say we had like this quiver of ... and he had strolls stuffed into ... to keep its feet woman he'd mended his click himself they could tell he was up there in the mountains for a long time and he had to be very self sufficient until he go to the village and someone else would you know fix this stuff and given the choice\nThat physical understanding of what it might be like to have been ... and and the cost\nTo understand all these tiny details of their life and I guess the summer of it like I said well I'd be interested in what's the texture of living in the world you read about armies and ... and law is being passed but who is your who's bringing in the city to making up the pets\nDo these people miss that children that kind of stuff was while I was always interested in like guess there's no space for that in fiction and the reason say\n... when you do have to be very rigorous and strict with yourself what detective like ... ... that raised in fiction is based\nIn fiction and that raises and say I'll kill you when you do have to be very rigorous and strict with yourself and ... like ... ... that are raised in fiction space to play and to imagine\nWell so this is what happens with an anthropologist takes on fiction because that's how we feel about the characters they have all these details about how they do things how they eat with their tea sets look like and that brings us back to Angelica again a quarter isn't not [laughter]\nYou know she she completed the stains the women in the street she is not that but what you're saying about women as a brothel with many young women who are sort of being instructed to grow up to be Angelica what are you saying about what you discovered in history about women's positions and in this time\nI think the more the Irish such the book and the more I thought about what is the story here I kind of realize that while I was doing was\nIn my mind I guess almost a kind of survey of the options the Eighteenth century women it's very much a world without feminism what if women tried to do well by themselves it might be at the expense of other women that there is very little sense of solidarity\nYou kind of pull the louder up like if you've done okay you want to continue to
