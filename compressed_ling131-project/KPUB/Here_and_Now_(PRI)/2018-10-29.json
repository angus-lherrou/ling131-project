own noting it reflects an increase in hate crimes across the country jak rose in his presidency the American Jewish Congress\nJak words fail you know we're so sorry about this route to community\nBut has this been in the back of your mind you know what were you thinking when you heard about this attack\nLike first thought is this is a\nBrutal anti Semitic killing tech not only the Jews but Americans and our values and the shock of it all was\nJews have been living in America comfortable it's accepted in all communities around the country she changed since the fifties and sixties and in the anti Semitism bigotry against Jews and many minorities\nAnd here we are again one more time\nOr the ugliness not only pop to the surface does periodically but it seems to grip a good number of people in America\nWell uh ... let's talk\nDoes that does periodically but it seems to grip a good number of people in America\nWell uh ... let's talk about the climate in which it occurred Jews make up about two percent of this country's population the FBI data says they account for about half the country's religious hate crimes\nAccording to the Anti Defamation league that's nearly two thousand incidents and twenty Seventeen five hundred more than the previous here have you been feeling that increase\nIn the last two three years we've seen more anti Semitic acts Nazi symbols on Jewish cemeteries schools the SAT on Saturday there's quite a shock to the community and to America is seems\nAnd you know we all have these silly gathering there in Pittsburgh thousands of people came out I Hope you're feeling that\nSupport from across the board and yet we heard the President's Day in his first remark it's hard to believe that this could happen in this day and age I mean you're saying somewhat the same thing except you're saying that you are also aware of a rising incidents\nDo you think that maybe possibly this horrific act on Saturday\nThat maybe at the very very least you know it's a small consolation but there there can be a a a moment of people understanding that there is anti Semitism in this country\nI'm fearful that unless we mobilize so political leadership decides to change its ways they won't be any\nMajor changes taking place you know there's an opportunity next week when we vote in America maybe as those that have been spewing out some of his viral language you know politicians closes who not spoken out against intolerance against minorities and\nMaybe that will send a message in shock the system\nYou know the answer to this or a political leaders\nParties and maybe that will send a message in shock the system\nYou know the answer to this or a political leaders they have the microphones most important political leaders of president as a bully pulpit as the biggest microphone in the country and I think it starts with him changing the tone\nOf how he speaks about Americans and politicians from other parties but it also has to go down to you know our representatives in Washington are man governors and mayors or you know it's a local issue and if we can mobilize yeah with a loud voice to make sure that\nThey understand that this is not the American way than Americans won't accept it still do go to to the polls is necessary to to change it and it becomes a priority that's where it has to begin as\nWell and actually some would say we're hearing the opposite from the president had been\nFor a while we know that the gunman in Pittsburgh shattered the same racist rant that was heard by those marching white nationalist in Charlottesville in August is plenty Seventeen and we know that you know on line these white nationalists a supremacist Nazis\nAbsolutely believe and foment the thinking that Jews are pulling the strings somehow behind policies they don't like let's listen to these marches it's hard to hear but let's listen to these marches again in Charlottesville\n\nSound from a documented it's put together that day I mean when you heard that that that's what he allegedly the shooter was allegedly shouting in the synagogue that had to be chilling\nYes of course you know coming off of Charlottesville and Charleston and other attacks I think Americans are very conscious of the wrong time being set in America I Know everyone\nCharleston and other attacks I think Americans are very conscious of the wrong time being set in America I Know everybody speaking about the president having\nA big responsibility in this because of you know his views and his political rhetoric we should all work hard to let him know that we don't accept that in America but it's not only him as the point I'm trying to make it was just happened to been watching Clinton sharpening show no TV yesterday\nHas shocked and I know yeah\nDiscussion tend to surround Trump the bigotry and hatred that show's been showing you the wrong tone has been setting and I said to myself what about ...\n... you're speaking of ... leader of the nation is on\nYou know he just a few weeks ago said the Jews are Tom writes why and she was speaking out against him is that because you're a Democrat and\nTrump's Republican but our political leaders should also be speaking out against\nYou know hatred coming from all sides from all parties we can maybe hold president a little more responsible you know he has to since he has the biggest microphone she's going to have to\nUh you know live with the fact that he's the one they talk about the most but we shouldn't forget other parties wall leaders don't just get a pass\nThem around town said that they were fine people on both sides in Charlottesville and you got permission half as much and I don't think\nThat you can talk about Nazis and the all white and Americans I just don't think that comparison makes you know\nAny sense to ten of us Americans\nCan't claim president as an act of Congress thanks so much in again since ...\nThank you for your time\n... president of American Jews Congress thanks so much and again so sorry for the last in your community\nThank you for your kind of thoughts appreciate the time to be able to express views of the Jewish community\n\nWell

trying to get on and it's about a dog a harlequin great Dane named Apollo after the suicide of her friend the narrator is asked to take his massive pet in and they mourn together to goodness focus last march\nThere were these three strands that I I wanted to bring together into the same story and one was about uh the suicide of of people that are very close to you and another was um [noise] my experiences as a writer and a teacher of writing\nAnd uh I've always loved animals and I have always wanted to write about animals and I've always been interested in this human animal bond particularly the human canine bond so I saw a way that I could write a story leaving all those strands together\nAnd did you ever um and throwing in by the way along the way I'm suddenly there's Beckett and flattery O'Connor and Kafka and you're quoting other moments in literature as is written another book dogs do us the honor of treating us like gods and we respond by treating them like things\nThat is a quote from Jay I'm ... from his novel disgrace\nAnd what are you trying to say about these not just overall noble creatures but in this case a character named Apollo who's one of the largest dogs you can imagine but when he first comes into the married his apartment his tail is lowered like a beast of burden\nWhat do we know about whether dogs grieve [noise]\nDo know that they do grief because we can observe that and we do know that you know that we can't explain to them all the person died because he was in a car accident or something I can explain that to a dog but they definitely do more and\nAnd uh you know in this book she didn't think about this because it wasn't her idea to taking the dog but once she has him she realizes that he is going through\nUh you know in this book she didn't think about this because it wasn't her idea to taking the dog but once she has him she realizes that he is going through a process of grieving it just like her own and that draws them very close together and they get through it together they help each other and he'll now\nI remember I had to put a little dogs asleep ones and the person who came to the house that it's better that the other dog see this oh so that they know where the dog is gone and I I thought well that seems odd but\nI Am so glad to meet you can't you can't say for sure that that would happen well\nWhen the when the shots started the injection to you know put him to sleep the\nOther dog ran from the room jumped into the bath tub and picked over the top as if to say is anyone noticed you're killing a dog here I mean you know fascinating they and then he did more afterwards\nOr as I Do think that although we don't really know what's going on inside dogs heads because we we can't and they don't have language we know that they're smart I think they might be many many times smarter than we actually have fought on to this point\nBut the book isn't I mean for those wondering we've seen books recently that concentrate on an animal and somebody's relationship with an animal\nYours goes off I mean there's ... chapters where we're not hearing anything about Apollo and every now and then you say it's only happened to the dog or is something going to happen to the dog\nBecause you presume it's like old yell or you presume okay embracing here if there's a book with a dog something's gonna happen but you go off with your narrator to other parts of her life when you thinking there\nShe has a life outside of the dog even though during this period of mourning she doesn't do much besides take care of that is a dog I mean he's he's her whole emotional life during this period\nSomebody asked for the party argue the woman who's in love with the dog\nWith a giggle memory but also if you are a writer and this narrator is\nArgue the woman who's in love with the dog\nWith a giggle memory but also if you are a writer and this narrator is a big part of your life is literature a big part of your life is reading and thinking about what you read and a\nTalking about what you read and so that also became a part of the book it's a book that you know where you do have a person who in trying to understand what she is going through turns to certain writers and certain books in certain words and that's why I quote people like\nFlattery O'Connor because she's reaching out to these things she's putting them into the narrative because she was trying to tell a story about ... and the and all of those writers do have a part in her life as people she's read and who have influenced her and inspired her\nNow along the way I I kept thinking I should Google especially Google this is it true that during the Nineteen eighties in California there were many Cambodian women who suddenly lost their sight yes and they all lead atrocities in what they were just psychosomatic ally they couldn't see any more because of what they'd seen\nYes they did have psychosomatic blindness I mean that was the only explanation that doctors had four it\nIs it true that research has shown that it helps I think it was damaged children or six children to read aloud to dogs\nYes that is something that uh has been going on in classrooms in libraries fairly recently I think I'm needs a therapy dog say they know to be calm and to sit still and and listen and to the child is having reading difficulties\nThe dog is listening but he's not judgmental and anyway it appears to work about what it does for the dogs I don't know but it does seem to help the children yes that's also true yes\nYou also talk about people we talked about the site but you also talk about people who were dying their throat because of ...\nThe children yes that's also true yes\nYou also talk about people we talked about the site but you also talk about people who were dying their throat because of something more powerful and traumatic that happens a couple of times to our narrator we're not going to give away the ending except to say that we find out that the friend\nIs all along is the dog and maybe not the mentor who committed suicide\nBoy could be both ... or maybe the friend is the narrator yeah\nAnd what about you said you know you've loved animals but you make your narrator a cat person who isn't sure how she feels about a dog\nWell my my ... my married are really does that this is something I definitely share with my married or she says she thinks of herself as a cat person it's not that I Love cats more than dogs I Love both species equally but she like a lot of other people have trouble\nWith this idea of dominating any animal ... and you don't dominate cats you dominate other animals horses dogs\nYou know at some point she says uh they're almost two poignant and their relations with the person that to our cat person for example she says I'm a cat person give me a pet but can live without me\nShe just much happier with the idea that her cats would easily survive [laughter] her dying suddenly whereas this dog is totally traumatized by the disappearance of his best friend yeah\nDogs can be unbearably poignant and she said although I'm reminded of the great essay writer the public radio as a writer Alice furlough who wrote the definitive essay on a her cat dying and the only solace that she took from it every morning her cat would try to wake her up by not going to Penn on her head\nAs they do you have her only solace is that she\nThat she took from it every morning her cat would try to wake her up by not going to Penn on her head as they do you have her only solace is that she is now waking up and the cat's not there it would have been more unbearable for her\nIf the cat was still trying to you know with a pen wake her up when she had gone Oh yes that's that's very moving\nWell and how was this book it's called the friend from secret newness and so they just have to ask you it is about writers and writing in the community and the teaching of it um can you give us one tip for those who uh wanna wrestle a story to the ground\nThe piece of advice that I really like is the simple don't flinch I say it because I Do see a lot of very good work among my students spoiled at least in a draft because they've done exactly that they have this really good story they have it is really good experience they have very strong feelings about it but\nWhen they get to writing it down they get scared and they flinch and they pull away from it and that you know makes it not as good a story as it could be", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city":
