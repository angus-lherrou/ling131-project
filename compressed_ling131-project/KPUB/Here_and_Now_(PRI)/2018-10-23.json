learn more at Geico dot com\nThis this year and now if you look across the country at all the races in the mid term elections there's one that doesn't fit the mold Republican in a very blue state who is way ahead in the polls\nIn fact Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker is the most popular governor in America again a Republican in Massachusetts He's facing Democrat Jay Gonzales and at last check is almost forty points ahead of him in the polls\nAnthony Brooks is senior political reporter for WBUR you are in Boston he joins us by Anthony hey journalist and why is a Republican like they are so popular in Massachusetts well\nWhen it comes down to is that he represents a brand of Republicanism that works really well in Massachusetts who's relatively conservative on fiscal issues he doesn't like raising taxes but he's liberal on social issues like abortion rights and marriage equality\nAnd he works well with the state legislature which is dominated by Democrats so in this age of hyper partisanship across the country Baker represents something very different that appeals not only to Republicans in the state but according to ... to lots of Democrats and independents as well\nProbably call him a Democrat if you were in any other state here is in a recent debate with chickens I was talking about issues that\nOf Democrats and independents as well\nYou'd probably call a Democrat if he were in any other state here is in a recent debate with chickens I was talking about issues that matter to him or where he has to go against the president\nI've always been quite clear about where I stand on a whole series of things with respect to the president and managed to work pretty hard over the course of the past four years to stop some of the things that the Congress and the president was proposing that would have been particularly damaging the Massachusetts ... cuts the cuts in the end I H\nM and cancer and other forms of research and a lot of the work we did associated with the travel ban immigration\nWhat more do we know about his politics well as we mentioned he's moderate a fiscally cautious socially liberal by contrast his Democratic opponent Jay Gonzales wants to talk about big democratic programs raise taxes on the rich invest billions in transportation education\nProvide tuition free college and moved towards single payer health care system\nBaker is much more cautious I kind of cautious fiscal manager presents himself as a responsible custodian of government of government for example he's made modest investments in early childhood education an effort to fix the T the state's public transportation system but he opposes the kind of big tax hikes and big programs that comes out\nAnd gets ... is trying to remind people that Baker is in fact Republican listen to this moment from that same debate when Baker refused to say whether he would vote in the election for Republican Jeff deal who is challenging democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren next month you're going to vote for Jack deal governor\nI'm going to vote for me and I'm going to vote for Karen polio and I'm going to vote for a series of other candidates as well I don't know what I'm going to do you expect to that one you don't know if you're gonna vote for the guy who endorsed decision\nHooking it carefully to by the way that that's his lieutenant governor I this is a tough issue for\nReally that was an awkward moment for Baker and became even more so after the debate when he said\nHooking it carefully to find out that that's his lieutenant governor I this is a tough issue for ... really that was an awkward moment for Baker and became even more so after the debate when he said that he misspoke and would vote for the Republican ticket which would include a deal\nNow ... trying to link Baker to deal and by extension to Trump and\nAnd this does put Baker and a kind of awkward position this socially liberal anti Trump Republican who says he'll vote for Jeff deal the state's number one Trump supporter the guy who co chaired the Trump campaign and Massachusetts does Baker have a relationship with President Trump no they're not close a Baker didn't vote for Trump as we mentioned he's opposed several of his policies\nBut he argues that when he can work with the Trump Administration when it helps Massachusetts he will\nUh but this is a state that voted two to one against Trump um so uh you know Baker has to do a bit of a balancing act here when it comes to the president now Massachusetts has a history of moderate Republican governors William Weld ... even Mitt Romney who was governor in past\nRomneycare which was the model for Obamacare that's right and Baker is part of that tradition of moderate Republicans that have had success in Massachusetts and across New England for that matter\nThey included people like late Senator Warren Rodman of New Hampshire Lincoln Chafee Rhode Island Olympia Snowe of Maine they were known as you know Rockefeller Republicans fiscally conservative more socially moderate even liberal Baker is part of that tradition is\nBaker does when what is the lesson or is there one for Republicans in other states you know the lesson is that Republicans and Democrats can overcome this hyper partisanship and work together and get things done I think that's one lesson that said bakers brand of moderate Republicanism is increasing increasingly rare\nOnce upon a time it represented a viable wing of the Republican Party that existed across the country but now that wing\nIs on the verge of extinct extinction so I think the lesson is Republican moderates like Charlie Baker\nDid across the country but now that when he was on the verge of extinction extinction so I think the lesson is Republican moderates like Charlie Baker increasingly rare\nSaid that he Brookes senior political reporter for WBUR you are in Boston has any thank you my pleasure well a more traditional Republican is gaining ground on his Democratic opponent in the north Dakota Senate race Kevin Cramer is ahead of senator Heidi Heitkamp in the polls\nI kept one her seat in twenty twelve by fewer than three thousand votes and she had strong support from Native Americans which brings us to the Supreme Court which declined to consider a challenge to in North Dakota law that requires voters to show proof of their residential address at the polls putting the law into effect just weeks before the midterms\nAnd law could pose problems for many rural voters many of them Native Americans\nDanielle to Sheena Finn is the director of external affairs for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe she's also a citizen of the tribe she joined us Daniel thanks for joining us\nFor having me Jeremy so you say it's common on reservations for someone not to have a physical street address a explain why that is for people who aren't familiar\nYeah so on the reservation were very spread out community\nUm and due to that a lot of people do not live in town ships or areas um communities that have a lot of people in them so actually\nMailboxes are kind of uncommon and because of that most of the community members here hundreds if not thousands of people on stand Iraqi used peel box addresses and go to the post office to get their mail and I'm count that as their actual address so um\nWhat we're facing here and and what I Believe that the voter suppression in that many people now have to get new ideas with an actual physical residential address\nSo I so I Want to get to do that and how you're dealing with that issue but first of all do a lot of people who live on reservations tend to vote given that they don't have\nSo I Want to get to do that and how you're dealing with that issue but first of all do a lot of people who live on reservations tend to vote given that they don't have physical addresses and it just before this year do they vote in big numbers [noise]\nAh yeah you can um credit US Senator Heidi Heitkamp went in twenty twelve for the U.S Senate seat of North Dakota to the Native American vote where she won with\nLess than three thousand votes and I can tell you here on Standing Rock on the north Dakota side we have twenty seven hundred eligible voters Eighteen and above um that are capable of voting in this election\n'em in twenty fourteen twelve hundred people on Standing Rock voted and so that tells you right there that if just one tribal nation alone um votes predominantly with one party that could swing an election\nSo what are you trying to do to get trouble citizen voters eligible for this upcoming election given this Supreme Court decision\nYeah so so do based on the the new law that North Dakota\nReally imposed upon the tribal nations is we have to make sure that everyone has identification\nWith their new residential physical address so that\nEntails either getting them a new ID cards that's issued by the tribal government here or we have to provide them supplemental material um whether that's a letter from the travel agency and you know tell them they need to bring a utility bill let them if they're going to use their old id\nUm and also making sure people do know their residential address because again like I said people I'm here on the reservation house numbers are not very common a joke that my grandmother was saying is that she actually did a permanent marker and and marked her own house with her own numbers so there you go\n[noise] the Republican controlled state government in North Dakota says this law is about preventing voter fraud or in the states\nThe Republican controlled state government in North Dakota says this law is about preventing voter fraud or in the state which is over or one of the easier states to vote and what do you say that\nI think that's comical because you ... as people now making up their own addresses a because they do not feel like they should go to the sheriff who is also are nine one one coordinator and the only person in Sioux county who can issue and address so they're making up their own um addresses right now which\nIs voter fraud so they just created a problem basically\nAnd how do people have to come up with a a new address in order to vote this election day yeah so they they have two weeks they can do this right up until election day correct yep uh-huh so do you think that they will do you think you're going to get enough people registered to vote so that they all can have their voices heard\nAnd the ... voting rights and voting restrictions we talked with Ari Berman author of give us the ballot he says twenty four states have implemented new restrictions disproportionately affecting minorities\nRanging from requiring voter IDs to closing polling places now also tell us about the

have voted to repeal the Affordable CARE Act or making promises that they will continue one of the most popular parts of the law making sure people with pre existing conditions are able to get and keep their health insurance\nThe Affordable CARE Act is still at risk of being dismantled\nMaking sure people with pre existing conditions are able to get and keep their health insurance the Affordable CARE Act is still at risk of being dismantled but a majority of voters wants to protect coverage for pre existing conditions joining us now is Julie Rovner who is chief Washington correspondent for Kaiser Health news ...\nHey Jeremy and let's step back a bit first before the Affordable CARE Act was passed in ... and who did and who did not have protections for pre existing conditions well\nIf you were going from job to job to show that employer provided insurance then you had protections for pre existing condition or either exclusions are being charge more as long as he didn't have a break of more than sixty three days with a Nineteen Ninety six law that Congress passed\nWhat the Affordable Care act did was that extended it to people who basically left their jobs for their own insurance who wanted to leave to start a business or who were people who work for themselves\nOr or kids graduating from college and going off their parents' plan the idea was that people should be able to get insurance regardless of whether they had a pre existing condition and they shouldn't have to pay more for those were the two most important pieces of the pre existing condition protections in the Affordable CARE Act\nBut back ... if you did leave your job and you did leave your health insurance for a period of time and you did have a pre existing condition diabetes cancer or whatever it may be what does that mean for you could you get insurance\nOr possibly not or you might have been able to get insurance but it would cost much more or you might have been able to get insurance but it wouldn't cover your pre existing condition so there were there were a lot of sort of pitfalls if you were trying to buy your own insurance and you had been basically treated for a medical condition sometimes as minor as an acne\nSo at this point with some of the dismantling that has been done of the Affordable CARE Act that pre existing condition protection is still in place right ... basically\nThis point with some of the dismantling that has been done of the Affordable CARE Act that pre existing condition protection is still in place right ... basically if you want health insurance no matter what your pre existing condition is in this country you can get it\nIt is a it is still in place however there is a lawsuit that is pending we're expecting to hear from the judge in Texas [noise] pretty much any time or the lawsuit suggest that because of the tax bill last year that took away the fine for people who don't have health insurance\nThe entire Affordable Care act is now unconstitutional should be struck down the Trump Administration argued that they didn't quite agree with striking down the whole uh for Bill Carrick but maybe they should strike down the preexisting condition protections so even though Congress didn't change it there is still some threat that it could be changed in the\nCourt ... well that brings us to the bigger picture here which is that how can you say that you want to keep that one popular provision of the Affordable CARE Act which is the production for pre existing conditions but you want to get rid of other key provisions does it work if you take little pieces of it away\nWell it it makes it difficult I mean that's basically what the Trump Administration is arguing that the insurance industry said we can't afford to cover people with health problems unless we have a bigger pool of healthy people that's what that tax was about that's why there was an individual mandate the individual mandate is now gone and there is still some concern\nThat only sick people will sign up for individual health coverage because it's expensive or the insurance companies appear to be betting that they're going to continue to hang on to at least they all the people that they have because they're not raising premiums a whole lot for next year oh we will see if that pays off we will know more about that in twenty Nineteen about how well that actually works\nMeanwhile let's listen to what President Trump has been saying ah here he is on the campaign trail at a rally in West Virginia last month\nI Want to fight for\nPatients\nTrail at a rally in West Virginia last month\nAnd I will always fight for\nPatients with pre existing conditions or you have to [noise]\n\nSome\nPeople think that's not a Republican thing to do I don't care and I'll tell you what all of the Republicans are coming into the position now all of them [noise]\nAnd we'll do it the ride was [noise]\nPreexisting conditions are safe [noise] Julie is he right that all of the Republicans are moving into that position at this point\nWell a lot of them are saying it but there are what they have done suggests otherwise and actually just yesterday the Trump Administration um put out a guidance that allows states to\nTake these are short term plans that don't necessarily cover pre existing conditions and let people get subsidies for them under the Affordable CARE Act\nWhich is not something that protects pre existing conditions it basically says that OK sick people you're going to be segregated into these other plans in the premiums are likely to go up so it's in what they say and what they do do not match this year we will see whether voters can sort that out\n[noise] what about the Affordable CARE Act overall is it likely that if Republicans keep control of both houses of Congress that they're going to try again to repeal the whole thing\nI think that would be likely I think there's some there was some talk that they might try to do it in the lame duck session after the election that seems unlikely because they're going to have the same Congress they had before when they didn't have the votes but if they were to pick up seats particularly in the Senate then I think you would probably see another effort to to do what Congress tried and failed to do and twenty Seventeen\nOther than the pre existing conditions part of the Affordable CARE Act what are the other really popular parts of the law that it would be difficult for Republicans to get rid of well Republicans tried to go\nOther than the pre existing conditions part of the Affordable CARE Act what are the other really popular parts of the law that it would be difficult for Republicans to get rid of\nWell Republicans tried to go after the Medicaid expansion um and that turned out to be surprisingly unpopular I mean who I I don't think I would've guessed and\nTwenty Fifteen that Medicaid would become a big political issue and yet we have medicate now on the ballot in four states I'm about either expanding or protecting an existing expansion so that the popularity of the Medicaid expansion which gave a health insurance to\nTo you know many millions of people probably around fourteen or Fifteen million people is proven to be popular also so there are other pieces of the Affordable CARE Act that the public likes a lot in fact the only thing that public really didn't like was that individual mandate penalty which Congress got rid of last year\nRight but the question is again whether the the whole thing can stand up if you take away that part of it I guess it has so far\nIt has so far that tried in the insurance company behavior suggest that it it will be are they are betting that it will be okay we will have to see what happens in the court\nThe sign up period for a sea health plan starts on November first and for the first time since twenty tend the price of health coverage through the federal marketplaces is down slightly ... what's going on there\nAre well what's that what's going on there is an insurance companies raise their rates so much last year for twenty Eighteen that they have no place else to go they're finally starting to make money so they don't really need to raise rates\nIn some cases they're lowering rates at least slightly um partly that's because under the Affordable CARE Act they're not allowed to raise rates unless they can justify the rate increases which they can't this year\nAnd the whole thing and it looks like you know there's a little bit of stability but I should point out it depends where you live\nI'm rates are higher in some places still than in other places sometimes that's because last year's rates didn't go up so much I Would also point out that in some states open enrollment has already started in California started October fifteenth\nSo you really need to to check your state to find out\nI Would also point out that in some states open enrollment has already started in California started October fifteenth so you really need to to check your state to find out when open enrollment is when it ends and what the premiums are looking like\nWhat are you hearing from Democrats as we lived up to the election are you hearing people talk about universal health care as they were a couple of years ago\nWell Democrats are going to have a really big fight I think after the midterm right now they're talking about protecting preexisting conditions um but there is this this sort of nasons and growing move for a Medicare for all or some kind of universal coverage\nIt's a phrase that means different things to different people but clearly the Affordable CARE Act while it expanded coverage through a lot of people did not do enough about uh doing something about the price of health insurance and the price of health care in general\nAnd the fact that the U.S pays way more than other industrialized countries and I think that's going to be the debate going forward Democrats are going to have to decide whether they want to support and more government run a health plan or whether they can figure out a way to to make the Affordable CARE Act more robust and do something about health care spending in general [noise]\nJulie while we have you ah we learned today that the retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor has revealed in a
