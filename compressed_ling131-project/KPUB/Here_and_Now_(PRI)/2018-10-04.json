ten years ago Trump denies that but did authorize a payment of a hundred and thirty thousand dollars to her to stay quiet about it just a month before the election in twenty sixteen\nTrump's former fixer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance law by making that payment will Stormy Daniels has a book out this week called full disclosure she joined me from Beverly Hills to talk about it it is a memoir about more than the night she says she slept with Trump\nEverybody wanted me to write a tell all and I was like I really don't want to do that because you know that doesn't define me of course everybody knows that you know about that ethic you know Ninety seconds in a back in two thousand six with Trump and I was like I just don't want to write a tell all because it'd be a very very short book\nBut then you know I really didn't have an outlet to tell my side of the story obviously I went on sixty minutes and hope to do that a an interview was over three hours but once it was edited down it was only fourteen minutes and some of the really key things that I wanted to express you got cut out everybody knows what happened but nobody really knew how or why\nSo like you people haven't gotten the full picture of who you are\nCorrect and like I said how things transpired and why they happened\nBack in two thousand six with Trump and I was like I just don't want to write a tell all because it'd be a very very short book\nBut then you know I really didn't have an outlet to tell my side of the story obviously I went on sixty minutes and hope to do that a an

really knew how or why\nSo like you people haven't gotten the full picture of who you are\nCorrect and like I said how things transpired and why they happen the way they did in the way things unfold that so I just rushed the book and it was it was just my way of putting having complete control um although you know I'm Still sure that people are just going to jump straight to chapter three and I've you\nKnow it might make a joke about that in the book but let's let's start with what you're talking about at the beginning you grew up in\nBaton Rouge Louisiana you describe a rough childhood your mother would leave you alone for days without food or you say you were repeatedly raped at the age of nine and you were called the liar when you tried to report that sexual abuse to a guidance counselor\nWhat are you were able to know about you and your life that you don't think that they do already know\nUm basically what I just said that I don't want to be defined by one single evening with someone that uh I met and just thought it was going to be a crazy night with a goofy TV star obviously I had\nNo inclination as anyone else that he was going to be a politician you know I just started the book with the background because I kind of wanted everyone to get a a feeling for\nWhere I came from but I think that like the most important thing that I wanted to get across is that I was established and my industry as a writer and director and a feature dancer [noise] um I had this completely different life although in its own right very extraordinary\nSomeone that uh I met and just thought it was going to be a crazy night with a goofy TV star obviously I had\nNo inclination as anyone else that he was going to be a politician you know I just started the book with the background because I kind of wanted everyone to get a a feeling for where I came from but I think that like the most important thing that I wanted to get across is that\nI was established and my industry as a writer and director and a feature dancer [noise] um I had this completely different life although in its own right very extraordinary and so I just wanted people to know that there's a lot more to me than just that night\n[noise] what made you decide to finally come out and say this is what happened\nI was fine when saying nothing at all if I wasn't I Would have never signed a non disclosure I'm not stupid [noise] um and if I was going to do that I Would have asked for a lot more than a hundred and thirty thousand dollars once again I'm not stupid I just wanted it to go away I didn't want it to affect my family or my young child\nAnd I had a pretty successful career I'd moved behind the camera was starting to be really known and respected as a director I directed the mainstream things music videos lived in small town in Texas was very happy with you know I'm doing air quotes normal friends so this was the last thing that I Want it to come out\nBut then somehow it got leagues and Michael Cohen started running his mouth and then they wanted me to sign additional statements that were completely false\nI was fine with saying nothing but I didn't want to lie in the meantime the story was exploding everywhere and people were attacking the left and right and call me names and I just wanted to set the record straight and I just wanted to be able to tell the my side of the stories of people to understand where I was coming from\nAnd at the same time all these other women were coming forward\nI just felt one day that it was the right thing to do so I did it\nWhat do you want to happen to Michael Cohen [noise] um\nColin started running his mouth and then they wanted me to sign additional statements that were completely false\nI was fine when saying nothing but I didn't want to lie in the meantime the story was exploding everywhere and people were attacking the left and right and call me names and I just wanted to set the record straight and I just want it to be able to tell the my side of the stories that people would understand where I was coming from\nAnd at the same time all these other women were coming forward and\nI just felt one day that it was the right thing to do so I did it\nWhat do you want to happen to Michael Cohen [noise]\nUm I think we're all about to find out on what is the December twelve\nHe was the kind of the orchestrate of this and the one who most importantly and if you read the book you'll understand what I'm saying he's the one that blew it\nYou know I was totally fine with saying nothing at all I was actually thrilled\nAnd then he's the one that started happening he broke the nondisclosure way before I did and then when he realized he messed up he just continue to do so\nI think he's going to get what he deserves but on the other side of that I also am starting to have a little bit of admiration respect that he did finally come clean it met the moment that I got the call I was actually overseas in Europe when I got the call that he admitted that\nI was telling the truth was a huge moment for me because I'm used to being called all kinds of named to have a pretty thick skin being in the adult entertainment business you know I'm being called a liar was was really hard because I knew I was telling the truth\nWhen you make clear in this book that you were worried for your safety all along still are\nRight that was my other reason for signing the nondisclosure which we all knew it was kind of a crappy deal I'm was because there would be a record and so I figure it's nothing really happened to me because there are people who knew about this non disclosure now my fear lives mostly with just sort of\nCrazy fans not you know directly related to the government\nThe entertainment business you know the being called a liar was was really hard because I knew I was telling the truth\nWhen you make clear in this book that you were worried for your safety all along still are\nRight

there are people who knew about this non disclosure now my fear lives mostly with just sort of\nCrazy fans not you know directly related to the government or anything like that\nBut you've got body guards now\nI Do I have to they are awesome\n[laughter] but what is that what does that like I mean to to now be in a situation where you've got to have bodyguards all the time because of coming forward with your story\nIt was very overwhelming at first you know I was used to being able to travel alone I Would you be able to go to the bathroom alone [laughter] that's gone but over the last several months you know I have adapted and I've gotten used to it and we've become friends and it's just the way that it is [noise]\nYou describe in this book when you first met President Trump in Lake Tahoe back in July of two thousand six and you\nSay your first impression of him was that he was run of the mill insecure which I find happens a lot with people with money that they didn't earn themselves they harbor this inner self esteem problem that they try to mask\nBy over compensating as you've been thinking back about that moment and as you've seen him as we all have over the last couple of years um as it shaped the way that you perceived him at the beginning at all\nNo not not much I still stand by that feeling you know ask anyone I'm not personally nominate checks but I have a lot of friends in the adult business that that's what they do or that's part of their job and they will tell you that their biggest paying and\nThe harbor this inner self esteem problem that they try to mask by over compensating as you've been thinking back about that moment and as you've seen him as we all have over the last couple of years um as it shaped the way that you perceived him at the beginning at all\nNo not not much ice does stand by that feeling you know ask anyone I'm not personally nominate checks but I have a lot of friends in the adult business that that's what they do or that's part of their job and they will tell you that their\nBiggest paying and most unusual clients are CEOs and presidents have companies and people at high power um and then the other thing about that is that people who grow up very\nPrivileged and spoiled for lack of a better word lack of social skills because no one's ever told them now\nAnd I think that was pretty obvious and still holds true today how would you describe it today [noise]\nI don't know I Would have to I mean I haven't talked to him and twelve years I think that he is a different person um at least the night I hung out with him he can make complete sentences\nOr there's a report in the wall Street Journal this week uh that alleges that Trump personally directed an effort earlier this year to stop you from publicly describing your alleged affair with him ... how do you respond to that\nI found out about that the same time you did I think it was yesterday just reading news on line it's the first time I've heard of that honestly and it doesn't it doesn't surprise me that it happened it just surprises me that I'm just not finding out about it\nThat actually brings me to another question which is how how much do you have to pay attention to the news now are you are you reading the news a lot more than you used to\nAh actually the exact opposite [laughter] from around the ... he asked for like the first couple of months I was obsessed and was reading everything and I can't tell you the last time I actually had it\nI found out about that the same time you did I think it was yesterday just reading news

a couple of different interpretations of this particular song and some people are saying it's a commentary on male hyper masculinity ...\nUm when I first heard it I just thought it was a really goofy fun track 'em and it's one of those songs like it it reminds me when I was little kid I wasn't allowed to watch Miami Vice before I went to sleep as they would get me way to fire it up before bed\nAnd this song sort of has the same effect on me every time I hear it\nAnd obviously funny would you say it's like a good listen to do you like to listen to it\nThe song is an unbelievably fun lesson yet I mean like it's after the after you get through the hook the first time you'll be you'll be chanting the hook on your own the second time it comes around and every other time\nAs the sun moves on to

is mavericks saber a who just released this new songs drifting appear to\nBe\n\nI like that why do absolutely I mean it's such an an orthodox delivery to and I think that's the first thing that really caught my attention with this song\nOr the beat is really simple really funky but more than that it's just sort of the way he sounds on it was just kind of otherworldly who is maverick saber\nHe's an Irish R. and B. singer I'm I guess he's been releasing record since two thousand eleven I Know a lot of people had been fans with him for a while I just sort of caught on to him with the song drifting\nA but he's also on the label of Georgia Smith who was sort of a an up and coming R. and B. singer from the u._k. and he's appeared on one of the Georgia Smith eat peas the project eleven ...

album\nIncluding sorry daddy lessons and don't hurt yourself and she had a previous career as an ATM singer under the name winter Gordon but I feel like this is this is Diana Gordon kind of doing her own thing\nSort of sort of a reinvention of Diana Gordon I guess the glue the multi talented person yeah I mean she she definitely knows how to write songs and and she can sing them too I mean sometimes when the singer things you can sort of feel their heart and soul and sweat of experience\nIn their voice and to me this is one of those instances um she's just sort of recalling her
