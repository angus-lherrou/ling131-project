what will happen in politics and the economy and technology and in other things but as the saying goes making predictions is hard especially about the future\nSo how do you do it well joining us now is Dan gardener who's the author of future babble and super forecasting the art and science of production Dan welcome\nHi Jeremy so why is it that we humans always want to know what's going to happen in the future when it's really hard to do that in a lot of ways\nYeah uh it really stems from a really fundamental need we have a need a psychologically rooted need for control a sense of control of our environment\nAnd what do you need for control of your environment you need to know you need to know what's happening now or if you're looking into the future you need to know what's going to happen and if you look into the future\nAnd you've got important questions on your mind and all you see as a swirling vortex of uncertainty that's deeply disturbing you have to a race that uncertain and one way that we erased uncertainty is by turning to experts in saying please tell me what's going to happen next\nOne the experts that I think of when it comes to productions that get it pretty right at least in the not too distant future our weather forecasters yeah I have an app that tells me in ...\nTo know you need to know what's happening now or if you're looking into the future you need to know what's going to happen and if you look into the future\nAnd you've got important questions on your mind and all you see as a swirling vortex of uncertainty that's deeply disturbing you have to a race that uncertainty and one way that we erase uncertainty is by turning to experts and saying please tell me what's going to happen next\nWhen the experts that I think of when it comes to productions that get it pretty right at least in the not too distant future weather forecasters yeah I have an app that tells me in ten minutes it's going to start raining exactly where you are right now um but you know where are we good at it and where we bad at it\nWell it's interesting that you highlight weather forecasters because of course people tend to make jokes about weather forecasts as they always get things wrong yeah ... exactly the opposite in fact weather forecasting is the gold standard of forecasting\nNow the big difference between the weather forecasters in one of the reasons why they're so good\nAnd so many other demeans is it the weather forecasters know how good they are and they know when they cannot do so many other demeans that's not true people use vague language like something's probably going to happen or that's pretty certain or there's a good chance that\nA and nobody keeps track they don't keep score and so if you look at\nThe big famous pundits who tend to dominate the news whether it's politics or economics or anything else [noise] um they don't actually have proven track record scientifically scored track records we don't know how accurate the are\nIn the same way that we know how good a baseball player is by looking at his batting average in is the goal of a forecast to change the future to be able to make a decision once you know what's gonna happen or once you think you know what's going to happen that will change the outcome\nThis is an absolutely essential point\nSo if you look at the big famous pundits who tend to dominate the news whether it's politics or economics or anything else [noise]\nUm they don't actually have proven track record scientifically scored track records we don't know how accurate the are in the same way that we know how good a baseball player is by looking at his batting average in is the goal of a forecast\nTo change the future to be able to make a decision once you know what's gonna happen or once you think you know what's gonna happen that will change the outcome\nThis is an absolutely essential point very often when you talked about forecasting people talk about well how do you make it accurate forecast but very very often when forecasts are made\nIt's not actually accuracy the people are interested in there all sorts of other reasons why people make forecasts so you know a pundit on television might be making a forecast because it's ideologically congenial for the audience that very often happens\nOr they might be making a forecast because it's shocking and it's interesting it entertaining [noise]\nUm there's all sorts of these other competing interests\nIn one of those is to cause change so for example if I warned that some terrible thing is about to happen it's not necessarily that I Believe that is in fact the case it may be that I'm trying to spur others to action in order to prevent this suppose a catastrophe\nI'm so we have to be careful when we're looking at a forecast we have to ask ourselves is this person just trying to give me the straight goods to be as accurate as possible or do they have other interests at\nStake what are some big flops some production failures that stand out in your memory\nWell I always liked to say that the Nineteen seventies where the golden era of failed productions um it started really in Nineteen sixty eight with the population bomb by Paul Ehrlich was a huge bestseller basically said that\nOthers to action in order to prevent this suppose a catastrophe I'm so we have to be careful when we're looking at a forecast we have to ask yourself is this person just trying to give me the straight goods to be as accurate as possible or do they have other interests at stake\nWhat are some big flops some production failures that stand out in your memory\nWell I always liked to say that the Nineteen seventies or the golden era of failed predictions um it started really in Nineteen sixty eight with the population bomb by Paul Ehrlich there was a huge bestseller basically said that there will be mass global starvation within a couple of decades [noise]\nWrong or and then the Nineteen seventies were absolutely stuffed with the most amazing forecasts and and and happily for humanity most of those forecasts which were wrong we're all dismal they all said we're going to run out of oil [noise]\nUm well it reminds me of Y. two K. right that we all thought that general is going to end with two thousand came along and nothing happened\nThat's that's exactly right Y. two K. was another one there is a very long litany of these things but you know a one of the unfortunate aspects about forecasting is this\nIf I go back to old forecast and say hey do you remember what that guy said ten years ago well let's take a look at what happened and it turns out it's wrong\nI can tell you from experience that people kinda yawn [laughter] because it's an old forecast who cares about ... forecast old forecasts are old news but if time passes in somebody's forecast happens to be right\nThen they will be introduced as the person who got it right and we all have to listen to this person\nBecause they tell us what's gonna happen next and as a result the rule with expert predictions so often is heads I win tails you forget we had a bad right well you think about that every time somebody who figured out that President Trump was gonna win when much of the media thought that he would not win\nThe people kinda yawn [laughter] because it's an old forecast who cares about old forecasts old forecasts are old news but if time passes in somebody's forecast happens to be right\nThen they will be introduced as the person who got it right and we all have to listen to this person because they tell us what's gonna happen next and as a result the rule with expert predictions so often is heads I win tails you forget we had a bad\nRight well you think about that every time somebody who figured out that President Trump was going to win when much of the media thought that he would not when a when he did win you know there are a few journalists out there like I said at look at my tweet from you know two months ago I said it was going to happen [laughter] yup\nAnd you know look it's a there's an old saying about the mutual funds you know you start five hundred mutual funds and you just bet on all sorts of different stocks and ... by sheer happenstance one or two of them will hit big\nAnd then you hold up your one or two that had big and you say look at this what a brilliant invest right and well forecast very often function like that you can't judge the quality of a forecaster by a single forecast\nThat stand gardener who is author of the book future babble and coauthor of super forecasting the art and science of production Dan thank you so much for joining us thank you well let us know what you think of forecast political and otherwise it here and now dot org\nThe famous

years you know the lay of the land\nIs pretty much yeah why did you bring me right here in this spot in downtown Providence\nThought if we were talking about this race this would be a good place to illustrate some of the changes that have gone on in the past decade say\nWe were in worse shape after and during the recession we were at the bottom\nWe were the last to come out of the recession you know I've heard this a couple of times talking to Rhode islanders you were the first to go in and you were one of the last to come out right and I think that's because we had a a workforce that was relatively\nAnd train for it\nSpot in downtown Providence\nThought if we were talking about this race this would be a good place to illustrate some of the changes that have gone on in the past decade say\nWe were in worse shape after and during the recession we were at the bottom\nWe were the last to come out of the recession no I've heard this a couple of times talking to Rhode islanders you were the first to go in and you were one of the last to come out right and I think that's because we had a a workforce that was relatively\nUh on train for new technology\nBut up until fairly recently\nThey were able to make a living in manufacturing a good middle class\nCottages little cottages down at the shore and things like that\nBut all that changed you know in the eighties and
