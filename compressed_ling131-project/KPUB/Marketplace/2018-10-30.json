you don't have to spend a lot of time driving around almost anywhere in this country to know that our infrastructure our road specifically are in bad shape typically the money to maintain and sometimes even improve those roads comes from gas taxes California is one of several states that increased it gas tax not too long ago to get more money\nTo make more repairs but as often happens with new taxes not everybody is happy about 'em and they have taken to the ballot with the anti tax proposition six coming to California voters a week from tomorrow but as much Jed Kim reports now from the streets of LA changes in what kinds of cars are on the road might make a real gas tax difference\n... men has brought me to the corner of Venice in ... in downtown LA\nIt's next to the convention center staple center\nI Would highway highway yeah the one hand freeway where I can hear the noises coming through um\nLipman is with the transportation organization called LA\nHe's against proposition six because he says the gas tax is necessary\nPoints out the ... in the heat that\nGot a big fire a couple of big titles here\nLipman says the state has a backlog of a hundred and thirty billion dollars in infrastructure investment in roads and bridges\nLipton says the state has a backlog of a hundred and thirty billion dollars in infrastructure investment in roads and bridges\nRoads that are less safe bridges that are less safe\nAnd we are heart investing in the states and the way that we need [noise]\nLast year California legislators decided to patch that hundred thirty billion dollar hole by\nRaising the state's tax on gasoline from Eighteen cents a gallon to thirty cents almost immediately and group formed to put forward proposition six to overturn the increase and require all future hikes to be approved by voters rather than legislators\nCalled the ... is chairman of the yes on prop six campaign he blames the poor infrastructure situation on mismanagement politicians have more than enough money to fix the roads they just keep diverting the money\nSo we don't need to add the cost of living burdens to working families to fix roads they should be putting the existing gas tax into roads rather than increasing it but even if the gas tax word to stay the same it wouldn't be able to keep up with the demands for one thing these types of having been indexed to inflation\nAnother reason can be seen directly across that street\nIn downtown LA at a Honda dealership\nIts windows advertise hybrids another fuel efficient cars\nKrista Ghouta is out on the law joking with other salesman\nI ask him how many people come in looking for good mileage most of it that\nPaying customer nine customers coming for them they should be of course they're looking for a

supposed to start asking questions but I'm going to cause it's like this is the heart of the players right this is where the rubber meets the road um [noise] so what keeps you up at night\nBut what's your worst [laughter]\nMy ... my the thing that keeps me up right now is that the the greatest player in the NBA LeBron James decided to come join us\nAnd and be part of what we're building and we've missed the class every year for five years so this is not what the brand was meant to be and that's what what\nAre fans deserve to be back to what they're used to in in terms of Lakers basketball having the best player has brought us back it's it's it's elevated the brand now we just need to do that\nI don't necessarily expect you to answer this question but are kind of have to ask her view in la brown and ... and Magic Johnson drug for basketball and and you know ... and the other best workers have you guys have the conversation on yourself about look\nThis isn't going to be rebuilding\n[noise] um yeah you you know yes I mean magic ... definitely has a plan as to what we're doing you know when when magic came in and took over basketball operations\nWhat I felt was and why I had to make the change from our existing general manager and my brother Jim who oversaw basketball\nWas that there was no identity of Laker basketball\nThey're really interesting 'cause liquor basketball's like a brand name exactly and and you can't\nIs that there was no identity of Laker basketball\nThey're really interesting 'cause liquor basketball's like a brand name\nExactly and and you can't establish anything when you're changing coaches every eight months so we've had three coaches and three years\nYou know and each one a great coach in themselves but you can't change your roster overnight and so the ... everything was not matched up right and we were struggling with no identity\nSo this goes to something which are more complex all the time you were in uncertainty and and not only does regular business suit on Saturday So too does the sports business in sports teams and the woman running loose sports team right on surgery was going\nIt was killing the brand and it was you know when my father passed away than commissioner David Stern called me and he said\nJeannie don't let the team fail like don't let go do run into the ground didn't really say oh yeah whom I loved it like\nIt it would you break your dad's heart and so you know and it was difficult because I wasn't in charge of basketball my brother was and I asked him how long is it going to take you to get the team on track and he gave himself a timeline which\nAs as time went on I realized that wasn't going to happen and that's why I had to make the change that I did but I you know I took that to heart and I wouldn't I wouldn't let this you know my dad had six kids and I think the Lakers were his favorite kitt [laughter] on the last\nWord here about your family right I mean Dr Bush or to your

years when the commercial lead culture and says don't\nBook you talked about it in interviews about how this is a family business show those first couple of years when the commercial read culture and says don't blow it with a family business and then you have to file your brother what's that was\nIt was very very difficult um\nYou know my dad kinda set it up for us but ultimately he gave me the authority and the power\nTo make any changes that I saw a necessary one of the key components of that decision making process was a conversation I had with Kobe Bryant he said what a player\nAn all star player who's you know a free agent is going to look at an organization and how it operates and making sure that there's somebody in charge who has authority to accomplish what the goals are\nMeaning you've got you've got to get the organization in the right position before anybody will consider\nInvesting his career in what you're doing right now nobody knows what you guys stand for\nSort of becomes a poke in the question about it up and making the change from prior management and your brother you should wear the number of years did you wait too long\nThat was the my first comment publicly was I apologized to Laker fans because ... perhaps I did wait too long\nUm as you can hear the music or early ... it's it's funny because we actually have a DJ now on staff you know
