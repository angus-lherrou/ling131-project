the ratings people at Nielsen who looked at digital and physical album sales as well as streaming numbers hip hop and R and be replaced rock as this country's most popular music genres\nBut as often happens there is a twist because what Nielsen didn't consider how much money people spend on concerts and when it comes to live shows rock and roll is still the king rock concerts accounted for more than half of the five billion dollars generated by last year's highest\nGrossing life tours you'll show wrote about rock in revenue for the wall Street Journal walk in the program thanks for having me

year's highest grossing life tours you'll show wrote about rock and revenue for the wall Street Journal welcome to the program thanks for having me when was the last time you were in a rock concert a properly pretty recently I went to a show at the Warsaw to see a band called all ways along with snail mail and hatching\nOkay so it was a surprise nobody was made his program that I don't know any of those bands but but but it gets to the point\nOf um uh that's where the money is really right hip hop and R B have been dominant culturally for many years now commercially speaking rap is really taking over the industry over the last couple of years\nSo there tends to be this huge focus rightly so on rap and it's important to right now but the thing is\nA huge part of the music industry is the other side of the industry not just the recording music side but to live side and something that's kind of been\nKind of obscured lately is how significant rock still is for live music is it just because rock and roll has been around so much longer than than rap and hip hop and all the rest there are several reasons rock also crosses generations in a way that rap doesn't at a rock concert you could have a younger\nA millennial a Gen Z a music fan who's curious about a particular act and then of course you're gonna get twenty somethings thirty something's forty somethings fifty some things\nBut it's it's more complicated than that guns and roses and older act and eighty nine guns ... roses is playing stadiums and his playing arenas public enemy and WMA also from ... to\nOr not so one one significant things some of the classic legacy pioneering rap acts aren't playing big venues\nA lot of questions actually come out of that the first is I'm going to a live show is is a

are\nA lot of questions actually come out of that the first thing is I'm going to a live show is is a disposable income kind of thing right do rock and roll show fans tend to have more disposable income than the folks who would go to see say and the way\nIt is the case that the younger fans of hip hop have less disposable rash so what happens is the economics for an act like juice world who's on top of their charts with this song lucid dreams right now are different ... if you had this lengthy sprawling tour hitting\nA second tier dirtier a cities across the U.S it's not going to work because there aren't enough people to come to that show where maybe a rock act who has older fans with more cash in their pocket can make the economics work um\nSo let's go back even farther
