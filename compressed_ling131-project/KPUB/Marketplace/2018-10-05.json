rising right so if they think inflation coming\nThen that could eat into their long term investment and a ten year treasury the long term investments are they're going to need a higher yield the other

multilateral institutions yet we have a a dynamic and strong and growing economy in the United states where do we stand on on on how things might play out\nI think it's pretty striking that we've basically spent the last year and a half alienating our friends punishing farmers and manufacturers with tariffs and counter terrorists and breaking apart the hard won alliance that we had built um [laughter]\nTo try to isolate China and we ended up in more or less the same position that we were in before which is NAFTA is still more or less in place a plus elements of of the Trans Pacific

the remaining two years of the president's term and perhaps for\nIt's a bumpy road ahead um what this negotiation process taught us is that even something that should have been a sure thing\nWhich is to continue on with NAFTA which is essentially what happened\nTook away longer with much more drama than probably necessary and that's with the north American trade agreement right now let's look at something much more complicated that really speaks to the future of China and the development of the emerging world\nUm where we are in a negotiation in which we do have some solid um reasons for
