the word we haven't heard in a long time or what the what what's going\nOn so there's been a lot of speculation about what I'm hearing is there a few things going on right now the Federal Reserve has

more expensive for some companies to do business also we've seen indications that the Chinese economy is slowing its currency is falling all of these things can make investors nervous\nThe question is really why this is happening now is in today and yesterday this stuff has been going on for a while so that's hard to say or it's uh\nSo slow down the economy and then there's the ... the U.S and

of big numbers right surgeon or points on the do a a bunch on the nose and there's computer down his will frame that for me would\nYeah those are scary numbers but you got to put this into perspective in terms of percentages that drops are so big so Thirteen hundred points and the Dow that's five percent and eat this sell off we haven't hit a market correction yet you know that's why an index falls at least ten prevent\nUh and if you look at the trends the Dow and the NASDAQ are both up by about ten percent in the past year as in ... up by seven percent so what I've been hearing from analysts is that at this point we're still talking about a bad couple of days\nArt I Will take that and we can run with the do me a favor though I'm ... and spit ball this with the copy of the past performance is

the underlying reality as solid\nAs soon as I've been here ... on the market beat today Thanks thank you All right so we will turn now to three snapshots from the president of the United states three glimpses into his thinking on monetary policy interest rates in other words\nAnd what the Federal Reserve has been doing with them mainly as marketplaces Mariel cigar sitting right there just said raising them three times this year if you are counting and we are in ... is the president\nWhich gets us to this first of all this from the president last night in Erie, Pennsylvania apologies by the way for the background noise\nBeen this this morning from a call he made to Fox and friends\nYou know the Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute that's all this that's ridiculous what they're doing\nAnd then finally later this morning from a bill signing ceremony in the oval office\nI think the fed is far too stringent and they're making a mistake and is that right [noise] and it's a despite that we're doing very well but it's not necessary in my opinion and I think I Know about it better than they do believe\nIf your business and economics journalist what do you do with that

opinion and I think I Know about it better than they do believe there\nSo if your business and economics journalist what\nDo you do with that because the president is just wrong the fed is not crazy or ... or stringent the central bank under both its current and immediate past chairs has been deliberate and transparent and measured as it sets about getting interest rates back to something near normal after a decade of keeping them at zero\nAlso by the way when I ask you a ... back in July if it bugs him win the White House poke them in the eye on monetary policy or whether it's going to

respected economists saying they're going to be risks to what's happening here and you have members of some inspiration downplaying those risk it's interesting to the division between those advisors to the president and president south we're talking about Jay Powell just a moment to go to the fed chair you had the present earlier this week\nCasting doubt even answered reporters' question does he planned to fire Jay Powell I didn't know that we've gotten there yet as a guy that he picked\n'em so you have a president now watching these interest rates rise fair to say no president wants to see interest rates go up um but there exists still this division between the president was revised\nYeah leave that point about uh the president ... told me on this program I don't care what the president says I'm gonna do my job but but there is something about um why it matters that presidents attacked ... never happen but but this is real now\nIt really is and and write he hasn't done this before and Jay Powell has actually managed to be relatively out of the limelight since ... since he took over\n'em but you know who knows I mean this could be here one day and on the next I mean we just don't know I'm right in the interest rates you know it's a good sign this is only good thing it doesn't need to be you know it it doesn't need to be such a bad thing it's not crazy\n[laughter] it's

Chinese and the United states still can't agree on on what to do about it there is a a ... effect that over time will take some of the air out of this cone\nOh absolutely I mean one hundred percent and we'll start to see it next year\nOr this is big this is a big deal and this is now that the the the tariffs which China has been vastly expanded in may be vastly expanded again uh this is this is
