let's say you own a manufacturing company you're deciding whether to expand and existing factory or build a new one\nThe new factory might take longer to come up and running but then maybe it has

investing versus not investing there's a cost associated with not investing in that is due to the time value of money\nIt's not clear what President Trump was referring to when he tweeted about the time value of money he wasn't specific and the times story doesn't mention it the writers did adjust all their numbers for inflation expressing them in what's known as today's dollars but that's a different concept ... for marketplace\nInflation one hopes we've explained it to guys right I mean right anyway self driving cars are the future as we know the only question really is how much that

hit it over to the headquarters of J. P. Morgan Chase security guy ministers up to the forty eighth floor where we called our heels for a little bit waiting for Jamie diamond that's on us we were early\nSo we had a chance to poke around a little bit lots of sports memorabilia on the shelf business and management books to interestingly enough\nBank history stuff as well diamond showed up pretty much on time we did the usual chitchat as we got settled talked about how we got into banking he's uh\nEnough bank history stuff as well diamond showed up pretty much on time we did the usual chitchat as we got settled talked about how we got into banking he's the son and grandson of stockbrokers by the way and then we got down to it\nDo you think um\nPeople understand banks in this economy like you understood banks when you were a kid\nI some people on the same things as a consumer so you know if you've taken a mortgage you have a checking account if you have a business need alone if you're a large corporation you have to sell equity your debt that they understand don't understand the inner workings of the bank\nDoesn't matter what does to me but I don't I don't think it should matter to the customer now with the customer wants to do a good experience and you know good credit card and a good yeah\nYeah but doesn't matter whether American consumers understand the way the financial system works\nI think it I think it matters to understand how business in general works so if you don't have a financial system you don't have an economy\nSo defense is is just part of his great economy in America has the widest deepest most transparent financial markets the world's ever seen in total I'm including private equity venture capital\nThe formation of business the transparency of our capital markets and no other country in the world has it it's not even close as kind of it's kind of a part of the engine that makes us the most prosperous economy in the world\nYou come to that we just come to that not without some scars right and we'll get to the crisis or a little bit later on but but what do you think um the financial sectors role in this society is what is the banks responsibility in this society\nI think the most important thing is you help grow a prosperous economy that helps the most people and they create the wealth by which you could take care of your old you are sick you're poor and so I I think people should understand that you need a healthy banking system my daughter asked me in their financial crisis\nYou know what's your financial crises that was the ... that happens every seven to ten years I wasn't being facetious I was looking at Nineteen Seventy four Nineteen eighty two Nineteen eighty seven Nineteen Ninety and ... and one of things makes me cautious as knowing all that\nAs I was looking at Nineteen Seventy four Nineteen eighty two Nineteen eighty seven Nineteen Ninety and ... and one of things that makes me cautious as knowing all that\nI always always always wanted to run the bank that we can survive anything so that were there in good times and bad times and more more important in bad times for clients\nLots in there and we're going to get to the crisis in a second as I said I I Want to talk for a second about I'm a corporate social responsibility which you are and this banker believer you talk about that a little bit\nI go I I've never believe that the only thing is to maximize shareholder value in fact I don't know any CEOs were that way I think these\nHank Paulson me a bunch of people ... Tim guy all thought that that could be holding the type that we got to stop we were wrong because as it turned out there was a succession of failures after that are ... didn't comment in lemon emerge\nIt would be holding the type that we got to stop we were wrong because as it turned out there was a succession of failures after that are ... didn't common name and number is the biggest financial series of all time with Fannie and Freddie which were government designed run your goals\nHey I was still dealing with by the way fending for exactly with the ... a A R G afterwards hundreds of mortgage brokers went bankrupt so yeah it's it was ... I Would have bought ... because even though we paid an extra price that we\nDidn't think we should have paid it put us into all so many places I forgot number how many branches we got but in those days you got the one down the street from my house where I bank I mean right and which country you're in California we've gone from seven or branches to a thousand I think it was a fabulous platform for Jake more to grow so I still would have done that one\nAre you satisfied that um we have the protections in place now\nTo avoid something like that happening again yeah you should never be satisfied and I I mean I Want to explain that ... the regular should I say they really should be happy and take a victory lap I give you just do leeman redux\nIt wouldn't happen they would have had not twenty below the capital but fifty\nBut because of the regulation yeah sort of play they would have had a lot more liquidity a lot more transparency if it did go bankrupt at the moment of bankruptcy it would have created another hundred billion dollars of equity in the ... over capitalized for him in the world\nThe government can run it and do whatever they want that but I think it was an orderly unwind but Hammond Leming was a ... or early unwind assets were thrown people couldn't get their cash markets we're going to collapse because they had to sell assets\nThat was all ... so the capital liquidate the banking system is stronger but with the way you look at risk I I don't just guess what the future as I say what is the worst you could possibly be and can we handle it\nAnd to me family means I guess still sort of my client does not mean to have to run in panic\nBut not always be quite as that question where's the next problem coming from it will be different from the last problem cyberattacks on other Institute\nBut you're not always be quite as their question where's the next problem coming from it will be different from the last problem cyberattacks on other institutions clearing houses and I'm not worried about shadow banking but they're always going to be issued a shadow banking so if you're a regulator you should be really cautious about what's happening in a way from banks\nAre you worried about you know given all that cyber and all of that are you worried about um the fed and its actions are and are you worried about a politicians and them stepping up\nYou know I'm not worried about both we planned for both not being exactly what you expect it so I think the fed is doing the right thing and raising rates the economy is quite strong\nAnd they just think it was just normalizing it but you know is it possible that down the road something happens it's too much inflation if that's going to move quicker that's possible so I'm not predicting it but my and my company could easily handle it but it is possible just like just like\nThe terrorists can cause problems that you don't anticipate today just like cyber can cause problems just like James who can cause problems I mean you always got to be looking to figure out and make sure you can handle bad outcomes you\nJumping ahead of my list of questions because I Want to get the terrorists in a second but that look let me back you up for a minute on the healthy economy and I'm not going to argue that the headline facts right jobs GDP all of that good stuff\nBut as you said are on the forty whatever it is floor of this building looking out ... literally yet at the American economy there's income inequality there's wage stagnation which has just recently started to pick up and I mean there are some not small problems yeah\nSo the American public's understand that this is the most prosperous economy world's ever seen them do what I mean I I I went to it but the good in the back yard so far so good as we have wonderful neighbors in Canada and Mexico\nAre we've got all the oil food water energy we need we have or what the founding fathers gave a freedom of religion and freedom of speech and freedom of enterprise the best universities wisely\nFood water energy we need we have ... or what the founding fathers gave a freedom of religion and freedom of speech and freedom of enterprise the best universities and why is the capital markets and yes income inequality the real issue and we studied it and they're fixes to it\nThe economy's been going in ... and ... and it was driving low wage growth less small business formation\nAnd all these other things that we need to fix okay but lord and there are fix the American public you know everything we talk about their or fixes for we put her mind to it\nAnd kind of dropped a Democrat or Republican view of it I appreciate the positivity generally I Do have some reality are right\nWe have serious problems with many other countries in this global economy we are pulling back from the international arena the president said at the at the un across town a couple of days ago\nIt is America First right so\nDo you reconcile that with what you call for and your letter which is intelligence thoughtful analytical and comprehensive policy where virtually have slipping a bit to make all that we have not had more we can or Mexico's Eighteen forty eight\nMexico's accident quite well and we treat them very respectfully\nBut you're actually correct his trade issue a medical a skirmish yeah yeah and it will so what people are afraid about is that it will get worse into what we call trade what so what do you see that's going to make it not get worse from a skirmish does it sure doesn't look like anybody's back into that look we advise the president that while you were young while you were you\nYeah we have and I know lots of us have done it and I'm most was said that we understand issue to China and he's right\nNon tariff barriers tariff barriers will property all intellectual property is owned enterprises subsidies et cetera I'm hoping the other day that President succeeds him where he wants to do and I say hey you know your method worked I'm just worried that the method can cause more problems so she'll put on your your most objective Jamie diamonds self here for a second an answer this question\nOr is it possible that you have too much power in this economy you\nThe objective Jamie diamonds self here for a second an answer this question or is it possible that you have too much power in this economy you\nI don't think so I mean there are all in a lot of leverage zero or twenty eight million companies in America\nI mean you know we we are one actor of many in this economy and there are a lot of other big banks do a lot of I I'm going to be competing window of the Chinese banks folks I don't see a lightly\nThey they are already they have a bigger home market they make more money they were worth more than the market value there's so many Chinese banks make more money than we do\nThey have aspirations and they showed their going overseas and they should they're fine they are Chinese companies overseas and they should and they will be competing with us in a lot of things we also proud to compete one day with alley pay and we chat and ten cent and\nSo I I look at the world on this ... this is Graham say no we're gonna have competitors I Want jeep more chase be the best bank in the world I wanted to be an American bank\nAnd it would I think it'd be a mistake for America the best banks in the world and the biggest banks in the world were Chinese banks\nWell so here's actually a good phone question do we as an economy\nOr get the benefit of your size that makes it worth the risk of you being so big\nYes because remember scale economy is that is true for banks is true for auto companies are two ... industries the beneficiary of skill of economics is to clients

have a low unemployment three nine percent of GDP Growth rate and revise forefront two percent second quarter through this\nAll of this great news and it just keeps on piling up and piling up\nA means that a investors could be thinking that inflation is coming okay so and if inflation is going to be actually coming we also saw an oil prices rise are rising right so if they think inflation coming\nThen that could eat into their long term investment and a ten year treasury the long term investment so they're going to need to hire you all the other thing is that uh this could be telling
