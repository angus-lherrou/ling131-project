Washington deals with at a policy\nLevel few of them bring with them more wailing and gnashing of teeth then these two seemingly simple words currency manipulation the subject comes up every six months Treasury Department is required to put out a report listing those economies that are manipulating their currencies to gain competitive advantage but really here\nWe are talking about one economy right China that as we told you last week the Treasury Department did not repeat not say Beijing is manipulate\nWe're talking about one economy right China and as we told you last week the Treasury Department did not repeat not say Beijing is manipulating its currency\nBut that did not end the wailing and the national over the weekend treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said he might actually consider changing the rules the department uses to decide whether countries are playing fast and loose with the foreign exchange markets so we asked marketplaces Tracey Samuelson why all the for X held up\nAs far as current global economic issues go currency manipulation no super high unless\nThis is not something that very many countries have done historically and not something many countries are doing today\nDavid Steinberg is a professor of international political economy at Johns Hopkins [noise] but if you worry as the president does that other countries so more to us than we do to them then you worry about the ways that exchange rates can make those foreign goods even more appealing Matthew Goodman is with the center for Strategic and International Studies\nThere is a

at the moment\nAnd anyway the label just doesn't pack that much punch they'll ... at the University of Maryland\nIs kind of a strange tool because if we deemed China to be a currency manipulator the result of that is and we have to have talks with China about it but of course we're talking with them already\nThen there's the politics Derek scissors with the American Enterprise Institute\nRemember the president said he recalled trying to crunch him and I put on day one we've now gone through four rounds of reports where they haven't called the courage to manipulate or and you know there are

marketplaces replenish or has more now on who stands to gain from that\nIf you don't have a credit history it's kind of hard to get a credit score like it's hard to get a grade class if you've never taken any of the tests so what if I go is doing instead with ultra psycho is looking at other information besides your credit history to figure out how credit worthy you are\nThat includes not having

thousand Eighteen congressional elections a lot of it coming from\nWell shall we say the upper end of the income distribution marketplace adjusting how has that one one\nOf the reasons there's so much money flowing into these midterm elections is because billionaires alleging more of their cash and politicians\nThis is something that sort of arose out of in the dark as fortunate as being made\nOr the last few decades\nThat stand for political scientist Adam Monica he found that the total wealth the force four hundred jumped eleven to fold since Nineteen eighty two and the amount will be people spend on politics has gone up in proportion historically he says\nPretty clear that there was a lot more money coming from very wealthy conservative\nLike casino mogul Sheldon Adelson he's worth

the opening of an embassy in Jerusalem\nThis year it'll send and his wife if pony up eighty seven million dollars to conservative groups and candidates but lately Monica says many billionaires are leaning another way\nAnd over time it's been trending pretty clearly towards more money going the darkest\nConservative candidates have earned more billionaire donations the data from the center for Responsive Politics show Democrats are catching up but like I says that's because a lot of newer billionaires come from more liberal places like Silicon Valley\nDustin Moskowitz the billionaire cofounder of Facebook gave over five million to groups like move on dot org and a group dedicated to winning Senate races others say the polarized political climate over the last two years his letting

Politics a huge chunk of the spending goes to advertising and depending on what the ads say she says their funders don't always have to be disclosed\nSo it makes it hard to tell whether it's a

up under President Trump there was this real sense that the merger would just get waved through because Trump is a big supporter of Mr Smith and if Sinclair and he was tweeting positive statements about the company\nAnd several weeks ago I G pie announced while we're not going to approve this deal we have major concerns in effectively killed the deal referred it to a legal hearing within the FCC which sort of do that\nBut what we've learned since then has Sinclair was basically behaving in such a way that it was a foregone conclusion they did not even make minimal effort\nTo appease their regulators and get their deal approved\nAnd they had had such success for such a long period of time to refer to be over in their favor\nThe trick had worked in the past and the number of regulatory
