the sun to American trade war earlier this year the United states put tariffs on solar panels and dishwashers from China and other countries to be sure that it was steel and aluminum also China and other countries\nNow those thanks to the Trump administration's focus on Beijing is taxing fully half of everything we buy from China all of that has led to retaliate George hours from China and other

agriculture mostly the whole thing happened so fast you might reasonably conclude we could get out of it just as fast but as marketplaces got song reports game theory suggests otherwise\nGame theory is the way scientists and mathematicians think about human behavior and interaction what should I Do based on what you do should I trust you and what do I do if you break that trust\nBefore this trade war the U.S and China had some trust both were members of a free trade club known as the world Trade Organization and then trust broke down trade professor Jennifer Hillman at Georgetown Law says a decade ago Beijing began requiring U.S companies there to hand over their secrets\nThey're forced technology transfer violates the commitments China made when it joined the WTO that its level of IP theft is a violation of the intellectual property provisions\nWashington meanwhile broke trust by taxing Chinese imports this year\nUnder the WTO rules the United states is not allowed to unilaterally just ratchet up the tariffs on China\nGame theory suggests a couple of things one is it's hard to establish trust when it's broken into a trade war is actually a rational thing for countries to do it in their self interest here's how\nNYU business process I ruined sooner origin says the U.S interest is to tax Chinese imports whether Beijing responds or not either way Washington makes money\nThat

Crowe played him in the movie a Beautiful Mind\nThat's the only way out of a distinguished only way that\nHe came up with something called the national equilibrium which suggests that a trade war of self interest is actually the norm and that cooperation and free trade is the exception\nBoth countries imposing tariffs is the ... equilibrium of the game\nTo send ... this means a trade war could go on a while as in ten years now game theory does allow for things to get shaken up but it takes something dramatic to disrupt things said political change\nCould be the election of a new president and the United states now that unfortunately has to be coupled with a similar willingness to negotiate on China's buck\nOr outside parties say other countries of the WTO could bring the U.S and China together and create space for trust so Jennifer Hillman at Georgetown Law they could say listen here's a new trade agreement that takes away tariffs provide new customers for your exports and outside third parties will be the free trade police\nDo it's giving a little bit of political cover to China to say we need to make these reforms in order to remain a member in good standing up the WTO we need to do these reforms\nAnd to provide political cover for D.C as well someone else made me do this but she agrees with sooner origin that a sudden outbreak of trust is not imminent and that this

Richardson from Edward Jones and Catherine Rampell from the Washington Post our in our studios in New York City everybody okay so let me start with you uh and and uh in the process of asking this question I'm going to point out that we're going to be hearing from\nA Tracey Samuelson in about six minutes or so on some of the details of the GDP report as deals with trade but a very quick pass on the GDP report it is a good number\nThe six minutes or so on some of the details of the GDP report as deals with trade but a very quick pass on his GDP report it is a good number\nYeah the headline number is good there are some underlying parts of it that are a little bit troubling including the fact that business investment I had had slowed\nYou know there is this risk that the boost to a capital expenditure as was pretty front loaded this year as a result of the nuns and we're seeing a slow down I'm so that is a little bit troubling but generally the headline number was good consumers seem happy\nNew and it occurs me actually just thinking back to our open the show that I should have said there is that there are three fourths right economic growth the trade war and also the ... 'cause there was a tension there between the trade one of the tax cuts in the stimulus and the and the ... stimulus if you will of what's going on\nLet's boil it down to two things uh one is higher interest rates which the stimulus feeds into and stronger growth and right now\nFor a short period of time maybe we are at an economic sweet spot for the economy can still grow but inflation is still very moderate in fact below the Fed's target rate of two percent in this latest GDP read\nAnd so right now um things are looking good economically speaking in its good as Katherine said because the consumer is good I I hear some trepidation though when you're ...\nYou know there's no such thing as a perfect the economy and part of the reason that markets were worried this week and we saw that in the stock market this week is there there were these three persisting concerns slower global growth higher interest rates\nAnd ... concerns those are going to stay with us until they're resolved and so you'll see the push pull in the market between really strong fundamentals and I'm very worried outlook for ... investors ahead\nOkay Katherine not to um\nPush pull in the market between really strong fundamentals and I'm very worried outlook for ... investors ahead\nOkay Katherine not to point out the president's ah economic inconsistencies but it bears leaving them out will will uh [laughter]\nSo so here's the thing just on the street and tariffs and he he came out this week in in a tweet at some point Monday Tuesday and said we're going to get billions of dollars into the United states because of all these jobs not mentioning the consumer is going to pay those terrorists but then he turns around in an interview with Wall Street journal and says tariffs we don't have any terms on this economy I don't I don't understand I guess is what I'm saying\nWell and in that very same Wall Street journal article he also talked about how useful the terrorists had been so like basically in the same breath ah you know on the one hand he's saying we have these tariffs on the other hand he signed the terrorists don't exist\nIt can make your head spin a little bit and you can understand why it has been so difficult for some of our trading partners potentially to negotiate with the people who have been dispatched to negotiate on behalf of the United states\nIf they don't really know what the president wants the president is inconsistent about not only what he wants but actually what he's already been doing then that can be that could make it very difficult to make any sort of progress and you know I when I've talked with\nA business groups when I talked with business owners they have expressed a lot of concern about the the uncertainty that comes from the fact that Trump does not seem to have a particularly sophisticated understanding of international trade or clear goals for that matter about what he's trying to get out of these negotiations\nOne other item from the wall Street Journal interview and and uh one has to say it's a goal right is to put pressure on the Federal Reserve he once again called the fed chair to budget Powell ah his biggest ah economic problem I'm even as a German pal told me back in June even as the fed doesn't pay any attention with President says one does wonder if\nNow with some signs perhaps\nGerman pal told me back in June even as the fed doesn't pay any attention with President says one does wonder if now with some signs perhaps the economy might not be a all that it will be for too much longer um and the fed might be thinking about raids what does this kind of pressure you suppose due to the motive ...\nWell you know it makes a hard job even that much harder right so what that is really concerned about is how they keep the economic bull market running how to keep economic growth in and stop lung still normalizing policy because women is\nAnd we know that it will be aware and eventually the next session hits he wants to make sure that he has to look at is this fully ready to to stop\nA the slowdown is possible and that means raising short term interest rates it's a very effective tool the fed has been using it for years and they want to make sure that tools ready for the next recession\nAnd they want to do so in in a context of economic growth and so that's what's happening here very moderate increase in short term interest rates from zero rain so\nAlong that path any political ... political realization of a very moderate increase in rates makes the heart his job all the more tricky and that's what a has to be negotiated going for a port\nBill Richardson a at the end we're Jones Catherine Rampell the Washington Post on a friday I'm In New York city don't you think he ... thanks guys have a nice weekend on Wall street today down day that ended up and down weak and let me say one more time I think\nLike the fourth time this week I've said this this is normal this is what's supposed to happen markets go up to go down but it has been a while since things have felt this chopping run will ever details when we do the numbers\nIn\nIn\n\n\nMm [noise]\nAll right\nBack we're going to go to the GDP report from this morning because you know a list economic indicator and all that is Catherine and you'll and I were saying it's pretty good number credit where credit's due\nTo dig a little deeper as we want to do around here and you could start to separate what his boosting economic growth consumer spending for instance from what is not helping growth all that much at all one of those drugs last quarter was trade marketplaces Tracey Samuelson explains what's going on there\nSo how much faster with the economy have grown without this drag from trade\nYou would have seen a much larger growth rate probably closer to over five percent at the end of you know is chief us economist at ... ... what you saw was exports down pretty sharply imports were up pretty sharply\nTogether that shaped nearly two percentage points off of GDP Growth but he says imports were driven by a strong dollar which is making foreign products a good deal plus she says companies where replenishing their inventories filling up their shelves head of the holidays\nThey may also be trying to get ahead of tariffs on Chinese imports that are set to jump from ten percent to twenty five percent in the new year\nBetter to spend now and have it ready to sell rather than having to purchase more that cost more down the road\nThis macro economic data matches what we've been hearing from public companies as they report their quarterly earnings Matt McDonald is a partner with Hamilton place strategies which analyzed transcripts from recent corporate earnings calls\nThe trade discussion has ... for the first time and when they're talking about trade there almost all talking about tariffs\nFor example Ford has estimated the Trump administration's trade\nFirst time and when they're talking about trade there almost all talking about tariffs\nFor example Ford has estimated the Trump administration's trade policy will cost the company a billion dollars this year in part due to higher steel prices and tariffs on imports from China\nThat does feel like from both the way companies are talking about it and from what we see in the GDP numbers that the impact is starting to bite\n\nStreet and to the I totally did not know that folder but you know the data that gets stored up in the cloud as the saying goes well it turns out all the big tech companies Amazon Google all the big ones they back up their cloud servers on magnetic tape\nIt seems so old school right but there is a problem and it's not what the tape just two companies make the tape that a big chunk of the Internet is backed up onto and each wants the other out of the business Susan Decker who's the ... reports\nCompanies make the tape that a big chunk of the Internet is backed up onto\nAnd each wants to the other out of the business through and decker who's the ... reporter for Bloomberg walk in the program yeah how are you doing today Kay I'm well thank you are but I I I Will be completely honest and tell you that I read the story and I said they're still using tapes for cloud backup explained to me how this works\n... old school sometimes is that the storage on on a cloud obviously is just basically somebody else's server but you when you need long term archival storage you want something separated from the Internet and you want something that's going to hold massive amounts of data even more than a server and that's where the tape comes in\nAnd the experts say the tape is the medium of choice because\nIt's cheap it's good it's it's reliable and stores a heck of a lot of data\nYeah Gen cheapest important with all that data right I mean I don't even know what gets bigger than terabytes but we have a lot of them\nYeah at ... terabytes is equivalent to about a million books I'm right now a a single L T o seven linear tape can hold about Fifteen terabytes that's about Fifteen million books on one tape on one car\nCrash okay now there's a corporate store you're right there's it Sony and Fuji film or the makers of this tape that everybody now uses and we'll be using for awhile and they're sort of at loggerheads here explain what's going on\nSo there's a basic standardized technology that was developed by IBM H. P. and ... it's called the linear tape open\nThere used to be six manufacturers now there's two and those two have said oh you're using my patents in Latin at inventions and the other one says no you're using my patented inventions and each one has filed complaints at the international Trade Commission in here in Washington trying to shut the other one out of the U.S market\nCatch them courses that if there is only one supplier of this tape and we're using it tobacco basically everything that's an issue and that's\nTrying to shut the other one out of the U.S market\nPotential courses that if there is only one supplier of this tape and we're using it tobacco basically everything that's an issue\nAnd that's the concern of the hardware companies um they have filed some papers with the IT ceasing please don't shed either of them out or we want to have multiple suppliers\nUm both of them by the way our in Japan and also there are concerns about what happens if there's another earthquake what happens if there's not just an army that shuts down operations ...\nGive me the upshot of all these ah shoots encounter suits and decisions and whatnot we're dependent it seems on backing up basically the entire Internet on on just two companies trip that that seems like a challenge\nIt it is there are some older versions of the tape but the hardware companies they want the newest version they develop the standard and to put ever more stuff on these tapes so the only ones and they would either have to pay higher prices for one or they would have to use these older tapes that have less data\nIt's so interesting because you hear people say oh it's up in the cloud all the time right and you think of this ephemeral thing but it's actually really tangible a physical product\nWill think about it I mean if you have software and there's a bug that's introduced into that software that bug will go on and on and on\nBut if there's a physical version of it on tape than that bug doesn't touch the tape and that's how you can recreate it and and so you know I spoke to a number of people doing the reporting in my story and they were all saying basically this is what keeps the world's running\nWow [noise] Susan Decker she's the patents a correspondent at a Bloomberg Susan thanks a lot of pressure\nFrom the American pet products association comes to set up for this next story in two thousand Seventeen we that as Americans spend more than sixty nine billion dollars on our pets will disclosure part of that came from me about six billion of uh do give or take went for services like grooming and training which gets us\nTo the point to a series we do called my economy help people's personal economies are doing away from the big economic headlines here Hugo\nMy name's ...
