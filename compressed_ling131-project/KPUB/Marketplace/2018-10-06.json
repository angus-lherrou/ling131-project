long everybody yes\nLots of news today we get it but we are going to keep our eye on the economic ball and the ball on this Friday was the September unemployment report it was a good hundred thirty four thousand new jobs and nearly fifty year low on the unemployment rate down to three point seven percent\nSo we will start there and then merger further or bats farther afield I never get them right Catherine Rampell right for the Washington Post Neal Richardson is with Edward Jones everybody\n... so Neal it's jobs the euro and that means we're going to talk about wages uh I I Want to point out that the jobs report was actually good a little bit of a missile and the number of jobs but but people should be happy with it wages however are another thing entirely still\nAn again you know what it really didn't matter what the job's number was going to be markets for us they have that right at rages wages for the focal point and what we saw is that there was some\nThe job's number was going to be a market for those people you have that right at wages wages were the focal point\nAnd what we saw is that there was some sustained growth in wages as a little bit lower than\nThan last month that but some growth at two point eight percent it was enough growth to spark some concern in the market that this would spill over to consumer in prices and and and prompt inflation and cause the fed to tighten more aggressively than previously anticipated so even that small pickup and grow up with enough\nUh too concerned the markets about inflation and rising rates and we saw that play out in the stock market\nDoesn't let me let me pivot a little bit uh to uh well I guess a lot to crude and the president and where we stand it is some amazing to me that it was only five days ago\nThat we reached agreement or on the new NAFTA a China is still out there uh we have a store president ah who's not an armored was a multilateral institutions\nYet we have a a dynamic and strong and growing economy in the United states where do we stand on on on how things might play out\nI think it's pretty striking that we've basically spent the last year and a half alienating our friends punishing farmers and manufacturers with tariffs and counter terrorists and breaking apart the hard won alliance that we had built um [laughter]\nTo try to isolate China and we ended up in more or less the same position that we were in before which is NAFTA is still more or less in place a plus elements of of the Trans Pacific partnership which Trump had broken up or had had pulled us out um last year\nSo you know I think the best thing you can say about this deal is that it could have been a lot worse and markets clearly a breathed a sigh of relief\nThat the existing structure ah is kind of ... there are that that Trump did not break globalization\nExisting structure I is kind of ... there are that that Trump did not break globalization despite his rhetoric [laughter] suggesting that he had hoped to do so\nBut that's a good one the debris globalization Neal put on your your actual certified economists at which she put on your\nAh ... and a poet bad for me to a you know thirty five thousand foot level and talk about what cats and we're talking about this idea that we're no distinctly trying to go it alone in this global economy uh with um a politics you're being um tenuous at best in terms of being able to get things done\nAnd where things play out now for the remaining two years of the president's term abrupt for\nIt's a bumpy road ahead um what this negotiation process taught us is that even something that should have been a sure thing\nWhich is to continue on with NAFTA which is essentially what happened took a long way longer with much more drama than probably necessary and that's with the north American trade agreement right now let's look at something much more complicated that really speaks to the future of China\nAnd the development of the emerging world\nUm where we are in a negotiation in which we do have some solid um reasons for pushing forward but a China also has some solid reasons for pushing back and so as much as markets chaired\nThe continuation of NAFTA or some kind of knew named as rose that smells a sweet [laughter] um\nIt's hard to translate a U.S flow when\nIn North America with a long process with the rest of the world where China is an emerging leader and has a growing power in terms of their economic strength and the supply chains in which they are they set right in the middle of\nIn Britain wants to slow\nThere are economic strength and the supply chains in which they are they set right in the middle of\nYou to have some great launched a slow when that's a great ... I'm okay look let me let me turn to the news today because we have to acknowledge it Susan Collins declaring that she is in fact senator from Maine to choose in fact you know vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh\nJoe Manchin doing the same thing he will likely be on the Supreme Court ah come you know mother Tuesday I Want to talk for a certain Catherine about uh how broken the politics are on Washington in Washington and what that will mean for anybody's economic agenda because there are things that have to get done writer budget to have to get down there are\nSocial programs and and a four and bills and all of that stuff still has to be done ... thirty seconds to you and then to Mueller where does things where the finished it\nI I think the status quo is very troubling it's not only the regular the regularly scheduled types of tasks that you mentioned like getting budgets through for example that Congress has to manage or and and the presidency as well the executive branch as well\nUh at some point there will be a crisis and the fact that we have so much political dysfunction suggests that we're in store for a lot of policy dysfunction and when I have talked with people who are around for the last crisis\nUh ten years ago that that's the number one thing that they said that they that keeps them up at night that basically what's gonna happen when we actually need everyone to work together and come to policy conclusions that may not be a popular ones\nNewer to you quickly for sure and I just want to add on to like cats and I think just said which was you know this is occurring the ... the political dysfunction if you want to call it that it's occurring at a time where we have really strong economic health\nAre a lot of wealth being created in the economy and investors are are benefiting we're seeing some wage growth uh what happens when the economy natural\nIn the economy and investors are benefiting ...\nUh what happens when the economy naturally turns as part of a natural business cycle but that's when the government plays have raw and what we need at that point as a government that functions together for the betterment of the economy and hopefully by then look at it\nNeal Richardson at the Jones Catherine Rampell at the Washington Post thanks you too\nThanks have a nice weekend one more quick thing about the state of economic play right now especially in light of the jobs numbers this morning which\nAs you've heard but unemployment in this economy at a level not seen since Nineteen sixty nine year old that in with what's been

pointed out to David Brancaccio this morning\nThat Chris works on a bond trading floor and the people in the bond markets\nThey've got a long long memories\nPeople are really nervous Nineteen sixty nine is remembered as the beginning of the big mistake that led to Nineteen seventies inflation and particularly the older guys out there\nThey don't think dishes at all and moves and but you know what would I like to remind them as the other thing that happened in the seventies who said oil\nIncrease in price from three dollars to forty you know be the equivalent of a loyal costing four hundred dollars a barrel in ten years that might be a little inflationary to\nYeah just a bit west Texas intermediate by the way Seventy four dollars thirty four cents a barrel today that was ... to

make it as hard as possible as a deterrent for companies and and uh people to use the process that exists\nJustin ... with the society for human resources management says this is not the best time to be making work visas more difficult\nThere's more open jobs right now than Americans looking for jobs so employers are really looking for the talent they need wherever they're from so visas immigration is obviously required in that situation and in many cases\nUs immigration officials declined to be interviewed for this story but said in a press release back in August that they were committed to protecting wages and working conditions they also said the total number of visas granted met the limit of eighty five thousand set by Congress\nAre enforcing the law acne\nAnd working
