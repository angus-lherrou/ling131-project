finally reach the United states Mexico Canada agreement or us MCA\nAnd this we will have a result of much more happening right here in the United states it means\nMore than anything else far more American Jobs and these are high quality jobs they're also strong provisions to enforce what's called the rules of origin requirements this will incentivize billions of dollars in New purchases of us made automobiles\nAll right so you heard the president let's unpack this agreement a little bit new name and all we've got marketplaces Scott Tom Hi Scott\nManufacturing powerhouse uh that's the president's phrase that's what he said this new trade deal is going to create in the U.S [noise] so let's talk jobs first um east is really going to create new jobs\nAt the very least it it's unclear so it looks like automobiles auto jobs at the center of the rhetoric of everything and the and and where a lot of the jobs involved are so few simple let's say you assemble cars and trucks to sell\nHere in North America you might be Toyota or GM or BMW right now sixty two and a half percent of your content\nHas to be from Mexico where the U.S or Canada that's to avoid tariffs under the current deal or else it's taxed\nSo this new deal written after two point oh whatever yup boost that up to Seventy five percent of the ideas well let's make North American cars even more North American ... now here's the problem the problem is the sanction or the or else for you\nAll of everything and the and and we're a lot of the jobs involved are so few simple let's say you assemble cars and trucks to sell here in North America you might be Toyota or GM or BMW right now sixty two and a half percent of your content\nHas to be from Mexico or the U.S or Canada that's to avoid tariffs under the current deal or else it's taxed\nSo this new deal that and after two point oh whatever you have to set up to Seventy five percent of the ideas well let's make North American cars even more North American ... now here's the problem the problem is the sanction ready or else that you have to do these chores or else\nI take away your phone right we say that in my house while the or else here is a tariff two and a half percent so if you make cars in Mexico where it's cheaper and have a lot of auto makers dug their way out of the great recession\nYou might say well you know instead of messing with my supply chain and finding parts in Indiana where it's expensive and this bureaucratic\nI'm just going to eat the tariff of two and a half percent and since I'm non compliant anyway I might source more my parts from low cost places like China I'll just get around it so that makes for more jobs in China and more jobs in Mexico\nOr let's say OK I follow the rules I have more U.S content for more U.S suppliers that's probably going to be more expensive for my costs go up my prices go up I Can't compete I might sell fewer cars in sales go down and I lay off people so several ways this could backfire as far as jobs\nWhen we talk about jobs one of the big focus this year has been high wage jobs and there is a ... to create and protect other jobs that pay at least sixteen dollars an hour ... fit in to that\nThere's still says a large percentage vehicle has to be made my workers who makes sixteen bucks an hour or more so what companies do when we just got pushed up all sometimes yes the hiring more workers who make more money sometimes they say you know what it's time for me to invest in more software and more robust more automation to rip\nSeveral ways this could backfire as far as jobs\nWhen we talk about jobs one of the big focus this year has been high wage jobs and there is a provision in this to create and protect auto jobs that pay at least sixteen dollars an hour [laughter] what fit into\nThat so there's still says a large percentage vehicle has to be made my workers who makes sixteen bucks an hour or more\nSo what uh companies do when we just got pushed up will sometimes yes the hiring more workers who make more money\nSometimes they say you know what it's time for me to want to invest in Warsaw afterward and more robust and more automation to replace people and as the cost of worker goes up and the cost of automation goes down there is no guarantee that employers are going to respond the way we think they might well\nSo looking a little more broadly to take off all of the tariffs against Canada and Mexico you know they're not all off the table um it's a little thing what's here and what's not\nYet so right now we do have tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum those are those are announced those are in place and the justification is because of national security so Canadian steel Mexican steel still subject to that and it's more complicated but there could be similar tariffs on automobiles\nComing as well we're waiting for the Trump Administration and that that's on a separate track but for right now yeah steel tariffs are still in place in North America\nIs interested in here in D.C today what are the chances that song gets approved by Congress\nWell good luck Lucy predicting down a vote on this would come

who's chats automated manual sales and marketing tasks my qualifying leads and scheduling demos learned morning intercom dot com\nFrom the studios at Colorado Public radio in Denver today I'm Amy Scott in for Congress do It's Tuesday October seconds good to have you with us\nBefore we get to the Amazon news of the day it's worth going back to last month and a bill introduced in Congress by Senator Bernie Sanders he called it the stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidies act also known as the stop bays those act\nAs an Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos the bill would tax big companies whose employees rely on federal benefits like food stamps Medicaid or subsidized housing which is reportedly true in some states of Amazon the idea is to encourage those employers to pay higher wages\nWell Amazon announced today that as of November first it's raising its minimum wage for us employees to Fifteen dollars an hour we got Abigail Wozniak on the phone to talk about all this she's a professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame welcome to the program\nThanks for having me trying to understand the impact of this though the minimum wage in Seattle where a lot of Amazon employees live is already more than Fifteen dollars an hour\nWhat kind of employee do you think this is going to have the biggest impact on\nAmazon apparently has argued that a lot of their full time warehouse workers are fulfillment center workers are already making on average over Fifteen dollars an hour so you're right that they already have quite a large swaths of their workforce who would not be affected by this\nThey specifically mentioned part time and temporary workers ah they almost certainly will see some changes there those tend to be lower paid positions than a full time positions and they should also apply\nFifteen dollars an hour what kind of employee do you think this is going to have the biggest impact on\nSo Amazon apparently has argued that a lot of their full time warehouse workers are fulfillment center workers are already making on average over Fifteen dollars an hour so you're right that they already have quite a large swath of their workforce who would not be affected by this\nThey specifically mentioned part time and temporary workers are they almost certainly will see some changes there those tend to be lower paid positions than a full time positions\nAnd they should also apply to whole foods cashiers\nAnd average wages for cashiers in general in the whole United States was about uh about ten dollars and sixty cents so for those folks this is likely oh a raise but it's very unlikely that this is touching a large set of their core fulfillment center workers\nAmazon and its announcement also said it's going to lobby Congress to raise the federal minimum wage which is just seven twenty five an hour\nBut even without the federal wage increasing this likely puts pressure on their competitors to do the same right I mean Wal Mart only recently raised its minimum wage to eleven dollars an hour that's still a quite a bit less than Fifteen does this sort of speed up the the movement in that\nDirection really I think a skilled warehouse worker is already earning more than a cashier um so that's kind of wanting to keep in mind is that Amazon is not quite in probably exactly the same labor market as Walmart is by the same token a lot of other\nFirms are already announcing these types of bigger wage increases so for example target aside at want it to get to Fifteen by twenty twenty and Costco right in saying fourteen so I think Amazon is in some ways just keeping pace with that\nAre lots of places where Amazon has employees that have lower minimum\nHouse worker is already earning more than a cashier um so that's kind of wanting to keep in mind is that Amazon is not quite in probably exactly the same labor market\nAs Wal Mart is by the same token a lot of other firms are already announcing these types of bigger wage increases so for example it's hard to do so I didn't want it to get to Fifteen by twenty twenty and Costco right in saying fourteen so I think Amazon is in some ways just keeping pace with that\nThere are lots of places where Amazon has employees that have lower minimum wages for example Texas what kind of impact do you think this will have on communities where suddenly a lot of people are making more money certainly there are places where\nThis raise we'll have more buying power for the employees who are affected that in general should be a good thing for those local economies\nIt also does put some more pressure though on firms that might not be at a point where they are ready to pay wages that are quite that high so I think definitely watching for effects on smaller businesses on their ability to recruit and retain workers and those kind of local markets\nA would be an important thing to follow up after this announcement\nWe're going to look at how far Fifteen dollars an hour really goes for an average worker but what kind of impact do you think this could have on the larger economy Amazon has what two hundred fifty thousand employees plus another hundred thousand seasonal workers as you said a lot of them are already making at least Fifteen\nBut fewer of those employees are relying on public assistance they have more money to spend I mean do you see a macro effect from not just Amazon but this larger trend when\nPay expands for workers we have more in kind of a total wage bill that can cycle back through the economy that's good in general for growth um\nI think this could have on the larger economy Amazon has what two hundred fifty thousand employees plus another hundred thousand seasonal workers as you said a lot of them are already making at least Fifteen\nBut fewer of those employees are relying on public assistance they have more money to spend I mean do you see a macro effect from not just Amazon but this larger trend when\nPay expands for workers we have more in kind of a total wage bill that can cycle back through the economy that's good in general for growth um we also going to want to keep in mind what's happening with inflation if\nWages go up generally that's great but we have that experiencing some optics and inflation and want to kind of keep an eye on the real purchasing power of these raises for workers\nAbigail Wozniak teaches economics at Notre Dame thanks so much Thanksgiving as the professor\nAnd I were discussing Amazon isn't the only retailer raising wages and more could follow suit meanwhile more cities and states are raising their minimum pay closer to what worker advocates call a living wage\nSo what's it like to live on Fifteen dollars an hour marketplaces Renata Sago talked to some of the people who would know best Alex Harris is twenty two years old and works two part time jobs in Florida he makes sixteen dollars an hour as a community organizer and nine fifty at a fast

there's no way\nBack in Florida Alexander Saunders who works at a community center received a raise last month after a few years of making a little over Fifteen dollars an hour the twenty eight year
