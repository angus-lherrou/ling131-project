and how much we're collecting how that continuously gross\nFor some reason conservatives have managed to convince Americans that if we collect less money will have more money against all logic\nSo now everyone's and in the Republican Party saying we might have to cut entitlements because now we have this crazy deficit and more money is going to go to interest payments we can habits that everybody's told them from the beginning that this is how it was going to look\nAnd uh it's just sad that we have this kind of weird cognitive dissonance\nIt bears mentioning here enough for the first time I was

did show slower than expected growth but that's only focused on good he says spending on services went up plus wages are increasing\nWith incomes rising and the savings rate going down that's a very powerful combination for sustaining fairly strong growth of consumption\nMany economists agree with him so if it's not showing up in the data then why there's so much talk about consumption downgrade

some degree as well\nBut journalism and Facebook have a weird symbiotic relationship to publishers need Facebook to get their content out Facebook needed that content to users and a court filing this week sheds new light on a key part of that relationship the part of that has come to be called the pivot to video Microsoft wrote about it for Vanity Fair welcome to the program\nThanks for having me so back a couple of years ago April two thousand sixty and Mark Zuckerberg says we are pivoting video at Facebook and journalism to does what [laughter]\nSo back a couple of years ago April to thousands sixteen ... says we are pivoting the video at Facebook and journalism to does what\nJournalism is what that basically and\nThey say listen we have to be in this space we're going to hire a bunch of video producers and and yet now we learned through this law suits that maybe it didn't work out so well\nRight so I mean I think for publishers us was kind of a second costs fallacy they've already invested a lot of resources and Facebook are they the face but kind of eating into traffic\nSo I face looks as we're putting video\nIt's kind of like a thing where Facebook says jumping publisher I say OK how high man so they invest all these resources into doing video\nAnd then in twenty six you know twenty Seventeen you kind of saw these layoffs where entire editorial teams were being restructured to eliminate writer even higher video producer is how this happened at places like ah MTV News and having to walk it as\nMike dot com mashable you name it probably happened there\nOr so we'll get to the to the layoffs thing in a minute but uh and the reason it's germane is that very quickly after this started Facebook should wait where were these video figures aren't as impressive as we thought and now we've learned from this lawsuit this week not only were they less impressive and thought they were just flat wrong by a lot\nYeah you you have a small group of advertisers what this lawsuit basically saying that Facebook inflated the number is by in some cases allegedly up nine hundred percent so entirely different story than what we thought we were seeing with as many of you accounts [noise]\nPart of the problem here it seems to me is that nobody's chicken Facebook's a mess as it were they keep their own numbers they tell us what was going on and and media and journalism react as opposed to having some objective measure of whether or not these things are working these videos\nI mean I think that everybody there's a lot of blame to go around here right obviously Facebook is to blame but also um advertisers and publishers maybe aren't doing their own homework and aren't keeping tabs on the number\nA lot of blame to go round here right obviously Facebook is to blame but also um advertisers and publishers maybe arguing their own homework and aren't keeping tabs on the number is ... ... they should have been a seems like publishers were a little bit Katulis they were definitely desperate for new revenue stream and ah yeah they're they're definitely wasn't any checking going on here in terms of the numbers\nShow even besides the numbers though one has to point out that that publishers as you sort of mentioned they jumped right in here and they made those transitions in the newsroom people were laid off organizations were changed and or warm shorter uses word permitted um because of what Facebook should do\nYeah I mean again it was kind of a case where obviously media in dire straits and publishers are looking for new revenue sources and they see this video thing Facebook is doing and they think that this could be at\nAnd and they kind of just jumped into both eat what does Facebook have to say first of all I Know a lot it is obviously refuting the fried clams and the lawsuit right now it did um I mean obviously it took some accountability and twenty sixteen when these discrepancies kind of first ah emerge publicly\nBut I mean Facebook is kind of maintaining that that it didn't do anything wrong\nAnd we should say this matters opening and Gordon and everybody's going to have to absolutely Microsoft jak writer of the
