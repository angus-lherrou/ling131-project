ninth of October is always to have your long everybody we will get to the purple and gold\nQuestion of the day in a little bit but we're going to take a couple of the dominance themes of the day today as we get going that would be Wall Street consumer spending terrorists also the ever important idea of economic growth\nEnroll them into our lead story ready here goes Wall Street was lousy today in part because of a report that the Trump Administration is getting ready to impose taxes on the other half of everything the United states imports from China that we don't already have terrorists on but\nAnd we've got new figures on consumer spending this morning we\nStates imports from China that we don't already have terrorists on but and we've got new figures on consumer spending this morning we consumers that is spent more for the seventh straight month last month\nAnd that's indirectly I'll admit gets the marketplaces ... shore and where one imagines things go from here\nWith consumer spending more and more and more for the past seven months without wages ramping up you might wonder whether some kind of issue is going to drop\nThere's no reason to believe that if there were spending is poised for a materials slowdown\nJames Bond agrees with economic forecasting firm I just market GDP Growth was three point five percent in the third quarter faster than economists were expecting\nThe state of the consumer is pretty much the best it's been in in decades and you know that's characterized by low unemployment rising income um and then the tax cuts of course\nThis is despite slow wage growth Alan ... is an economist at UPS\nWith all these and overall income growth just because people have been putting in more hours we've been having more people being hired even though the wages for individuals have been going up rather modestly they're starting to pick up for now\nAs long as jobs keep getting created consumer spending should be strong so what might threaten jobs well tariffs for one\nOver the next six months or so it's likely that we will see some flowing in employment and income as firms take a wait and see attitude on the tariffs and the tariffs slowly by and on the economy start re priced\nStill ... expects that to be temporary some firms will suffer some will fail others will adapt Richard ... is an economist with Wells Fargo and company he says there's a threat to employment and spending closer to home\nWe've got growing headwinds in the form of higher interest rates are reservists raised with great several times over the past years\nAnd if those rates continue to go up that could be it\nThat lives in the form of higher interest rates are reserved has raised with great several times over the past years\nAnd if those rates continue to go up that could be a drag on home sales in auto loans next year in New York I'm Rebecca shore for marketplace once upon a time IBM stood for international business machines but somebody hasn't made any actual machines in years since he got rid of its hardware divisions it's been selling to things to business customers\nSoftware and services and today the company took another big step in that direction big blue is spending thirty four billion dollars\nTo acquire the open source software and cloud computing from red hat it is the biggest acquisition IBM's ever made\nA bet on the big market for cloud computing marketplaces ... has that one\nWe all know there are different types of clouds in the sky right strategies clouds are closer to the ground in serious clouds are way up there will cause for data work the same way companies put some info and servers far away but not all of it came forest at Fort pitch capital says sometimes you need the info lightning quick\nIt was over in China over in Europe you don't know where the cloud really is all that back and forth takes too long so you have to have stuff close to you like the guy to your business\nHaving some clouds close in some far is called hybrid cloud that requires the different clubs to talk to one another and red hat make software to do that it's a big reason IBM bought the company together redhead and IBM hope to take on the big big boys in cloud computing Amazon and Microsoft has Chris gardener at Forrester Research\nThis is a a proactive approach to say look we don't want to be in their shadow when it comes to go out we want to be the first one player\nIBM hasn't been first that much lately Michael ... what the Sloan School of management at MIT says big blue came late to mobile computing and then the cloud now it's trying to catch up\nYou know it's still an important company but it's not a growth company\nTo mobile computing and then the cloud now it's trying to catch up\nYou know doing important company but it's not a growth company anymore it's a shrinking company the big challenge for the c._e._o. JD rom it is to figure out how to grow again\nThis is a pricey batch thirty four billion dollars for red hat is sixty three percent more than what the market thought the company was worth on friday I'm Scott Tong for marketplace\nAs I said speaking of markets Wall Street was lousy today not as lousy as it could have been though will have the details when we do the numbers [noise]\n\nHere's a story about getting what you pay for or more accurately getting what you don't pay for you don't have to spend a lot of time driving around almost anywhere in this country\nTo know that our infrastructure our road specifically are in bad shape typically the money to maintain and sometimes even improve those roads comes from gas taxes California is one of several states that increased it gas tax not too long ago to get more money\nTo make more repairs but as often happens with new taxes not everybody is happy about 'em and they have taken to the ballot with the anti tax proposition six coming to California voters a week from tomorrow\nBut as much Jed Kim reports now from the streets of LA changes in what kinds of cars are on the road might make a real gas tax difference\nHe line Lippmann has brought me to the corner of Venice in ... in downtown LA\nIt's next to the convention center people center\nAnd I would highway highway yeah the one way or I didn't hear the noise coming through I'm\nLiving in is with the transportation organization called LA\nHe's against proposition six because he says the gas tax is necessary\nPoints out the ...\nThe transportation organization called ... LA\nHe's against proposition six because he says the gas tax is necessary\nPoints out the ... in the paper\nYou got a big fire a couple of big bottles here\nLipman says the state has a backlog of a hundred thirty billion dollars in infrastructure investment in roads and bridges\nRoads that are less safe bridges that are less safe\nAnd we are art investing in the states and the way that we need [noise]\nLast year California legislators decided to patch that hundred thirty billion dollar hole\nBy raising the state's tax on gasoline from Eighteen cents a gallon to thirty cents\nAlmost immediately a group formed to put forward proposition six to overturn the increase and require all future hikes to be approved by voters rather than legislators\nCalled the ... is chairman of the yes on prop six campaign he blames the poor infrastructure situation on mismanagement politicians have more than enough money to fix the roads they just keep diverting the money\nSo we don't need to add the cost of living burdens to working families to fix roads they should be putting the existing gas tax into roads rather than increasing it\nBut even if the gas tax word stay the same it wouldn't be able to keep up with the demands for one thing these Texas haven't been indexed to inflation\nAnother reason to be seen directly across that street\nIn downtown LA at a Honda dealership\nIts windows advertise hybrids another fuel efficient cars\nKrista Ghouta is out on the law joking with other salesmen\nI ask him how many people come in looking for good mileage most of it that\nTank got nine customers coming for the end of the of course they look in a way to get\nAnd they're fighting it some vehicles top out it over fifty\nMiles to the gallon for people maybe\nHad to buy you know five gallons of gas to go a hundred miles now maybe they\nMiles to the gallon before people maybe\nHad to buy you know five gallons of gas to go a hundred miles now maybe they got by four gallons of gas\n... winds dean ... researches transportation finance at San jose State University\nAnd as a result they're paying less in gas taxes and they were previously\nDo you know ... or one two three four uh four or five like minded shoulders and screams all the ... of course I'm with this phone you can or the best guess is would you regret\nThat's true of course I'm with this and you can or the best guess as I said you regret\nThe way that the the building is designed is the the the basketball courts are at the center of the building and when you know when you hear the basketball's it's kind of like the heartbeat of the building and um so now we're walking as if oh so there you go you know we are one of the players\nSo you're waiting rooms with the training room right of course are over there the beautiful weight rooms and drove so this is a big boom you're supposed to start asking questions but I'm going to cause it's like this is the heart of the players right this is where the rubber meets the road um so what keeps you up at night but what's your worst [laughter]\nMy ... my the thing that keeps me up right now is that the the greatest player in the NBA LeBron James decided to come join us\nAnd and be part of what we're building and we've missed the playoffs every year for five years so this is not what the brand was meant to be and that's what what\nAre fans deserve to be back to what they're used to it in terms of Lakers basketball having the best player has brought us back it's it's it's elevated the brand now we just need to do that on there\nI I don't necessarily expect you to answer this question but it kind of have to ask you a little brown and ... and Magic Johnson drug for basketball and and you know ... and the other best brokerage of you guys had the conversation on yourself about look\nThis isn't going to be rebuilding\nUm yeah you you know yes I mean magic has definitely has a plan as to what we're doing you know when when magic came in and took over basketball operations what I felt was and why I had to make the ...\nWhat we're doing you know when when magic came in and took over basketball operations what I felt was and why I had to make the change from our existing general manager and my brother Jim who oversaw basketball was that there was no identity of Laker basketball\nThey're really interesting 'cause liquor basketball's like a brand name\nExactly and and you can't establish anything when you're changing coaches every eight months so we had three coaches and three years\nYou know and each one a great coach in themselves but you can't change your roster overnight and so the ... everything was not matched up right and we were struggling with no identity\nSo this goes to something which are more complex all the time you were in ... and and not only does regular business with them through new show true to the sports business in sports teams and the woman running loose forced to write uncertainty was going\nWas killing the brand and it was you know when my father passed away than commissioner David Stern called me and he said\nJeannie don't let the team fail like don't let go do run into the ground losing the oh yeah you know up to like\nIt it would you break your dad's heart and so you know and it was difficult because I wasn't in charge of basketball my brother was and I ask him how long is it going to take you to get the team on track and he gave himself a timeline which\nAs as time went on I realized it wasn't going to happen and that's why I had to make the change that I did but I you know I took that to heart and I wouldn't I wouldn't let this you know my dad had six kids and I think the Lakers were his favorite kid [laughter] people ask me [laughter]\nMy dad had six kids and I think the Lakers were his favorite kitt [laughter] on the last\nWord here about your family right I mean Dr closer to your brother who work with and then and then had to replace\nYou talk a lot you talked about it in your book you talked about it in interviews about how this is a family business [laughter] show those first couple of years when the commercial read culture and says don't blow it with a family business and then you have to file your brother what's that was\nIt was very very difficult um\nYou know my dad kinda set it up for us but ultimately he gave me the authority and the power\nTo make any changes that I saw a necessary one of the key components of that decision making process was a conversation I had with Kobe Bryant he said what a player\nAn all star player who's you know a free agent is going to look at an organization and how it operates and making sure that there's somebody in charge who has authority to accomplish what the goals are\nMeaning you've got you've got to get the organization in the right position before anybody will consider\nInvesting his career in what you're doing right now nobody knows what you guys stand for\nSort of becomes a poke in the question about it and making the change from prior management and your brother you should wear the number of years did you wait too long\nThat was the my first comment publicly was I Apologize to Laker fans because ... perhaps I did wait too long\nUm as you can hear the music or early ... it's it's funny because we actually have a DJ now on staff you know because yeah it's like these young players they they're used to multitasking there used to having music\nWhile they're doing whatever let me show you\nBecause yeah it's like these young players they they're used to multi tasking there used to having music while they're doing whatever\nLet me show you don't get out of your [noise] it's good to know your way around the wrong way\nOkay this is my ... one and I mean actually this is the trophy room I just happened on my desk in here and so I don't ever\nGoing to be this close to them to be a tribute to probe that's cool it's seven\nSo that the reason you know it it was important the trophies were displayed so that the players ... ... this is the inspiration\nAnd we overlook record and if they look up here they will see these trophies hanging around\nNow here's a great feature wow or me\nIs that are actually ... have the balcony\nThis is nice right after we got here is just going to watch this work yup that the war room old our that we were the
