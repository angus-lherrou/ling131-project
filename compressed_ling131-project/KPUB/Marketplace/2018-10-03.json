studios at Colorado Public radio in Denver today I'm Amy Scott in for Congress do It's Tuesday October seconds good to have you with us\nBefore we get to the Amazon news of the day it's worth going back to last month and a bill introduced in Congress by Senator Bernie Sanders he called it the stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidies act also known as the stop bays those act\nAs an Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos the bill would tax big companies whose employees rely on federal benefits like food stamps Medicaid or subsidized housing which is reportedly true in some states of Amazon\nThe idea is to encourage those employers to pay higher wages well Amazon announced today that as of November first it's raising its minimum wage for us employees to Fifteen dollars an hour we got Abigail Wozniak on the phone to talk about all this\nShe's a professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame welcome to the program\nThanks for having me trying to understand the impact of this though the minimum wage in Seattle where a lot of Amazon employees live is already more than Fifteen dollars an hour [noise]\nWhat kind of employee do you think this is going to have the biggest impact on\nAmazon apparently has argued that a lot of their full time warehouse workers are fulfillment center workers are already making on average over Fifteen dollars an hour so you're right that they already have quite a large swath of their workforce who would not be affected by this they specifically mentioned part time\nThanks for having me trying to understand the impact of this though the minimum wage in Seattle where a lot of Amazon employees live is already more than Fifteen dollars an hour what kind of employee do you think this is going to have the biggest impact on\nSo Amazon apparently has argued that a lot of their full time warehouse workers are fulfillment center workers are already making on average over Fifteen dollars an hour so you're right that they already have quite a large swath of their workforce who would not be affected by this\nThey specifically mentioned part-time temporary workers are they almost certainly will see some changes there those tend to be lower paid positions than a full time positions\nAnd they should also apply to whole foods cashiers\nAnd average wages for cashiers in general in the whole United States was about uh about ten dollars and sixty cents so for those folks this is likely a a raise but it's very unlikely that this is touching a large set of their core fulfillment center workers\nAmazon and its announcement also said it's going to lobby Congress to raise the federal minimum wage which is just seven twenty five an hour but even without the federal wage increasing this likely puts pressure on their competitors to do the same right I mean Wal Mart only recently raised its minimum wage to eleven dollars an hour\nThat's still a quite a bit less than Fifteen does this sort of speed up the the movement in that direction\nI think a skilled warehouse worker is already earning more than a cashier um so that's kind of wanting to keep in mind is that Amazon is not quite in probably exactly the same labor market as\nWal Mart is by the same token a lot of other firms are already announcing these types of bigger wage increases so for example targeted aside at wanting to get to Fifteen by twenty twenty and Costco right in saying fourteen\nAnd our that's still a quite a bit less than Fifteen does this sort of speed up the the movement in that\nDirection really I think a skilled warehouse worker is already earning more than a cashier\nUm so that's kind of wanting to keep in mind is that Amazon is not quite in probably exactly the same labor market\nAs Walmart is by the same token a lot of other firms are already announcing these types of vigor wage increases so for example targeted aside at want it to get to Fifteen by twenty twenty and Costco right in saying fourteen so I think Amazon is in some ways just keeping pace with that\nThere are lots of places where Amazon has employees that have lower minimum wages for example Texas what kind of impact do you think this will have on communities where suddenly a lot of people are making more money\nCertainly there are places where this raise we'll have more buying power for the employees who are affected that in general should be a good thing for those local economies\nIt also does put some more pressure though on firms that might not be at a point where they are ready to pay wages that are quite that high so I think definitely watching for effects on smaller businesses\nOn their ability to recruit and retain workers and those kind of local markets\nA would be an important thing to follow up after this announcement\nWe're going to look at how far are Fifteen dollars an hour really goes for an average worker but what kind of impact do you think this could have on the larger economy Amazon has what two hundred and fifty thousand employees plus another hundred thousand seasonal workers as you said a lot of them are already making at least Fifteen\nBut fewer of those employees are relying on public assistance they have more money to spend I mean do you see a macro effect from not just Amazon but this larger trend\nWhen pay expand\nPardon thing to follow up after this announcement we're going to look at how far are Fifteen dollars an hour really goes for an average worker but what kind of impact do you think this could have on the larger economy\nAmazon has what two hundred and fifty thousand employees plus another hundred thousand seasonal workers as you said a lot of them are already making at least Fifteen\nBut fewer of those employees are relying on public assistance they have more money to spend I mean do you see a macro effect from not just Amazon but this larger trend when\nPay expands for workers we have more in kind of a total wage bill that can cycle back through the economy that's good in general for growth um we also going to want to keep in mind what's happening with inflation if\nWages go up generally that's great but we have been experiencing some optics and inflation and want to kind of keep an eye on the real purchasing power of these raises for workers\nAbigail Wozniak teaches economics at Notre Dame thanks so much Thanksgiving\nAs the professor and I were discussing Amazon isn't the only retailer raising wages and more could follow suit\nMeanwhile more cities and states are raising their minimum pay closer to what worker advocates call a living wage\nSo what's it like to live on Fifteen dollars an hour marketplaces Renata Sago talked to some of the people who would know best Alex Harris is twenty two years old and works two part time jobs in Florida he makes sixteen dollars an hour as a community organizer and nine fifty at a fast food chain\nHe says he's able to pay his bills and bus fare but earning Fifteen dollars an hour full time with health benefits

Peterson is forty two years old and lives in Utah she's made Fifteen dollars in the past working odd jobs and said she was able to manage as a single woman now that she lives with her husband and his raising two kids she relies on renting out rooms in her home and her parents chip and money\nIf we hadn't bought this house when we did we wouldn't be able to survive on Fifteen dollars an hour there's no way\nBack in Florida Alexander Saunders who works at a community center received a raise last month after a few years of making a little over Fifteen dollars an hour the twenty eight year old credits that wage with and being able to pay off his debts\nI actually just paid off last year at a car loan\nBut he says he wouldn't have been able to do that if he hadn't been living with three roommates\nSplitting rent some was enormous all\nWhile cities like New York Los Angeles in Seattle are mandating Fifteen dollar an hour wages the fight for Fifteen as it's known continues and now

from it costs a lot um\nSo many of these projects are mainly funded by the federal government particularly the Army Corps of engineers and FEMA in total cumulatively the U.S has been about nine billion dollars to rebuild beaches since Nineteen twenty three\nAnd when we looked at the north Carolina data after Hurricane Florence we found that in that state alone federal state and local governments have spent more than eight hundred and twenty eight million dollars cumulatively for those beaches\nWow and what is the argument for spending that money\nSo the local residents would argue that they need that money to keep their tourism economy going to keep their properties up\nAnd that you know people from all over the country coming enjoy these beaches so the government should help fund their economies the people who benefit the most from these projects are actually the property owners of ocean front properties\nSo these tend to be the second homes or vacation homes oftentimes they're very large a pricey mansions right along the beach they're the ones who get most of the benefit from these projects\nWhy is that who decides which beaches to protect in which to leave

who get most of the benefit from these projects\nWhy is that who decides which beaches to protect in which to leave alone\nThat this is sort of decided on a case by case basis some communities actually fund most of this work themselves through local and county taxes and so in that case the federal government isn't really involved\nBut for many communities it's the Army Corps that decides a which communities get funded and the way the Army Corps makes these decisions\nThey are using an economic formula that ends up favoring more affluent communities and the reason that is is that the corps tries to see\nWhich projects can they find where they'll get the most out of every dollar spent so in essence it ends up favoring more affluent communities\nAnd not just affluent but predominantly white right\nYes um so the analysis we did in North Carolina we looked at about sixteen communities that have received funding for these projects and the average uh demographics in those communities with something like Ninety four percent white\nAnd you found that the effect is that they're the same beaches just keep getting rebuilt over and over again can you talk about an example

Morgan Chase security guy minister cars up to the forty eighth floor where we called our heels for a little bit waiting for Jamie diamond that's on us we were early\nSo we had a chance to poke around a little bit lots of sports memorabilia on the shelf business and management books to interestingly enough bank history stuff as well diamond showed up pretty much on time we did the usual chitchat as we got settled talked about how we got into banking he's the son and grandson of stockbrokers by the way and then we got down to it\nDo you think um\nPeople understand banks in this economy like you understood banks when you were to\nSome people are saying banks as a consumer so you know if you've taken a mortgage rubber checking account you have a business need alone if you're a large corporation you have to show equity your debt that you understand they don't necessarily see the inner workings of a bank does it matter what\nIn management books to interestingly enough bank history stuff as well diamond showed up pretty much on time we did the usual chitchat as we got settled talked about how we got into banking he's the son and grandson of stockbrokers by the way and then we got down to it\nDo you think um\nPeople understand banks in this economy like you understood banks when you were a kid\nI sometimes people those same things as a consumer so you know if you've taken a mortgage you have a checking account you have a business need alone if you're a large corporation you have to sell equity your debt that they understand they don't necessarily see in the inner workings of a bank\nDoes it matter what does to me but I don't I don't think should matter the customer now with the customer wants to do a good experience and you know good credit card and a good yeah\nYeah but does it matter whether American consumers understand the way the financial system works\nI think it I think it matters to understand how business in general works so if you don't have a financial system you don't have an economy\nSo defenses which is part of his great economy in America has the widest deepest most transparent financial markets world's ever seen in total I'm including private equity venture capital\nThe formation of business the transparency of our capital markets and no other country the world has it is not even close is kind of it's kind of a part of the engine that makes us the most prosperous economy in the world\nYou come to that we just come to that not without some scars right and we'll get to the crisis or a little bit later on but but what do you think um the financial sectors role in this society is what is the banks responsibility in this society\nI think the most important thing is you help grow a prosperous economy that helps the most people and they create the wealth by which you could take care of your old you're sick you're poor and so I I think people should have said that you need a healthy banking system my daughter asked me and their financial crisis\nYou know what's your financial crisis it was a card that happens every seven to ten years I wasn't being facetious I was looking at Nineteen Seventy four Nineteen eighty two Nineteen eighty seven Nineteen Ninety and ... and one of things that makes me cautious is\nBut what do you think um the financial sectors role in this society is what is the banks responsibility in this society\nI think the most important thing is you help grow a prosperous economy that helps the most people and they create the wealth by which you could take care of your old you're sick you're poor and so I I think people should understand that you need a healthy banking system my daughter asked me in their financial crisis\nYou know what's your financial crises that was a kind of didn't happen to be seven to ten years\nI wasn't being facetious I was looking at Nineteen Seventy four Nineteen eighty two Nineteen eighty seven Nineteen Ninety\nAnd ... and one of things that makes me cautious as knowing all that I always always always wanted to run the bank that we can survive anything show that were there in good times and bad times and more more important in bad times for clients\nAnd we took the major risk and we bought three hundred billion of assets you know the Federal Reserve financed a very small part of it not rush for themselves because it's just a bridge too far for us and they took the the high grade mortgages we took the low grade mortgages\nIt just it just was a bridge too far and yes it helping company Bush is funny because it was the first French and Louis came and then one of the game you know we thought at that time\nHank Paulson me a bunch of people\n... Tim guy an old thought that that could be holding the type that we got to stop we were wrong because as it turned out there was a succession of failures after that are ... didn't common name and number is the biggest financial series of all time with Fannie and Freddie which were government designed run your goals\nHey I was still dealing with by the way fending for exactly ...\nThe low grade mortgages it just it just was a bridge too far and yes it helping company budget is funny because it was the first French and Louis game and then one of the game you know we thought at that time\nHank Paulson me a bunch of other people\n... Tim guy all thought that that could be holding the type that we gotta stop we were wrong because as it turned out there was a succession of failures after that are ... didn't comment in lemon number is the biggest financial series of all time with Fannie and Freddie which were government designed run your goals\nHey I just still dealing with by the way fending for exactly what they did a I G afterwards hundreds of mortgage brokers went bankrupt so yeah it's it was ... I Would have bought ... because even though we paid an extra price that we\nDidn't think we should have paid it put us into all so many places I've forgotten number of how many branches we got but in those days you got the one down the street from my house where I bank I mean right and which country you're in California we've gone from seven or branches to a thousand I think it was a fabulous platform for Jake more to grow so I still would have done that one\nAre you satisfied that um we have the protections in place now\nTo avoid something like that happening again you know you should never be satisfied and I are more explained that ... ... regularly should I say they really should be happy and take a victory lap I gave you just do leeman redux\nIt wouldn't happen they would have had not twenty below the capital but fifty but because of the regulation yeah sort of play they would have had a lot more liquidity a lot more transparency if it did go bankrupt at the moment of bankruptcy it would have created another hundred billion dollars of equity in the most over cap wise for him in the world\nThe government can run it and do whatever they want that but I think it was an orderly unwind yeah but ... it was a disorderly unwind assets were thrown people couldn't get their cash markets we're going to collapse because they had to sell assets\nThat was ... so the capital liquidate the banking system is stronger\nBut what do I used to look at risk I I don't just guess where the future\nThey had not twenty below the capital but fifty because of the regulation yeah sort of play they would have had a lot more liquidity a lot more transparency if it did go bankrupt at the moment of bankruptcy it would have created another hundred billion dollars of equity than most over cap wise for him in the world\nThe government can run it and do whatever they want that but I think it was an orderly unwind yeah but ... it was a ... or to unwind assets were thrown people couldn't get their cash markets we're going to collapse because they had to sell assets\nThat was ... so the capital liquidate the banking system is stronger but with the way you look at risk I I don't just guess what the future as I say what is the worst could possibly be and can we handle it and to me family means I can still serve my client does not mean to have to run in panic\nBut not always be quite as that question where's the next problem coming from it will be different from the last problem cyberattacks on other institutions clearing houses and I'm not worried about shadow banking but they're always going to be issued a shadow banking so if you're a regulator you should be really cautious about what's happening in a way from banks\nAre you worried about you know given all that cyber and all of that are you worried about um the fed and its actions are and are you worried about a politicians and them stepping up\nYou know I'm not worried about both we planned for both not being exactly the way we expect it so I think the fed is doing the right thing and raising rates the economy is quite strong\nAnd they just think it was just normalizing it but you know is it possible that down the road something happens too much inflation if that's going to move quicker that's possible so I'm not predicting it but my and my company could easily handle it but it is possible just likes them just like\nThe terrorists can cause problems that you don't anticipate today just like cyber can cause problems just like James it can cause problems I mean you always gotta be looking to figure out and make sure you can handle bad outcomes\nJumping ahead of my list of questions because I Want to get to ... but that look let me back you up\nDoing the right thing and raising rates the economy is quite strong\nAnd they just think it was just normalizing it but you know is it possible that down the road something happens too much inflation if that's going to move quicker that's possible so I'm not predicting it but my and my company could easily handle it but it is possible just likes them just like\nThe terrorists can cause problems that you don't anticipate today just like cyber can cause problems just like James it can cause problems I mean you always got to be looking to figure out and make sure you can handle bad outcomes\n... jumping ahead of my list of questions because I Want to get to a terrorist in a second but the money back you up for a minute on the healthy economy and I'm not going to argue that the headline facts right jobs GDP all of that good stuff\nBut as you said are on the forty whatever it is Florida this building looking out ... literally yet at the American economy there's income inequality there's wage stagnation which has just recently started to pick up and I mean there are some non small problems yeah\nSo the American public's understand that this is the most prosperous economy world's ever seen you have to wait I'm not I I Want to but the good in the back yard so the good as we have wonderful neighbors in Canada and Mexico\nAre we've got all all of the food water and energy we need\nWe have or what the founding fathers gave a freedom of religion and freedom of speech and freedom of enterprise the best universities that why is the capital markets and yes income inequality the real issue and we studied it and they're fixes to hurt the economy has been going in Munich early and it's ... it and it was driving low wage growth less small business formation\nAnd all these other things that we need to fix okay but look at the end or fix the American public you know everything we talk about their or fixes for be put her mind to it\nAnd kind of dropped a Democrat or Republican view of it all\nI appreciate the positivity generally I Do if there was some reality are right we have serious problems with many other countries in this global economy we are pulling back from the international arena the president said in the at the un across town a couple of days ago it is America First right\nFixes to it the economy's been going in Munich early and ... and it was driving low wage growth less small business formation and all these other things that we need to fix okay but law and the architects of the American public will do everything we talk about their or fixes for we put our minds to it and kind of dropped a Democrat or Republican view of it all I appreciate the positivity generally I Do some\nReality are right we have serious problems with many other countries in this global economy we are pulling back from the international arena the president said at the at the un across town a couple of days ago it is America First right so\nDo you reconcile that with what you call for and your letter which is intelligent thoughtful analytical and comprehensive policy\nWhere we are so we have we're slipping a bit so that we have not had war with Canada and Mexico says Eighteen forty eight\nMexico's extant quite well and we should treat them very respectfully but you're absolutely correct this trade issue a medical a skirmish\nYeah yeah and it will so what people are afraid about is that it will get worse into what we call trade what so what do you see that it's going to make it not get worse from a skirmish does it sure doesn't look like anybody's back into\nThat look we devised a president that while you were young while you were you\nYeah we have and I know lots of us have done it and I'm most was said that we understand that you should uh China and he's right\nNon tariff barriers tariff barriers will property all intellectual property owned enterprises subsidies et cetera I'm hoping the other day that President succeeds him where he wants to do and I say hey you know your method worked\nI'm just worried that the method can cause more problems so she'll put on your your most objective Jamie\nDiamonds self here for a second an answer this question or is it possible that you have too much power in this economy you\nDon't think so I mean there are all in a lot of leverage zero or twenty eight million companies in America\nI mean you know we we are one actor of many in this economy into a lot of other big banks still on the I I'm going to be competing with the Chinese banks\nActual properties down enterprises subsidies et cetera I'm hoping the other day that President succeeds him where he wants to do and I say hey you know your method worked I'm just worried that the method can cause more problems so she'll put on your your most objective Jamie diamonds self here for a second an answer this question or is it possible that you have too much power in this economy you\nI don't think so I mean there are enjoying a lot of leverage zero or twenty eight million companies in America\nI mean you know we we are one actor of many in this economy and a lot of other big banks still on the I I'm going to become the window of the Chinese banks folks I I don't say that lightly\nThey they are already they have a bigger home market they make more money to were worth more in the market value\nThere's so many Chinese banks make more money than we do they have aspirations and they showed their going overseas and they showed their find their Chinese companies overseas and they should and they will be competing with us in a lot of things we also proud to compete one day with alley pay and we chat ten cent and\nSo I I look at the world on this ... this is Graham say no we're gonna have competitors I Want J. P. Morgan Chase me the best bank in the world I wanted to be an American bank\nAnd it would I think it'd be a mistake for America the best things in the world and the biggest banks in the world were Chinese banks well so here's actually a good phone question do we as an economy\nOr get the benefit of your size that makes it worth the risk of you being so big\nYes because remember scale economy is not true for banks is true for auto companies are true for law industries the beneficiary of skill of economics is to clients that it's not the company because capitalism\nForces to return to the company lower uh and and also our size and diversity it's why we had no issue to the store [noise] there was a whole lot more to that interview of course Jamie diamond on the next crisis for one thing we've got the transcript online it's on a corner office podcast as well also at marketplace\nYes because remember scale economy that is true for banks a trooper auto companies are true for ... industries the beneficiary of skill of economics is declined\nIt it's not the company because capitalism\nForces to return to the company lower our and and also our size and diversity is why we had no issues to distort [noise]\nThere was a whole lot more to that interview of course Jamie diamond on the next crisis for one thing we've got the transcript online it's on our corner office podcast as well also that marketplace dot org whether a cyberattack could actually cause the next financial crisis [noise]\n\nThis final note on the way out today in which I rise on behalf of all New Yorkers grew up there by the way to protest the bomb a nation that apple is calling a bagel and a new set of ... that it's coming out with the next Iowa's update whatever that\nWonder bread looking smoothed crusted frozen food section clearly never touched by human hands too perfect round thing with a hole in it is\nIt is not a bagel and those are also and this just in from the marketplace desk of shameless self promotion Molly Wood and I are doing a rented AMA tomorrow she the host of marketplace tech me those cheer us together on a podcast called make me smart\nAnyway ask us anything I guess we gotta say tomorrow to be on the eastern eliminating Pacific I mean I Am a sub read it\nAsked me about the new bagel among gee maybe how about that\n[noise]\n\nMarketplaces supported by progressive insurance comparing car insurance rates from multiple insurers ...\nAre doing a reading AMA tomorrow she the host of marketplace tech me those fear us together on a podcast called making smart anyway ask us anything I guess we gotta say tomorrow to be on the eastern eliminating Pacific on the I Am a sub Reddit asked me about the new big limo gee maybe how about that [noise]\nMarketplaces supportive progressive insurance comparing car insurance rates from multiple insurers so shoppers can evaluate options in one place now that's progressive comparisons available at progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive\nTen ... bourbon handcrafted in small batches for a full flavored sipping experienced forty seven percent alcohol by volume unless you Craig Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey barge town\nKentucky think wisely drink wisely and by Charles Schwab ... leads a modern approach to wealth management starts with asking questions Charles Schwab on your tomorrow learn more ... dot com\nOr we got to go down just rose up fifty four points to death about two tenths present that go up twenty five points three times presented\nAs be five hundred two points to be good basically flat ...\n...
