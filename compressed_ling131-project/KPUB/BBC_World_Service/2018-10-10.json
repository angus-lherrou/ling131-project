sets across the the timescale of the year that's right so each game as a a month that's sort of like building chapters out as you're writing a novel and now that we've got the whole arc of the game figure it out we can just go back and knowing what the end is like we can try to make all the game kind of reinforce that ending\nSo this whole with tens of thousands of people in it will clues and some real work will begin what happens tonight\nTonight the very important part of our developing process we're going to be meeting up with some place that they're in a conference room in a hotel at some secret location or playing through these in three and I'll be watching it with a notepad in hand\nReally seeing how the out of the box experience works how their first games where\nAnd I'll be doing that for about twelve hours over the weekend I'm at the Knight it's going to be two couples for player game we recruited them off the Internet using Twitter on those people I Do not know I've never met\nGet a lot of submissions were very fortunate in that regard\nSo you're kind of like an old tired and you will know tighten your belt and seeing how much what\nI Would say I'm not an empire I'm more like an anthropologist because I I Want to be observing but not influencing as much as possible as part of the reason why we do video as well because I'm not in the room whenever I'm In the room there's an effect\nBut I get such a rich data being in a room sometimes I Do that as well\nSo I just try to be applying the walls and try not to interfere as much as possible\nThere's almost a scientific discipline that you go back the results of your experiment that's very true yeah I mean I basically tell them right from the beginning I'm not going to answer that question unless they get really suck\nI Would say I'm not an empire I'm more like an anthropologist because I I Want to be observing but not influencing as much as possible as part of the reason why we just video as well because I'm not in the room whenever I'm In the room there's an effect\nBut I get such a rich data being in there and sometimes I Do that as well\nSo I just try to be applying the walls and try not to interfere as much as possible\nAs long as the scientific discipline that he doesn't want to back the results of your experiments that's very true yeah I mean I basically tell them right from the beginning I'm not going to answer their questions unless they get really stuck\nI don't want to interfere 'cause they can't ship me in the box I rely on the real fat and that's where we find out where the holes in the rules are\nAnd the creation of those rules is an international business world does he I came on both to code is only on the late to legacy ... pandemic\nRules are always tough because when you learn a game you want to get into the game right away so you don't want a lot of rules and then you get stuck in the middle and you need something very precisely you're trying to write a book that's full\nCasual and breezy but oddly specific at the same time\nOne of the things that helps us is\nA this game is translated into a lot of languages including German which is a very precise language so we will finish our rule book we'll send it off the translation and we will get dozens of questions from the German translator about where English has been incredibly sloppy or have to meanings\nIf we have time we always go back to the English rules and rewrite them based on all of these questions and really get that precision that only comes from having someone have to word by word translated into a more precise language\nWas asked languages from other countries filtering back in the whole game design\nYeah in their culture and the language of other countries all if you're doing is going to be globally all affected in some way I mean you'd like in Germany you can't put a tank on the cover of a game\nIf not if it might be illegal but it certainly heavily frowned upon\nWhere English has been incredibly sloppy or have to meanings if we have time we always go back to the English rules and rewrite them based on all of these questions and really get that precision that only comes from having someone have to word by word translated into a more precise language\nWill dots languages from other countries so turned back into your game design\nYeah in their culture and the language of other countries all if you're doing is going to be well they all affected in some way I mean you'd like in Germany you can't put a tank on the cover of a game\nIf not it might be illegal but it certainly heavily frowned upon and put that on a cover you just won't sell it and Germany so it you think of the culture you have to think of the language you have to think of how people played\nSo at least that kind of postal German fatigue with combat games and things like that did not feed into the creation of cooperative games like that it fit into\nWhat were called German games in the nineties and then Europe games which was this interesting thing because of the post war fatigue and cultural sort of a version to direct conflict they had to design games where you really didn't take anything from anyone else and said you sort of passively aggressively\nGot in a place where they wanted to be so if there's one space and we can only you can have your person there I can and I get there first I technically I've been taking anything from you know I just prevented you from getting some things\nWhich on the surface is is both the same in very different but it led to a whole other way of thinking about board games like what if we were all just racing to do better\nAnd there's been this blossoming of game design over the past Twenty years just from the post war aversion to direct conflict\nThere ah probably around five hundred game developers gemstone [noise] selling gangs of everything you can imagine titles about SPN oh ... ... ... creations of

and we're not only talking this is about creating change on the ground\nAnd if we look at the at the changes that we have made so far let me give you an example then assess a T of interfaith marriages today\nMuslim women cannot marry outside the faith unless the men converts to Islam unless you are cultural muscle and when you do not\nReally practice um so this is actually an acute dilemma and we have couples coming from Norway Sweden Denmark and friends even UK to get married in the mosque because we are able to serve them and we are\n... the Koran with a focus on gender equality allowing women to marry non Muslims\nIn Tunisia they change the law last year in December Seventeen so now it's also legally possible to marry outside Islam for a woman it has always been that possibility for the men because they've stated clearly in the Koran that a muffin man can marry a Jew or Christian or non Muslim\nThis is actually an acute dilemma and we have couples coming from Norway Sweden Denmark and friends even you'll pay to get married and then my mosque because we are able to serve them and we are maybe the Koran with a focus on gender equality allowing less than women to marry non Muslims\nIn Tunisia they change the law last year in December Seventeen so now it's also legally possible to marry outside Islam for a woman it has always been a possibility for the men because they've stated clearly in the Koran that a muffin man can marry a Jew or Christian or non Muslim\nBut the the other said it's not stay the candy but he does not stated either that a woman comment so we use that as already Timothy\nBut you go to another problem there are many people in Denmark a politicians of the rights in the far right secularists those who have a deep suspicion of Islam and all of which forms to look at you and feel that you represent a danger because you you appear to make\nIslam more acceptable to a Danish minds when in fact they say many of your core assets huge or just to sort of aliens to Danish values I was so cool to Islamist\nIt's a very little minority core having that we're getting that stable\nIt let's go through a few of the specific points about you you claim to the beginning of the money ... experiment all the founding of the most you said you were going to have mixed friday prayers then you can also no that's not try to prove or don't believe you do a mixed ... lead was true\nBut I didn't I didn't back up when you create a community\nPeople come and then join you that's a policy democracy so the majority they voted for women's mosque on friday because they wanted to to establish a magical sphere with women only when women could say what they want and express themselves and in the beginning I wasn't really\nMeaning of the money in experimental the founding of the most you said you were going to have mixed friday prayers rather than you can also no that's not trying to prove or don't believe you do a mixed ... lead\nWas true but I didn't I didn't back up when you create a community\nPeople come and then join us that the policy democracy so the majority they voted for women's mosque on friday\nBecause they wanted to to establish a magical sphere with women only when women could say what they want and express themselves\nAnd in the beginning I wasn't really I was really sad about the ... flood I didn't back off I accept and that's the power democracy you how did that the majority was good to know when you have to uh I have to make the conclusion and because the conclusion is vital\nWhen you want to create change you have to understand the art of flourishing\nIf you burn all the richest behind you cannot be a bridge builder there's no I I really ... that\nBecause we have a women's ... only on friday at all other days it's for men we have men coming from different countries to pray because we are centered in the middle of Copenhagen as the only mosque vary but in my life was my point was that\nIf he wants to create change you have to do it slowly and ... and we can do the real revolutions\nLike the interfaith marriages given women the right to divorce we can do these things\nBecause we are actually unsafe theological problem because nobody can criticize though that\nYou are making such interesting points I Need to pick a way of looking at it in your philosophy especially if you move slowly you say never bone you'll bridges ... by the way you achieve change\nWhat I'm hearing from use but it is a very delicate insensitive balancing I was just take one more example I think a number of things you a quote unquote your political opponents on the run to regard your stunned after that uh\nAnd just given women the right to the boy we can do these things because we actually unsafe theological found because nobody can criticize that\nYou are making such interesting points I Need to pick a way of looking at it you'll philosophy is fascinating move slowly you say never neo bridges and that by that way you achieved change\nWhat I'm hearing from you is that it is a very delicate insensitive balancing act let's just take one more example and I think a number of things who are quote unquote your political opponents on the right to God your stand after that a crisis over the cartoon\nIn a unit is Boston in ... I think it was five it first came out anyway that cartoon became a sort of litmus test in Denmark for whether you are supportive of\nFree speech that during civil opinion or whether in the case of many Muslims in the country you said that the offensive ... dot com tuned to you trumped all else now it seemed\nTo many that was that that ... and ... you may do that shit that's not my quotation I'm quitting but\nThis is your quotation you said freedom of expression in your view must be used more delicately Sam said when is the dialogue\nThat the ... the cartoonist in this case is claiming to establish showed it sounded to many dangers do you actually are defending the rights of Muslims in Denmark not to be offended and will not defending the rights of the cartoon\nNow not on the other hand I with you on that debate\nI set that we have to understand we're living in a globalized world and if you're living in a globalized while you have to ask yourself what tell you what do you want to have a dialogue with people and units talking they said that they won that dialogue with like ... and then like so he really truly wishes a dialogue\nYou have to understand you have to ask the central question what is important to you and why feed them\nA defending the rights of Muslims in Denmark not to be offended and will not defending the rights of the cartoon\nNo not on the other hand I with new on saying the debate\nI set that we have to understand we're living in a globalized world and if you're living in a globalized world you have to ask yourself what tell you what do you want to have a dialogue with people and units talking they said that they wanted a dialogue with Muslims and on my so if you really truly wishes a dialogue\nYou have to understand you have to ask an essential question what is important to you and why freedom of speech is an essential value to the majority of Muslims in the world\nAnd the sacredness of the Koran is also and the Central Valley too many Muslims and the ... so we we have a group of Muslims who have different principles that they value at the same time so my point is that we have to understand that we have people among us who have\nA values who are essential to them at the same time so it's not a matter of favoring the sacred this of the crown over freedom of speech it's a matter of understanding that if you want to enter

correct me if I'm wrong but it costs something like three hundred thousand dollars\nFor like three hundred thousand dollars yeah was seizing the expenses\nAnd that prices come down considerably how much would a burger today costs\nUm it's it's hard to tell you can only do calculations because for the prices come down to four is it needs to be\nScaled up the production and you need to know exactly what the production system is um but having with a couple of some shows that you can scale up to let's say twenty five thousand leader bioreactor which comes out about ten thousands a me for ten thousand people a year\nThat price would be around ten dollars for a number of the cost will be ten dollars for a helicopter yeah and it's of course still way too high\nAs skilled up the
