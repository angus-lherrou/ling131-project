to influence the likelihood of one developing an eating disorder\nWe seeing especially in the younger population who live in the cosmopolitan area is going to make schools that are linked to associated eating disorders thinking so a lot of concern around race in shape losing weight\nAt a visiting the pro anorexic open mic with sides so that waste and culture influence is seeming to\nTo be

westernized nation is a major factor in the rise of eating disorders amongst the population [noise] but some doctors are wary of putting too much emphasis on infants from the west when we talk about eating disorders in Africa [noise]\nI really feel that when you talk about ... I think developing countries\nSometimes the attitudes that are held by the rest of the world is that they are not able to\nFully accept or see someone even from a rural part of an African country or just anyone from that part of the world as a fully hole and complex human being\nThis is an assault chi chi chi chi in New York based Nigerian American ... he just public awareness walk in Nigeria

and New York based Nigerian American ... he just public awareness lack in Nigeria [noise] she told me that the ... in the country and public awareness is live\nThe response that you may get from the general public from some people they may say I don't understand what is going on what do you mean you don't want to eat\nThere are people that actually don't have food to eat and you're saying that there is food available but you just don't want to eat they don't really want to acknowledge that there is some components\nOf a mental health issue\nOh why is that why is that is typically around mental health\nYou're deemed somewhat of a pariah from the rest of society some people will say any abnormal or strange behavior that they may know or deem strange or normal\nIs basically spiritually induced all you need is prayer all you need is some sort of spiritual intervention or cleansing\nSo not many people really want to talk about it and not many people really are able to get the amount of help that they really need when they are facing any kind of mental health issue\nAnd how worried telling you about the lack of resources the people in Nigeria he was suffering with eating disorders\nI'm extremely worried I feel that sometimes it takes one being on the brink of death before somebody actually takes a problem seriously and at that point it may just be too late [noise]\nWell to get the amount of help that they really need when they are facing any kind of mental health issue\nAnd how worried telling you about the lack of resources the people in Nigeria who

just be too late [noise]\nA quick reminder you're listening to the food chain on the BBC wild Saturdays with me and he told us this week I'm hearing about the experiences of black women have had eating disorders and why the prevailing stereotype that it's only white western women who suffer is so harmful\nI've just been sneaking teen ... she adult he's been explaining how some aspects of Nigerian couch might to make people vulnerable to eating disorders I wondered whether someone have suffered from the illness which agreed with having out of this\nSo I spoke to another ten to ... and Jimmy ... he suffered from ... from the age of eleven\nNatures of society where um people don't refrain from common thing in other people's bodies\nUm even liberal children um especially with all girls aren't exempt from these kinds of envious of comments about their bodies um and you got them not just from the appearance but you also get them from adults\nEspecially from grown men and um it made me very uncomfortable thing would they say men would say things like um you know you ... ... which is like basically you're a developing a bomb and then also women they would say things like cover that\nFrom commenting on other people's bodies um even lift all children um especially with all girls aren't exempt from these kinds of invasive comments about their bodies um and you get them not just from the appearance but you also get them from adults especially from grown men and um it made me very uncomfortable\nOn this thing would they say\nMen would say things like um you know you ... which is like basically you're developing a bomb\nAnd then also women they would say things like covered this or your bum is too much or you're developing breaths and like they'd actually be taught him like pincher bomb they gave you the impression that your body was inserting itself into the public view and then it was your juicy to to hide it\nAnd then not just stop but then they transmit very vicious comments about people's weight as well so if you're ... your cold or a ball and if you're a sin like they call you won't get fish and like they make all sorts of like horrible comments about you [noise] um so that was really where like the eating disorder starts it\nAnd we'll say anything else going on you at that time that may have made you ... do you think\nSo several times um you know I had a um some situations where\nEither I had to physically get away from someone who is trying to assault me or there was a lot of inappropriate um behavior towards me by older men or older boys I'm so that\nKind of compounded this idea in my mind that my body was a problem and it needed to be controlled because clearly it was attracting all these harmful people towards me\nAnd I think that a lot of um young nature and girls and like probably even boys go through the same thing because there isn't very much record for people who you know\nWho is for me or there was a lot of inappropriate\nUm behavior towards me by older men or older boys [noise] um so that\nKind of compounded this idea in my mind that my body was a problem and it needed to be controlled because clearly it was attracting all these harmful people towards me\nAnd I think that a lot of um young nature and girls and like probably even boys go through the same thing because there isn't very much record for people who you know had been molested and it's usually in scenario that they brought it on themselves\nI'm so because of that people really learn to self censor in a way and one of the things that you can do is like you know to shrink yourself and to to make yourself less visible and one of the ways of doing that I just to start starving herself\n\nFrom Arizona Public radio in Flagstaff I'm

I spoke to one of them he is professor jak hind them and from the University of cancer brand new Zealand after most of the connection between herbicides designed to kill weeds and antibiotic resistance the prize\nWell the updates there's no counting the millions of lives saved by the discovery of antibiotics in the early years of the twentieth century will the twenty first to see the end

antibiotic resistance\nNice surprise at all all of this is that as you say we expect herbicides to kill plants and we expect antibiotics to kill bacteria but\nThe chemistry of these different kinds of of agents and drugs are such that bacteria proceed both types of drugs as toxins\nHerbicides are not particularly good toxins for the time the bacteria that we study but the bacteria I don't know this and they react to them as if they were good toxins\nBecause these are or toxins because herbicides or poor toxins they don't kill the bacteria so you'll get a sub lethal affect\nThe bacteria would respond to these herbicides like turning on genes for pumps that remove all those toxins from inside themselves to outside\nThat pre adapted bacteria for exposures to toxins that are much more potent like antibiotics so that herbicides in a sense are vaccinating the bacteria against the antibiotics\nAnd this is happening this protest is underway and the most harmless of sounding places anyway told

told the punks looms where people play with the dogs\nThat's right wherever herbicides and antibiotics may come together and they come together and these places because for example you might use herbicides on your lawn\nYour cat uh or your neighbor's cat might walk through your lawn what back into someone's house where there is stroked that puts her side and application levels on their hands and they made touched their mouths\nIf there are also on antibiotics or if the taxes on antibiotics we now have a combination of herbicide an antibiotic in this latest study\nWe found that that particular combination when herbicides and antibiotics come together\nThe development of antibiotic resistance can be up to a hundred thousand times faster than when there is no herbicide\nWhat can be done professor\nWell first and foremost we have to have a much better understanding of all the different kinds of chemicals that are in commercial use for their impact on bacteria and sub lethal
