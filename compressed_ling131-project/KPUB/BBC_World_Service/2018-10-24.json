Gonzalez says and the state of Georgia and only one of them is in eligible to vote\nA safe because they are a U.S citizen or because they um because he is\nA you know currently incarcerated ah because of the exact back system they don't match\n'em all of the data information so\nI'm a one person who's in eligible uh we'll get flagged in a system and other people with that name could also be flag um I think the other reason is that um people of color are more likely to be registered to vote via voter registration drive\n'em and we tend to voter register people to vote\nOn paper for 'em and go ahead\nAnd say other than that we do understand that they've been sending incidents with say a busload is ... is one table to to continue when news about two to ...\nThat's ... so I'm a week ago a in a rural part of Georgia\n...\nThat's ... so I'm a week ago a in a rural part of Georgia um there were about forty black senior citizens who were had it on a bus to go register to vote and they were all ordered off the bus\nA because there were complaints\nThat I'm the boss was organized or the voting trick was organized by one of the political parties and there's no law in Georgia that prevent seniors or people period from I'm participating and\nI'm a voter or a bus drive to go vote but um one person in front of took it upon themselves\nTo order the seniors off of the vote and and unfortunately I'm a we have seen these type of suppression tactics\n'em all over the state of Georgia and we believe that he's got a sponsor the energy and enthusiasm that we've seen for people of color who are interested in participating in the mid term election\nWomen say thank you very much in the telling us about the ... the new due to budget do see the ... and then can you tell that when I mentioned to\nKeep you from someone in on the BBC motives for two weeks to go into the midterms in the u._s. but next what went wrong when South Sudan on the new country was born in twenty ...

struggles seems James ... woman room to get\nMany people both close observers folks that were new to you for a moment to two dozen women\nWhat went wrong I think it's done many people both close observers and folks that were new to it you know the euphoric high of that moment in two thousand eleven was sort of celebrated the world round and I think part of the problem was that people saw that as the finish line of the south Sudanese project this kind of unprecedented experiment\nIn international state building and moved on rather than as the beginning of that project\nWhich took him out of the international community in particular do not so much the south Sudanese maybe ... well both\nI think I think national and international actors have some soul searching to do about this but yeah I think South Sudan had an unprecedented coalition of support both among the Africans in the region but also among the wider world not least in the west among European countries in the United states\nIn the book he made the argument is that America sometimes described as the midwife assassinate as independents go too close to the south Sudanese to the people who go to 'bout freedom as the south Sudanese soy why what was the problem\nYeah I Do think the United states in particular play to an absolutely critical role a huge role in helping deliver that independence and that is a real achievement but I think\nUltimately overtime that on critical embrace an unqualified belief in righteousness of the cause ultimately blinded some of South Sudan's and the SPA limb supporters to the flaws of those chosen heroes and I think ultimately that both\nWarped the political space in South Sudan and it reinforces dynamic in which the south Sudanese elites we're increasingly answer too and we're a derive their legitimacy from abroad rather than from their own people\nThe dynamic is really different now if you look at the way American politicians leaders talk about South Sudan there's little support now as America gone too far away the ... to disengaged\nI think we've swung too far at this stage there isn't a lot of concern there isn't a lot of interest about this and the trumpet\nAmerica is gone too far away the cup to disengaged yeah I think we swung too far at this stage there isn't a lot of concern there isn't a lot of interest about this in the Trump Administration and I think we see that playing out on a day to day basis now where the United states is a two absent from the scene\nYou'll say critical says the south Sudanese leadership solve a kid was the accidental president and you'll woods or you know very complimentary to about ... the main rebel leader they signed a peace agreement now are they going to have to work together again it's failed Seventy times in the past and they work together now\nThe million dollar question look I have my doubts and I had you know I was part of the mediation that helped broker the first peace agreement with alternately failed to produce a a real political transition and South Sudan and I have some of the same doubts now that I did then I think this deal\nIs important if it can stop violence in the immediate term if it can allow humanitarian access if it provides an entry point for the international community the best peace deal in the world won't be implemented without the political will I think we need to think in five and ten and Fifteen year terms and for me that means partnering with youth in South Sudan and means partnering with\nThe thirty something a little tired of politics I mean not totally locked out relatively army\nTotally locked out of politics and have been for too long waiting generational change in their own country I Do have optimism about South Sudan and it's in many ways tied to that generation and so I think the Trump Administration I think western governments I think outsiders would generally do well those to address the immediate term but to start to invest and partner with a new generation and South Sudan\n... ways that governing elites who came from a rebellion you ended up as politicians despite themselves in some cases [noise] did you get much feeding that they wanted the best for that country that I prepared to go beyond their own interests and uh I work in the national interest\nI Do think many of them some of them did have the best\nThe best country that I prepared to go beyond their own interests and I work in the national interest\nI Do think many of them some of them did have the best intentions of their country at heart but\nThey failed to seize this incredible opportunity there had both apple oil reserves oil reserves that many states would kill for and they had a remarkable reservoir of international goodwill and so they had a real opportunity and I think\nBecause of that history because of they were in many ways disconnected from their own population because institutions went there and there was opportunity for corruption sadly I think they failed in that\nIn season that opportunity I think some of them are repented and some of them have seen what's happened as a result of those failures others I think or not and\nThat in many ways is why I think generational change is the\nFundamental ingredient in a long term transition to a piece in South Sudan\n... author of wrote from the sky the

can determine our future relationship with the ... you and make sure that we do not suffer the consequences that such a major described\nOf old is is that the prime minister is being manipulated by

that they will always be a safety net whatever the status of a future trade agreement between the u._k. and the ... that will always be a safety net which ensures that Northern Ireland and the Irish

around now there's no doubt that every waking day the poor prime minister takes in the last inning coming file for many angles are mostly from those who want to re heartbreaks over breakfast or no deal a tool\nBut she doesn't touch and what she's doing as she is saying very clearly that uh the union of the United kingdom the full countries in the u._k. must be held together\nAnd that the peace

now over breakfast it cannot possibly deliver a cut here in ... deal\nBecause I think that in the next few weeks if the prime minister gets a deal and comes back to parliament with adult chemistry of all this will will change and we will have the votes in parliament which I actually believe would vote for a deal\nI hang on this is interesting so your vision of a deal it's a deal that she's done with the end you're twenty seven year old telling me can get through the British Parliament but it won't have to support\nThis is interesting so you'd have a vision of a deal it's a deal that she's

check his deal is put back on the table before parliament is the final deal with the Europe your party's\nFinish that because that that thought is was bigger than the events that has to cope with in the case of ... as much a journalist as he is a politician said sometimes he uses this floor it language and what was happening was that he was clearly intending to go into ... with a wish to undermine the prime minister\nOn race you are listening to finishing off and and\nThat's all if you you can solve or if it's a bar is back in ... in order to try and just get in to back off I had to

discussing today so everybody should have no idea what\nWould I Know that he does it would be we'd be getting it's a completely on then to energy of that what's happened and that's why I don't want it to happen which is why as I as one of the older members of parliament\nAppeal to my politics a stick together or to stop I'm having a guy that the prime minister all the time and to realize that you

in American political culture a desperation to see somebody who is not taking money from the ...\nI think that's because there has just been assumption that it is very easy for a small number of people to donate a lot of money and then in effect by the government's\nWhat's better O'Rourke and other candidates that except small dollar donors what they're saying is that it's possible that we can have a government that is elected only by people making small donations even campaign finance advocates going back to the Nineteen sixties\nThey said that there is absolutely no way that they could win office or on small dollar donations that's changing a Bernie Sanders showed that it's possible to run for president by rejecting corporate pacts and superPACs and better our work is making a very big play\nTo try to win his Senate race and he's doing that in part not just by making his campaign power by small donations but then asking those donors to become volunteers to knock on doors make phone calls in turn people out to vote\nSo this is being mobilized obviously on the one hand by the Internet the fact is you couldn't have done this ten Twenty years ago because the architect you wasn't there for people to just play ... and make a quick to nation but also you're saying that the money\nIs actually only part of the strategy here it's almost like you get buy in from people

knock on doors to text their neighbors and ask them to vote for\nThe most remarkable things that I think better or works campaign has done is they have ten different offices throughout the state of Texas that are officially run by the campaign but they've asked their supporters to set up their own offices and they have eight hundred and sixty two campaign offices run out of garages apartments\nFront lawn fats artificial intake points for people to come and volunteer and help turn out the vote if not just about asking for money it's not just about having people involved in the system\nHe's having his volunteers and his supporters in effect running large parts of his campaign on their own if he does when it was suddenly send the big message across Washington that's right what better was doing win or lose is showing that you can run the campaign very differently than anyone else has thought possible\nAnd I think the true test of better works legacy will be\nHow different democratic presidential candidates\nTry to emulate what he's doing won't see spending is thirty eight million plus on so far he has spent thirty percent of his money just on digital expenditures that means running ads on Facebook on Google on recruiting other donors and supporters\nWhen he was a it was a similar tactic approach by the Trump campaign was it not\nYes the two best spenders right now on digital\nExpenses are Donald Trump and better at work when you have better spending so much of his money on investing in a digital program that is something that is very unique

where the Republicans were last cycle\nFederal glucose his car he losing cording to the opinion polls by on a percentage points also do you think that as opposed to the extent that fundraising is a symptom of sentiment tendencies he asked them to think the polls are all\nThe polls that have been gotten so far in excess of all university found that Ted Cruz's ahead by eight what I think the equation is whether or not better work can turn out voters that are not being picked up in the polls\nKen you reach voters that are not going to be picked up on in any traditional assumption of who's going to vote and nobody's going to do that until November sixth and I think that Beto O'Rourke is making a good place to try to prove the polls wrong here\nWell the fact is that everyone not just the journalist and former Democratic fundraiser Michael Whitney all watching this Texas Senate race very closely indeed this year it could be crucial\nTo the Republicans keeping them majority losing it but despite the fundraising hype not everything is going the Democrats' way at the moment\nAnd vote in the mid term [noise]\nNow what do you ensure our forty minutes president here a country Donald Trump [noise]\nThe Republicans led by the president himself have been leading their own major efforts Donald Trump remains a big fundraising drawers events like this one and anyway it is important to stress that well Democrats are raising more than they ever have before the Republican National committee's war chest has generally been better stalked from previous years\nWhich means that spending

even so how might this translate into success at the polls does the money even matter that much Donald Trump after all under spent Hillary Clinton twenty sixteen but still one\nMuch academic research in recent years just that expensive TV advertising campaigns are not always that influential unplugged is somehow should campaigns be focusing should they be spending on online advertising Michael Franz is a professor of government and legal studies and through his Wesleyan Media project he tracks political advertising in the U.S\nMoney is incredibly important to winning an election because you need the money in order to buy the communications to voters and so most candidates spend a lotta time raising a lot of money in order to be able to buy advertisements and to fund all the things that needs to happen in order to reach voters\nWhere would you spend your money if you are running a campaign\nWell I Would certainly spend my money if I were running for say the U.S house on television because I Would want to reach\nOlder voters who are much more likely to vote and who are much more likely than younger voters today to watch traditional live television\nBut I also would spend a fair amount of money on a digital media so that I could reach younger voters and so that I could build email lists and donor distribution lists\nOr what digital allows a campaign to do is to target effectively and so if you want to reach particular sub groups of voters you can do that very efficiently with digital media\nAnd so I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to miss that opportunity but at the same time I wouldn't want to disarm on television because that's where the most likely voters still are and probably will be for the next election or so\nJust TV advertising still work\nDoes work in the sense that if you out advertise your opponent and have more messages on TV than the other side than we've seen\nWork in the sense that if you out advertise your opponent\nAnd have more messages on TV than the other side than we've seen evidence consistently that poll numbers move in that direction and so if you can out advertise your opponent you can move the poll numbers and the closer you get to election day the more likely that means you'll get more votes\nBut what we also know is that those effects don't last for very long and so the the spending that happens very early in a campaign you know paradoxically is not going to impact the outcome of the race and all that much uh and so campaigns are in sort of an arms race which is why they sort of an irrational arms race for why they spend so much money early in campaigns\nSo that they're not out being outspent by the opponent but that's being done to neutralize any short term effects which might have some impacts later on in terms of how much money you can raise in the sense of the euro viable campaign\nBut at the end of the day campaign ads matter in small ways and and then not very big or long lasting ways but you don't want to lose that advantage of the election is likely to be close if it's a fifty fifty race and you lose by half a percentage point and that's because you decided not to spend the last\nYou know half a million dollars on ads you're going to be you know you're you're gonna you're going to regret it and so that's why campaigns do what they do\nSo will basically keeping our eyes peeled next two weeks but ah votes as being absolutely bullets with the TV sports wherever they may be\nAbsolutely and voters consistently say that they don't like these things\nBut campaigns don't care because they they want to make their message known and they want to advertise their opponent and they don't want to leave anything on the table and so voters in in competitive districts in states\nShould expect to see a whole bunch of advertising online and on TV and on the radio or in the next uh in the next ten days\nProfessor government Mike friends separate oil this also do political advertising we'd been

ships and hundreds of that Croft\nAnd the European Parliament is we've just been hearing is expected to vote in a few hours on an EU wide ban on single use plastic products [noise]\n\nYou're listening to weld update from the BBC\nObsessive compulsive disorder is just that a mental health condition which the patient has obsessive thoughts and compulsive behavior is one of the most common types of a CD affecting nearly fifty percent of patients it's a vet contamination fears and excessive washing\nIt's a conscious of not developed to not to help those with the complaint to take the form of video which enables the patient to watch themselves washing their hands or touching fake contaminated ... BBC's Tom Field and has been talking to use\nYou can say that's the ... which which say like when you when you're ready just a quick stop and depending on what's your mood and how do you ... just on to those questions so the first\nIn your ear off to rate your mood now how how tense you feed it\nGets so you have to re care so like how discussing you for the right now how anxious your and once you're done with the questions that would be able to do\nThis is tell you that for you so it's a picture it it's a film\nDo you have great you're so like how disgusted you food right now how anxious you're an once you're done with the questions that would be able to do and this is tailored for you so it's a picture it it's a film of you washing your so yeah it's myself washing my own hands the way I wash every day [noise]\nI Do wash my hands quite often like for example of any for touch my mobile I feel like okay should I wash my hands before I eat anything because I was just touched my mobile even if I go to ... to make sure I wash my hands either by signing Kaiser or\nThe so so I keep on washing my hands a lot of times and you get these develops in between the U.S does come up on the screen just to ensure like you're watching the video and how concentrate\nOn your yes it it Oscar you how many circles came up on the screen yeah and that brings you really weren't paying attention and you were actually engaged in even tells exactly and then it asks you how you feel after you've\nWatched yourself wash your hands and now how disgusted all anxious you fail\nYes so it also the same set of questions to measure like is it better for watching video or is it was after watching with you\nOh you're washing your hands as much as you were before the trial or or or do you think it's had some sort of lost in\nEffect if I keep on watching videos of washing my own hands all the time it relaxes my mind I was like okay that's it using to wash your hands and so I can see a little bit different like okay I don't need to wash my hands now that said\nWell I've been a talking to professor Barbara Sahakian one of the developing solve the brain training at ... who's findings to the period in scientific reports\nMany of these people wash their hands so many times a day that they can damage than some of them get cell extreme they put bleach on my hands and because they're worried about the contamination touching things that other people\nAnd some of them get so extreme they put bleach on their hands and because they're worried about the contamination touching things that other people have touched maybe getting some disease sometimes they can't even leave their own house because they're worried that anything they touch will you know a contaminate them\nUm walks treatments currently exist\nSo there's two main treatments one is cognitive behavioral therapy and it's a special for them it's called exposure and response prevention so in that therapy\nThey as psychologists would actually ask you to sort of maybe ... around the edge of a toilet seat maybe even put your hands in the toilet and then they wouldn't let you go and wash your hands so what happens is anxiety goes way up and these people as you can imagine because they're worried about this contamination\nBut eventually it subsides and when they can't wash their hands anymore they realize that actually there were right there is nothing wrong so it isn't effective treatment and many people but not for everybody and also as you can imagine many people don't want to undergo that treatment because it's too stressful\nFor them to do it and it causes too much anxiety\nAnother treatment as the selective serotonin ... taken him a disease of drugs\nThat are used also in the treatment of depression the ss arise drugs like Prozac but again I'm about forty percent of patients uh don't don't really get a good response to treatment\nBut yours you maintain your brain training up is more affected what's the thinking behind well the thinking behind it\nWas the first of all off and when you have to do the CB T therapy you have to go into a specialized hospital I have to make an appointment it's expensive sometimes it's an inpatient treatment and that now with the new technology we should be able to use these new technologies for you know developments in the twenty first century\nPatient treatment and that now with the new technology we should be able to use these new technologies for you know developments in the twenty first century I'm going to a meeting on the therapies for that at the world society and Academy of medical sciences\nAnd we should really use this new technology and get it into play and the idea behind it was well perhaps if you watch yourself washing your hands it will substitute for doing it yourself\nAnd the other one was to put something akin to the cognitive behavioral treatment of exposure in response prevention on the app itself\nSo there were two different types of Aspen both seem to be effective actually\nSo you're getting the person to reflect if you'd like on the behavior yes so they they really when they look at the ... some of them said you know I I used to not be able to go on the bus but now I can go on the bus because if I get worried that have touched something I just can look at the\nUh myself washing my hands on the up and I feel fine I'm not anxious stressed or anything like that\nAnd then with the other one um which is more akin to the CBP therapy\nThey would say things like I used to be able to uh not be able to touch them been or\nUse a cloth twice so used to have to throw it away if I was wiping accounted but now I realize that actually this nothing nothing wrong with using it twice rinsing it out or\nWhen I touched been I don't need to rush away and wash my hands so what sort of says has have you had with those using the some brain training so we have a certain measures of this kind of obsessive compulsive\nSymptoms and they were reduced by about Twenty one to twenty five percent so that was a good reduction because they've only use the F for one week so if they used it for longer than it might even have a better effect but that was quite a good reduction\nAnd also it affects their ability to a cognitive ability so they're not\nA better attack but that was quite a good reduction and also it affects their ability to a cognitive ability so they're not so rich it in their cognitive thinking anymore they're not so they will they can sort of think more about goals that they want to achieve rather than these rituals in their obsessive thoughts\nThat was a professor Barbara Sahakian not one very lucky person is reported to one of the law just to have the luxury jak poked in American history in the ... last night did make a million\nAmericans are nights mega millions jak record breaking one point six billion dollars jackpot and you might be five ... plus that go

multibillion dollar deal he's working on I still have about half an hour ago and he was very very different uh obviously he was ... he said\nBut he really essentially seems shaken a I think the

than to take some action but what came from a President Trump yesterday might come pay the G. seven\nUh seem to be renting this up and putting in doubt some of the huge investments but it being talked

some contested reefs shows into military outposts as well so being standoffs with us naval vessels but China\nIs country holding joint naval exercises in the south China Sea with countries of the\nRegional grouping ... some of whom Malaysia Vietnam Brunei and the Philippines have overlapping claims with China with me in Studio ... a research fellow at the United services think tank\nWhere she focuses on the south China Sea and are we seeing here a change of strategy by China\n[noise] um no I think that\nChina's always actually in the past couple of years especially stress too on as the un member states and that is willing to host a an and conduct\nAnd military a maritime exercises in joint drills so I think this is just a an opportune time where they've all parties have seen that there's a necessity to have some sort of confidence building exercises measures and they're taking each other up of a up on that offer\nBut the countries involved um have not given up that territorial claims you know the south China Sea\nNow they have and so this is really I'm In a way it's it's putting that aside for now and that is a long term issue that that is not going to be solved in terms of deciding which features belong to who\nI'm the hope is that at in the meantime at least these countries can come together learn from each other built some sort of trust a and make sure that if there's any sort of maritime emergency in the south China Sea they have a basis to worked with each other on it\nAnd is China's thinking that all these countries might come to look upon the United states has the common enemy [noise]\nUm I think China um is certainly worried about the position\nLook upon the United states has to call them enemy [noise]\nUm I think China um is certainly worried about the position of the United states I'm In the south China Sea as one that is not going away as the one that will will continue to reinforce its bilateral multilateral relationships in that region\nUm but it is at the same time going to uh exercise it's its own efforts to try and build upon its own bilateral multilateral relationships there\nWe did we stand with some international jurisdiction international rulings on whoever owns walked in the south China Sea\nWe have no international ruling on who owns what in the south China Sea we have an international ruling of course\nAs a result of the permanent court of arbitration finding and she doesn't sixteen which are ruled on the nature of the features in the south China Sea and what type of maritime territory they had around them but they made no ruling whatsoever on the sovereignty of those features\nSo um it's still up for grabs is motion was saying and whoever\nHangs on to water into a gets to keep\nWell um it's definitely going to be difficult to say that countries who occupy certain features at the moment will suddenly relinquish them I'm not by ah like I said that sovereignty feature at sovereignty issue is going to be an issue that these countries are are going to be working on a in a very long timeframe\nSo China or the United states do you do see the the potential for more conflict and has occurred in the south China Sea them before\nThe United states and China on um I mean the the near collision that we saw recently uh between a Chinese and American ship 'em was certainly worrying I'm On the United states that have been reports that have come out of the United states saying that\nChinese and American ship\n'em was certainly worrying I'm On the United states that have been reports that have come out of the United states saying that um they will step up exercises\nUm in the south China Sea that is likely to aggravate China but I think it's important to note that that neither China nor the United states are looking for war looking for conflict in that region that is hugely destabilizing\nUm and that is exactly what these types of of exercises in simulations are for um which is why we see this type of re engagement this push to try and build that trust\n[noise] there's no in many things that was a ... a research fellow at the royal United services a think tank here in London and uh

spoken to are the lucky ones they fled to turkey and twenty fifty since then there are very few reports of anyone being released from the camps are too [noise]\n\n[noise]\nBack in ... we try to visit a camp where we've heard ten thousand people may be held\nBut in front of his police closed the whole highway as we are right [noise]\nYeah well I Wish you well for example they tell us the roads surface has melted in the sun straight on [noise]\nWe try other routes antennas back here but every time that road block after block\nThere's no way through and I'm going to get anywhere close up ahead the satellite data once again\nShows watched towers in wools in schools China does not want the well to see\nWhat we were comments and we haven't received one but at the foreign ministry today a

smooth surfaces an exit for so long grace of the ... ... suggests to Matthew ... of Stanford University in the U.S has been working on the joined NASA project they don't have legs per se but\nThey have these attachments mechanisms that allowed them to creates you know the script on their environment so we were\nUsing sort of two flavors here we have a gecko inspired it he said they were using for for smooth surfaces such as class and a micro spines which are these little fish hooks independently mounted on compliance ... that's can grab onto surfaces\nWhat are the robots look like\nThey're about a hundred grams ... sort of\nIn your hands and it looks pretty much like a an aerial vehicle a quad wrote her sort of for propellers with some of these attachment mechanisms down below where on the side\nAnd a forceful winch so sort of this motor geared up to produce some high force and some of the versions also have to provide for some more precise locomotion on the ground\nAnd it's because of the way they can cling onto surfaces isn't it that they can exist to a lot of fools\nExactly yes yes so really the interesting part here was this combination of aerial locomotion you know these small aerial vehicles are very mobile they can fly over ... stern floors that can fit into crevices and things like that\nBut they're not very forceful they really have an excellent he loads that are out there saying wait till they can fire round with\nSo by latching onto their environments with these attacks from mechanisms which is the secret sauce here they can generate these forces with their environments to tug up to about forty times their weight depending on the surface\nNot nearly as good an opening doors as humans isn't that an argument against them [laughter] yes\nNot nearly as good an opening doors as humans isn't that an argument against them\n[laughter] yes but not not as certainly not as quick and it's not as Dexter is but you know I think this is really a proof of concept that small aerial vehicles or might\nBe a feasible solution for some of the tasks that we usually think that we have to use larger terrestrial robots for\nIs this the research route to go down in the future do you think essentially copying nature\nI wouldn't copy nature for nature sake\nYou know there's there's a difference between ... and violence ... so we don't want to Nick all of the features that nature has\nBecause it has to do a lot of things that are robots don't they've Argo bus don't have to reproduce and feed themselves and things like this but if you take some of the underlying principles ... is a wonderful source of inspiration to sort of spur on some creativity and solutions that we might not have thought of as designers\nAnd uh yeah get an outsider's perspective on how to
