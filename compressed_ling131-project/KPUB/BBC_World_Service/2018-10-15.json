part of the current tradition a of of of of western liberal is and\nThat's not really the issue that we're facing now have very it's a matter of whether the values that we press fast actually have any reflection in what's happening or in the United states one of the things that list\nFor fast actually have any reflection in what's happening or in the United states one of the things that was so disturbing\nAbout the cabin I hearing is just watching um the institution that is so important in maintaining those ideals basically being a over override with pop politics with\nUm impartial impartiality being rejected as a measurement of of a qualification for a judge so those of us who are really concerned about the distance between the ideals and the reality of American society really distraught at this point over the direction that the country's going in\nRight and it's interesting to me that you immediately point to the\nThe sort of toxic procedure surround the appointment or the nomination procession appointment of of judge Brett Kavanaugh to become a justice of the Supreme Court and we will of course around the world watched that play out in Washington DC\nAnd there is there for a temptation to see that the Trump presidency with the nomination and a whole host of other things too\nA same luxury that that's the politics of patriarchy playing out in society today\nAnd I get the same so but you know just from this conversation from your rising student you are angry euro angry about the way America works and and your view of of water is a patriarchal society oppressors groups including women and minorities is something that makes you angry but to change it you\nDo you have to reach out beyond your own groups whether it be women or whether it be African Americans you know to build a winning coalition\nYou've got to go national and you've got to obviously you include men and you've got to include a a range of of ethnicities so how do you go about building booze coalitions that cooperation\nWell so I guess I have to roll back for a moment and just to just that as you mentioned you're familiar with my writing in my writing the whole point\nOf intersection analogy is to talk about the kind of ... coalitions that are necessary in order to realize are a state of values and object is um there are many applicants\nA ... coalitions that are necessary in order to realize are a state of values and objective um there are many applications of intersection alley across any number of differences and cross any number\nOf forms of discrimination one of the points that I made and the New York times article that I wrote two weeks ago was to say that the failure of a coalition between anti racist and feminist was one of the factors that led to the elevation of Clarence Thomas\nAh over in as against the uh claims that were made by Anita Hill I'm the what I argue there was that there was a common history of anti racism and Semitism found in the fact that the very term\nSexual harassment at the very knowledge admit that sexual harassment is in fact discrimination\nWas largely set forward by African American women plaintiffs who works ... discrimination when they when they were working there is a long history of African American women bringing gender into anti racism and bringing anti racism into ...\nBut but some African American activists women feminists and civil rights campaigners\nHave looked at the history of ... as you say the failure of the times of of white feminist to make common cause with the black ...\nI'm frankly some of them have enough I'm quoting one who ... who says I find myself at the end of my into into ... feminist rude it's time to go back into survival mode\nDue to the dumpster fire him live Bora Bora\nFeminist agenda and\nI mean I could build his lineage\nPeople who actually uh say the opposite I think the point is you know and I find this very interesting um\nThere's plenty of people who actually uh say the opposite I think the point is you know and I find this very interesting um folks who are concerned about too much group miss\nUm respond to moments like these by showing that there are few individuals um who are at things differently of course we don't all think alike\nI'm so having a quote from someone who\nUm is exasperated by um the lack of allies ship of of white women is not surprising I'm often frustrated by it as well in fact I'm only forty eight percent white women actually believe Dr lazy Ford there's I'm far greater racial gap\nIn American society now than a gender gap that doesn't mean a gender isn't significant that doesn't mean that patriarchy isn't working through it doesn't mean that we don't need an intersection of politics to fight and both of them at the same time I don't mind described as a problem\nI I get I get the industry you know the argument that you couldn't bring different groups of press people together to make common called him I can make a very big difference I get but I guess what I'm\nI'm moving to motives are asking you how you reach out if you can reach out at all to those particular groups are particularly maybe white working class people men and women interestingly because let's not forget a majority will be with us on a majority of white women voted for Donald Trump\nIs there any way you do you see that you can use your arguments new powers of persuasion to make inroads amongst those groups if we cooling groups\nMany of us are I I think one of the challenges is to recognize when we're hearing the talking points from the other side of the idea that there haven't been efforts to reach out a ...\nRecognize when we're hearing the talking points from the other side of the idea that there haven't been efforts to reach out across groups the idea that the civil rights legacy wasn't always a a movement that was\nA multiracial and in fat and bipartisan so um our our challenge today is not only maintaining and building those ties but resisting the narratives that suggest\nThat that we're all just separate groups and we're not really engaging in efforts to to reach across many of the differences\nI think in fact uh the last a week opens up even more possibilities are every thing that we've been seeing suggest that many women are particularly those of that fifty three percent that and that in fact voted for Trump\nOr may be rethinking that but let's let's not you know see pie in the sky here race has always been a determining factor in American politics so it's not surprising that this is a challenge for us\nDo you feel now there's a little bit of time distance between his presidency and the and the President's Day how do you feel about ... because he's with the midterms coming up is going to the political fray making so much more pointed political speeches in recent weeks saying things like this quote\nYou know this whole notion of the sprung up recently about Democrats needing to choose between trying to appeal to the white working class or voters of color and women and it'll GDP Americans not as well known since I he said I go votes from every demographic\nDo you see Obama or some body that you know Democrats need to listen to and be mindful of because he had the right approach or do you think in retrospect bronco bottom of actually walking rather cool enough he he didn't do\nThe right approach or do you think in retrospect bronco bottom of actually walking rather cool enough he he didn't do enough to actually change the structures of American politics\nI think it's tough for president to actually change the structures of American politics um I have my disagreements or with a ... on on a range of issues some of them having to do with the the failure to actually even have a rhetoric um\nIdentifies some of the structures that continue to create any qualities\nUm I had took issue with him for example on my brother's keeper it was a program that was a racial justice program but it excluded women and girls but that was a minor I'm sort of a difference of within a broader reality\nWe are a country that shapes ourselves around certain values and I think he\nTried to perform that and it is true that he was able to win the support the votes of uh the white working class he was able to win those districts in Pennsylvania\nI'm In Michigan that were really important so it is true it is it possible to win votes and to create coalitions across race and class and he's in good reminder of the fact that this isn't an inevitable dimension of American politics\nAnd just the final thought on that as we go into elections who what where in election season or the Democrats are trying to create a winning progressive\nCoalition that is interesting isn't it when Ron Brown steam reflected on this with some figures from the Pew foundation recently said\nUh the ... democratic votes as you said a clearly divided he said Democrats must weigh the culture of liberal instincts are mostly secular wing of upscale whites with the often more tradition\nClearly divided he said Democrats must weigh the cultural liberal instincts are mostly secular wing of upscale whites with the often more traditional inclinations of African American and Latino supporters\nThat again in this world of of of sort of into sexuality and an ... group based politics is he's a very complex a complex set of relationships and the attitudes and values isn't it\nAnd I don't I make the complexity even greater I'm the most mobilize piece of the Democratic coalition is African American women they're the ones that game the vote that the victory to Roy Moore a\nA U.S senator who was the first a Democrat\nOr to the elected from Alabama and a generation or they're black women all over the ballot so the real question and challenges how can we not only use black women as the wheels on the bus but how do we actually put them in the driver's seat what are the agendas\nThat actually speak to them if we can figure that out will probably be able to figure out how to sneak across the working class 'cause black women are disproportionately working class will probably be able to build those ties that at one point made the Democratic coalition a winning political mobile mobilize\nA coalition that's what we're looking for in this in this midterm election will see\nWe will indeed seek ... thank you very much for joining me now to\n\nDistribution of BBC World service in the U.S has made possible by American public media with support from\nThe

business responses to some of the online threat but how bad is it really on these concerns I have a date that just an occupational hazard of life on line or are they something deep and\nWe've created this crazy system where every time you use it you leave data about yourself and what your activities are for anybody else to harvest and that's just not right that is very small\nAnd what your activities are for anybody else to harvest and that's just not right\nThat is Larry ... founding director of the California Institute for telecommunications and information technology and one of the architects of the first prototype networks the precursors to the ... Web\nCreated back in the seventies he believes the molten Internet's very structure of outgrown original design we\nAre taking an Internet that was set up for an earlier today and when there was many fewer malicious operators and actors than there are now and there was many many many orders of magnitude less data\nAnd in particular data about you I mean we're getting to a social crisis over the uh very Internet that is generated so much economic growth in the last several decades\nBut still people don't necessarily panic about sold at someone else's harvesting that data and particularly if they're getting a free service and Rita and if it's a social platform or something else\nOr they may not be concerned if they haven't had their identities stolen but if they have they are in one of the worst situations in their entire lives and getting out of it can take many years it's the worst possible thing that can happen and it can happen to absolutely anyone\nSo what is the ... it was this architectural weakness\nYou're seeing people like Tim burners Lee served timber initially who invented the Web particles back in Nineteen Ninety who's spent many years now developing a much more decentralized Web\nIt's fundamentally to put the control over the data about you that you generate in your hands period you have got to own your data and if others want to get that\nTo generate in your hands period you have got to own your data and if others want to get that data from you you may sit down and negotiate with them whatever price for whatever person ones that are corporation wants or government wants that\nWe're a long way from that but I think the fact that someone as influential as Tim burners Lee has publicly not only develop these capabilities but it's set up a new start up to actually try to grow it scale it\nOr to economically important a scale that's a sign and I think we have to have it\nSo the most simple level it is forcing Internet uses regular citizens like your eye to opt in to the data harvesting model that Facebook Google and everyone knows is using rather than opting out as it is now kind of gently being posted\nThat's absolutely correct and we don't want it to be a so time consuming that you're sitting around doing legal intellectual property in negotiations all the time but I think\nIt's starting in medical data you know there's a huge societal gain as our bodies become digitally read out to the sharing of that data because you can only understand you relative to other humans\nBut right now you're in danger if you share your data from insurance companies from your employer from all kinds of things\nSo it's a social good to protect the individual so that they will make a socially generous donation of their data because they're not afraid that there will be things that happened to them or that are bad in their future\nSo I think the European Union in some ways is further along than the\nThat that there will be things that happen to them that are bad in their future so\nI think the European Union in some ways is further along than the United states but I I think the scale of the uh catastrophes that are happening on the net including the various tax on the foundation of our democracy\nHave open people up Internet pioneer and would be reformer Larry small no of course you know human isn't just about identity theft in data harvesting there is another problem some reckon demonstrated by the emergence of so called information warfare fake news\nVaries Anderson is the founder of scout hey oh it's a media company focused on the future of technology and she's been studying the way the boats when them nippy electing the way we talk and debate on social networks\nI've done a lot of analysis especially if Twitter date in the last year and what we found is that generally if you're looking at a conversation on Twitter about a large cultural phenomenon so\nFor example the Colin Kaepernick Nike controversy or a lot of the conversations around Robert Mueller that go on online\nI very very large percentage of those conversations are often driven by pots you know I did a quick search this morning and found you know one tweet by Trump that was promoted by sixty percent box but generally eighty\nPercent of the people retreating what Donald Trump said we'll machines\nYes yeah it's important to keep that in mind when you're encountering what seemed to be really angry or to visit comments on line is that there is a very good chance that those comments could be written or constructed with the deliver intent to anger you or to garner your support right and it happens on both the right and the left\nAnd the idea is to divide those two groups of people further and harden and calcified their beliefs are that in order to change their behavior in specific ways\nIt's extraordinary isn't it I mean you just take a moment to think about what that means if you were to trends\nHarden and calcified their beliefs are that in order to change their behavior and specific ways\nIt's extraordinary isn't um you just take a moment to think about what that means if you were to transform Twitter or Facebook of these platforms into a physical community we'd be standing in a crowd of people\nSeventy percent which would be machines\nYou know it would be like walking around in your daily life and Seventy percent of people that you meet are real people right they looked like real people they talk like real people but they're actually just actors who are trying to change your perspective or beliefs about the world\nKind of like living in the Truman Show\n[laughter] it is sold in the living dead might be another movie but I I just people presumably don't understand that they still don't understand that I mean you and another political commentator without having that conversation and telling people these things but regular folks don't get that presumably because they're still talking to each other at least they think\nWell yeah I mean I ... when you observe these kinds of conversations on line you see that they work right people responded to these people or thoughts or algorithms whatever they might be and the retreat them they'll use their messaging they'll promote their messaging they'll get angry at them\nThe way that you create news stories in today's media ecosystem is by creating a trending topic\nAnd so the ... century act as like the kindling or the spark that lights the fire\nAnd then normal people get involved and it takes up steam and picked up steam and at that point media companies are looking at what's trending on Twitter Google News is based on off and on what's trending on Twitter or Facebook\nAnd those stories then become mainstream news right so that then becomes an accepted story and it's all essentially been architect id by a group of fake\nAccounts on social media\nBecause you say the mainstream news meter was complicit in in that eventually as everyone else\nWould love to see a major media company out them take a stand about reporting on Twitter controversies I think that'd be a very powerful statement to me\nI Love to see a major media company out there and take a stand about reporting on Twitter controversies I think that'd be a very powerful statement to make as a media company\nBut it has and you'll have not yet buried under the new suggests a variety of own says to fix these problems one she reckons could be using encrypted technology like ... chain to help verify people's identities on the Internet\nI think one of the reasons that people are so excited about the idea of the block chain generally are very you know it creates this arc decentralized architecture where you can actually verify someone's identity\nUm with Rosie ... pretty pretty reliably yeah I mean nothing is perfect I'm sure that there are ways to hack into and and get around that but the whole idea of a black chain is that every person has a node right and not know represents their identity but all of those notes are connected and every other note also has a copy of who that first note is so\nDecentralized yeah I mean it would be in a decentralized time there's no children how you do see centralized\nBut it's also you can delete essentially a ledger right so there's a record of every transaction or interaction between different notes and therefore you can see oh this is the same at butler that has been talking over here to someone else and you can tell it's the same guy because he also did this interview over here and they hear this conversation or exchange that they have so\nThat is the future that as a potential future for one way in which we could at least improve the architecture the social social platforms absolutely yeah are you optimistic so this is going to do we have a way through because ultimately we've all got to live with the Internet is not going to go away we've gone on invented\nCan me I'm very optimistic I think we we live in a really interesting time for the Web where I think we've outgrown the architecture of the Internet but the good news is that people like Tim are coming along and really really care about and focused on how do we reinvest like what is it looked like to reinvent an Internet that's actually built to do\nWhat it does today there are a lot of people out there that are very passionate about doing that so yes I Am absolutely optimistic about it\nLike what is it looked like to reinvent an Internet that's actually built to do what it does today there are a lot of people out
