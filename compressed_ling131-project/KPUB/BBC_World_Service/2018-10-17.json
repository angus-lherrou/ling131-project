hybrid system as a bit of a proxy for what that battery will be\nAnd what that allows us to do is really get these aircraft into surface safely in reliably right now or as soon as possible and then upgrade the batteries as soon as the battery technology is there\nDescribe who is in this game\nIt's really a combination of the major multibillion dollar aerospace companies and you've got a lot of interest from these very large scale aerospace companies in the ... that can absolutely are thinking of the right people\nAnd then you've also got a lot of interest from New start ups that are taking new angles to developing these aircraft and new business models actually where you'll the traditional aerospace companies if you will are mostly looking at providing aircraft\nSome of the start up companies are looking at being vertically integrated where they develop the aircraft but also operate the service for example so they combine airline and aircraft manufacturer\nRegulation it's the big one isn't it particularly in big western cities how soon can we expect any of the regulators to say okay you're good to go you\nAcross New York or London or Paris\nIf you're talking about a piloted aircraft let's say it's not so much an air taxi but maybe an Airbus although not the Airbus that's in Europe\nYou worry of maybe a pilot and four to six passengers on board there is a roadmap for that right now and with the technologies that we have right now\nWhat I expect to see is you're going to see the highlighted versions of these aircraft and the ones using hybrid electric power trains like the ones that vertigo is developing\nHit the market first and then you're going to see an evolution over the long term as autonomy technologies come into play eventually as new battery\nCraft let's say it's not so much an air taxi but maybe an Airbus although not the Airbus that's in Europe\nYou worry of maybe a pilot and four to six passengers on board\nThere is a roadmap for that right now and with the technologies that we have right now what I expect to see is you're going to see the highlighted versions of these aircraft and the ones using hybrid electric power trains like the ones that vertigo is developing\nHit the market first and then you're going to see an evolution over the long term as autonomy technologies come into play eventually as new battery technology has come into play and the diversity of aircraft types than grows\nWe took about taxes I think of a taxi is going to be picking me up from my office and taking me to my home I mean that presumably in the first thing we're going to see with this kind of new model\nThat's correct you're not really talking about flying to and from your house you're more talking about flying let's say from London Heathrow to the city center or from JFK Airport in New York to Manhattan directly places where you have large amounts of traffic congestion\nAnd if you think the most traffic choked cities in the world a lot of them are in the developing world on that you use it might have been all of a sudden they have perhaps low regulations that perhaps they are the most likely places to see this kind of technology says\nOh absolutely and we're seeing a lot of interest in cities like Delhi Mumbai Bangkok Sao paulo Mexico City and it's really interesting because all of us in this industry are actually watching the Sao paulo market very carefully\nRight now today in Sao paulo there are hundreds of helicopters operating to and from hundreds of HeLa ports on top of the buildings around the city\nAnd so this type of transportation model isn't something that's theoretical it actually already exists in one city busy businesspeople five to ten times a year and we all find ourselves\nThe Mumbai Bangkok Sao paulo Mexico City and it's really interesting because all of us in this industry are actually watching the Sao paulo market very carefully right now today in Sao paulo there are hundreds of helicopters

city\nBusy business people five to ten times a year and we all find ourselves in the cities where\nOkay my flight was late getting in I really need to get to a meeting in the city center and at that point it's very easy decision to say I'm going to put this on my expense report I Need to get there now on those few times a year when you really need to get somewhere\nIt's really valuable to you to get up and over the traffic how soon\nAre we going to see this revolution you're describing so I think we're going to see the early services around twenty twenty five and ... by ... that saying that I think those are going to be the piloted aircraft it's perhaps more like a bus in less like a taxi\nOr going to see a few cities in the world where you're going to start to have service let's say from the major international airport\nTo two or three of the major business centers around the city so that you've you've started to deliver this rap and transportation option\nAnd then it just starts to grow from there\n... botch over there to go arrow hair on business day even the b._b._c.\nBut really for the new tech will be when these flying drones but come\nOn just a novelty play thing for rushed overpaid business executives but when they also are a viable option for ordinary people that you will may well some Seventy or eighty starts up battling to develop the hard way and ride sharing tech

the b._b._c.\nThe really for the new tech will be when these flying drones become\nNot just a novelty play thing for rushed overpaid business executives but when they also are a viable option for ordinary people that you will meet well some Seventy or eighty stocks opposite battling to develop the hard way and ride sharing tech them ...\nAlso is investing millions of dollars in infrastructure in lobbying Steve tape it says there's a public relations effort underway to persuade ordinary citizens that this could be that future transport model as well\nI mean they're doing a great job in galvanizing industry employing everybody together to go after a common goal to get air taxi ride sharing on parity with owning a car which is well it's a brilliant goal and they've got a lot of technical hurdles to get there but brilliant but realistic\nOr you know people would argue with the realism but even if they're close you know there are still going to be people that have a meeting across town and there's going to be no other way to get there and they'll spend the extra money to to make that meeting and so I think that there's a market there even if it's not on price parity with owning a car\nThere are technical hurdles not just safety but also noise and other things and simply finding places in big cities to land I guess but is this going to start in Europe and America what was going to start somewhere else about the regulatory hurdles to this high\nYeah I think probably the number one city in my estimation is is Hong Kong right it's water water bound in super crowded and there's a lot of money there and uh it just a natural fit\nYou know a lot of islands to jump over ... less dangerous for that reason because I mean you're not going to crash onto onto a house if you did come down\nRight over the water most of the time\nJust safety but also noise and other things and simply finding places in big busy cities to land I guess but it's going to start in Europe and America what was going to start somewhere elsewhere but perhaps the regulatory hurdles a less high\nYeah I think probably the number one city in my estimation is is Hong Kong right it's water water

onto onto a house if you did come down\nRight over the water most of the time but you know if you look around the world a lot of the a lot of the most popular city to live in our water bound so there's an application for this type of transportation\nTheloop says it's hyping to pilot flying taxis and a number of western cities Los Angeles Dallas New York or Paris as soon as twenty twenty five but it is that actually unrealistic sheds you'll give them the technical and psychological obstacles we're gonna have to overcome a professor Steve right from the University of the west of England well is this the worry\nFirst time we have an accident which can be attributed to machine as you can imagine people kind of lose their mind to it\nAnd say we're getting very very carefully because one
