many Afghans\nAre facing the possibility of going to the polls because of insecurity and lack of government control of key parts of your territory they brutally exposed ever thing that is currently wrong with Afghanistan and its politics\nThere were multiple threats by the Taliban or al Davis precedents of attacks on polling stations the African people defied all of that and came out to vote I

verdict on democracy is and what it is that they want in their life\nThis was the first election that was completely organized by the Afghan government and security provided by the end DSS uh I think they did a tremendous thing a good job compared to what we had in the past\nUm even from the number of attacks that that ... that were um launched on on the election day in two thousand fourteen when we had foreign security assistance and the elections or had a lot of support from the international community ah we're much larger scale than we had this year\nLet's look at reality I I Do not mean to belittle the bravery of those three or ... million Afghans who didn't go to the polls in face of Taliban threats I Do not belittle that bravery for one second but he is the reality your own electoral commission\nSays that at least a quarter of polling stations across the country didn't open because of security concerns we know the whole swaths of territory including Kandahar\nOne of the policemen who survived afterwards said look we fight for our country but we do not get the benefits and respect that are given even to Afghan soldiers we suffered so many casualties so many policemen what killed\nBut the government pay no attention to us he said we haven't even been paid yet what does that say about your government\nAs a national security adviser that is exactly what is on my Monday to change I I Do realize that we have a lot of challenges\nBecause I knew was one of the reasons I accepted into this job it hurt me personally as an African to know that we failed our security forces from a policy standpoint\nAnd I'm dedicated me and the national Security Council will be working to resolve all of those issues\nI issued a statement our people our security forces that what I Would be doing is to reflect their voices in our policies it's true we haven't been able to deliver the kind of services that our soldiers in on the front line deserve they have not failed us\nBut I Want to make sure that we also do not failed and when it comes to policies and ... that that protect their lives and their families\nYou know what I'm mindful of mindful of something that I mean ... former president said as he was leaving office it was something that deeply upset and many people are in the west in NATO particularly family members of those who lost their lives because he said this he said the name so exercise all of its operations in Africa\nUh in the west in NATO particularly family members of those who lost their lives because he said this he said the navy so exercise all of its operations in Afghanistan have been ones that have caused Afghanistan a lot of suffering and loss of life unknown gains because our country is not secure\nHe says that of NATO's operations and of course the operations costs more than two thousand American lives more than four hundred and forty British lives one could almost say the same thing today to Afghan veterans the families of those who lost their lives in uniform serving the Afghan government all of this loss of life\nEither from nighttime forces off from your own Afghan forces unfold Walt because this is the more you can't win\nThat's again um something that you have the luxury to say as Afghans we don't this is our country if it does not winnable we have no other option we are in this country and we have to live our lives\nAnd protect ourselves while I'm I Do not want to comment on ah on colleagues from previous government\nUm they have their own opinion what I can say to you or is this is a changed country as a result of your investment in those are fewer and fewer than one of the reason I came on this show\nIs to tell you and and your viewers that this is not the Afghanistan that you only see it from TV there is so much more to that context I understand that there is only so much news a space for one son and it's usually covered by the spectacular events which are unfortunate\nBut this is that transform country whether you look at it physically or you look at it socially I'm a ... a generation Seventy five percent of this country ah grew up in the war our aspirations are to end this conflict and bring peace to offer\nRation Seventy five percent of this country\nAh grew up in the war our aspirations are to end this conflict and bring peace to understand where extremely proud of our country and what we have but we also realize that the challenges that we ... we face are also hours we're thankful that we get support from our allies\nOr to help us along the way they know that your investment in this country has not gone to waste yeah that's where a war it's not an eighth it's not a war that we have brought upon ourselves\nIt's a war that we must end a and it takes a ... it takes more\nThan just a statements to be able to uh to end it there are we are taking measures every day and thanks to reason with support who are being helping in equipping training or security right is to provide the kind of security that the Afghan people deserve\nWe we don't have much time has to move so let me ask you some quick questions or a pivot thing to what you just alluded to that is the support of allies in particular the United states and of course you a former ambassador to the United states on behalf of Afghanistan or let me ask you this\nDonald Trump has said of course that he will keep troops in Afghanistan advise and training fourteen thousand of them but he clearly wants to end this conflict in America's commitment to it as\nQuickly as possible one thing mood in America is privatizing\nThe U.S military commitment in Afghanistan I spoke recently to Eric friends formula that had the Blackwater who wants to get a piece of that action\nHow would you feel if the Americans offered you instead of the U.S military privatized contracted force\nWe have a a decision by the national Security Council and we should a statement this is ...\nContracted force we have a a decision by the national Security Council and we should a statement this is we will not allow a business is to ah to make to to turn our war into profit\nA it's an honorable cause we're proud of our partnership with our our life we're fighting terrorism a and counter insurgency in this country and and that's not for profit\nA second and more important point about the diplomacy right now it turns out that in October I Believe October the twelve Donald Trump's\nAnd why is that on my ... he had talks with senior Taliban officials yes or no did you know that those talks were taking place at the time we told beforehand\nWe knew he had talks there Steven ... this I Want to clarify there is a lot of confusion about this people confused talks with negotiations\nThe Afghan government has the initiative on the peace and reconciliation process we held two major conferences here in Kabul called the ... process to bring regional countries on board on what we're doing on peace and security we are also had the initiative on the ceasefire wet\nUntil you start because we have to get on you or I don't think it'll stay straight down said who are very important question 'cause it's about who really is driving efforts to engage the Taliban right now the New York times reported sources saying quote fills that\nI had these meetings with\nUh the officials from the Taliban just uh he flew to the Gulf states have ... he quietly met them an Ashraf Ghani your president your boss and his government\nHeard of that meeting only afterwards\nI thought he quietly met them on Ashraf Ghani your president your boss and his government heard of that meeting only afterwards through news reports is that true or not\nAre you asking me a question that you just one confirmation for or or what is going on it's a lot more detailed than what you see in a news report adjust because few words were not said in a meeting doesn't mean that was intention behind a hiding that it was a quick meeting a and a ...\nI didn't know he has to be very exhausted from his trip you didn't want to be clear then I think you've cleared it up first you didn't know who the ... the special envoy was talking to the Taliban\nAnd it just strikes me that the signals we're getting right now is that the Americans have decided that far from this position in the past where the Afghan government always says we must own\nAny political process with the Taliban now the Americans seemed to be saying no we're going to engage with the Taliban ourselves\nNo you you cannot have one incident\nUh dictate an entire policy or that's not what the Americans are saying and that's not what the American stands as we are are in ... I mean in constant contact with our American partners\nThat's not their policy and let me let let me tell you one other thing it's not that Afghans must own and drive the peace process Africans do own and drive the peace process and that's the only way\nFor success it's not that we we won the ownership just for the sake of ownership we think that without it there will be no peace in Afghanistan and it would be a shame that all your investment in our and mess investment in sacrifices go to waste I'm just by\nWould be ashamed that all your investment in our and mess investment in sacrifices go to waste I'm are asked by a ... through a process right on that process and it's very clear\nOur final thought we've discussed and you've been quite Frank about the degree to which the Taliban has a ... a real presence on the ground in many parts of Afghanistan but what would it take much to national security advisor for you to formally recognize the Taliban's\nRight to a stake in the governance of your country what would it take\nWell where the Taliban contend elections\nThere more than welcome to participate and see that the Afghan people want that process despite death threats\nThey participated in elections if the Taliban really feel that they have a place in Africa and society other than driving fear into them then they must come and content and see where whether the Afghan people really vote for them or not\nThey they can only be a force of military force that um that drives fear can they provide governance and and the Afghan people accept can only be known if they participate in a in in in a democratic process and let the African people choose\nHandler my we have to end it there but I Do thank you very much for joining me on how talk\nDistribution of BBC World

strife\nI think about a hard border would introduce would range all the way from street protests and maybe civil disobedience to physical violence from small groups of death and the Republicans\nOn what our most senior police officer in Northern Ireland the chief constable George Hamilton said is that if there was any sort of border infrastructure or people in those people that are car and I did that work would become a target\nThat and it's the police Judy to defend people who are being targeted says if the police then arrive at the border then they become a target as well so\nThe play
