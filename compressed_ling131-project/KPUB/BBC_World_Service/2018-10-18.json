three hundred and sixty million years ago when sharks were roaming the seas and plants just started to call in Iceland\nAnd so during that time this large event occurred it would have generated towering tsunamis and other catastrophes but over time it got buried in when we want to study it today we need other means to study it so hard discovery was made by drill core collected nearly Twenty years ago\nWhile so it's a historical discovery in a sense\nWell think about this if the impact that hit Mexico sixty five million years ago it didn't occur the dinosaurs would still be roaming the earth mammals may not have evolved we wouldn't be having this conversation assuredly and so we know the big impacts in caused dramatic changes\nUh to uh to uh earth and the things living on it\nThat impact as a hundred and eighty eighty kilometers in diameter and the one in Western Australia called would lay we think it's probably much greater than a hundred kilometers in diameter so it's the big

people knew about whether they were off ethnic minority origin or or Asian or Indian or whether they were purchased a meaning a white person\nSo in terms of a story she was a Muslim sissy pacifist she was born to an Indian father an American mother and she was actually a children's writer and Paris than when World War two broke out of family moved to the u._k.\nAnd she volunteered for the women's

that if they do remember it from the undergraduate days yeah so do you get onto the surgeries did rather better than the economics of the eighties and nineties and the early to says\nThe financial crisis I like to the extent to which was being tortured universities was increasingly irrelevant\nWhen do you call them was head of graduate studies at University College London a top rated economics departments she saw how unhappy with students were with a mismatch between what they were learning in close what we're seeing on the news as supposed banks and then the whole financial system began crushing down\nWe're all watching this and in some sense struggling trying to understand what was going on there were similar a sense of students being very perplexed and what they would come and say is can you help us understand what's going on\nWe're not learning this in our classes and they were right that we're not getting in their economics classes a set of tools that was helping them to understand the day by day dimensions that the crisis and Christmas was a good sort of catalyst because\nAt Christmas people have thrown together with their relatives and one typical question is well your studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually no\nWell your studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually not covering that ... is\nThe fact that students around the world continue to be two courses which has seemed to weigh a financial crisis but it was actually raging all around them brought home to many out of touch the profession has become windy calling is most of widely used university textbooks\nIn retrospect she admits these books missed on subjects that we huge Lee important in terms of understanding the crash\nThings as basic as how finance works\nI can put my hand up I had to spend a lot of time writing macroeconomics textbooks\nWhich we're addressing particular issues in the macro economy side or the one published in two thousand and six was all about inflation targeting and there was no section on banks all the financial system\nAnd this was very typical of the way I'm not correct comics was taught in universities around the world and has that changed\nIt has changed I write in your textbook that that really catches it in other words with my co author we felt really challenged and I think it was true not just about that of many others\nAnd if you're wondering why we should care about what's going on economics classrooms remember these are the people who graduate and going to steal the financial systems in which we will depend if they give bad advice and can wreck your economy\nThe growing frustration felt by students and teachers around the world\nHas given rise to a number of new initiatives to overhaul economics courses in one of these Wendy and many others of building a new free online curriculum known as cool this was a concern I feel passionately about and so I have to put my own hand up here I chose the core charity [noise]\n\nAnd so I have to put my own hand up here I chose the core charity [noise]\n\nBut with a different curriculum be enough\nIn finance in so many other areas the person who pays the piper cools to bankers and politicians founded convenient to listen to those economists who argued for deregulation and who's morals allowed them to justify the housing bubble [noise]\nAnd that's a much easier to comics professor at Stanford University in the U.S\nShe's frustrated by economists taking refuge in theory and saying what people want to hear well turning a blind eye to the bond even criminal behavior by bank because that can threaten them financial stability\nThere is definitely a problem it is a very very shocking they remain really fantastic early in the sense of how they explored the system but in the end\nIgnoring the biggest elephants in the room and all the flooding incentives and all the deception and fraud and all the excessive endangerment that's entirely unnecessary it's just taken is given it's just what they accept the system\nAnd does she think this has changed following the crisis\nWhat you hear is more about you know very shockingly you know stuff happens and you know we're doing our best and it's going to be sort of the big groups at crisis just wakes you up because you notice it\nAnd then he's like oh you know we really had terrible regulations before let's fix it but then the fix is really not quite right but then you just kind of move on and say well I did my best can we prevent it stuff happens\nNot much of a comfort to think that the economists could be happy with the idea that stuff happens some things clearly going wrong for professor Joe Stiglitz it comes down to the continued reliance recording was on the totally unreal list\nHappens some things clearly going wrong for professor Joseph Stiglitz it comes down to the continued reliance record them is on the totally unrealistic notion that the market is always right he dates this right back to the founder of modern economics Adam Smith\nThey were blinded by the same ideology that had blinded the central banks and other policymakers the blind belief that markets work well on their own unfettered markets will deliver for wellbeing for all citizens as been\nAt the center of you might say conservative economics sings Adam Smith\nAdam Smith actually understood that wasn't true\nI think it would be horrified at the abuse of his ideas he recognized that ah whenever businesses get together that conspire against the public interest to raise prices but somehow and the two hundred and some years after Adam Smith the conservatives I'd miss\nUsed his ideas\nEven more astounding was the fact that beginning in the Nineteen fifties sixties seventies and my own work or in the seventies and eighties advances in economics explained\nMarkets often don't work the reason that this will hand often seemed invisible was it wasn't there\nThe notion of an invisible hand and supremacy of markets is based on the idea that if everyone buys and sells things and the self interest and threads freely without government intervention everyone will be better off\nJust sticking that's one of the Nobel Prize for economics

out by experience\nThe notion of asymmetric information is very simple ... just\nEveryone has all the information they need to make the right decisions just isn't borne out by experience\nThe notion of asymmetric information is very simple ... just that somebody know something that somebody else doesn't know and the banks obviously knew some things that others didn't know about their bad behavior the banks knew that they were engaged in market manipulation\nOthers didn't\nThe fact is that the people who want to believe that markets were perfect close their eyes at in Dr needed their students\nThat markets basically worked perfectly\nWider economists expect humans to behave like rational calculating machines despite all evidence to the country\nFor some this tendency indicates a key problem at the heart of economics which is to explain human behavior as if it were signs ... only works if you imagine all humans are the same responding in the same way an old contributions to

perhaps of working remotely and this is kind of research that was living at the moment was actually helps people become more what we call a resilient\nTo engage with technology animal healthy and sustainable way of what does it help someone become more resilient\nWell we have to crate rules for ourselves in terms of being on 'em up being away from technology is feeling and control it's things like switching off email notifications when you're doing something about involves\nA lot of concentration and creativity because you know it's very distracting it's very stressful [noise] being aware of what we call switch and costs and it's very common for people to be you know you're working for a while on a report snow all of a sudden you're thinking okay I Want to dress up as an eight miles\nSo yo then switching from this deep sea comes and tries to task\nReaching her emails and then coming back to the task switching costs can actually adds several hours a day to your work because I Know he was not that it takes you a long long time to get back into the task so being aware of these problems\nAnd also being aware of the lure of email one of my colleagues calls email a bit like a a wrapped up present you think about what's in it it could be something really interesting it it's all just email anymore\nIs it it's ... messages ... there are companies that have what was that matches in groups for all their employees and what you\nExpected to participate that's right tons of course one of the interesting things that I've actually found out later today is the most organizations I most individuals don't see this messaging and email out of trauma communications us politics than normal\nSay it's the most organizations are most individuals don't see this messaging and email out of trauma communications us politics than normal day to type job well actually they spend over four hours a day on it but it's not in the job description\nSo perhaps making sure that you don't ask your email on to the end of the day I'm your communications as well because obviously but it's going to seriously like from your working day\nProfessor gal Kidman so we're working in ways that increasingly impinging on personal lives what does that leave an employee's rights to privacy a right to a private life separate from work\nIs he also to go the way of frogs where employees now the legal right to avoid work emails outside working hours it's a question I put to you Ellen temperature and she's a partner at the little from Louis silken here in London where she covers employment low and workplace privacy\nI didn't know what the rationale for the French legislation was I think from the u._k. perspective the concern would be around the idea that you never switch off\nAnd the other reason why it's quite difficult to come up with legislation that does though to be too restrictive\nIs the whilst one pass and may fail under pressure to respond to survive as old as you know everyone's watching as a difference another person might valley the freight and that leaves in the face and being able to access systems for a mobile device gives them say\nYeah if you have to leave to collect a child but you still go to ... to meet you can do on the run and that's to some people in advantage so it becomes very difficult I think to say that there is one rule that should seize to everyone\nAs far as what it does indicate is it because of ... communication because communications the ways that we have them on all smartphones we have ... phones the delineation between your home life and what life is becoming increasingly blood and I imagine that ... communication is a lot to do with that\nPhones the delineation between your home life and what life is becoming increasingly blood and I imagine that ... communication is a lot to do with that\nI think that's true I think you know as I said we access what stuff I\nHad when we come and help us as equally we\nWere looking at what soften Instagram it was say in our minds that distinction becomes blood and we probably don't switch off as as we would have done in the old days where\nWe left work and there was no possibility to connect with the office except for the phone call what happened then is already that people's right to privacy in the home\nFrom work hasn't really being some diminished I think it's very difficult question because that means the rights of privacy but it's not an obsolete right say it's all about balance\nSeven employee on one side of the scales has the rights to privacy which encompasses a right to special interaction so the right to correspondence\nRight to form social relationships\nWhether that's that was cool I ... ... doesn't really look at that sort of a geographical location when they correspondence with ... say what you send them ... will you send in a workplace system it can still be passing it could still be private\nBut he ... on the other side of the balance if you like all of the employee's rights to protect the business to protect that reputation and it's about balancing those two conflicting often competing\nSets of rights and the the little has to test to find that balance have you had any cases where he should have worked in the gray area where that trying to find that balance\nI think it comes up all the time because as you say they blaring between highly became any ... there are plenty of cases in court say one of the most recent leading cases if you'd like is the case before the ... of human rights and stress boat which involve the remaining employee

I think from the u._k. context band or personal ... because it's very rare in the case for\nEmployers to ban past weeks of of what systems completely and by that you mean music ... and ... and ... with the other side I think is is this blaring because people recognize your work uh laws so you do need to be able to access\nYour private systems or your private communications from the workplace or vice versa say\nAnyway this individual and he's with Tyson was a ban on personal ... he used the system to send personal messages the import transcribe them and ultimately dismissed him for his breach of the employers what place policy saying you couldn't use it personally and he went right up to the European Court of human rights and they looked at this question of\nWhat he says well established principles that\nYour private correspondence can be privates even if it's in a workplace context and ended up to this issue about whether the fat balance had been achieved and\nOne of the key things about that case it's individual hadn't clearly had advance warning that the employer could monitor his communications or could read the contents of them and that's you know one of the key things about guessing that balance right\nHe was the case well yes I mean it's quite complicated with that and what ... clearly he did establish that he had some right to privacy but it wasn't an obsolete right is model if everyone else that\nYou should always assume that you're both your employer can see anything you send him were males or what communications I think it would be a ferret\nYou should always seen that your boss your employer can see anything you send him were females or what communications I think it'd be a fair assumption but it's back to the balance I was talking about say you could have seen that an employer might look in setting second stances but the ...\nThis afternoon fifty for Flagstaff page fifty eight Prescott sixty jello fifty eight and came in Seventy one he's temperature still about ten degrees below average we start to warm things up a little here friday and into the weekend getting near average temperatures and a few showers develop each day over the weekend\nListening to the b._b._c.
