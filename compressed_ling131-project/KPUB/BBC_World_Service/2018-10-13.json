to introduce one more pests than and nuts you reverse gal he's one of the office of this week's IPC see reports and he's with me here in the studio\nYou read the report cool for the well to aim to keep rising global temperatures to one point five degrees Celsius but that's going to comment to price\nIs the world's on track to me anything like that target festival\nWent to clarify up the report doesn't call for anything the report also is a question that the government has asked the IPC\nIn two thousand Fifteen independence agreement on it was clear that two degrees of global warming was not a safe level\nAnd governments wanted to know what the difference between one point five and two degrees and how it was possible to limit warm into one point five and noticed report\nClearly shows that there is an important difference between warming if one point five and two degree and also shows demeans into raising rich global warming can be limited to that level\nPossible to limit warming to one point five and now this report clearly shows that there is a important difference between warming off one point five and two degree and also shows demeans in two ways in which global warming can be limited to that level\nSo cold hard to abate sectors including things like shipping aviation some forms of manufacturing for to steal but there's great technological development going on there\nThere's a crossing our fingers innocent ...\nNo no the people who are working on this all across the world a new development going on there's a report you out at the end of November by the

being possible using ... technology at some point same with law a long distance trucking genome\nTeasing out slightly I don't know about the technology but I think that we're going to end you know by specific technologies but I think they're going to have to face the issue of how we use energy if we have to reduce fossil fuels it's currently constituted about eighty percent of our primary energies and\nEvery kilowatt hour every message will is among those is going to have to be allocated think we really have to focus on the areas that are the most important and you say that everybody enjoys fine\nNo everybody that people do I think I think they wouldn't if they knew the consequences if they knew the real\nDo you support same with law a long distance trucking Jones\nEasing that slightly I don't know about the technology but I think that we're going to buy specific technologies but I think we're going to have to face the issue of how we use energy if we have to reduce fossil fuels which currently constituted about eighty percent of our primary energies and\nEvery kilowatt hour every mega ... is going to have to be allocated so I think we really have to focus on the areas that are the most important and you say that everybody enjoys flying\nNot everybody but people do I think I think they wouldn't if they knew the consequences if they knew the real cost of it that\nThey're actually putting things into you know five flying is one of the most environmentally damaging to be as one can possibly have in terms of damaging the climate and if people saw that saw the direct consequences between their action and real pain suffering harm but isn't that how do you\nShow that to people especially at the so far we've just talked about rich countries where people live very comfortable lives how do you prove to them that there are real consequences of their actions 'cause they don't necessarily see them\nI think those consequences are becoming extremely visible on assignment on American by nationality right now hurricane Michael is I'm currently pounding on on Florida and causing a lot of damage last year Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico and you know these things are not in a speculative future they're happening right now\nA billboard so it's important to people on the ... the ... and climate change does not mean we have to have a reduction in living standards in my life has deprivation let me give you an example an aviation it's now offer much quicker a more convenient to travel by train between London and Paris than it is to fly\nBecause you don't have all the hanging around at the airport\nWhich are often outside the city center is so ... and a lot of cases will be able to replace short term flights\nWith other alternatives I think this is the important thing we need we have the opportunity\nAnd so it's important to people on the ... the ... and climate change does not mean we have to have a reduction in living standards in her life has deprivation let me give you an example an aviation it's now offer much quicker a more convenient to travel by train between London and Paris than it is to fly\nBecause you don't have all the hanging around at the airport\nWhich are often outside the city center is so ... and a lot of cases will be able to replace short term flights with other alternatives I think this is the important thing we need we have the opportunity here to restructure our economies\nSo that people have better quality the laws they don't spend as much time sitting in congestion worrying about pollution we can design a world that is both lowering emissions and one in which people's living standards Ohio\nLewis is just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in a sense that the bed and will be some jokes that simply and\nThink here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs and long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say nobody anywhere is going to be losing\nFrom from switching or from transitioning to a lower carbon economy is something that maybe in two thousand and five to ten some people were saying that these ... these days we know that there are some costs however\nShort term cause that's an equate long term\nCleveland policy I'll give you some examples we know that the increasing an extra ... prices seem that you can get another country and in other countries have heard the most a low income people said larger share of their income is going into energy so we cannot say that there are no\nLosers what we can say is that these losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate for these short term in office but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know governor\nWe know that there are some costs however\nShort term cause death and equate long term costs the I'll give you some examples\nWe know that the increase of seeing an extra seat prices seem that you can get another country and in other countries have heard the most are low income people are larger share of their income is going into energy so we cannot say that there are no losers what we can say that\nThese losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate for the short term in office but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is the role of governments to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies I Will give you the other example we also know that the\nFossil fuel industries you know people in those jobs are going to have a hard time however we the appropriate policies of training and we've uh emergence of these other high technology sectors that we're seeing in maybe the case that in the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall\nBenefit seen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to meet to get these short term\n... cases if I can just bring you back from them and you read was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between at one point five degree rise to degree Celsius rise\nDC isn't elements of of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in a sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um when I\nLooked to sort of questioned some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier around you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started in the terms of ... we're seeing massive increase in the months of\nRenewables that we vote in the world you know both wind and solar so we are starting to make the change we own yet reducing our carbon emissions and so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see action right now and I can totally\nPeople that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um well I like\nTo sort of question some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier around you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started on the television we're seeing massive increase in the months of\nRenewables that we thought in the world you know both wind and solar say we are starting to make the change we aren't yet reducing our carbon emissions\nAnd so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see\nAction right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement although I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition that we have been able to use the Paris Agreement incredibly effective ... working on European policy so you know for example I work on the sustainable finance area we can I say the oil financial products or pension products have to be aligned with one point five\nPowers target for example I can see that now in the parliament and again support for that was previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians rumbled for they say look ahead and they mentioned the world that he is climate change the climate is breaking down and they see how unmanageable and how difficult that will be politically and so my perspective is a real political will to make these changes not\nYou know it just went to us today is that when asking the question who's going to pay to\nFor this one we should not see\nThis as a luxury something that we do now because otherwise we could just go on a business as usual trajectory one\nDoes this reading an investment in a safer and sustainable growth and when asking the question we're going to pay for it for the ones who should today one should also balanced is with the question what was going to pay to go for future climate impacts if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already we can observe them today\nThey're projected to increase significantly already with one point five degree of warming\nAnd ... to a degree of forming this is not in the far future this is um one point five up the current levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees yet again\nJust go on a business as usual trajectory one does this reading an investment in a safer and sustainable group and went on asking the question we're going to\nPay for it for just one station today one should also balanced is with the question was going to pay for future climate impacts if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already we can observe them today they're projected to increase significantly already with one point five degree are forming\nAnd ... to a degree of forming this is not in the far\nFuture does this um one point five at the current levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees yet again about twenty five years later so this is really not that far into the future so we really need to think about who is going to pay for that down the road and finally\nThe report actually also shows that this payment and and\nAnd the policies that are put in place have to be carefully managed and they have to be carefully managing managed so that they she the poor of the impact of this so that they can be compatible with sustainable development and and general welfare Laurie\nWants to come back and yeah and I think I wanted to bring together that comment that money made and and I do or you just made a lot has been done we have a Ninety nine countries we ... the entire Seventy three countries with\nAuctions fifty eight countries that are the how the other places to see that when you both and\nThanks to all of these work over the past three years or so we've seen cost the cost of mutation coming down significantly cities is making it easier\nThere isn't a global carbon price for instance there's a great no but there is that what do we need and I mean it

increasing number of applications and countries indication they're beginning to be competitive so it's this investment ... it is changing and that's the only said again we are doing and we have been doing is not enough\nAh as they obviously the reports he's reminding us okay um but I Do think this point that he's made all their report about making sure that the most vulnerable or not hurt it's not just necessary for ethical reasons but it's also necessary for political reasons because only in that situation do you get the support you need\nBoth so when we talk about coffee is important but we remember the global economy is not stuffing and there were three big trends are going to happen regardless of whether we make this transition which involves reducing emissions by fifty percent by twenty such even down to zero by twenty fifty so over that period\nIn the next between two thousand and Fifteen and twenty thirty the world's infrastructure is going to double\nNinety ... will be invested in New infrastructure infrastructure will be built regardless of whether we might the transitional not and we have a choice whether we make it's sustainable infrastructure the\nGlobal economy itself is what we could double in size in Twenty years if we grow at the rate of about three percent of the year and the population living in cities around the world is likely to double in the next for two years they all trends in the global economy\nAnd I see him down to zero by twenty fifty so over that period in the next between two thousand and Fifteen and twenty thirty the world's infrastructure is going to\nDouble Ninety Chilean will be invested in New infrastructure that infrastructure will be built regardless of whether we make the transitional not we have a choice whether we make it's sustainable infrastructure the\nGlobal economy itself is likely to double in size in Twenty years if we grow at the rate of about three percent a year and the population living in cities around the world is likely to double in the next forty years they are trends in the global economy that are going to happen we have a choice of whether we continue with our\nCurrent growth model which was delivering US cities that are congested polluted unpleasant places to be not productive\nOr we design our cities more effectively so that that's the real choice we have it's not about us having a whole bunch of new costs on it it's about us choosing to make investments in a more sustainable economy\nRather than the one we have at the moment\nAnd with that thought I Want to wrap up this how fast and now think heat panel ... Julius Steinbeck at ... case had\nA ... year we were a gal will take a short break ... just to remind you let us know what you think of the program or any ideas to topics he likes to look into you can email us that the real story at BBC ... me at ... and if you enjoy the program we have the ...\nAbsolutely so I I think for you know when you look at those grass where you have a very sharp decline\nAbsolutely so I I think for a you know when you look at those grass where you have a very sharp decline it's clear that he is a big departure from the status quo and I think getting that requires all these kind of action all these factors and also a different way off a\nOf going about not pushing for but arguing or four different policies\nMoly I just want to bring you back in I touched on the idea of nuclear what's your view does nuclear power out relatively clean energy or does it have a place in this picture\nWill the world's nuclear energy report for this year's shows the outside China nuclear power generation has been declining right across the world and the the prices just stuck up I mean we can now in Studio offshore wind about forty five donors and make it ... and make it was ...\nI think the point which is a hundred and twenty dollars and make a little tone that's actually in my patch there was a ... that one very ... because it's just totally on economics so\nNuclear just cannot compete with renewables in what we need to do is is electrify our energy supply and make it a little coping as quick as possible in the most efficient and cheapest way to do that through new bills\nSo when somebody will and I want to think about the politics which was the gums touch on another more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually accept the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he works for a think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on the Trump transition team\nVery hard because it's just totally an economic so nuclear just cannot compete with renewables and what we need to do is is electrifying energy supply and make it a little coping as quickly as possible and most efficient and cheapest way to do that is through new those\nSo wouldn't come evil and I want to think about the politics which was the gums touch on another more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually except the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he ... think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on the little Trump's transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he may have Monday's PCC report\nI've investigated the claims and I find them wanting from multiple viewpoints one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more deleterious effects on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an him in a crisis because that's their charge from the United nation just level but\nI mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to say that they can you imagine anything that the scientists could say that would persuade the administration that it needs to take this seriously\nUh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are a pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron evil talking to the BBC's Evan Davis said they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Julius ... with us effective leadership isn't is not lost I think\nMinister ration but it needs to take this seriously oh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are are pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\nMyron evil talking to the BBC's Evan Davis so they got nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judea Steinbeck and with us effective leadership isn't this battle lost\nI think there is effective leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office and the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science and the abuses science to argue for the fact they use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that global warming is happening really fast to argue for a week or\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on science what they do have a view is they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\nBillboard wants to come in and bring you in the United states government was one of the governments that approved the summary of this ripple line by line in South Korea last week they have not disowned it it is something but the American government has signed up to\nSee how ... how do you decide gate and of course that trait how do you desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states from city some companies all say we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you go to separate what happens at the at the national ...\nDisowned that it is something that the American government has signed up to\nSee how that how do you decide your date and of course that trait howdy desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states as shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states and cities some companies all say we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I I don't in the states\nI I'm importantly when President Trump gives his reason he talks about the coal industry in the United states ... states is in long term decline because it simply cheaper to generate power from other sources such as shale gas natural gas and renewables\nBut isn't the points the facts are becoming separates it from the optics and this is a president who wants to project a very particular and each one that appeals to his electoral base and what she said oh with the kinds of conversation that we've been having here\nIt is he's appealing to the problems that they have in the United states of the many other countries of what to do with ... left behind communities including coal mining industries and we need to tackle the so called just transition giving people other jobs is\nPart of coming up the solution here but the uh the other thing is I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence that climate change all around them Florida it's just been hit by\nThe strongest hurricane to hit the Gulf Coast on record the storm surge associated with that is pick up because it's sea level rise and as a good chance that the warmer than average waters in the Gulf well partly pull my big\nGiving people of a job she's part of coming up the solution here but the the other thing is I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence of climate change all around them forward or it's just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on record the storm surge associated with that\nIs big up because it's sea level rise is a good chance the warmer than average waters in the goals were partly poma because of climate change I think people would say it's an increasing costs to varying the impacts of climate change in the United states nor\nAt one of the few areas of the\nTrump environmental or climate policy where Congress and the U.S has gone way this has been in the support for innovation and low carbon energy technologies President Trump at two years the narrow try to cut by sixty percent by fifty percent some program straight to zero at sea route investments\nThat three thousand a million dollars a year more or less that the u._s. government or has been spending\nYou know carbon energy technologies that Congress didn't go along with that Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas the idea that there are benefits to investments in low carbon technologies are are actually something that uh brings bipartisan support\nWe've talked ... about the first world the very developed well let's see if we may\nTo

growing I won't speak to treat the good he's a professor of environment and developing in the global south of the University of Amsterdam and she joins us today from Cairo joy I won't talk about India because India in a way is an interesting example of an economy that's growing\nFast but also a country that has taken\nIts climate change commitments fairly seriously just described to some of the changes that are underway\nWell India is trying to invest a lot in solar panels but I don't think it's doing as much as it could possibly do when I was growing up in the Nineteen seventies we already knew that renewable energy could have a future but since then it's up\nIt's not getting as much attention as it could have got right now there is much more energy efficiency on the agenda there's much more to talk about renewables but at the same time let me just give you a small example\nIn the Netherlands where I live we are just starting to phase out the use of gas in the houses whereas in my mother's house last year they did a connection\nAnd I think that the developing countries should not following the footsteps of the north have to find a short cut to development so in some ways what I'm seeing is some action in India but it's not going fast enough\nAnd what I also wanted to see over here is that happens studies which show that if India would actually invest in some more additional book in relation to energy they could actually have a huge savings in help\nAnd so that itself could be a reason for taking action\nOn a fossil fuel and doesn't this come back to the politics because then the cost Indian governments of all give that a country that's growing is simply not positive it wasn't\nAnd so in some ways what I'm seeing is some action in India but it's not going fast enough\nAnd what I also wanted to see over here is that happens studies which show that if India would actually invest in some more additional book in relation to energy they could actually have a huge savings in help\nAnd so that itself could be a reason for taking action on a bus with\nYou and doesn't this come back to the politics because then the cost Indian governments of ... that a country that's growing is simply not portion of it wasn't part of the industrialization process that if you like caused\nThe problems of climate change and therefore it's contribution to the solution should reflect that it shouldn't pay for it in its economic growth now\nAbsolutely but you see if you look at the beaded Nineteen Ninety two thousand and five at that time the developing countries but arguing the knock must take action cyst\nNo it's very difficult for the developing countries to actually force the U.S and Europe to take action\nThe problem is right now there's a limited space the action so it's it's no longer a viable argument to save it going to wait for the U.S to take action I think India China and the rest of the developing world have to quickly try to figure out ways to bypass\nThe mistakes of the north you'll be talking about the fact that we could perhaps in the north tried to convince a pension funds to stop investing in fossil fuels\nBut the question then is one of the pension funds going to do with the fossil fuels are they going to sell those fossil fuels or\nThe investments to the south and I think that for the very good idea to shifting the problem effect right and so I Do think developing country should try to buy those technologies all those fossil fuels they should try to bypass that but it's going to lead to some sort of economic disruption do you think\nFor a country like India that democratic that this is\nThe fact that we could perhaps in the north tried to convince a pension funds to stop investing in fossil fuels\nBut the question then is water the pension funds going to do with the fossil fuels are they going to sell those fossil fuels or the investments to the south and I thought about a good idea to shifting the problem is that great and so I Do developing country should try to buy those technologies all those fossil fuels\nThey should try to bypass that but it's going to lead to some sort of economic disruption do you think for a country like India that democratic that this is\nMore difficult or easier to push through as an idea [noise]\nThe problem with democracy is of course is that everyone talks and it's very difficult to come to this is ... ... relative to perhaps the dictatorship on the other hand\nI think that day is a lot of knowledge in India there's a lot of science\nAnd I think that if he can get

children that was going on in Pennsylvania ... not far from places you knew\nIt hurt reading the report because I was reading about these Paris is that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so

the beat in June to or from your mother the beatings that she endured all of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOne of the things that I was going to say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing costs just traumatic thing but I Will say\nThe layers of particular kinds of abuse really personal and structural I think let me\nEating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bullying and a lot of other big kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and that a lot of really big women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding 'em\nAn individual you started to start as a way of attempting to hide and attempting to disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of there between of which sounds to me like obese\nThe layers of particular kinds of abused really personal and structural I think let me\nEating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bullying and a lot of other big kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and a lot of really big women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding 'em\nAnd individually I started to start as a way of attempting to hide and symptom and disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of there between of which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something\nRight now the running was terrible I run two hours in the morning two hours a night and I play a lot of basketball in the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days and there's a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lot of times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body and pushing my body and pushing my body I could disappear and at that point you know it had lots of running as police I was about it kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear enough thought if I could just make my body smaller\nLike I Would be OK lead people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years so my body ...\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how does that enter your life\nOh man I'm by the time my body broke my body literally wrote from overuse wrote from not sleep and it broke from not eating the only thing I turn to that brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I've made from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and\nIt was hard to write about that harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I talked about in the book\nYou are implicated in this in a way you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense of purpose\nBy the time and my body broke my body literally wrote from overused and wrote from not sleeping in a row from not eating the only thing I turn to their brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I've made from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and\nIt was hard to write about that harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I talked about in the book\nBecause you are implicated in this in a way you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWell I'm definitely in a perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame when we show people and tell people that the money that we are able to make\nWe aren't able to keep right\nAnd especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win though I told myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home and that's why we're feeling absolutely\nLike trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood\nMy mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually still the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse the addiction the gambling on both sides of my family is something that we still can't really honestly talk about\nI I don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now what do you care what she thinks\nOh I Love my mother to death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be around\nTalk about with my family we can talk about their physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse the addiction the gambling both as my family is something that we still can't really honestly talk about\nI don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now what do you hear what she thinks\nOh I Love my mother's death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be\nA writer or read a teacher at my mother not love me enough to instill a practice at an early age and this book in some way is like her investment\nComing full circle she really believes that reading and writing can save and I don't know if that's true but I Know I'm a writer a norm in American reader and I want it to use my words to try to talk to her and tried to tell her that we can be better\nWe can be better if we give ourselves a chance to walk honestly together and that's that's what I tried to do with this book\nHere say lemon his book heavy than American memoir thanks so much for being with us thank you so much for having
