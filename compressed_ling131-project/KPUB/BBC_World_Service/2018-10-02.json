would still have repair skills\nAre we mistake on\nThe need for the caffeine is that because the older generation of sort of bad is getting lost we are living in um\nA nuclear families and a a via not

nearby it's at all in the corner\nHow'd you get away from you know harming most other businesses you say you're taking a long viewed away from us\nSo in this back if you have professional to better also sitting along with us along with wall India's a so uh it's the first thing is that we are not competing against the professions are better they are not taking their business will be\nHis career my points to go ahead what we find is obviously politicians are but it is about saving the planet but it's also by saving people money\nI'm what we find is that people in all kinds of the day they can't afford to take something along to a professional repair up and get to assess tend to be told to calm the retired so what we do is we do at least the assessment for free\nAnd then maybe we say it is worth taking a tour in Paris so we take care of some of the expense and the person who's going to the professional repair knowing that it can be amended but are we in RIMPAC company time have those games\nBut I think one of the things that should change in the future to get to repair back in to our daily lives is that a professional repairs who've become cheaper\nNow for many people repairing professional repair is too expensive\nTend to be told to calm be retired so what we do is we do at least the assessment for free\nAnd then maybe we say it is we're taking it to retire us so we take out some of the expense and the person who's going to the professional repair uh knowing that it can be amended but are we in RIMPAC company time have those ...\nBut I think one of the things that should change in the future to get to repair back in to our daily lives is that a professional repair should become cheaper\nNow for many people repaired professional repair is too expensive because you have to pay for the labor and labor is text highly so we believe I Believe that uh the tax system should change and that label or should be taxed lower so that's\nA professional repair which would become more attractive\nIn in more cases and that would enable professional repairs to run their business\nAnd um [noise]\nI don't know of course there will be different on labor costs in different policies of well so\nWhat you're talking about that might have a different impacts depending on where you are on the planet\nAfter listening to have any\nOne thing I wanted to talk about that I was you know for the solution to work and just the costs were alone people going out of their way to get stuff from ended in the first place I'm for whatever reason a lot of people just don't think like

during the time yeah fun yeah I've got two kids that have to run and I just called people that really sometimes it's just not practical exactly\nWhat's in it that we put the\nJerusalem cameras stuff you know\nWhen you put a whole new lens and the\nYeah um yeah that will be on the unfortunately um which is a point where they can't use because they grow fungus in general things wrong with him so ... in a bind them could you ...\nYou can try but there's not really much point that it wasn't anything to take it to patients cleaning around would cost a ridiculous amount of money it's a perfectly good that the ultimate equipment it's just\nIt comes down to the fact that that was in ... to about twenty quit in ... or somewhere like that I was a real hair it ten times that much so you've got your your\nYour lenses and we're going to put them in the world is is this little applause has been no I've already been up here not looking here we go\nWe should we be doing things to\nReuse things but it comes down to ... county is does only says she proceeded\nThan you can hardly\nDown to the fact that that was interesting working order about twenty quit or in the right place only by or somewhere like that and to repair it was real hair it ten times that much so you've got your\nYour your legs and say we're going to put them in the world is is this law as long as there's been no I've already been up here not looking here we go\nWe should really be doing things to\nReuse things but it comes down to ... county is designing says she proceeded\nThan you can hardly blame people for buying the right to stuff especially if they knew something was going to be generally cheaper than the old equipment and he does a better job\nSo there are a couple of issues are raised the I Wonder you know ... people have good intentions when it comes to this sort of thing but like often gets in the way they're too busy I just don't have the time\nYeah obviously of people are pretty busy that day to day life\nBut ah there is a lady informed community of people around who are very conscious about their environment that that same background we get in some parts we get ... response because\nPeople want to do that bitch in ah in their surroundings and so that the things they are actually doing a lot of that sort so that things don't go to lunch and\nMust you know I Wonder if you could kind of address ... some of the people here in this RIMPAC cafe you would kind of preaching to the converted they have a reason because you know that already on board with the environmental movement without ... how'd you get the other people how do you correct\nMe other people who as we heard from the people look at the tip you are quite happy just to throw stuff or\nThat's the challenge of course but we hope to get them into the repack cafe when they have something that they really want to hang on to win that when it's a fresh is broken object that cannot be so easily replaced by the

hope to get them into the ... cafe when they have something that they really want to hang on to win that when it's a fresh is broken object that cannot be so easily replaced by the cheap you time and we know that that's what happens\nWhen people come to be back I say they don't really expect things to be read that but when\nThey come here and when they see that it can be done it really opens your eyes and I believe it opens your mind\nTowards a more sustainable society\nWhere they were running short time now ... cafe in Holland is still still going to some people that are fixing a for a machine that pulled apart as a chapter was launched Sean and get him into the workings of the device some final thoughts I'm from ... in a way to solve it can be in ten Fifteen Years time\nWell I think that will be more repack I face because they'll they'll\nBut we also hope that manufacturers realize that product should be repaired Hubble and that they should be a produced in a more sustainable way so that they can be repaired in a proper way\nMaybe you might have a three D. prints are in in in ... so you can principles back home to to fix things and you don't have the baseball strikes a way that will be challenging but um maybe in the future you love that Christmas you Oh yes I mean I think the future of preparing ...\nIs as much around bringing people together and I think coming to RIMPAC cafe yeah it does create a sense of community that togetherness it creates friendship\nShould be re bearable and that they should be a produced in a more sustainable way so that they can be repaired in a proper way maybe you might have a three D. prints are in in ... so you can print just as bad policy to\nTo fix the things that you don't have the baseball strikes a way that will
