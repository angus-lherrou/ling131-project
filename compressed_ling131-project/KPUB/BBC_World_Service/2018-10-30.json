comfortable joking about certain things like the impact of gender based violence of things like homophobia are so\nHuge that we can't even risk to try to minimize those issues because you give a green lights to people who would act out that bigotry in ways that tend to be harmed people\nSo I think that it's necessary for us particularly in disciplines where maybe we're making ... so comedy for example but in film navigating the taboo would look at the difference I think people navigate taboos in ways that show where we stand as a society about those issues was thank you so much

cases hug was found guilty and he will in effect the post war Germany most prolific serial killer\nAnd as you can imagine if he's found guilty well to try to read a unified rate raising concerns and questions for the German health authorities because at the number of deaths that these two clinics on I was very high on during this particular time period\nAnd yet it's a pet is that if found guilty if how gold most responsible for these deaths and he seems to be able to get away with it with impunity the management of both of these clinics\nDo seem to have taken very seriously a tool the fact that high numbers of patients were dying on high numbers of patients will having to be resuscitated so ... it's a doubly shocking trial I think ready for Germany festival the possibility that this man will emerge as the country's most perfect ... serial killer but secondly that\nPotentially the hospital authorities had might have let him get away with it\nIs the evidence emerging how exactly where I'm from ... to do your minister these drugs I was opposed which caused these hot failures without anybody noticing I mean maybe the first couple you might get away with it but how so many\nWell they these are the questions which which have to be on that what's really interesting is that in two thousand and one for example and the clinic which he was walking someone to talk to the masses because they were concerned about the significant increase in the number of herself to patients and deaths at the clinic\nAnd between two thousand and three and two thousand and five the death rate and in the intensive ... one of these hospitals doubled and the use of a particular medication increased by by seven and ... ... ... um he was actually costs in the act of of giving some of this\nBye bye seven

until you do that this country is in serious trouble so I think that's why so many people are out and talking about politics which maybe years ago they didn't they are doing it now if\nThe Democrats win the house [noise] they're going to just impede talk that's our whole mission you're going to stop what's what's going on to raise taxes and move things forward accent\nYou out on a tough to predict the outcome of elections\nPosters and professor Chris for its political science class are busy trying to predict the outcome of the race it's not just the national political environment helping Democrats here the chips and demographics as well voter registration is way up a new Democrats outnumber Republicans four to one\nNew register rents are usually younger voters are and they tend to\nRegistration is way up and new Democrats outnumber Republicans four to one\nNew registering are usually younger voters and they tend to to break Democrat but in this particular cycle that's accentuated I Am so Democrats if these new voters to turn out and there are some signs that they're going to be more likely to turn out really does give a boost to the Democrats in a district like this would have reaching out to voters from the mile campaign\nAnd the final days of his campaign it will come down to which candidate and get their message out best and which party can turn out that there are there I don't know interested in wild campaign and we just have knocking on doors [laughter] which checking in with\nAnother topic reporting unless you've heard another report the economy healthcare to the key issues for Republicans and Democrats a head of the voting next week\nWell what are the polls say about the issues the uppermost in both has minds I've been speaking to leave Maryland Gulf director of the Marist College poll on the front of a cruise and independent polling and election consultant first Kathy what issues does she think will help voters make up their minds\nBut I find the most fascinating\nThing is that the polls suggesting that we have two completely different electorate the Republican electorate which is motivated now say they are motivated now by issues like immigration and the Democratic electorate which is focusing on much more traditional bread and butter issues like\nIn particular this year health care that means that it's an election that is operating basically on two separate tracks\nAnd leave what difference might the pipe bombs and the outrage in Pittsburgh the mountain what difference might they make you think\nI think there's a tone in the closing days with the campaign that can move some of the voters who are on the fence we saw that in the press\nI I think there's a tone in the closing days of the campaign\nThat can move some of the voters who are on the fence we saw that in the presidential campaign after the combing letter and other things are going on in the last week\nWhere people moved into Donald Trump's direction I think right now this is a kind of issues that ... to talk about in partisan terms is you know unfortunate but\nYou know there is a midterm election and if anything this is not the kind of discussion President Trump would want going into the find a week or a vague midterm campaign people are very concerned about what's going on and this affects people's outlook towards the stage of the country\nAnd Lee has the Republican Party come to terms with a Trump presidency I mean across the Republican Party\nWell I think it's interesting because there there there was a note Trump burst for quite a while they have pretty much vanished\nI think it's fair to say that this is Donald Trump's party when you look at the votes for key legislation you look at what Republicans are saying at worst they say\nWell you know he's got some odd characters are things that I Wish she didn't talk about so much or tweet about so much but the agenda I'm really solidly behind there's very few Republicans who are distancing themselves\nOr who are facing election right now or reelection from Donald Trump I mean they they are really you know stepping in line to his administration and his presidency\nI was gonna say if I may it there is relatively little different polling data between people who identify as Republicans and people who tell us that they voted for Donald Trump it's not as if one group is any different from the other on in terms of their political views what we find is that\nIt's not as if one group is any different from the other\nOn in terms of their political views what we find is that Republicans in particular are taking their cues from President Trump and while they may not have an opinion that matches his when an issue first emerges\nAfter a week or two they do in fact echo the Trump position so we've got Donald Trump effectively leading the party and leading those people who who voted for him two years ago [noise] um if I also\nCan add something about we've had shootings in the United states we've had a lot of mass shootings over the years it does relatively little in the long run in terms of changing opinion about gun control about what to do about gun violence\nUm there's usually a short term effect but it it dissipates in in us surprisingly short amount of time a week or two so this coming ten days before an election it's sort of hard to see whether or not it's going to have any meaning to voters when they go to the polls on next Tuesday\nUncover your what about the Republican women because there are lots of things about what this president is alleged to have done to women on the things he says a bug women which might average women even if they are loyal to the Republican pie\nSpent a lotta time over the last few weeks looking at the relationship between gender and partisanship\nAnd how that affects opinion and what seems to be the case is that Republican women and Republican men don't differ very much when it comes to opinion about Donald Trump they did not differ when it came to opinion about\nSupreme Court justice now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh where we see gender differences emerge and be very distinctive is among those people who identify with neither\nBrett Kavanaugh where we see gender differences emerged and be very distinctive is among those people who identify which neither party on independent women are very different from independent meant\nYeah and I I Would add to that uh is clearly more about party than it is about gender with the exception of back critical group of voters\nAnd the basis of both parties are pretty much lock stock and barrel behind their party's candidates that these these independent voters and especially independent women and independent women who may be in the living in the suburbs\nWho are the ones who are if there is a swing group that's probably the the group of voters that zero in on\nWell then let's finish by talking about the Democrats we report quite a lot about changes in the Democratic party I'm much more progressive voices the kind of establishment Clinton nights really losing the influence how do you see that really\n[noise] well I you know [laughter]\nI think there were a couple of primaries that sort of got some headlines I'm not sure that we have anything that's clear looking ahead to let's say twenty twenty at this point\nOther than there's a lot of globalization among the Democratic party I don't think the Democrats up necessarily pick sides as to which part of them is going to dominate the process I think they're a unified in their opposition to President Trump to this point\n... if the Democrats take control of the house of representatives um it's very likely that Nancy Pelosi will continue to be\nThe leader of the party in the house and she is certainly identified as one of the old guard on the other hand she's also a woman which is a distinction that may prove valuable in terms of her contest for house speaker if the Democrats taken Trump\nWoman which is a distinction that may prove valuable in terms of her contest for house speaker if the Democrats taken Trump\nJust a short answer from each of you or how likely is it that the Democrats will take the house or even the Senate late\n[noise] well I think you know the ... and I suspect cat will agree with that I mean the conventional wisdom maybe right this time I saw in the house is likely to go democratic and and the centers like is the Republican\nIs very likely that the national house vote is going to be clearly in favor of the Democrats but the way districts are drawn that may or may not result in a Democratic majority in the house of representative\nThe Democrats have a terrible time trying to reach a majority in the Senate just because there are too many vulnerable red state Democrats who are on the ballot this year\nAnd and very few Republicans who I see that the that Hillary Clinton carried so
