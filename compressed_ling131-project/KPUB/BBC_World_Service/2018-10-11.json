will find over time is this very cheap rockets are going to get extraordinarily efficient at going from the surface of the earth just into space into earth orbit\nAnd from that point we'll have a

Hawking has been\nUm really obsessed with the last four forty years will say and this problem as essentially as you said what happens objects when they fall into a black hole why does the information about these objects guys\nAnd usually we think it's on the outside you can't tell anything about what's inside the black hole and said want something flew into a black hole all information about that

want to step forward I'd say we've shown that and so there's a way of describing all the information in a black hole and not schooled entropy and we've shown that that was a way that we can say this

can recover and if this description and all the information paradox could possibly and actually result this problem and if we could recover or the information in a black hole\nAnd this is not just
