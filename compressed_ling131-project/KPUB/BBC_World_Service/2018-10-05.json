R. C. so I can speak from my experience from the last outbreak or\nThis is a scary disease right and I think as health care workers you must see that the the men's um amount of care that we must take with a personal protective equipment with\nThe with the isolation up of patients all of this tends to be quite alien and you're trying to convince people who are suffering from a disease that potentially has has a high mortality to lead their family members to be\nTaken away at a time when they'd rather spend those last moments with their family members and so I I think all of those are already dynamics that are in play to create trust and um\nI I think to add to that I think particularly Andy RC are looking at an environment where there has been active conflict for a long period of time so you're asking people to come into care to to become stationary and and to give up that amount of trust you know to to outsiders wage which is I've got to be hard to begin\nIt's interesting though because I could understand that maybe in twenty fourteen when all of this was happening and as you say there was the outbreak and in places like Sierra Leone surly own and people were still trying to come to terms with the fact that they cannot properly say goodbye to a loved one who's died they can't touch them they can't bury them\nNPR see you're looking at an environment where there has been active conflict for a long period of time you're asking people to come into care to to become stationary um and and to give up that amount of trust you know to to outsiders\nWage which is I got to be hard to begin\nWith it's interesting though because I could understand that maybe in twenty fourteen when all of this was happening and as you say there was the outbreak and in places like Sierra Leone certainly own and people were still trying to come to terms with the facts that they cannot properly say goodbye to a loved one who's died they can't touch them they can't bury them\nBut the deer or see for example that had many Ebola outbreaks and in the past ... ... you would expect that and it's become part of the general knowledge that\nYou know the ... by now people know that it's so dangerous that you shouldn't be in contact with with the body of someone who's died of a bull\nI I think that those are two very different community and you don't know if the people who are involved currently had that knowledge permeates through this communities right I mean if the knowledge is there it's not so much potentially a knowledge issue as much as there is a trust issue\nI mean think about climate change ... him and it's the same thing like you have so many people have the science and may not believe that it's the same thing here where they may have been told it but it's in the end it it comes to building long term bridges to those communities and and and having those already in place before a crisis like this happens\nAnd I think um that's why you're sort of seeing that district and not and and I think these are communities like I said that has been affected by conflict for a long period of time that may not have that trust at based on\nHow do you prepare there was a health worker\nUm to to care for their patients or to go into this area for the patience to go to go in the area but also to face this kind of of of backlash it's\nI Can't even imagine I can tell you

was a health worker\nUm to to care for the patients or to go into this area for the patients to go out to go in the area but also to face this kind of of of backlash\nIt I Can't even imagine I can tell you just without in in the early on when I was taking care of patients it was hard to begin with because you're providing care in this area you know strenuous situation that takes a lot of physiological reserve but it also alter the kind of care that you can provide you know it alters the relationship you can develop with the patient because you're in these\nGuards you know these personal protective equipment\nAnd then to add to all of that I think you're also acting in a in a in an environment where you're worried for your own safety and I think patients can sense that rate and and and we do our best to make that connection and so all of those things combined in in addition to sort of\nUm having going into a community that you you have not care for the past this is why national healthcare workers training national healthcare workers and making them available and making giving them the resources is probably the best strategy in the future because\nThey have that

I spoke to her a bit earlier about these kinds of attacks from people who are still denying that this virus exists\n[laughter] it's a scary disease right and I think at health care workers you must see the immense amount of care that we must take with a personal protective equipment with the with the isolation of of patients all of this\nTends to be quite alien and you're trying to convince people who are suffering from a disease that potentially is has a high mortality to lead their family members to be taken away at a time when they'd rather spend those last moments with their family members and so I\nI think all of those are already dynamics that are in place to create trust and um\nI I think to add to that I think particularly Andy RC are looking at an environment where there has been active conflict for a long period of time you're asking people to come into care to to become stationary um and and to give up that amount of trust you know to to outsiders\nWage which is I got to be hard to begin\nIt's interesting though because I could understand that maybe in twenty fourteen when all of this was happening and as you say there was the outbreak and in places like Sierra

that it's so dangerous that you shouldn't be in contact with with the body of someone who's died of a bull\nI I think that those are two very different community and you don't know if the people who are involved currently had that knowledge permeates through this community is right and even if the knowledge is there it's not so much potentially a knowledge issue as much as there is a trust issue\nI mean think about climate change ... him and it's the same thing or like you have so many people have the science and may not believe that it's the same thing here where they may have been told it but it's in the end it it comes to building long term bridges to those communities and and having those already in place before a crisis like this happens\nAnd I think that's why you're sort of seeing that district and not and and I think these are communities like I said that has been affected by conflict for a long period of time that may not have that trust at based on\nHow do you prepare there was a health worker um to to care for their patients or to go into this area here for the patience to go out to go in the area but also to face this kind of of of backlash it\nI Can't

takes a lot of physiological reserve\nBut it also alters the kind of care that you can provide you know it alters the relationship you can develop with the patient because you're in these guards you

and and we do our best to make that connection and so all of those things combined in in addition to sort of\nUm having going into a community that you you have not care for the past this is why national healthcare workers training national healthcare workers and making them available and making giving them their resources is probably the best strategy in the future because\nThey have that

S. writing a thesis on the intersection between culture and eating disorders she's from Hong Kong but says the cultural factors she's identified applied to much of China\nIn Chinese culture you might be expected to eat everything that is put in front of you but let's say the media that\nI was being approached by at the time was saying like oh being finished better all these kinds of different like moral connotations that are attached to weight loss and wait in general and so it would be like oh am I supposed to respect my culture\nAnd you know eat everything that's put in front of me\nPatients that are attached to weight loss and wait in general and so it would be like oh am I supposed to respect my culture\nAnd you know eat everything that's put in front of me or do I want to be quote unquote successful in terms of what the media is prescribing it as do I want to be the best and of course in my competitive mindset of the of course I Want to be the best um and so there was this weird conflict going on and\nDo you think there's anything about women's role in society that comes into play here\nYeah for sure [noise] women are expected to be like\nSmaller and not only in the way that they behave but also like physically small even though I can say that in Hong Kong it's already more progressive than like maybe other Chinese communities in the sense that women are allowed to take charge of their husband [laughter]\nIf you are slightly larger and behavior or in the ice just like you know you are\nA slightly more muscular woman even if you will be like stared at and I'm even myself as a woman who like lift weights I Do get a lot of weird stairs and I have\nHad like doctors tell me things like oh if you have too many muscles no one's going to want to marry you and he was a doctor it's so normalized on that you know people who are on like the ... or even expressing disorder symptoms\nNo one really diagnosis that it's only when when girls are dying oftentimes when when people are dying that's when they're diagnosed with eating disorders\nStaff told me it wasn't until she moved to the U. S. the university and she had people talk about eating disorders as a mental rather than physical illness\nPeople will say oh I have a headache instead of like I'm I'm not feeling you know emotionally well today and that's what I Would I ... I deeply felt during my eating sorter but I was like oh just it's just because like my head hurts or my ...\nEmotionally well today and that's what I Would I get I deeply felt during my eating sorter but I was like oh it's just it's just because like my head hurts or my stomach hurts because these are the things that most people express their discomfort in like that's the language that we use\nStaff told me that even the ... used to describe eating disorders themselves didn't fail right\nThe Chinese translation of anorexia it's actually teaching food disorder I think it's just very misleading the way that\nUm it's name in my particular case um I I Love food with like my whole entire heart like food is life and so my eating disorder um developed largely because I thought that if I could control myself in front of the things that I I really loved and\nUm I used to eat with like know that you know then I could control my entire life\nStaff feels very strongly that sets an aspects of Chinese couch I make young people take to leave honorable and eating disorders\nI wanted whether a psychiatrist would agree with her analysis dope ... works at Peking University hospital in Beijing which has the only place world specializing in eating disorders and the whole of China she told me she's worried the cases are on the rise across the country\nIn the mail that mail you cook the food you there isn't reliable data available for reference old I can say is a clinical level we do feel particularly huge pressure as there are more and more people like this\nMy experience tells me it's impact is huge it has destroyed too many families ...\n... there was one of the we used to think that eating soldiers were middle class problem all only found in people who are meant to be rich but now it seems the problem is also seen in rural\nMm their animals on the we used to think that eating soldiers were middle class problem or only found in people who are relatively rich but now it seems the problem is also seen in rural and working class people\nI also see an increasing number of boys who are ill they say that they want to look like the idols often um South Korean style to a very slim and somewhat feminine looking\n[noise] is that enough awareness of what to eating disorders are in China do patients and their families and friends recognize that they have a problematic enough to people realize what these illnesses are\n... they have the ... the issue\nHow should I put it the awareness level is not very consistent at his some patients families might realized very early on but they're not as it might take more than ten years to realize there is a problem and before they realize it they could have been treating it as a ... a logical organic logical disease\nThe feeling of shame is very strong so many people are not willing to face it and currently there's not enough attention to it in schools who pretend not to see when a person becomes a risky than\nHow much do you think that ... west ... contributes to the problem is eating disorders and China\nShe's on the date on ... found out the influence from western culture is certainly quite great but I think it also has a little to do with the rapid development of China's economy nowadays there's food everywhere and China is a country of gloom A's\nSo impatient hospitalized it is easy to get better but once they get out of hospitals they have faced with all kinds of food temptations\nThat are currently notes of extremely slim Chinese and South Korean singers and movie stars on young people want to be like them it's hard to say whether this is west and influence but I think China's new found openness is definitely an important country\nYoung people want to be like them it's hard to say whether this is west and influence but I think China's new found openness is definitely an important contributing factor\nAnother crucial factor is the over protective of Chinese families when it comes to their children so when the children start to excessively squander food and money and then voted to tone up\nThe parents will try to let them be ... and I don't see why you Rona China's highly competitive country and resources are still relatively ... gas\nSo if you want to be an outstanding person and that expectation is put on you by your family from childhood that means you need to be competitive in every aspect\nMy patients were old really outstanding individuals before they got sick who was seeking extreme affection in every aspect winning is will they won't and pleading controlling their weight\nAnd what about the status of women in society does that have any instance\nUm she'd like ... we are no longer in the Confucius culture in which women was totally expected to attend to their husbands and raise children\nGrowing up goes are expected to do as good as boys including academic schools and when it is time to start a family the expectation of marriage and children directly fools on the go\nSo girls may feel heavy button and there was a view that goes who suffer from eating disorders of trying to take control of their independence\nThere are many cultural factors that make young people particularly vulnerable to eating disorders according to talk to me and she said one of the concern with me that diet pills that potatoes and direct takes off ... easily available\n... diet pills all run and in China ... packaging ... actual production you have no idea what ingredients are in them off the\nPills on the run and in China cheap packaging ... production\nYou have no idea what ingredients are in them off to using them you might experience diarrhea insomnia tremors sweating into even psychotic symptoms like loose and nations on the online shopping website to talk about how they're all vomit to just being sold with instruction videos\nYou can push the cheap into your stomach and clean out what you have eaten\nBut no one is doing anything about it and there's no law over regulation to restrict such things\nYou don't have to look very hard on line to see what she's concerned about\nAnd to find disturbing social media trends including cycles challenges why young women paste pictures to show that waste can be hidden by the way it's a piece of a full pay per old legs and narrow up than the length of and I find six\nOverlap from a few minutes of set ching so what would the women have MS is herself in China's social media find\nI spoke to men yeah pizza China's social trend watcher and the editor in chief of what's on why people a website to providing insights into one of the country's most populous social media platforms\nOne of the things that has become really big in China recently is the so called big stomach kings sluggers huh that's the Chinese literal translation but what it is it's basically extreme eating live streams\nAnd anytime I ... for me and the rest of the ... sorry start at ... ... thanks for

material if I work as social behavior and his how we communicate with each other and society how we are together and of course that's the only made by people\nYou wrote not long ago you said a lot is an expression of mice so it's not something to be collected something might find that a little narcissistic [laughter]\nWell I didn't meant is about me I mean that I should be the place and wish everybody can look at themselves and when I said not to be collected I mean that we have to pay attention\nOn what is the role of art that I I it's not only or should not me primarily some to invest in economically but something to dive in emotionally to open your cell phone\nSo much of what you do and we'll talk about the specific pieces installations and performances so much of it seems to me in some ways ... to see it\nIt's about me I mean that I should be the place and wish everybody can look at themselves and when I said not to be collected I mean that we have to pay attention\nOn what is the role of art art art is not all the or should not be primarily some to invest in economically but something to dive in emotionally to open yourself all\nOn so much of what you do and we'll talk about the specific fishes installations and performances so much of it seems to me in some ways closer to see it than it is to any other awful is that because from your youth you you have been preoccupied with performance\nBut I can see that for you as an artist it was important to do this even trust and you'll security or safety your freedom but\nBy inviting other Cubans to take part in this sort of formative autistic experiment you were putting them in danger as well\nWell it is true that there are consequences in Cuba when you step in and you speak your mind [noise]\nIn the case of

statement and I invite people to be together and think together how to create that political statement\nYes I didn't feel I feel responsible more than anything\nAnd I felt and it's interesting because every time when I was in prison and I say you have today they're all going to say you have to liberate my audience you'll have to live at the red ... out of the work I never told than those who are disadvantaged so there were like\nWhy because I was the fund that defined that this was in our piece\nWhy because see in Cuba otherwise I Will have been a life prison\nTracing but I Wonder if we'll

off but I'm Wondering\nWhere's the beauty West is such a ... west enjoy mhm and your art and maybe for you that's not important\nIt is important of course is important\nBecause I have a sense of ... of course in my work with a sense of aesthetic in doesn't come from looking at something it comes on what you feel about being part of something uh\nSo what do you when you discover you could speak for yourself and your discovered it can be better than you think you can be when you discover that you are not afraid that's pitiful\nAsking about fear\nBecause when you've been picked up and you've been several times I Wonder if you do for you [noise]\nKnow that something missing just unjust and injustice something field is not something mental I listen to me is something they feel is happening to you when you feel that the law doesn't exist when you're in a demolition understand that the law doesn't exist\nBetter than you think you can be when you discover that you are not afraid that's pitiful\nAsking about fear\nBecause when you've been picked up and you've been written several times ... how much ... the few [noise]\nWhat happened is when you\nKnow that's something ... think just unjust and injustice something and feel\nIsn't that something ... suddenly it's something they feel is happening to you when you feel that the law doesn't exist when you ... you understand that the

artists in Cuba whatever the state says whatever that particular awful are required to in a sense ... stumbled approval from the ministry of culture to allow them to continue to work\nAbsolutely and

whatever they think is helping you to do the art or you are using the process of showing the art [noise]\nAnd unfortunately I think that creates promise not meaning that will be a huge space and ... a vacuum that can be filled with corruption the people in Cuba the interrogators and then when it's of course already have\nSentence me as an artist ... once I enter contests I'm not an artist\nThey decide that for you that's up from a tree forty nine the government decide who is who is not an artist and what is and what is not\nOur when they um walk into the language they speak so frankly about what you see is the failure of the system and the ... to bus system on ideas on the expression on creative typically I don't even know that when you go back home you won't be put back in the police so\nWell I guess it is every time I come home since Nineteen twenties Fifteen Everytime I enter the airport I'm stopped and I have to weigh one two or three hours on to the secret police come and interrogated me in\n... what is and what is not when they um walk to the interview\nLike this they speak so frankly about what you see is the failure of the system and the bed meaning effect of the system on ideas on expression on creativity how do you know that when you go back home you won't be put back in the police so\nWell I guess it is every time I come home and I'd twenties to Fifteen Everytime I enter the airport I'm stopped and I have to weigh one two three hours on to the secret police come and interrogated me in when I go in and when I go out sometime in between as well [noise]\nBut it's okay I have nothing to hide I'm not doing anything wrong\nAnd all I only want to blink you'll have to be free and to speak their mind that's nothing wrong about it as\nYou said lots of interesting things to me about the relationship between your creative impulse and you'll political feelings which clearly very strong and you say is your daughter of the revolution [noise]\nYou didn't want particularly interesting piece not so long ago where you know there's a sort of autistic experiment that you are going to run for president in Cuba\nNo depression last us kind of me is what I actually sat in the deal was that the costs are led shows are coming in because are completely controlled by the government [noise]\nMeet together with a group of activists want it to tell every Cuban to proposed himself as a candidate and I said well if I ask you to\nDo it I'll do it too I don't want to put the fire and then I'm like here so I say well I started by proposing myself but I never said precedent but\nI in a way this whole interviews about this blood line between your activism you're off and your politics frankly given the sorts of people we see injury in politics\nCompletely controlled by the government [noise] meet together with a group of activists wanted to tell every Cuban to proposed himself as a candidate\nAnd I said well if I ask you to do it I'll do it too I don't want to begin the fire and then I'm like here so I said well I started by proposing myself but I never said precedent\nBut I in a way this hole in the news about this bloodline reading your activism you're all on your politics\nFrankly given the sorts of people we see him drink politics today who don't ever political career but come into politics from outside of the things they can run a country and ... and just one person I get emails from [laughter] why why are we allowed to finance area okay good but the point is\nOkay you know the politicians but you've always been the occupied with politics and the reason why why 'cause you're beautiful to share with you well\nBelieve me I said let's just say somebody like Tom becoming a president I think a lot of people who thought they could be a person to sniff thought twice [noise] but um\nFor me is not important to be in a position of power or to\nEvery lights on me for me the important thing is to make sure that people that there is an educational process where the people were everybody start understanding how it feels to be themselves\nIs very hard because I think we have been Fifteen Years\nWhere even the father's the parents are the sensors of the kids you didn't have to go to school already in the house somebody say don't say that you're going to get in trouble shut up so well that's what I'm interested that how can we criticize social project\nThat indicates people into the best they can be done about ... right now\nStill completely blown away by the story of you and your phone\nUnderstanding how it feels to be themselves\nIs very hard because I think we have been Fifteen Years\nWhere even the father's the parents are the sensors of the kids you didn't have to go to school already into how somebody say don't say that you're going to get in trouble shut up so well that's what I'm interested that how can we criticize social project\nThat educates people into the best they can be ... by now\nI'm Still completely blown away by the story of you and your father but it just strikes me in the course of this into everything you've described to me about your experiences in Cuba makes me actually\nThink that you wouldn't be the authors do you all today how did you not been\nThrough all of the experiences you've been through in Cuba or if you've been brought up with the relative freedom of of being a a performance installation creative person\nIn London you probably would have to be honest you all today but it is important\nNot to romanticize censorship and it's important not to idealize a moment solve repression where people are more credit because of it but also let's be clear\nNot on the Cuba has problems that we're sort of injustices and it's full of irregularities that I'm very I'm just\nSo I'm sure I Will have done something\nAnd in the end when you're always regarded cucumbers your home base your creative center or could you end up leaving Cuba bowing\nThat are very unjust\nSo I'm sure I Will have done something\nAnd in the end we always regard cucumbers your home base your creative center all could you ended up leaving behind\nIn turn ...\nOkay well let's walk through this do that you were just describing forests or at least so and um yeah we're heading down I mean I'm ah about five foot eleven and it's not really even for me so just imagining them being able to get Olson ... through hair back in the day it's some it's a bit of a stretch now isn't it was so I just said\nFrom the start uh the the state level it's kinda like one point five meters from where we stand now [noise]\nRight we've come a few minutes we'll go away from the museum and listen to it looks like we're going to jump on a boat to get us across this really quite narrow canal but we still need to get a surprise to cross\nYeah because they used to be a bridge connecting to\nHire a but it was destroyed during for African and and since then so now we have to walk across the sport to go to not that comfortable let's do it [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's also a printing company here\n... okay so we're still

being twenty five years of open society here and however much sometimes it seems that we're going back to the past let's\nSay on a human level things have changed so much hair that it's hard to think of us going backwards again I mean you know we took it off about the penetration of state media here and how that influences people's opinions and it certainly does but\nI look at what's happening recently with all the\nUh digging in investigation that's being done by Jen let's say in Moscow Russian journalist primarily a digging up on the Internet information about people who are supposed to be secret agents you know things have changed people's minds that has changed\nOr there are tempted to reverse the the clocks and and to go back to the thinking of old but in practical terms I think that's a very different difficult close to set back\nWhat then has been the reaction to these very detailed allegations from the Dutch government about this attempt to penetrate the chemical weapons inspections really obesity W\nThat is an old school reaction not ... dismissal and denials from Russia I mean the the ah the ... that's been coming from the west I think as slightly uh surprised most go up but it's replied in it in its usual way in a way that we've seen ever since\nI guess getting back to climate annexation of Crimea then ... then mh Seventeen and they stay there ... all the rest of it is all about saying that we didn't do its and accusing the west in this case the spy mania the foreign ministry\nPut out a statement last night saying you know it looks like every Russian who has a mobile phone can now be accused of being a spy so they're not dissecting the evidence that saying there is no evidence but you know ... that's evidence ... standing up our selves independently

off as usual\nBut those investigative journalist so you mentioned and they've been very brave or do they have the opportunity to continue asking those questions about for example the colonel who they are doing to fight earlier as being one of those who was in children\nBut we do and we're here and that's what we do so yes are there are opportunities and every time there's an opportunity that someone had to take it and it's Russian journalist and it's the foreign press and I'm not so job I guess yeah so that people online in particular this new generation of online investigate the investigative reporters who were going through databases who are finding information and then there's people like us who head out to the\nNine time zones or whatever it was far east of Russia\nAnd trying to find people on the ground and when we do that we do find them we find the evidence say for example the allegation that or at least one of the men accused of the ... poisoning is a military
