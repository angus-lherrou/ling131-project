World Service with me Judy America in this last half hour of the program we'll hear from a senior U.S Senate is talking about the death of the Saudi journalist ... plus the American jazz singer Madeline pay rue about how much politics should ones music reflect\nA roast when I when it hit a news report from the Sunday Times Danny sorts kinds of Roger as his secretary general of civic us Johannesburg based on bread organization for various civil society groups which you are leaving at the end of the year that's right how do you reflect on your time\nWell I've seen that for six years and they've been pretty depressing um I mean I think if you look at the evidence of what's happening on civic freedoms around the world for example is roughly because monitor we you know we've documented serious threats to one or more civic freedoms that you know the rights that we have to speak out take action come together\nUm there have been serious threats in more than a hundred countries and just in the last year including some mature democracy so\nFor ... and that's about ... protecting promoting citizen action the we live in some more ring times\nA resident of brief or do you about a I have the Seventy times newspaper with me a big splash on page H written by you this is reflecting on the march in London yesterday by people voting for a second referendum on the deal for Brexit when you write something like that given that you know that would have been covered on the television and radio extensively by the time I pick it up\nReferendum on the deal for Brexit when you write something like that given that you know that would have been covered on the television and radio extensively by the time I pick it up and read what are you trying to you trying to say and do\nWell that's more of a sketch I ... rarely\nAnd say it's a little sort of reflective vigil stories are coming out of people you yes which I always think it's a nice a nice touch that is that you Kevin you find that people haven't found\nAny making life lazy people do you still want to read it because you're quite right by the by that time effort nice to have as much as they you know when you've got a report on something like that is not as they what you're saying it's revelation unless something enormous happens that\nUm and and you're covering it from that and science say so yes it's it's much more of a sketch and and that's quite fun to write but it doesn't mean oversee or trying to follow and you'll find as a mom on\nSending in your cafe and which is never again when you got that many people it presents a majestic challenge because and everybody you know you couldn't get email because it was so many people that that was a little bit tricky but ... is that\nIt's there it's on page eight [laughter]\nUh it's eight minutes past seven GMT President Trump has confirmed that the U.S plans to withdraw from a key nuclear weapons treaty with Russia he said Moscow had repeatedly violated the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty\nWhile America had owner did Russia has denied those US claims so who's right President Trump or the Russians Daryl Kimball is the executive director of the arms control association that is a U.S based known parties on organization which promotes public understanding of arms control policies\nThe United states beginning in two dozen fourteen alleged in I Believe it's correct that Russia tested a ground launch cruise missile beyond the five hundred kilometer range limit allowed by the treaty and began to deploy a small number of these missiles probably\nI'm for it to ... but you know what the clearing the imitation is it doesn't take very long for for the you know the public investment fund to boast about a hundred and Ninety billion dollars of assets on the management\nThat they have an presumably that's the game and money talks and with so many people so many countries desperate for an investment the Saudis have surplus money\nAbsolutely one of these investments and and you look at the trade between for example of Britain and Saudi this full point two billion a to lose ... pounds of of of five billion dollars of of annual trade\n... at the trade but it was as much in favor of the u._k. so that translates into about a hundred thousand jobs in the u._k. as a result of trade with Saudi are we prepared to give this up an roasted price rose means\nWell one of the things they let me think Britain leaving me is that we and our I'm with\nNo surprise residents\nWell one of the things they love Britain leaving me is that we and our I'm willing to skate neither other like set we have I Would argue I mean as somebody like ... having a midlife crisis leaving leaving never liable\nAnd ... now and getting in finding set us all lays out there and more dangerous friends and I think um willingness to ... ...\nAh obviously leaving the biggest market in the wild\nAbsolutely I mean it to the ultimate question is how much does Britain or any other country wants to be the policemen of the world is this a wrong or is that is that to global responsibility and when we say global that includes Russia and China who work on the church was different set of values than we in the west operate\nOn what though if more emerges I mean clearly there is talk of more evidence emerging from turkey um if some reports a right to some of the evidence could be extremely gruesome would that change things\nWill murder is always gruesome regardless of how to take space um and I think uh the Turks have been politicizing the way they've been dropping and dripping information and then saying don't don't take this into account that's authorized leaks so it's important to look\nAt a at the whole thing in context social she was murdered and he was um as as Saudi Arabia has said was murdered by at least senior officials and on and I think we'll just have to wait for the results of the investigation budge Saudis and how's the world would react to it\nAnd of course not even pulled out when we knew what was happening in Yemen they rule still getting very happening what what what do you think about that\nWell I mean the Yemen crisis is is is another one you've got it it's it's not the subject that's operating there it's Iran with who says if the straits of of um of merit\nIt's another one you've got it it's it's not the subject is operating there it's Iran with who says if the straits of of um of merit in the south is Red Sea all closed at Fifteen Percent of global trade goes through the straits that means massive inflation that's going to affect us all\nGoes through the it's it's ... you know you could argue that Saudis actually fighting the war of the west of war because of the south is news and the Iranians close the straits it's us in the west who will be having to pay the price for it one\nOf the things we're told about why the west supports the Saudi regime is the sort of fragile and complexity of political settlement in the middle east what would happen if the west actually took the bold step of not propping up the Saudi regime\nWell I mean that's what's happened in two thousand and three with Iraq and that led to the creation of ISIS and we're still dealing with that I think it'd be much worse if the same thing is repeated with Saudi\nBecause it's not early Sunni extremists who wouldn't exploit this but the Shiite extremist and and and you you have and then you've got the oil um we have severe political and economic repercussions that will take many many years even longer than the Iraq War repercussions from steel which will still dealing with no\nThank you very much into becoming monitors and I'm sure they simply as we look ahead to that event in Saudi Arabia this week it's a twenty two minutes past the hour we'll get away with some music because Madeline pay ... is an American singer\nBorn in the state of Georgia she grow up in New York and California but for many years she has been living in Paris\nDi di di do know\nIs ... the final track of her new album and submit so originally from up having bipolar Edwin from the time of the world war two the album was mostly written in the U.S during the last presidential campaign that and when Madeleine came in she told me\nFrom the top of the world war two the album was mostly written in the U.S during the last presidential campaign there when Madeleine came in she told me how the political debates at the time left a mark on that album\nYeah I Am and then on the line and try to some guy\nSon's a gun\nIn early to thousands sixteen we started doing smaller venues and little clubs around the United states\nThroughout the primaries and caucuses 'em and various debates and the ins and outs of the day to day news that I felt was worth addressing a little bit in our shows just so that I could introduce a song and say\nThis is dedicated to anyone who's not represent doesn't feel represented by the government and then do the song and we'd get laughs in some places in other places we'd get like an angry jeers but the state of our shows just felt the atmosphere of of politics was unavoidable\nAnd different from any that you've experienced before a\nLittle bit I mean the fact that the news\nInvades our lives in a way that it didn't do years ago and certainly not Twenty years ago when I started doing these little clubs and things like that and yeah so I just started to feel like it would be great if some of the stuff we could talk about it instead of just trying to find a clever introduction to a song and\nSimultaneously Larry climbed who I've worked with many times over the years and had just started by saying you know let's come over here and let's try this thing where we all sit in a room together five of us and\nThat's what this was a group of musicians of rights as all collaborating effect yeah almost you've been to the dining room\nLess and less if this was a group of musicians of writers all collaborating effect yeah or even to go back in time and\nChange change your mind all the time I'm In long lines\nUm my hero [noise] um\nI mean one thing that struck me because I Know there was one particular review that I wrote which talked about I think I don't know what was your comment or somebody a alongside you talking about the danger of being\nI think the word was pre ... ... and it's a difficult balance isn't it because you want people to enjoy the music and the lyrics with it but if they don't necessarily agree with the center but it gets more difficult\n[noise] yeah but I think even beyond that it's just not artistic to stand up and say you know here's what I think and you should agree with me and if I keep yelling at you because I've got the stage you know I've got the podium because he ... paid to come and see the show or whatever it is that they gave you\nThis audience it's so presumptuous to think that people want to be told what's right but it's\nFar more artistic to ask a question and it's more fair and it's just more right oh birds they\nSang at the ... de\nDa de\n...\nKnow do what he's doing\nThey're meant to tells personal stories and uh that each one of these stories is you know these are meant to be such a sort of like life life experience\nAnd uh that each one of these stories is you know\nThese are meant to be such a sort of like life\nLife experience type stories like down on me where you just can't get out of a circle of debt or find some kind of financial ruin that might have just happened by accident you don't really know [noise] so yeah these are all stories that I think are relevant to the ... my experience of America is and their stories that I I think I intended\nTo at least for the most part say hey let's let's talk about this and um\nYou know the song and some wasn't the starting point but it ended up being the summary\nAnd ended up there for being the title and so this recording of this poem by ... carries the almost like the book and sort of like the counterweight to answer them in this quest for what is democracy and freedom and what does it mean\nYou didn't grow up in front of you spend a significant portion of your life in person I think when you were there that had a huge influence on the style of music that you have gone on to to play it before I moved\n[noise] it's ironic because it gave me more of a understanding of how important my American music that you know is to me and ... some of the things that I loved about that I Love about it\nYou know of course also there's just a genuine appreciation for American jazz in Europe that does not get the same time of day you know at home and\nMuslim ... she'll be performing in the u._k. in November you'll hear more of a music for the end

mean we're looking at the limits of human endurance and particularly long distance running we all know that we can\nRight I went on to that place I mean we're looking at the limits of human endurance and potentially long distance running we all know that we can't run long distances at a fast as possible sprint pace how come up ... let us do that\nWhat we have in the body as essentially two systems of energy delivery so we have aerobic metabolism which is using molecular oxygen from the atmosphere we didn't have any robot metabolism which all energy transfer proceeds not involving oxygen\nLet's say you could sprint for American the American world record but then be Seventeen minutes rather than just over a hundred and twenty minutes\nAnd the reason the body can't do that is because you channel supply die energy rapidly enough using the aerobics system aerobic metabolism is quite slow whereas an aerobic metabolism is extremely fast you know your classic and aerobic events that a hundred meters two hundred meters four hundred meters\nAnything above that it's the aerobic system the predominant\nIs there a speed limit what are the limiting factor as\nWell in distance running we like to think of three parameters the first of all those is you'll maxima law says you're not take all your video to max as we sometimes call it which is if you like the size of your in June and that's determined largely by the size of your house\nThen you've got the ... threshold and the ... site threshold is if you live how much of an engine can utilize before he's there are consequences for third parameter is your running economy so what is your engines fueled economy\nAnd you want the highest video to max possible the highest lactate threshold possible and so to be as economical was possible if you put those three together you'll run a false now from the marathon as we know of Puerto record for example has amongst the best\nFemale video to max the best female lacked the threshold

things that happen as a result of that or are we we're beginning to realize for example in the way that people choose to fight 'em and how that can be affected yeah\nSo I mean and huge unintended

news as supposed banks and then the whole financial system began crushing down\nWe're all watching this and in some sense struggling trying to understand what was going on there were similar a sense of students being very ...\nAnd what they would come and say is can you help us understand what's going on we're not learning to enact classes and they were right they were not getting in their economics classes a set of tools\nOn we're not learning this in our classes and they were right they were not getting in their economics classes a set of tools that was helping them to understand the day by day dimensions that the crisis and Christmas was a good sort of catalyst because\nAt Christmas people are thrown together with their relatives and one typical question is well your studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually not covering that you're not classes\nThe fact that students around the world continue to be two courses which has seemed to weigh a financial crisis was actually raging all around them brought home to many out of touch the profession has become windy calling is most of widely used university textbooks\nIn retrospect she admits these books must not subjects but we usually important in terms of understanding the crush\nThings as basic as how find them works\nI can put my hand up I had to spend a lot of time writing macroeconomics textbooks\nWhich we're addressing particular issues in the macro economy so the the one published in two thousand and six was all about inflation targeting and there was no section on banks all the financial system\nAnd this was very typical of the way I'm not correct comics was taught in universities around the world\nAnd has not changed it has changed I rose and your textbook that that really catches it in other words with my co author we felt really challenged and I think that was true not just about that of many others\nAnd if you're wondering why we should care about what's going on economics classrooms remember these are the people who graduate and going to steal the financial systems in which we will depend if they get bad advice and can wreck your economy the growing frustration felt bus\nThe financial systems in which we will depend if they get bad advice and can wreck your economy\nThe growing frustration felt by students and the teachers around the world has given rise to a number of new initiatives to overhaul economics courses in one of these Wendy and many others are building a new free online curriculum known as\nCool this was a concern I feel passionately about and so I have to put my own hand up here I chose the core charity\n\nBut will it different curriculum be enough\nIn finance as in so many other areas the person who pays the piper calls the tune bankers and politicians founded convenient to listen to those economists who argued for deregulation and who's morals allowed them to justify the housing bubble [noise]\n... and the comics professor at Stanford University in the U.S\nShe's frustrated by economists taking refuge in theory and saying what people want to hear well turning a blind eye to the bond even criminal behavior by bank because that can freshman financial stability\nThere is definitely a problem it is a very very shocking they remain really fantastic cut in the sense of how they explored the system but in the end ignoring the biggest elephants in the room and all the flood incentives and all the deception and fraud and all the excessive\nEndangerment sets in tire early unnecessary it's just taken is given it's just what they accept the system and does she think this has changed following the crisis\nYou hear is more about you know very shockingly you know stuff happens and you know we're doing our best and it's going to be sort of the big groups at crisis just wakes you up because you notice it and then he's like oh you know we really had terrible regulations before\nIt's going to be sort of the big groups at crisis just wakes you up because you notice it and then he's like oh you know we really had terrible like this before let's fix it but then the fix is really not quite right but then you just kind of move on and say well I did my bass can prevent it stuff happens\nIt's not much of a comfort to think of the economists could be happy with the idea that stuff happens some things clearly going wrong for professor Joseph Stiglitz comes down to the continued reliance record them is on the totally unrealistic notion that the market is always right\nHe dates this right back to the founder of modern economics Adam Smith\nThey were blinded by the same ideology that had blinded the central banks and other policymakers the blind believed that markets work well on their own unfettered markets will deliver for wellbeing for all citizens has been\nAt the center of you might say conservative economics sings Adam Smith\nAdam Smith actually understood that wasn't true\nI think it would be horrified at the abuse of his ideas he recognized that ah whenever businesses get together that conspire against the public interest to raise prices but somehow and the two hundred and some years after Adam Smith the conservatives I'd miss\nUsed his ideas\nEven more astounding was the fact that beginning in the Nineteen fifties sixties seventies and my own work or in the seventies and eighties advances in economics explained\nWhy markets often don't work the reason that invisible hand often seemed invisible was it wasn't there\nThe notion of an invisible hand and supremacy of markets is based on the idea that if everyone ... and ...\n... was it wasn't there\nThe notion of an invisible hand and supremacy of markets is based on the idea that if everyone buys and sells things in their self interest and trades freely without government intervention everyone will be better off\nJust Stiglitz won the Nobel Prize for economics by then to find some of the ways in which the key assumptions about perfect markets offload the presumption that everyone has all the information they need to make the right decisions just isn't borne out by experience\nThe notion of asymmetric information is very simple it's just that somebody knows something that somebody else doesn't know and the banks obviously knew some things that others didn't know about their bad behavior the banks knew that they were engaged in market manipulation\nOthers didn't\nThe fact is that the people who want to believe that markets were perfect close their eyes at in Dr needed their students\nThat markets basically worked perfectly\nWider economists expect humans to behave like rational calculating machines despite all evidence to the country\nFor some this tendency indicates a key problem at the heart of economics which is to explain human behavior as if it were signs and the only works if you imagine all humans are the same responding in the same way an old contributions to the economy can be counted\nJournalists country muscles book who cooked announcements dinner argues the traditional economic theories and methods only makes sense if you imagined humanity to be self centered so unlike humans as almost a different species in fact some economists have given the species a name Homer economic is\nEconomic case doesn't have any feelings at

economic decision making he's this sort of rational big calculating brain that is always acting additive self interest and all of those sort of characteristics or characteristics that we have been told to view as a male\nAnd even more obvious is sort of all the characteristics that economics guys to great lengths trying to exclude from these models like emotions family the faulty feelings compassion and altruism\nAnd all of the things that we have been told that these are not economically relevant these are not anything that we need to studying economics they like sent to the same things that we have been torched view as female\nI Know because the off to the Chrysler people were saying\nThis greed is a good philosophy and is very narrow idea of what human beings are it's not good we need to bring these other values back and\nWe can't solve our economic problems without the courage to see ourselves with all that makes us human and failed economic models in economic theory

Navarro Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has been under fire since\nThe Washington Post columnist was killed in the Saudi consulate and assemble that's my mommy is an expert on Middle East affairs and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region thanks for being with us\nMy pleasure or the development of this story playing out in the middle east or is it proving to be a loyalty tested the kingdom or is there any opposition in the region\nClimbing governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty and many of them issuing statements supporting a boat or Saudi Arabia and the un Kingsolver and of course uh the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of\nA lot of fear a lot of worried that the people who are activists journalists to sit in\n'em and those who may be speaking their opinion and they in fact to be threatened now are there is a real great too I think in the air amongst those are members of civil society\nYou're trying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist or without their intelligence services leaking the information it's also a major player in the middle east and American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very Calcutta the terms of how they're released information really to extract as much I think LeBron James possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they played it very smart or they are looked like the hero in this story a ironically they have you know forty thousand people in prison or many of them are are journalists as well and activists than others and so there clearly\nYou know forty thousand people in prison or many of them are are journalists as well and activists than others and so there clearly not a good beacon of liberal democracy in the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically\nDefending a you know uh this one man driven and of course uh it really struck thing I think an important\nImportant important price or from the Saudis which has yet to be determined I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey a what would what game are they playing I mean why expose Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis\nThey have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated debt\nOr they need they need hard currency date foreign exchange the need investment they need investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by\nOther allies or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the INS is very clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with with with liquidity\nI and and just briefly we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult uh I Believe for a U.S government who wants to impose sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looks like a much more menacing actor in the region\nThat was that's not my money political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so much thank you on September twenty six twenty fourteen students from the teacher training school in rural southern Mexico commandeer some buses\nThank you on September twenty six twenty fourteen students from a teacher training school in rural southern Mexico commandeer some buses their ultimate destination was Mexico City for a demonstration\nBut those buses never arrived and forty

investigation is that all the official they're showing the satellite is not to its ally\nSo tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked the students and why they were
