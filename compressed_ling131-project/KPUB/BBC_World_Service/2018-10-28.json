you very much James Gregory research published last week suggested using a mother's voice on the smoke alarm could save more children's lives than the conventional high pitched sounds that we associate with those loans\nA team at the nationwide children's hospital in the U.S state of Ohio carried out of the study on one hundred and Seventy six children they found that Arnie Hoff woke up to a noise like this on a conventional smokers um\n[noise] buzz about Ninety percent of children woke up to a voice alum sounding something like this\nWhite cop time get back makeup\nDepending I suppose if it's your actual mother to continue to explain why this might be we tend to Daniel Glazer neuroscientist base here in the u._k.\nYour weight or asleep you'll since organs all taking in information from the world all the time she will sound or smell taste your eyes even with your eyes closed on monitoring the world all the time and we have very sophisticated mechanisms from bus\nTo direct our attention to things that are important and to filter out the things that don't and actually it's the filtering out that's more important than the direction because if we were alive to everything that was happening all the time with the overwhelmed and so the question is why do children succeed to ignore\nBecause if we were alive to everything that was happening all the time we'd be overwhelmed and so\nThe question is why do children's succeed to ignore things in their sleep better than adults\nAnd this is clearly true for any of us who've had young children alone or others you can take them to a disco practically let's say to a wedding with a pounding music and once they're asleep they stay asleep through and and the ... that ... that developmental stage of childhood sleep is more important than knowing what's going on\nThis if you compare us let's say two elephants baby elephants of bone pretty much immediately able to walk around follows the herd see the difference between safe in dangerous places a baby humans\nAre blown dependent so the trade off we make us humans is that with blown unable to the cough drops elves and in that time with that early stage of development the first two years sleep is incredibly important\nBecause it's in sleep that we replay the experiences of the day strengths and the connections that we've developed and lose the ones that on simple so the tradeoffs that we make as humans is to\nBuild children's that basically ignore everything when they're sleeping because sleep is more important than working out what's going on and that's because we're born\nDependent on our parents to the cost is\nA essence can fend for themselves pretty much from bus humans comes\nNow the question of why your mother's voice is more important than any other\nIs an interesting story also about humans from before the with tuning in to sounds that method to us and so the first few months of life we're exquisitely sensitive to the whole range of environmental sounds that we encounter\nThe kind of music that we hear the kinds of language that we hear\nA very very young ages changes that perception for the whole of our lives and so babies tune into them up as voices from the very young age\nVery very young ages changes that perception for the whole of our lives and so babies tune into them up as voices\nFrom the very young age and beyond the initial period\nThat's just the sound that his most salient that's most relevant to them so it's not surprising that this preliminary results is a small sample a study that's just been reported finds that a mother's voice is much more salient much more relevant to the sleeping life of a human child than an author tree along\nDaniel Glazer who's in euro scientists where we thought that we would test a couple of human voice of loans which we've had specially recorded on I'll guess Chitra I'm Matthew what'd you make of these alarms uh which will be more effective do you think his ... in

I mean\nI Disney comes right the idea that you'll oven and it's now become sort of some sort of ... officially intelligent machine in the house which has kind of robust soon as the implications which me I might be wearing my audience wants talking to me I'm I'm getting wiring would you be reassured Chitra by talking oven\n[laughter] not really I find that when I have something in the oven like a

yeah that scare off of determine book the church you think\nI'm not sure like like like the idea of of directly addressing that but let's let them know that you'll have no burglar yes exactly and let them know that you're aware that they're about to Rob someone's house and um yeah telling them that they're on cameras Clinton nice touch whether or not that's actually true in ...\nGender specific books ... case it's a woman in truth to\nIt does happen wouldn't have been better to have the voice saying that this is the police I mean that would perhaps being slightly more intimate I Would however be ally ... [laughter] well that's true it might maybe some legal implications there [laughter] but you you want to buy the artificial intelligence implications or you might you generally but\nWell I guess [laughter]\nI I guess the idea that everything now has to be so kind of ... everything's so sophisticated on the digital level that we're losing our capacity to the basic things I mean I I can barely navigate around London anymore now without getting my city ... I'm wandering around the street with my head back out into my screen\nUsually colliding into someone else is doing exactly the same things that I may sound like a lot of it but I I think it's I think I think we can live without human voice Saddam's\nAs a as a teenager Chitra briefly you wouldn't have been very effective to your mother's voice telling you to get up in the morning or to get up and threw a smoke in your room indeed\nYeah and this is actually my first reaction to this story that it would be good for them to actually see\nWhen that waking up to your mother's voice tens into trying to ignore it to get just a little bit longer than that and my parents can tell you that my reaction would have been oh just another ten minutes rather than me jumping out to go and BBC World out of it is and we can we live from London\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

I Know you've talked about alternatives for Germany 'til you're blue in the face we do every time we mentioned Germany in a political context how about the greens\nWell that's right so we have on the one hand the right wing populists AFDC built in Germany on the other hand to the left of the spectrum you've got the greens both parties are doing pretty well the greens at doing really well\nI'm not because we've had a long hot summer in Germany that's played into lots of green concerns about climate change also the green policy has really credible leadership right now so the the the thing is very nice it\n... this is already ... to ... all of our national pitcher in Germany of the big main big tents policies doing less well\nBecause the scientists changed under votes is really look at individual issues rather than loan to loyalties to a left wing or right wing policies say ... votes have become quite fickle and that's why these these two policies are both extremes of the spectrum is doing pretty well\nBut what we're also seeing really is that there's a lot of dissatisfaction with the with the main policies I'm not ...\nFrom doing pretty well but what we're also seeing really is that there's a lot of dissatisfaction with the with the main policies I'm not connected to migration because the two big center left center right parties are quite divided on migration\nThe greens are very clear the very pro open borders as they were ... the ... the alternative for Germany are also very clear that essentially gates migration so when it comes to migration ... those two policies think about\nAnd then not migration issue also is representative of the whole world view ready so\nThe issue of migration hasn't actually been mentioned much in the ... elections in the campaign for the last few weeks of but that does play into an idea ... how votes to see themselves ... votes to see themselves as how they would describe as open minded all\nInternational tolerance or however you want to say they would vote green is versus the thinking themselves with traditional they they're nervous about change they might very tasty said he's not really just about migration is about whole world view I'm not world view something that the ice the on the greens\nTalk about very well on the both parties are United on those sorts of course emotional quite subtle issues\nDamien McGinnis in Berlin many science we're going to go to minute for quick point teach Matthew and chitchat on on your view from where you are on these German elections which sound quite important ... well\nFor me just listening to your ... then it strikes me how similar dynamics on not just in Gemini and other parts of the\nIntense about this move away from the center they from the mainstream that benefits those progressive policies like the queen's as well as the ... right on the immigrants ... and also that this is happening in the context of economic closed and lo and employment I find quite striking Islam\nMatthew ... us all the point Damien made about the Green Party advancing\nLet me close and lo and employment I find quite striking Islam\nMatthew ... all the port Damien made about the Green Party advancing on the fact that in Germany people are actually connecting the hot summer to climate change that sounds like they're well ahead of us in the u._k. where\nAll the debate is so dominated by Brexit that I mean politics is always been more central in job yeah this is the that would be a new door and even for that green ... well it will quiet and I think so because he's such a huge economy in such a big global ... that we can maybe see a little sliver of hope that\nYou're listening to the b._b._c.

G. M. T. to introduce are fun to watch them on the program today I'm going to turn to the American soul singer James Brown\nMachine doing it you know\n\nStay on the\nMachine James Brown with is Ninety Seventy hit\nSingles coming into the ... machine what James Brown would have thought of today's world in which sex machines were actually available to buy it's anyone's guess you see the link or he might have been intrigued by the fact that sex robot Brussels\nHave popped up in some cities on this subject it's fair to say that science fiction films haven't inspired optimism from the Nineteen

where ambitious women are transformed into do style husband pleasing author Mesa and more recently the British movie ... which are female robot stabbed so the city is create to the city is having use that word for a while to death\nSo robots are going profoundly to change our lives and all sorts of ways but how will they affect all sexual behavior\nChildren after the room perhaps slides health warning Cape Devlin is a senior lecturer in digital humanities at London universities King's College and she has the answers to everything you've ever wanted to know about sex robots but were afraid to ask a new book\nIs called toned on science section robots and she joins us in the studio welcome Kate morning are quite positive about sex robots aren't you\nWell in a way I mean I think there is potential for technology to help us with relationships to help us with intimacy on to bring pleasure to people but whether or not comes in the\nForm of the currents extra boats is another story what all the color insects robots there's really no to any reading it we kind of have one in prototype that's due to ship to customers anytime now I really and it's essentially a sex told her I Love till\nI'm with an animatronic had\nUh how'd you hear from the house why is it so different from a blow up love a wouldn't say blow up because they think it's quite expensive um they ... up with a [laughter]\nIt's probably up with a little too much too early Mac [laughter] dies of dollars up words to buy one of these robots um five thousand dollars up words if you just want to adult version they're made out of silicon\nThey are um sculpted they are they are kind of think it works of art\nAnd but they don't look anything like humans rate\nOkay we're going to dispel a few minutes in a moment what do you make of the concepts Chitra very briefly of the sex robots before we go on\nAnd I find it really striking that human being\nIn a moment what do you make of the concepts Chitra very briefly of the sex robots before we go on\nWell I find that really striking that human beings can do all kinds of things with technology and this is why we put a ethics\nRice sex robots kind of feel ... and you know divorcing the sexual act entirely from feeling comes with risks or does it\nI I don't think it necessarily does and we know that sex toys for example have been around for hundreds if not thousands of years the difference here is that the current form of the sex robot is a humanoid form that's that's the problem because it tends to be a very productive stereotype of female body\n[noise] and and that's the problem why are we talking just about the female body on the sex robots for women on the sex robots for gay women\nKnow that we're not yet there are not yet at this at a male version of a sex or will it tends to be a straight men that are buying the robots that doesn't\nWhich is interesting because on most sex toys build those which suggests that the the classic lead on would be a you know deal do based sex robots notify you\nSo essentially there's something else here and I think there's two streams what the two lines of developmental one is the sex toy like you say there's this big things like Elizabeth I breeders are mine for years and the other is the sex all the sec still has always been a fairly nice market for manned\nOkay entitlement and some men in in sexual to ... you know this is an area that brings huge alarm bells\nUm the compliant ever willing female figure is imported isn't it in the form of the passive sex do which takes what he's given to it it it it's offensive to many people on all sorts of levels\nAbsolutely I Am not something we've been fat by sigh fight on the air is as well and of course but it's always the hinges on a dystopian plot where the the woman gets about ... and the female robots ah\nWell I Know of course which always the hinges on a dystopian plot where the the woman gets to be up to the end of the female robots or takes over as a threat to men I think there's a certain power levels is with real life than not fear\nUm but yes it is it's just this past the female form that we have and I I just strong enough kept me from the wife not because we have technology that could do wonderful things in terms of\nHelping relationships in terms of bringing pleasure and it doesn't have to be in this form\nIt's open field for questions Matthew I'm kinda nervous the venture into this minefield will have to admit pool when I saw that this was going to be a topic of discussion it\nJust before a surge in the morning but K. I. average don't shy away from Milan are most of my by my has raised sitting it became ... can you tell us how you go into this topic what drew you to this you know I wanted to address that question [laughter] it was to route\n[laughter] well I mean it's a fascinating subject area um it came about ready from a sitting up in a pub after a conference and come to the system is talking with a group of colleagues saying what is it a bite develop have symptoms that can think why or why why we're putting all this effort into creating\nA ice that half human like traits we have very specific traits that changed the way we think and sexuality is one of those it affects how we how we ...\nIt's it's kind of fundamental driver to humans because the the whole point is whether we like or not we want to replicate our our genes Chitra [noise]\nYes I mean we've touched on this slightly already by one in ... I Want to explore more are we not worried about what sex robots would mean for human sexuality particularly given that that as we mentioned already designed by men woman suspended straight man\nWhat are the implications for women especially when it comes to attitudes about an agency consent and rights\nAnd and also linked to that is not perfect analogy but when you look at pornography [noise] they're up at sea\nTo bind agency consent and lights\nAnd and also a link to that is not perfect analogy but when you look at pornography\nThat particular racial stereotypes um that uh uh put fluids in pornography as well and I'm just wondering about I guess the the race and gender implications of a move towards um sex robots I slept Yale ideas Kate\nYeah that's right I think it's very problematic at the moment it's very much a male straight while I'm ...\nI'm a last word has her normative so the idea that people um are in relationships are straight on on monogamous and I'm featured in this case um it's it's a month and a woman and it's it's um sex evils of China [noise]\nUm I think that that sounded problem I think um we know that the ... the ... that we have today old tend to be in this um\nSalmon ice hyper sexual form and they all tend to be white as well um whether they aren't where there there are it's all the different skin color they are as you say they're kind of exhaust sized um this is probably my take on and I think that we do have to really address stop and look at new ways of doing these things\nJust to check out our we act the technological stage of development where robots can really accurately imitate a ...\nNot ... the other problem we're very very bad at making human like robots\nWords so the problem is how sexy can they possibly be most ... it's quite a big ... and I think it will stay incredibly nice for quite some time but we can can you know integrate virtual reality now these they I mean showing the technology is changing so quickly that also official intelligence as hyper realistic ... I mean\nThe ... or at least a robot can talk to you convincing absolutely so they these I've been in the mood give you a bit [laughter] and this\nThese robots have personalities that are being developed you can ...\nDo you convince him not lately so they these are not in the mood give you a bit [laughter] this\nRobot this robot have personalities that are being developed you can ... app on your phone or tablets you can have a virtual girlfriend in your phone they're working on a a meal version as well partly um so I think that's that's probably a more realistic it convincing human than any rowboat\nWhat's being reception fuel bookcase oh sorry Chitra quick point we're going to\nSay just hearing it makes me I'm wonder why people need that she'll go for it\nAnd whether it is is this does it say something about who got boyfriends and girlfriends that I mean let's be honest it's not boyfriends at Central Gulf and is that we're talking about and does this say something about masculinity\nI'm In an era that you would rather have a vet she'll girlfriend who doesn't it's not a real human being with her own ideas and soul\nMate ... ... yeah I think that's probably about it and I think ... sort of the ... the idea that women are the emotional gatekeepers or so we of course you know we're able to go out there and\nAnd bomb socially but perhaps men have more problems without dabbling author of toned down south science sex on robots many thanks for coming on the program big thanks to August ...

system is that bring our research is and I'll you know members of stuff together you know to to try to see on this big economic and global landscape that we look at where something is coming out that

us\nThis is the reason Christine the God explained to me well under her watch the funders initiated working nontraditional areas such as inequality agenda and climate change mixed on what's the driving force behind the stern report on climate change he explains why climate change is not bankers business\nThe central bankers and many of the north and but many of them and some of those in leading countries have recognized that climate change is a major potential source of economic and financial instability Ifill battered by storms and hurricanes that the economic instead of the major scale\nAnd we have seen these very dramatic effects of storms and hurricanes causing major economic damage in different parts of the world\nAnd what we've actually seen so far is small very small relative to what we risk\nFor example the bigger I recommend Sunday that almost wrecked New York in two thousand twelve cannot be ruled out\nWith most financial centers near coasts expected ocean rising rates of storms will be severely destabilizing climate change\nShould be a global priority for many reasons spots in the short term in my view a pandemic is the most likely cause of the next financial crisis\nAnd one that will woefully ill prepared for Pete appeal to the direct to the London School of hygiene and tropical medicine discovered Ebola and it's a leading global experts on pandemics\nI asked him about the risks they pose\nEndemic could trigger a global recession it all depends how big it is of course and where it's will hit and we know that the Spanish flu a hundred years ago I'm reduced global GDP by about five percent three trillion in these days we know that in Hong Kong a very short list\nYears ago and reduce global GDP by about five percent speed trillion in these days\nWe know that in Hong Kong a very short lived epidemic of sauce really hit the GDP by about closest three percent\nBut it was also an increase by to hundreds base point in the country risks premium so that's another problem so according to the the size of the epidemic we're talking about the damage in terms of trillions nothing billions [noise]\n\nThe failure to think beyond finance is the first lesson that has yet to be loves the second is that management and regulations focused on what was happening within individual countries are the bankers were operating system which transcended national borders\n\nIn the u._k. the full separation of investments in retail banks has addressed the number but not all the sources of risk so John Vickers of colleagues Oxford University shed independent commission on banking set up by the u._k. government following the crisis\nI asked him whether this has made banking safest\nOne reason why Britain had a particularly bad crisis was that we have these gigantic institutions doing ordinary high street banking which we all depend on small businesses depend on day today and all sorts of global investment banking and they got into trouble on on all those friends then the second heading was\nHow to make the banks more resilient in the sense of being able to absorb losses if more likely when the next crisis hits we recommended a kind of separation cold ring fencing so this is the idea\nThe ordering high street banking retail banking current account side of the drafts let's call things which we all this individual\nThe ordering high street banking retail banking current accounts I dropped it was cool things which we all as individuals and small businesses depend on which the government can't let for life without titled calamity that those activities in major banks\nShould be in a self standing powder the bank separated from the global investment banking commodities trading derivatives exposures to other kinds of financial institution and all those other things it shifts the dial it increases the odds that you wouldn't imperil domestic banking from a global crisis\nAnd if nonetheless there is some Japanese or that it puts you in a much better position to do with that crisis\nIn the u._k. despite the abduction of a number of so Jones recommendations banking has become concentrated in fewer hands in the u._k. is in the U.S taxpayers' money was used to bailout the ailing banks and to sweets in terms of the merger with big banks\nThe result was that the surviving banks got even bigger and competition was reduced the big banks are not too big to fail I mean if they collapsed they would bring down the whole system\nList implies the government's which means the taxpayers have given them an implicit guarantee of survival here's another Monti co author of the bankers' new clothes\nSize of the largest banks certainly grow\nThat will tell you that they did the favor swallowing the weaker institution but there's really nothing natural or nothing efficient about the size and complexity of these institutions if they lived in market they couldn't actually live like that at all not one day it just that they had a privileged existence what they keep getting\nFunding despite being sold risky insult pay\nTheir too many privileges of too many subsidies that's coming on with the status\nOf being sort of that begun dominant and so on\nSo pay their too many privilege and too many subsidies it's coming along with the status\nOf being sort of that big and dominant and so all the counter parties want to deal with you because they know you can't default on your loan\nTo where the measures to prevent the mix financial crisis an improvement as well made them worse\nI think that he has made things worse and even though it may have been the first response you know quick solution it really ended up with a system ten years later that's pretty scary and distorts the economy about competition and about and just about anything\nGrowing complexity into dependency of the banking system was facilitated by revolutionary technological changes such as growing computer power\nWhich alone physics and math graduates to boot financial products which the top bosses let alone the regulators politicians and customers didn't understand\nFall from reducing an offsetting risk innovations we're raising and spreading it\nThink we were told that all these innovation that word you know used around Silicon Valley where I Am a lot innovation was kind of a great thing that it would allow you know more efficient funding it would spread the risk ever more efficiently around the world\nAnd instead it was really a lot of financial innovation is really about\nClever ways to hide or asks and clever ways to avoid taxes and clever ways to do things that are not necessarily used for for society so yeah at some level you you want it functioning financial system and the financial system can do wonderful things\nBut out of control it it's really dangerous and I think that a lot of energy was spent in justifying things that are not that great and in a void being discussion of all the subtle ways some times in which the public was deceived do miss sold and older misconduct that goes on in this industry\nSubtle ways some times in which the public was deceived um miss sold and older misconduct that goes on in this industry\nAs the pace of technological change has accelerated this concern has become more acute and increasingly\nKnown financial institutions such as ... companies mobile phone operators and others are issue in credit with very little regulation oversight [noise]\nNew cyber currencies such as bitcoin which are typically avoid the regular tree radio\nAs a meeting of new technology innovators of ... of electric capital which trades digital currencies he told me there is no accident that corner rose immediately after the financial crisis as it's aimed to build a financial system without relying on will being supervised by\nThe discredited government authorities\nBecause it was launched into a NATO and it was very much catalyzed by the failure of the financial system fundamentally the words intermediary trust\nTrust lesson is these are the terms that you see recurring and and the original decline my paper and it's because fundamentally what happened in two thousand eight\nIs we realized that the system was predicated on trusting these very large and powerful intermediaries and windows intermediaries fail the entire system failed with it that collapse indicated not only that the system itself\nSome critical design flaws that got I think the ball going in terms of thinking about what a system might look like they did not have those fairly\nRecent
