to film inside the building and they said that they are all cameras inside the consulate there how do not actually record so quite ... therefore want one ... one scotch and one's head\nButts CCTV from

strained to an unprecedented\nAbout living in Istanbul you're listening to we cut and from the BBC ... [noise]\nThe Venezuelan singer ... Rojas has lived in America for seven years but his family is still in Venezuela and she goes back when she can she recently played a series of sold out concerts in Caracas when she's banging London for the first time on the twenty fifth of November at the E F G London jazz festival\nAnd I've been speaking to her about her music and the problems facing the country\n\nIf you listen to music you think that I'm from Spain you think that I I grew up in ... Spain but actually not I'm from an island in Venezuela called Matty Thailand and I didn't even grew up listening to it\nCultures in Caracas which is bringing London for the first time on the twenty fifth since November at the E. F. U. London jazz festival but I've been speaking to her about her music and the problems facing the country\n\nIf you listen to my music you think that I'm from Spain you think that I I grew up and down to the ad itself to Spain but actually not I'm from an island in Venezuela called ...\nAnd I didn't even grew up listening to these kind of music I I actually grew up listening to Christina Aguilera Celine Dion nothing like what I Do now\nBut then I just got very interested in this type of music and I think it's because of their honesty and how ... it is you know when you listen to this music and then I just met ... which is like the perfect person to these kinds of music he's like the king of flamingo in Spain\nSo they kind of museum doing is a mix of folk music from Venezuela and also you hear traces from Spain and from English I Would say\nThat\nYou mentioned heavy the moment I'm In love with I think you're going to be performing a song that he's written about what's going on now in Venezuela and give it a little flavor of what you're saying in much will\nSo this song actually he called me one day from Spain and he's like no I just open the newspaper and the first thing that I saw was a situation in Venezuela\nA I mean here already knew of course I bought it uh because one of my family is is still there and since we're from a new look from these island it doesn't affect just as much as a cop it all I guess and\nIn ... I think you're going to be performing a song that he's written about what's going on now in Venezuela and give it a little flavor of what you're saying and much will\nSo this song actually she called me one day from Spain and he's like no I just open the newspaper and the first thing that I saw was a situation in Venezuela\nA I mean he already knew of course about it uh because well my family is still there and since we're from ... from these island it doesn't affect us as much as a cop it all I guess and I'm Talking about\nFood or a you know crime a but when he read it he said that he'd eat really touched she's hard and he told me and I just wrote this and he sent me this song and he was like I wrote it I mean I talk a lot about it with him so he knows how I feel\nAbout my family and everything we've been through so they sunk talked a little bit above me wanting to go back to being away from my country for seven years I left because of my career\nBut of course I miss my family my dad has been hurt me sinking since I left it's been seven years he cannot come to the United states so he hasn't her missing since I left\n[noise] soda and the\nMan said get sent to\n\nAnd I actually just went back in March for a concert that I gave in ... and that was the first time after seven years\nWhat was that like during ... to ... point\nIt was crazy actually cause they never go to ... when I visit and I I've been trying to visit at least once a year but this time that it won't in March was my first time stopping and ... is very different of course since I left a lot of people has left so actually it's not even traffic actually ...\nYou said get some\nMoney and I actually just went back in March for a concert at age ... and that was the first time after seven years what was that like going back to ... point\nIt was crazy actually cause they never go to ... when I visit and I I've been trying to visit at least once a year but this time that I Want to march was my first time stopping and ...\nIs very different of course since I left a lot of people has left so actually there's not even traffic actually traffic was as crazy as it is in New York and it was very very emotional for me because given a concert there with the people you know with my people\nAre and singing a song that it's called ... which is my single where I talk about the island that I'm from and the people that are the lift there it was very touching very touching it was like the first thirty minutes just wanting to cry so it's been one of the most beautiful countries have had in my life\nDon't know I mean these were cultures that sold outliving to move to yeah\nAnd I it was a last minute thing because I was just going to give to countries in the ... and they sold out and then uh one of my friends are using the industry she was like now like you really have to give a concert in ... and I'm like are you are you sure\nYou know people are waiting for you are like well let's see and then it was to sold out concerts he was a big surprise and a beautiful moment\nI mean the original ... is not to sound surprised that it comes to buy you should be sold out but it's sort of cultural incorrect ... I Know we sold out at the moment\nI Know I Know but you know what they have nothing right now like it's very difficult for artists to go there and tour 'cause it's not worth it like in the economy side\nThe industry she was like now like you really have to give a concert in ... and I'm like are you are you sure you know people are waiting for you like well let's see and then he was to sold out concerts he was a big surprise and a beautiful moment\nI mean the original ... is not to sound surprised that it comes to buy you should be sold out but it's sort of culture in Caracas ... I Know we sold out at the moment\nI Know I Know but you know what they have nothing right now like it's very difficult for artists to go there and tour 'cause it's not worth it like in the economy excite economy side but also people are afraid to go out during the night you know to concerts and so they tried to make ... early during the day\nSo they don't have to be exposed to like you know at eleven PM leaving the theater\nSo yeah for me was also surprised that it was sold out even though it was the night but yeah they're they're they're just like a craving for talent and for people to go and sing for them\nAnd when you are an artist from a country that has highlighted the moment full suddenly all the wrong reasons mhm do you feel that sense of pressure to perform to writes about it to sing about ... to to put some sort of message out there about the situation back home\nOf color pressure at all I think it's something that we actually comes naturally\nThat we want to talk about it that uh as I said because my family's there I'm not I'm really far from the book and I say that yeah from the situation because I talked to him every day and they're living at you know so I think it's something that has happened naturally for us to talk about it or to express how we feel and it's more about missing\nMy family missing the beautiful beaches we have they're missing the fact that like if I Want to bring people to go on and and see where I'm from they they don't want to go because what they see the news and uh it's not too pretty\nTalk about it that uh as I said because my family's there I'm not I'm really far from the ... can I say that yeah from the situation because I talk to them everyday and they're living at you know so I think it's something that has happened naturally for us to talk about it or to express how we feel and it's more about missing\nMy family missing the beautiful beaches we have they're missing the fact that like if I Want to bring people to go on and and see where I'm from they they don't want to go because what they see the news and uh\nIt's not too pretty [laughter]\nUm so but yeah I I'm hopeful you know like I think things are going to get better because they have to and people are very very brave and when I went last time people are still working you know he was young people young people with a smile on their face\nJust very happy to be there and working for a better better Venezuela and that was very touching for me\nAnd then the good times ... redrawing and look\nFor you really have to visit it's now because I'm from their release you all go to admit that yeah I Know I really it's beautiful I think it's perfect the whether we have actually it's maybe Ninety degrees the whole year [noise]\nI Know it may sound bad for you is actually very uh it's amazing because we have to win the uh the food is grade people are happy all the time Everytime I showed pictures to people there like what the hell are you\nDoing here [laughter] to me to mogul redrawn and another is growing in London for the first time of the year after London jazz festival the twenty fifth of the members of some sort of brief words from you both but it's interesting you started to somebody\nPerforming abroad because she has to be ruled by law reflections on family she's missing what's going on back home yeah ... ... what are the ones that are called murder to ensure when you're talking to her when I started to touch on the delicate political suits\nPeople are happy all the time every time I showed pictures to people there like what the hell are you doing\nHere [laughter] take me to ... and then I was playing in London for the first time of the E F G London jazz festival on the twenty fifth of November just some final brief woods from you both but it's an interesting insight into into somebody\nPerforming abroad because she has to be ruled by and large and reflections on family she's missing what's going on back home\nYeah ... it's funny the one thing to call my attention when you're talking to her when you started to touch on the delicate political situation it was the coded language yeah I remember that from the years with the military dictatorship in Brazil\n... was a coded language there are things that you want her to pass it but you couldn't actually say yeah because you were a fresh you worried about what would happen to family exactly yeah she's got family there so she was worried\nYeah yeah I I think it's interesting that she said people start for culture is of course a might cut I got used to be an amazing really alive Sandy I mean I actually have a friend living there\nAnd um I Can't understand that say concert was sold out to a class at\nBoth of them indeed well listen we're going to have a bit more of a music [noise] and I was going to say thank you to both of you for joining me this morning let's hang [noise]\nDon't get used to it really but you learn to live with that anxiety nine times out of ten everything's going to be fine but it's that one time that you have to be prepared for and ready to act on\nIf there's one place getting better at being prepared it's Florida\nUm surprisingly for the state's dumped the hurricane capsule of the world there's a lot of research happening hit and how they work and how to mitigate their effects and as we'll hear later on in this program scientist in other parts of the world uh taking those findings and trying to test whether we could stop harkens altogether\nBut before that I Want to start with some basics want so hurricane and how does it for them why there's so many of them here in the southern tip of the United states\nWell if there's one person who can tell us all that it's this guy professor Hugh Willoughby\nBig told me I'm a distinguished research professor to distinguish part means they don't have to pay me as much in the department of earth and environment her for the international university\nHe's being modest he's one of the first as a hurricane hunters paving the way for the team he took us up and he explains how they form\nHurricane is strong\nCircular storm that lives over the tropical oceans\nWell if there's one person who can tell us all that it's this guy professor Hugh Willoughby\nThey tell me I'm a distinguished research professor to distinguish part means they don't have to pay me as much in the department of earth and environment at Florida International university\nHe's being modest he's one of the first as a hurricane hunters paving the way for the team he took us up and he explains how they form\nHurricane is strong\nCircular storm that lives over the tropical oceans it takes its energy from the warm waters of the sea and hurricanes work like steam engines the ocean as the bar or in the course of wind blowing around in circles the turban\nHurricane Florence maybe a steam engine but it's one that's the size of a small country and its hustling across the Atlantic to the east coast these storms stops thousands of miles away in the Sahara Desert as tiny disturbances in the flow of hothead streams west from that\nYou may have come across the idea of the butterfly effect that the tiny motion of the butterfly flaps its wings in one part of the world creates massive consequences somewhere else it's he's in popular culture the meta full but for what the scientists ... true\nMeteorologists always talk about how butterfly flaps its wings in Omaha can make it rained in Beijing two weeks from now\nHurricanes in the U.S tend to start in a similar fashion with small disturbances in the ... coup waves\nAnd you get these waves that come across the car and Senegal about every four days\nAnd every one of those could turn into something so you get\nSeventy or eighty of those during the course of the time when it's possible to make a hurricane and ten percent or a little more grow into hurricanes most of them don't live up to their potential\nThe other thing harkens need ... seats\nFly flapping its wings Omaha can make it rained in Beijing two weeks from now\nHurricanes in the U.S tend to stuffed in a similar fashion with small disturbances in the

course of the time when it's possible to make a hurricane and ten percent or a little more grow into hurricanes most of them don't live up to their potential\nThe other thing harkens need room the will to that is a very particular recipe\nIn the ocean surface where you have water that's twenty eight thirty Celsius going down fifty sixty meters huge amount of heat stored in the water and that's what the hurricane lives\nThese days the focus in the U.S at least its own monitoring hurricanes which help scientists predict what's going to happen when a storm like Florence hits the coastline surely ... is the deputy director of knows hurricane research division and explains how the organization's mission has changed quite a bit\nWe started way back when with a project called project storm theory the purpose of that was to stop hurricanes we thought that we could use silver iodide\nToo if you will sprinkle it over the hurricane and maybe stop the convection from happening that didn't necessarily work for us and so we got more involved with trying to improve the forecast\nSay ... when that started when people said\nOh a hurricane's coming is it just they tell by looking out the window and seeing black clouds pretty much so I mean it only got better for us when we had a satellites and that was around the early Nineteen sixties and that gave us sort of a picture of what was to come to our coast and since then\nAnd maybe stop the confection from happening that didn't necessarily work for us and so we got more involved with trying to improve the forecast since ... when that started when people said\nOh a hurricane's coming is it just they tell by looking out the window and seeing black clouds pretty much so I mean it only got better for us\nWhen we had a satellites and that was around the early Nineteen sixties and that gave us sort of a picture of what was to come to our coasts\nAnd since then we've been improving the forecasts what kinds of tools to use to track hearken we use as I mentioned satellites we use the aircraft to collect data overland we'd we launch radio sons which are weather balloons\nHave buoys out in the ocean or we also use coastal radars so we use all those those things to help us improve of how we can monitor the hurricane ... they all doing they're gathering wind speed wind direction pressure\nA relative humidity all of those things and with all of that data that we can collect even the radar gives a sort of a reflectivity which is a signal of how strong or how deep those us thunder storms and hurricanes are\nAnd you've got on the table in front of us well it looks like a cylinder that you'd push a poster inside what is it\nIt is a drop one son does a GPS drop one son and we drop about twenty five from the belly of the aircraft into the storm and so we sort of pepper the storm with these instruments\nTo morning our fourth Hurricane Florence making landfall hundreds of thousands were\nSo much you might wonder how TV

that it was getting out is I think really unfortunate and you would think that we will be able to do something as a global community in areas are affected by this you know these rather have each

these sounds good trick your voice act\nIt's actually something sinister hidden within those Robin Oi sounding natural sounds ... to us\nThese sounds could trick your voice activated personal system or maybe in the future you're driverless cars concealed within that but so was a ... to get one of your catches your eye contact with don't eat the policy\nAnd like I listen to the embedded sound just type dummy code as part of new research into the realm of psycho to stick hiding\nDuring the ... is professor in an ethical engineering it's mentioned technology at ... university book um\nWe were interested in seeing how far\nWe could go in using the difference between human audio protection and machine audio protection because humans of course how some limits\nTheir perceptual ability for example after a very loud sound human won't be able to perceive a very quiet town for a speech recognition system that's just the fame and there's other effects like that so not only can you not hear quiet sounds after an hour south\nBut also when you have a very loud sound at one frequency for example let's say you at the very very out\nFifty Ford's hound and you won't be able to hear very quiet sounds like at fifty five for its really close by to that's the sound and also so called cycle acoustic masking effect\nAre utilized already by many gadgets intact so for example you were MP three player also uses those cycle acoustic effects\nTo be able to work with very compressed audio files in MP three including you only in cold that information that is relative and that just perceptive the choice Schumann listener and you can throw away you can discard parts of the sound that won't be perceived or\nThat just perceptive the choice Schumann listener and you can\nThrow way you can discard parts of the sound that won't be perceived or maybe not in coal them so precisely\nSo there's a lot of tech out there that's using those um cycle Christie masking effect that we were wondering if it would also be possible to use them to hide information from humans which would then be very clearly proceed with the for an automatic system\nRight so it seems from your research that there are ways of am betting and doing so imperceptibly audio signals like militias ... within very sounds and they might be able to check or something like what about your voice systems or elect so have you\nYou have another example which involves an autonomous cars to join us vehicles what is that well\nThe idea is really that if we had\nThat were controlled by voice than we can use that very same attack factor to make that for example in in our example activate the emergency brakes by voice\nSo that you'll you'll being driven by you told them is called Simon and Garfunkel on the radio\nShame on me\nI mean that music sounded normal to me but now we're going to have that same bit of music but you modified it in your research\nShame on me\nWhich to me frankly it sounds like the ... that we played in the first place but in the second clip of the Simon and Garfunkel this is even better it's some kind of come out and that will trigger the call to do something then\nYeah it's actually full we've invented a combined after they emergency brakes and ... all the war and of course that's needs pretty trained to me to a very scary scenario where um\nYou could imagine a few years in the future\nOf course that's needs pretty trained to me to a very scary scenario where um\nYou could imagine a few years in the future\nPeople being actively put at risk by their says driving tech if those gaps in security are infringing so\nYeah so you mean by the calls go on and I asked my six speech recognition yeah the yeah I'm Sorry but how you doing the same way as if you'd actually set out loud to put the exam and\nObviously this is proof of principle and bumping but you point to an end you'll probably be you haven't actually done this or you were the ... as it was just going straight to him to the voice recognition system so that made me very much prefer principle\nThat's all I'm ... and that our system currency half\nAnd the second imitation is that we're currently assuming that we know all the parameters of the speech recognition system\nSo in effect for attacking the speech recognition that we've trained ourselves it's a ... system so it's a speech recognizer that is very widely used and the research community and we're pretty sure that it's also used in many commercials systems\nThat we definitely need to know all its parameter person to compete structure in order to attack a system and so this kind of attack it's only by either if you have some possibility twin for the premise tourists from some tests thinking all the Assange twin aunts our system\nLooking at it it's all put or if you can actually go and steals the parameters and some other way for example by having somebody inside the company\nWas this book is very experimental it's a ... at this stage but what's your main message that you want to get across from\nI really think it's sad for me it's the point in time we're companies offering speech recognition systems\nAcross from the research what I really think is currently the point in time work companies offering speech recognition systems should look at how to make their system robust against us in the town\nYou know that's an understatement I think there are costs that we need some ... ... ... security if the system and it's really hard to make it because it means is that there is a whole\nOver to an all full of of adversarial exile in pools wave idea where networks and machine learning systems that they they just tries to an optical illusions are for the machines I received a number of examples way you can confuse images is a famous one

on this very shy repeatedly but says you know think professor material science and electrical engineering at MIT lake just ... when he does move the field on the term wearable it\nBut as you think professor material science and electrical engineering at MIT lakes is where it really does move the field on the term wearable\nIf you just think about it was really developed to describe something we don't wear what we where we call\nClose and that really sets the stage for really what we've been focused on here which is really getting technology into the things you actually we're into Europe flowed into the fabrics and into the fiber themselves\nAnd that really is what sets us apart and and what makes this point in history so special\nSay are we moving ... like the people find strands of cup of a way for them to like a black T shirt that you just buy from the local store and then sold ... onto a piece of ... which I've done an awful lot of my career you know in order to\nDeliver and make technology happen you need to have an insulator you need to have a conductor to get signals in and out of the most important material the most important class of materials that really enables all of the technology that we know of today is called the Seventy\nAnd until very recently literally a few weeks ago there were no real reports on how to get semi conductors into fibers and into fabrics\nAnd without semi conductors your phone is not smart at all [laughter] without semi conductors we don't have computers and without semi conductors we don't have displays and we don't have communication\nAnd so um what I wanted to focus on is the importance of getting semi conductors into fibers end fabrics as an enabler of functionality and enabler of you know I don't like to use the term smart we could leave that to describe humans\nBut certainly something which is highly functional and technological and it's actually\nDo digital revolution happened after\nSmart or we could leave that to describe humans but certainly something which is highly functional and technological and a day\nDo digital revolution happened after all because we have good ah I'm growing components ... wife was a civic and tell me go so far as to say well now you all doing that and fabric\nThat's the essence of the paper that just came out about a month ago in nature was to announce the emergence of a a

Copa because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season in that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into a new ... new event as it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event in debt usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average to slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but it woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got an ... heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over large parts\nAtlantic hurricane season but I woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got an oceanic heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius so for a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical in sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before Florence made landfall ... raised with scale full wins the Atlantic sunk clinics But Kevin read at Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in these forecasts simulations that we did which are very similar to a a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there was a most pacification overland after impact of the storm was fifty percent increased due to climate change\nI'm very interested in the description is different from the kind of description I've heard from friday also which is as a great so long can you heard of this kind of event ... this is very specifically giving a number to the amount that the strength of the event is being changed\nYes so what we're doing is slightly different than looking at what was the probability of this event to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in the north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and\nSo our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it made landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the normal ... Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in the ... tradition you could pinned down specific ...\nIt was the enormously bloom Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in the ... tradition you could pinned down specific ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nSo we basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that's an estimated as part of path research by climate scientists and that pattern isn't uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so they're warmer area and cooler areas but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal\nFrom our forecast initial education so that when we run these modified forecast without climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction in the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nAs well as changes that that has on the atmosphere temperature as well as on a certain temperature changes that have\nOn once during the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and a belief that particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific pack ... that's ... associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform a change in the U.S team we actually have a pattern change of the SST that comes from the fact that\nThe climate system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and so that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that is actually included in the set up\nThese conscience of geographical variation can let's just look under the bonus of climate change so to speak look at the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they sent the interest Michael Mann particularly in the light the Florence and several other storms\n... driving some of the new extremes they sent me interest Michael Mann particularly in the light but Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see it while still far out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that somewhere in the range of twenty six to twenty seven degrees Celsius so there's a very large region in the Atlantic\nThe sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms and that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming\nThat region where temperatures are high enough to form those storms is actually expanding quite a bit it's expanding quite a bit because you have so much of that marginal territory that's right on the threshold a little bit of warming\nCan suddenly create a much larger region it's warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms are intensifying earlier we're seeing storms turn into\nMajor hurricanes much farther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see and that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as well [noise]\nIt's marginal changes to the Atlantic look potentially ... then rapid changes in the Arctic ... even greater along they may have been implicated in many of the events that have ... to the past few months sea ice is declining rapidly melting foster most some of those and recovering more poorly each winter\nJulian Streever of the national snow and ice data center was recently in the Arctic between Alaska and Siberia seeing herself the continuing decline in Arctic ice\nOf the things when I was just out in the Arctic Ocean and the ... see we really struggled trying to find large enough ice flows to set up and I can't and also thick enough to support many people out there doing there\nSee we really struggled trying to find large enough ice flows to set up an ice camp and also thick enough\nTo support many people out there doing their their field observations and also we were trying to deploy our booties and you know we couldn't find many flows that were very sick so we're putting out these buoys and ice that may be a meter sick and you're hoping that it will still survive\nMid forties Flagstaff and show now and mid fifties in Prescott and pacing along the ...\n\nBBC World service comes to you on Arizona Public radio ...

Elena Kagan were Princeton on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nIt's an incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial being neutral and of not being simply an extension of the terribly polarized political process and environment than we live at\nUm this is not only divided

relatively low profile for the short term for example future this term maybe even next term\nSometimes it can of ah avoid getting sucked into\nVery big controversies there is for example right now a

family\nDidn't know how to incorporate into like our our family life our discussions they had really been told\nAt the time that they adopted me by the judge to finalize the adoption and by the social worker and by the adoption attorney that\nThe my race was relevant the word that the judge used was assimilate treat you as was one of them and not really acknowledge the fact that you were you're of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of the prevailing thought in trans racial adoption at the time and so I think they were given this advice by people they viewed as experts\nAre so to then it made perfect sense to just kind of ignore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them you know shouldn't matter to anybody else\nHow's that different what what are the challenges that you faced because of that because you couldn't share your experience of of being basically bullied and you know having racism levied at you with your parents\nIt's racing hard
