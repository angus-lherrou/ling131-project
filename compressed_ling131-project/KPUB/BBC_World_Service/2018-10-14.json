City and other towns where emergency officials are handing out food and water like we just heard of the top but that said there is a huge need for basic supplies and not just on the coast storm did a lot of damage in small dirt road towns forty and fifty miles inland\nAnd there are very long lines for supplies all over the region lots of people need help\nYeah and the pictures of devastation or

been following all of these races and she joins me now to break them down\nHe Jessica Hi Lulu so can Democrats cut into the geo peas edge among governors\nThey haven't really good chance they can pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats and this is incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty twenty when there will be\nA census that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of got in the really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional maps to their liking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats and so it's a good sign for Democrats this map is really for them\nWhat states are you watching heading into this last month of the campaign I mean where they're really tight races\nSo there's a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan\nSay some of the really tight races or Florida in Georgia Florida is always you know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American mayor from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple states\nAnd so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santa is going to be I think a really close race still next door in Georgia\nTo this last month that the campaign I mean where they're really tight races so there's a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan\nI say some of the really tight races or Florida in Georgia Florida is always you know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American mayor of from

going to be I think a really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's a state that is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they're sort of a handful of surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss ups but then Democrats have real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that it sort of a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administration in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states had been rocked by five super education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level\nAnd Republican or some polarizing nominees friends is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally you only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and tariffs is playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nMeant that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four
