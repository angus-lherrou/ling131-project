eight years of newness is here from our business asking Vivian are we expecting a big spending budget for Britain them\nWell as you say ... or the conservative party conference last month declared to much fanfare that austerity is that after eight years of cuts in public spending or they were phrases in public sector wages and sweeping cuts to sums up as the services particularly at a local government level\nBut the prime minister said that thanks to all of that belt tightening that will be better days ahead this afternoon in parliament all eyes will be on finance minister Philip Hammond he's known as the chancellor to see if he can deliver on that problem is how I miss him from the Institute the fiscal studies here in London says it won't be easy\nThe chancellor like to go to a very difficult to Oscar three somebody wants him to ... um but he also has a commitment to try and eliminate the budget deficit I'm so used to have normal government boring from about the mid twenties ...\nOn the situation is in is in the last financial ... boring was around forty billion pounds\nOn certain focus to come down over the next few years but because of cuts spending so on the one hand you want to not be causing spending because we want to indulge territory but on the other hand he needs to the deficit to come down and to eventually be eliminated to me seems to have a commitment to get it for legal\n... juggling act for finance minister Philip Hammond among the spending announcements we are expecting a more money the public services particularly mental health services as well as some money for infrastructure spending and that's in an attempt to boost Britain's productivity\nI mean it's an optimistic headline but aren't Britain's finance is really dependent on Brexit and the deal it gets when it leaves you\nYes I miss the Hammond is expected to tell him pays today that the really big decisions on public spending can only be made wants to break the deal has been done and Britain's feature trade arrangement with the European Union has become clear as calling us and said we really don't know what that will look like just yet\nThe ... the deal has been done in Britain's feature trade arrangement with the European Union has become clear as kind of innocence that we really don't know what that will look like just yet\nThe government's focus so far been predicated on a kind of or at least move breaks it it's certainly the case if we have a very disruptive breaks it was like for example there's no deal made with the European Union and we just read the to trade on WTO terms that would be hugely damaging in the short run\nAnd then we clearly affect grocery significantly my costs will solve effect tax revenues to the Johnson's goldie ... head of this\nWild public

the government could governing coalition\nSixty percent of voters said that they use these regional elections just send a signal to the national level that either they get out get out of governing governing better at the national level and to as you said\nThis needs to a lot of question marks about this is the inability of the coalition has also Mrs Merkel the political future\nWould listen to this is a regional national issue so regional issues would really like to hear it was most things like questions of migration questions of governance from the center\n[noise] it wasn't even any sort of question like migration that was the dominant there's more to the state of the governing coalition that the had kind of self inflicted crisis throughout the summer\nThat where they were triggered by some of the conditional part doesn't specially Mrs Merkel partner's problems but very out of the Christian social union and voters were unhappy with the state in which the coalition presented itself and they said\nYou know we want to send us take well and they actually made the party's stronger that either presented the far right alternative alternative for Germany or the Green Party which cause then is a centrist moderate open minded alternative and in general\nIt also I think all the end or the minds of what we call big tent party a catch all parties the Christian Iraq has the Social Democrats Germany thing is party landscape is becoming a more fragmented that make the poor man governing coalition it's more complicated\nTo say the demise of ... he's going to a big statement isn't it because that combination okay struggling but he still miss his medical he's still they're\nStill there but ah ... ah we went to the polls now all day wasn't get and we used to call the\nStill they're\nStill there but a ... ah we went to the polls now all day wasn't gets and we used to call this radicalization because it it had an overpowering majorities\nSeventy percent eighty percent of the votes right now if you believe the polls the Christian Democrats and the social network of these big tent party is combined with barely get forty percent off the boat so there you have the demise of that all the way\nIt's not clear whether that terminal or there's just a loss of faith because they've been governing are seen as governing\nSo put it together but the people seem to be clearly more cosy in smaller towns and that makes the Christian Democrats that makes the Green Party is stronger that also made and also a chief the generational shift they have new fresh ... the leaders and of course the far right alternative for Germany\nThen entered into the sixteenth fine you know they they made a complete run and they're all represent all regional government the regional state assembly\nIn Germany now the the latest results coupled with the ... back in the area not long ago will just mean Mrs ... who has no money to the gym and politics are so no\nThis is the endgame of Mrs mark on now the question is how long it a little less but that low last fall for three years that we still have long or the left in the journal whether whether it will happen\nRight now it looks that she may have to give up the party chairmanship December of what the party comes together\nAnd she wanted to be reelected as chairperson but right now there's a lot of voices against that and there's a big question on all the Social Democrats will position themselves but they are really suffering they didn't want to go into this coalition they were forced to go into this coalition because all other all the global alternative\nThey are really suffering they didn't want to go into this whole issue they were forced to go into this coalition because all other all its little alternatives to work all the suffering at the polls ever served as a real kind of patient\nWas in a strong sexual or credit card to jump out of the window\nAnd leave this coalition so what do they ask for Europe and the rest of the world is that Germany will be a lot in the evening with internal politics the in the in the ... the added to this but at a game of those folks ran it may be a fairly drawn out affair\nTo
