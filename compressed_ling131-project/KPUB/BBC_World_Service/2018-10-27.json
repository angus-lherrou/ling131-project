really looking at how we fund research and to ensure that we give the judicial system the best form of support from science that we can\nI liked markers I think it's good or for the world and I think it's good for the people that live in democratic society so I think it's an ominous development when you get threats to democracy well\nVery many people in your native United States like the fact that democracy helped elect President Trump and I think that he's finding that corner\nWell actually what we're talking about his liberal democracy so the democracy park refers to people voting but the liberal part refers to the rule of law to a framework of constitutional checks and balances to make sure that what the people choose doesn't ...\nTo the rule of law to a framework of constitutional checks and balances that make sure that\nWhat the people choose doesn't Sharon eyes over their fellow citizens doesn't excessively concentrate power and that I think is the part that is being threatened by the rise of the populace politician like Donald Trump\nI'll hang on democracy is only a good thing when people vote in a way that you did prove off\nNo I think it's a good thing pointed is constrained by checks and balances and buy a rule of law you know people can make lots of choices but their choices cannot uh include for example the\nDepriving of minorities or you know unlike individuals' of their uh equal rights than a liberal society so that's really I think the issue in front of us what\nLinked D.C between demanding dignity an identity politics\nWell I think that the basis of modern identity politics is this feeling that we all have that we have this inner source of dignity that's not being adequately recognized and that's why we go into politics because we want political recognition that\nDignity we want the society to acknowledge that we are the group that we belong to the religion of the nation the gender ethnicity than race that people with those characteristics be recognized as equal and I think that propelled a lot of\nPolitics in the world over the last couple of hundred years you recently got a voice mail from a supporter of Donald Trump didn't you know so did she was very angry at what I had written because I said the American constitution does not define who we the people are\nAh she said yes it does it says that it's the people that fought in the American revolution and their descendants and people that came later a including you are really trying to take that constitution\nFought in the American revolution and their descendants and people that came later a including you are really trying to take that constitution in that country away from us\nI suspect that she doesn't literally mean\nThe descendants of people that fought in the American revolution I suspect it's something like you know we white Europeans are the real owners of this country and people that aren't that way are somehow you're not part of the national community and by the way she told me I should go back to Japan which I you know when I\nWas born in Chicago so it's not it's as if this is really an option for me\nNow that will be people all over the world and not just support as a populist leaders like victim oil banning hungry who you mentioned in your book\nAnd like the alternatives that Germany movement that you will send mentioned that will be loads of people who who listen to you and think\nWhat a ... view you know what a liberal Californian view your day mate has passed you know the days when liberal elites democracies rude and got all the money you know it's all of a tough how'd you react to that\nYou know I I think one of the biggest issues is the fact that we actually live and de facto multi cultural societies and if one of those groups you know says that basically where they're going to we're going to be the dominant ones you're just setting up a situation of of perpetual conflict\nSo I think that there's actually a good reason to\nHave a liberal order meaning liberal in the sense of being open to people or you know that are different nationalities cultures of religions and integrating them into a common framework by which they can make democratic decisions collectively\n... and that's really what's at stake and what's being threatened I think by these people that are used to her\nPatients are collectively ... and that's really what's at stake and what's being threatened I think by these people that are you say you're you know not California and that that are rooted in one particular place or one particular ethnic group\nIs a clear majority of people in the approaching midterm elections in November in in the U.S\nVote for Donald Trump or rather vote for the Republicans surely that democracy is black and Latino people in large numbers cast a vote for the Republicans if gay people vote for the Republicans that is democracy in action isn't it\nIt uh is Fox or see an action or and I go I think that what it's going to threaten is not democracy per se is going to threaten liberal democracy\nOr because I think that Donald Trump has been trying to avoid accountability by basically attacking any institution that gets in his way and at the moment that's\nRobert Mueller and his investigation over the connection to Russia it's the FBI it's um the Justice Department and I think that if she\nGets a a perceived mandate as a result of the way that people vote he's going to you know go after all of those in a way that he's a little bit frightened to right now and I think that's not good for American institutions because the institutions really\nAre built around the separation of judicial power and the independence of courts and the independence of prosecutors\nFrancis Fukuyama and the title of his book is identity they demand for dignity and the politics of resentment what's your take on identity politics suit black\nIt's really interesting isn't it because it's the talk of bites democracy and I think it's in some ways a merchandise democracy it's about saying we're not comfortable with the extremes\nAnd I think it's in some ways a merchandise to democracy it's about saying we're not comfortable with the extremes\nBut what we've got in the middle ground that doesn't feel as if we've got anything stable to stand on\nSo I I think that balance between wanting to be able to have the freedom but also wanting to be able to ensure that we've got a quality I are always going to be tensions that that work together and work against each other in the same in the same so descendents\nSo identity politics is really saw shifting sons\nIn terms of where we place ourselves within that spectrum and everything that has a spectrum becomes really interesting when you look at either end of this extreme and people gravitate towards the middle where we find unhappiness with it\nAnd therefore won't say effectively how the freedom to go back to the extremes\nWhich then become uncomfortable and we moved to the middle so that ... that comes from Brian in motion effectively in politics is really interesting do you have\nBeliefs F cell based on your identity\nI'm not sure I Do a show my identity is a it's a multi faceted and so my political beliefs\nBut I think this issue here is is really I'm very profound and I think France is so ... started the debate which I Hope will be grab by people more widely\nOne of the assumptions as being that I'm the end of history that doesn't western liberal democracy is the way forward we are not going to do any ... ... ... it's not going to go away we'll even though it's so new ... indeed and history history tells us anything everything has a sell by date\nAnd if it is if we do think it's the best system than we need to understand it in ... and ... and change it\nSell by date and if it is if we do think it's the best system than we need to understand it in ... and ... and change it to the manager who fashion\nThe tension that sue spoke about essentially the tension between uh the value system of liberalism and the democracy bed which says a ordinary people decide what they want\nNow the value system a it is possible the system\nFrom which the ordinary people are often divorced ordinary people are the people that suffer economic deprivation most that feel disenfranchised from the legal system and the power base and it is these these people that are hardest by extremists politicians who are anti democratic in the longer term\nSo we do have a big issue here which does need to be addressed and thought about but much more widely than academics it needs to be understood by societies if they are to preserve and prosper in a democratic system otherwise it's very French\nOne problem soon we're wrapping up the program here I'm afraid is that a liberal democracy in the ... which is\nFine as lots of people up you know there isn't the passion surrounding the currents of liberal democracy is up or you know there is um and I think that's part of the problem the fire comes and the extremes and the damn pens as they go towards the middle ground which is actually viewed as being safer ground\nAnd that's the ground you stand on ... [laughter] regardless Ashraf ... black have\nBeen a guest on this edition of weekend many thanks to them hope you come back again soon and thanks to you for listening we all we can we live from London misses the b._b._c.

quite surprising angle they looked at ... uh when we die and they look if you plant the age at which people are likely to die on a graph\nOr you can see this time any one particular point in time a it's a beautiful ballad because it goes up and then he reached the peak and then it gets back down on the other side in a nice ...\nAnd that's a beautiful ... has been shifting lay chat a in people's lives of the century has progressed\nSo um it's just been the kind of still looks the same now if there was some natural limit on human lifespan you would expect that the right hand side of the cubs would start to get compressed and which are much more cramped up but it's not doing that\nSo you think I felt so cluster up in that you have I don't know ... people dying eighty five Ninety exact a lot about what's happening exactly\nAnd it's not doing that so I'm of course it doesn't tell us that uh the that can never be some limits on our lifespan it might happen in future that because we'll start altering but what we can say is that hasn't happened yet there were no signs of it happening yet\nUm why should that be a limit if you can find ways in the future of preventing cells from becoming cancerous and you can find ways of preventing dementia and you can find ways of replacing bones and very new bones if necessary why why shouldn't we just carry on getting older and older\nWell it's quite speculative but some people have proposed that that might be some kind of natural physical limits on a buddy for instance maybe I'll bones just a destined to crumble after a certain age or\nMaybe the right to which uh we can replace me cells just can't keep up with that than dying um but I Would say that was quite theoretical and does notes\nTo which we can replace me cells just can't keep up with that than dying um but I Would say that was quite theoretical and there's no sign of that happening yet\nThanks class now that I was saying when we discussed life expectancy a couple of weeks ago it was Spain that came out on top with the U.S led down the list and you might expect and one of the reasons for this was because every day in the U.S an average of a hundred and fifty people die from an opioid overdose\nThe people come from all walks of life but in San Francisco a team of public health workers it's focused on treating the most vulnerable populations homeless people on the city streets\nNow is that a couple of weeks ago on the size of the homeless population is very visible next month voters will decide whether the city's biggest

though to bury the evidence of this team walk the city streets to build a poor with homeless people with addiction problems and they offer on the spot treatment\nBunch trusted established encourage patients to visit the city's public health clinic today there's a steady stream of homeless people\nInside the clinic known as the ... health center I mean James not his real name from a medic in the U.S army recently started treatment for heroin addiction\nRight now I got a prescription refill to Bush and the doctor who was also like do you need shelter but for a you know is there a U.S or other things I can do for\nJames her therapy has been prescribed the pornography and to help\nBut for a you know is there a sort of other things I can do for\nJames who's therapy has been prescribed

change\nHis medication essentially allows 'em me to do talks I'm less painfully um and I are\nNo longer will have intense craving ... who are for the substance abuse it's definitely more comfortable but I'm I'm so cold turkey for instance or or just without any medication of systems\nSerious races are registered nurse but the San Francisco public health street team these regularly walk the city streets to identify vulnerable patients in need of health care and detox as a pundit pavements how does she and her team signed and convince homeless people like James to stock to treatment there's\nTwo ways we identify people's through our own outrage and street presidents and other agencies in the city that bring people to our attention\nSarah who wears ripped jeans and T shirt explains typing in conspicuous a non threatening is key to the beach just\nKind of casual has not formal we kind of dressed down we don't wear uniforms\nThe new white lab coats no lab coats no\nWe just sort of talk to people where they're at the clinic serves between ten and twenty homeless people doing it daily for our clinic new appointments are necessary and you don't need insurance and a quarter of his works with Sarah on the streets team\nTo them and we just say hey how's it going we try to build a relationship first in check in with folks I think\nThat's the reason why a program is so successful because I think everybody that works here these people first and then patients check yet and\nThat's the reason why a program is so successful because I think everybody that works here these people first and then patients check in and ask what they need and try to deliver that not impose my own engine known them\nThe clinic delivers a comprehensive health care treatment plant prescriptions for detox medications and even helps patients find a Ruth for the night starting conversations about drug use is a sensitive process and it takes weeks months even years for the St team to build trust with people on the street and it needs to exchange facilities\nYou know it's not like hello what's your Social Security number and what are your medical history no like who are you\nHow can we help you ... describes the process as motivational interviewing which involves a lot of listening and no judgment\nSo like if somebody comes and they were like hey Anna I've been using a lot I'm not going to say oh you shouldn't do that would be like oh well what are your thoughts around that what's happened with that and then just kind of carry that conversation like that\nDo to Perry's

by targeting the most vulnerable people in achieving results he's convinced it's inspired others to get treatment he considers a remarkable success that about one third of his patients are still in touch with the team and on treatment after a year\nI always describe our model as effective but not very efficient\nWow once a week\nThat sometimes seems like not enough for some of our patients\nThe San Francisco program it's just one of several schemes across the United states in Boston and in Texas they're often run in conjunction with needle exchanges a low barrier shelters so the addicts can get the full support they need is a solution policy changes more shelters and more funding\nHealth care worker unequivocal offers a more profound inside\nAnd honestly for me like the most challenging part is\nChanging the way that the larger community views are population are folks a lot of their humanity has been taken away if I had a magic wand I Would just flush and be like hey guys how about some compassion for folks kindness\nLike when somebody talks to you in the street look at them in the planning that little seed of compassion and kindness goes a long way and I think that's how the

the treaty\nIt's very clear that the United states and uh I live in a way to think that the house being serious violations of the treaty by Russia but equally the Russians think that aspect of the United states and NATO posture in Europe and the deployment of missiles in Europe\nHas in effect undermined the treaty in other ways so there's a balance of accusation if you like\nBut I think this is much more about rules and with uh the world should worry whenever a rule is dismantled more than anything else\nChinese intermediate range missiles development is arguably the biggest threat for the U.S [noise] ... do you think America can know will do anything to try to now negotiate a new treaty that perhaps includes China\nWell this is really interesting isn't it I mean the United states clearly believes that the constraint is on there was a result the IMF treaty because after all it can't break out and confront China with the sort of missiles it thinks it should in response to

Arabia to stop its bombing campaign\nAppear to be the case I mean this has been a disastrous war for Saudi Arabia since it began when the Saudis originally announced their bombing campaign that was back in March of twenty Fifteen\nThey announced it was going to be a short sharp campaign to restore the internationally recognized government of president ...\nWell that's turned out to be anything but true\nBy one estimate there have been airstrikes carried out by the Saudi led coalition in Yemen every Ninety minutes since then on the impact has been absolutely devastating in terms of the loss of civilian life in terms of the damage to infrastructure\nBut also I Would say in terms of the grave damage to Saudi Arabia's international reputation\nOn the longer the conflict has gone on the more instances have been identified by the un of civilian targets being ... in coalition airstrikes hospitals weddings funerals schools\nWe went to the scene of one of the most tragic under the notorious recent airstrikes in a place called die young and the province of data and the north which is a who's the stronghold\nAnd that was where forty two school boys were killed on a bus\nWe met some of the

there are many who are asking if this another Saturday airstrikes actually among to a war crime so it's a deeply damaging inexpensive conflict for Saudi Arabia and there's no indication that they have any exit strategy\nThey're all ... million people in Yemen facing found them in twenty Eighteen what did you see there\nWe had an opportunity over a period of about two weeks to see the scale of the men's suffering in Yemen this was my fifth trip\nBut I hadn't been in Sana'a the capital in two years\nI did was really shocking to see how much things have deteriorated there has been a massive

if there is no political solution on other certainly isn't one on the horizon\nWill solve the aid agencies able to do with the momentum look too they think needs to happen now\nI mean one thing you hear from the aid agencies on from Yemen Egypt hers and indeed Yemeni civilians the messages is really the same from everyone at the end the conflict what we need is the end of the conflict on the great fear is around the red sea port of a data that's in the hands of the who's the rebels there has been an offensive since about June\nBy the Saudi led coalition on on the various forces that

their operations are controlled and limited but undoubtedly it is the operation of of the aid agencies that have been keeping so many Yemeni is alive during the years of this conflict\nOn the air and the earth is warming so rapidly that most experts agree that measures need to be taken to suck carbon dioxide after the atmosphere to avoid the worst consequences of climate change\nBurning fossil fuels for energy clearing forests and diminishing let plans all contribute to the problem\n[noise] CO two stops heat from leaving the planet one reason why the U.S average temperature is higher than it used to be scientists in the U.S now say that some technology able to capture compromise is ready to be deployed on a large scale right now\nSo is this a solution to climate change I all star environment correspondent not McGraw the\nWith these techniques that they talked about here is that nobody's retry them yet because there's no real financial incentive to do them but on the basis of the calculations of these scientists and others have done they are talking about the fact that by the middle of the century we need to be removing about twenty billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year\nAnd some of these techniques would get us about halfway there if they worked really well and everybody did as they were told everybody did have some joined up thinking\nThey are optimistic about some of the newer technologies that are coming on there you know we're talking about planting trees and changing farming practices the brothers would be boring things more sorry fly

got these machines that looked like washing machines that fans in the ... of the year\nThey can do that right now they cost about six hundred dollars a ton of carbon that they remove but the report's authors are actually saying well we don't know about them right now but we think about ten years time they can get down to about a hundred dollars a ton if they do that\nThat's a very successful and we could beat this problem\nThe big problem with that is this what they philosophically called the moral hazard\nIf you have machines that can remove comments that Mr why bother reducing your use of fossil fuels and that's one of the big dangers that politicians and campaigners environmental is really worry about because if people think there's gonna be a solution ten years down the track they'll keep flying they'll keep eating meat to keep driving cars they do all the things that are contributing to the problem right now\nTo the extent is common capture happening all ready and how can you make it more appealing\nOther lots of different things going on with the moments every country in the world is planting trees pretty much people are trying to change the way that they do for a station that the\n... lengthen the time to time the trees grow or they changed you know when they have a massive kilometer you fire or something they plan very quickly the bigger more technical industrial challenge of you know holding on big pieces of technology to coal fired stations\nThey're all they're in theory but very few in practice is really a handful around the world and the big problem with that because all these big bits of case cost lots of money and nobody really wants to put their hand in the park has to pay for all these things\nSo what's interesting about this report that's come out and saying that actually you know there's lots of other things we can do blue carbon as it's called for one thing which is effectively mangrove swamps and marshlands near the sea if you can protect those there may zing source of our thing for common they soak up more carbon than anything else\nAnd you can do it for about twenty dollars a ton of carbon and that is really really cheap the bigger problem of course a lot of times we don't have enough of them you know the fight the number of ...\nYou can do it for about twenty dollars a ton of carbon and that is really really cheap the bigger problem course long terms we don't have enough of them you know the fight the number of coastal areas in the world is fine nice people want to build new coastal areas and you've got this thing called sea level rise happening as well which might wipe out some of the gains are making so\nThe big tech not really happening a lot of smaller take is happening and it's cheap and I'll just report things we do more but how do you\nIncentivize countries such as China countries such as India which have been industrialized in very very quickly and actually getting rid of some of the landscape that was doing carbon capture\nYeah both China and India are taking all these steps in terms of planting trees and doing other things that are also obviously building lots of coal fired plants as well [noise]\nHow this works out no one really knows to be honest with you the hope and belief amongst richer countries is that if they develop better technology to capture carbon and sequester it\nThen there'll be able to either share that technology but Indian China nothing really happened so far and there are number of intellectual property questions about all that the big challenges but China and India they remain on solved at this point\nNot Accra that's it from the well this week for now don't forget to join us at the same time next week for ... ... what's happened in the next seven days

political campaign is have you software that scrapes Facebook for citizens phone numbers and then ultimately sends them ... ... messages and asked them to ... groups\nJunior underground Yani from BBC News Brazil told me about this investigation and explained to just how important what type has become in Brazil\nWhat's up is very important the company says a hundred and twenty million people use watts up in Brazil and the population is two hundred and ten million\nIt has become and Brazil almost like a social media and not only an instant messaging app where people participate in groups with people they don't know from around Brazil and chat with them\nOne hypothesis is that this happens because of how ... networks offer what's up for free without discounting the Internet data so\nIt's it's a cheap and readily available to and how is it being abused during the present you know actions\nSo we found out that there are ... that are buying devices that can scrape people's numbers from Facebook\nAnd then use these numbers to a target them with lots of messages they can put people in in lots of groups and they can to send the message is individually about a candidate\nOr when they put people in lots of groups one markets here who I spoke to was told me he would put a a person and a group\nAnd the group would have a name that is not related to candidates specifically like political debate and then people would start talking but there were would be to ah people infiltrated from the campaign that will try to lead these people on and make them support the candidate and this is just\nA little fringe activity or is it an awful lot of this happening\nWhile we can say for sure how many people\nSupport the candidate and this is just a little fringe activity or is it an overload of this happening while we can't say for sure how many people are using this but in our report we saw that this has has been used by different candidates in Brazil and different parties lots of different parties\nAnd it was top has played a big part in this campaign in Brazil are very big part uh so we have sixty six percent of the voters saying that they have used watts up they use watts up in Brazil\nAnd ah the far right candidate presidential candidate staples for NATO\nOr who's come pain is is being played a lot uh in in what is this against Facebook's rooms in any way well it is against Facebook's rules Facebook said and Facebook told us it is investigating a the claims\nAre it is also against a lots of rules and watts of has been a trying to\nShut down spam accounts what they say they said that they have closed thousands of Spanish accounts in Brazil\nAnd the justice system in Brazil or doesn't let it clear if it's a against the law or not it hasn't a written laws thinking about what's up this year until specialist in the electoral justice in Brazil\nOr disagree between what is it legal and what is not they can only say that illegal database is being used to get people's phone numbers that is illegal\nThat's Judy on the ground you're only from BBC News Brazil or Tim ... is our special guest um it's it's two years ago that we began a space to worry about the impact of social media on elections with the U.S presidential elections um and it keeps on going on in its own was Facebook isn't it Facebook's role in this because of course it works I just keep\n... um and it keeps on going on in its own was Facebook isn't it Facebook's role in this because of course the world's up just keeps on ... ringing alone bells and they don't seem to be able to do much about it\nWell some of us will be morning about is coming from over two years actually but it got fashionable two years ago for various reasons yes I I think it is you know it was ... at the same problem which is how our politicians today going to get their message across to people on campaign\nThe way the wheels socially interact now he's completely tied up with social media so obviously the politicians are going to do that and then you get these questions of well why did they get the data how were they targeting paper the messages\nAre I think things have ... but he is having conversations if you were a political candidate he would also trying to do that now in this particular case face but it does seem to be the ... Leakey with people's time numbers\nOr to put it kindly so the these are all the questions if I was suddenly being added to groups gang well who is this and why am I being added to this I think I'd be annoyed\nBut I think there's always a danger of confusing the specifics of how ... put across with what the message is all me if you if you think that the way that campaign to being conducted in terms of the content is a problem I think that's why you need to focus\nOn we've seen more ovens this week the vice was not ... will for instance in sight news being used as a political weapon in the United states more examples ... a whole saga or about the caravan of migrants\nBut it's a kind of impossible find any for social media because that whole model is\nEverybody shares it everybody else we don't control the content and so if that she'll sets up whose job is it going to be to say well this is acceptable and this is not acceptable and and I think is a real problem is an easy answer that you can say that should be government regulation\nIt can't be to say well this is acceptable and this is not acceptable and and I think is a real problem it it was an easy answer you can say this should be government regulation and then you effectively have\nState censorship of what's acceptable and what isn't or if you get the companies themselves to police it well then you've got private companies in Silicon valley deciding what we can read and what we can't wait so it is a problem I didn't want answers [noise]\nWell we're going to leave you without announcing that it's a story we've covered the many times on tax and then when we come back to thanks to my special guest amend ... thanks to my baby see technology colleague climate and you can read older that story's a BBC adult ... technology to video losses stories\nPlenty plenty of information that and I've got to join his again in the tech tent\n[noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

reporter for the wall Street Journal is written about the impact rushing trolls have had on the controversy over players who kneel during the plane of the national anthem to beat and joins us from New York Thanks so much for being with us\nThanks so much for having me on why was this Internet research agency interested in whether football players took her new you're not during the plane of the anthem well\nAt first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like\nHealth care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think about it what their efforts were aimed at\nWe're sowing discord this issue with players kneeling during the national anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues racial inequality\nThis issue has been pretty much as divisive as it gets but it's not just\nPeople that are weighing in on this it's a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic regularly whether that was in stump speeches whether that was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this was an issue that\nReached the top of the food chain\nWhat did you find when you are dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency well\nWhat we found was these tweets head be gone all the way dating back to twenty fourteen but when Colin Kaepernick began the movement\nThen we saw these issues sparked to life and then in September of twenty Seventeen President Trump gives a speech in Alabama that really attacks the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then the Twitter trolls spring to life even more\n... that really attacks the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then the Twitter trolls spring to life even more and so that's one of the first things one of the second things you look at when you start to parse through the data\nIs which angle they were coming from so of the partisan tweets eighty seven percent were from what the researchers at Clemson University who helped provide us with this data eighty seven percent they identified as right wing conservative those are the people who would be\nA sailing the players for the kneeling calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players so it's interesting to look at that breakdown wonder how that influenced the conversation\n... so it it it wasn't directed achieving a certain result just to just er things up apparently\nYeah and the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord\nAnd this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is fraught\nContentious issue and also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you want something to go viral football is the most popular sport in America they chose some pretty red meat some pretty rabid fans to try to track to this debate\nAh I gather a lot of these accounts have been closed right\nYeah so the accounts from this study have been closed but you know what we see with these it sometimes seems to be a game of whack a mole ones closed down new ones pop up and one of the interesting notes that the ... and professors had was that these are closed but they're monitor new ones that they suspect to be connected to the same operations\nAnd they're continuing to weigh in on controversial sporting topics such as a month ago we saw\nThe new Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick which again became a charged moment and then\nSuch as a month ago we saw the new Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick which again became a charged
