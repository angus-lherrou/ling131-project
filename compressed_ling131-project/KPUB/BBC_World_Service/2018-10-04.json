and countries values and things like this they become critical and is a bit difficult for their country young and probably naive because I'm here to actually figure out what the impact might be off

moved to follow the crops she'd move with them\nWhen you should change school full time she did bugging her exams but through it till she thought this was ... it wasn't until the filmmaking made a

now she's made it to university where she's an activist on child labor campaigning in support of the ban I definitely\nFeel like children shouldn't be able to work until the ages at least sixteen I think this is dangerous for the safety of these children in their education and I know there's a lot of people like me out there\nAre some people say well actually it's who writes if you'll if someone goes to school and just started a couple of hours in the evenings or perhaps a couple of hours that we can to help get them income would not be All right [noise] uh [noise] it's\nDifferent every debatable I Know these families want their children and worked to bring some income in but they're just hindering their education and I think that these families also need to find a different way to get around their situation\nDo you think you would have been able to go to school if you and your siblings hadn't worked Oh absolutely my two younger sisters still live at home\nThey've never felt like they have to go out in the field to work and that's because you know my family moved on to a different type of job that provided more for us\nSo it sounds like you're saying it's almost as though

say that these products are clean they're not touched the hands of child labor\nBecause they've seen that's connected with child labor they wouldn't get any money for them they won't be able to sell them\nExactly we don't even acknowledge their presence\nSo when the authorities come across child labor as she says that instead of helping them they want them to dissipate in\nAnd do your children are found working the state's response is come in white ... put them in and take them over the the Chinese gate homes where they're locked up but you know the way from their families and the state cause the family and then the child should never ever be seen like this again\nAnd when they're released most of the children go back to work because the problems that drove them to work in the first place I haven't been solved\nAnd this is what can be threatened is organization comes in they meet child labor isn't advantages\nAnd also then that parents why they walk some talks about the whole meal they got to the factory some said they didn't get the support they need it at school others said they had to look up the younger siblings so fetch water all of them had different reasons but they had one thing in common\nThey would not willing to transfer the boat and onto the family for instance if they ... they will not give it to seeing that your mother fish water and you'll be in school

known as the hunt chance India's local councils\nAnd a lot of the work of my organization has been to walk with these local governments with children sitting with them and the solutions in one case can be a scholarship for the child who has no money\nIt could be more funding for ... cat so children don't have to the cost of the younger siblings\nIn other cases of each year for another child in other kids it can be getting electricity for house once which don't have it and that is how we were able to create chai labels free communities and a country like India\nAnd by labor free and she doesn't mean these are communities where no children look what she means is that the work that doing no longer interferes with school like\nType ... and she says some what can be a good thing gets children useful skills and money for textbooks so school uniform it's all about making sure they can choose the right kind of work and to do that they create children's councils\nI give you an example is the religious we work with we talked to children and actually come up with a document called work we can and cannot do for instance milking the cows most of us might think it's OK harmless et cetera but these kids that\nSchool like\nType ... and she says some what can be a good thing gets children useful skills and money for textbooks so school uniform it's all about making sure they can

we can and cannot do for instance\nMilking the cows most of us might think it's OK harmless et cetera but these kids said if you're looking what are called jealousy coast which are very ... implement do and which are very happy kicking they said nobody should be doing it because it's harmful look it's dangerous\nInstead of lists drawn up by international organizations or central governments they find out what the children want some like being ... hours of household chores or thought to spend to al it's working for a local shop others might choose factory work as a milking temperamental Jersey cow\nIt's down to them and it gives them a little control over their own lives\nBut can you really expect children to meet the right decision for themselves\nI'm yet to find a child who really wants to be exploited\nThat a child to perhaps continues to walk because they feel the pressure to help that family\nWe have to give that child that choice in fact this kind of walk actually increases our responsibility when they're working with children directly you don't let them take that one decision and then forget them you're still in touch with them you're part of their life\n[noise] than our children's councils throughout bind a little it's time consuming and expensive but it's having results so is it time to rethink the ban on child labor [noise] the alone\nHope that finally we have to

pushed into more dangerous was called ... by the authorities it's debatable continue but when you take a step back it's clear that the argument isn't just about policy\nIt's about something real fundamental [noise] to some particularly in the west a child under such an age he works is by definition being exploited others say a child should have the right to walk\nAnd that's what makes it so hard to know what's right [noise]\nThe answer doesn't line our definition of child labor it's about how we view childhood\n[noise] [noise]\n\nOoh\nOoh\n[noise] it is because to gather their game change it says Tony see but I'd also an ... vision rate who's written extensively about the revolution the he believes has already gone\nYou think about why the smartphone both iPhone and Android\nHappened two thousand and seven the reason is that there was a technology convergence of technologies that meet six hundred dollars marks on possible happen two thousand and seven similarly uh by two thousand Twenty one or so\nWhen the convergence of autonomous electric and on demand\nSo imagine an over without a driver and electric that convergence will essentially means that the cost of transportation ... kilometer will be at ten\nOf the cost of owning your Petra car electric vehicles have twenty moving parts versus about two thousand moving parts for the pet shop car\nAnd in seven similarly uh by two thousand Twenty one or so\nWhen the convergence of autonomous electric and on demand\nSo imagine an over without a driver and electric that convergence will essentially means that the cost of transportation per kilometer will be at ten\nOf the cost of owning your Petro car electric vehicles have twenty moving parts versus about two thousand moving parts for the patrol car\nWhich means they're ten times cheaper to maintain the cost of charging an electric vehicle is also ten times cheaper than the cost of fueling a federal car on a per mile bases\nAnd the last five hundred thousand miles as opposed to just a hundred and forty thousand miles for the federal ...\nWhen you're older and you drive a car a hundred thousand miles per year\nOver five years you need one electric vehicle or two and a half or three federal court and then you take a driver out of the equation then the cost goes down further three or four times\nSo you combine that on demand\nAutonomous and electric and you get the ten times decrease in the cost\nThe satellite powerful arguments they're saying this is starting in twenty twenty on you know you say two three years away you're saying there's a storm coming if there was a storm coming we would see the beginnings of it now wouldn't we ... we don't ready just on the revolution that you describe happening\nWe do and if you look at the cost of an electric vehicle say that Tesla Model S was a hundred thousand dollars just in two thousand and fourteen and now you can buy a Tesla model three four fifty thousand dollars\nGreece and the cost these satellite powerful arguments you'll say this is starting in twenty twenty on you know you say two three years away you're saying there's a storm coming if there was a storm coming we would see the beginnings of it now wouldn't we and we don't really ... the revolution that you describe happening we do\nIf you look at the cost of an electric vehicle say that Tesla Model S was a hundred thousand dollars just in two thousand and four team and now you can buy a Tesla model three four fifty thousand dollars so it's come down by half\nEssentially they're going to be cheaper than buying petrol car by about twenty twenty for half the market and essentially by all the market by about twenty twenty five\nNow car companies aren't getting it after denials for the last years they're all announcing that they're investing tens of billions of dollars into an electric vehicle and autonomous vehicle technology so it's all happening\nOkay the electric vehicle revolution get autonomous vehicles self driving cars may well be a lot more than three or four years away but it's huge ... not to mention the technological hurdles\nOf being in a ton of vehicle and a lot of these cars are ready and yes there are regulatory hurdles but it's an allergy is improving explanation in several countries are investing the regulatory from China\nFor instance there are many cities that are already investing in making self driving technology happen in their cities\nBut with autonomous vehicles that is not just about persuasive technology you need the public to be happy to see these vehicles on the road and it may take a long time before the public's persuaded that self driving cars are safe\nNot correct the main adopt or uh\nOur regulatory hurdles that it's an allergy is improving explanation in several countries are investing the regulatory from China\nFor instance there are many cities that are already investing in making self driving technology happen in their cities\nBut with autonomous vehicles that is not just about persuasive technology you need the public to be happy to see these vehicles on the road and it may take a long time before the public's persuaded that self driving cars are safe\nNot correct the main adopter of autonomous technology will be flee will be the ... list of the world\nWhen they do they're going to purchase millions of cars at a time and they're going to offer consumers a product\nWhich is going to be ten times less expensive than ownership of cars and consumers are going to start trying it maybe once and maybe twice in once they get used to it then they can adopt it interrupts our car\nWhat about the worries about an autonomous vehicles plowing into a prosecutor that kind of issue it's always raised when this discussion happens\nWhen humans kill about thirty five thousand people every year\nAutonomous vehicles are already safer in many ways than humans so that's a narrative that's driven by the incumbents who don't want to see a ton of must acknowledge the disrupt their products oil products Petro cars and so on\nSo I tried to you said you think there's a storm coming back how quickly do you think this vision of robo taxis will destroy the internal combustion engine\nTen years after autonomous vehicles are ready and approved by regulators which we expect\nTo be twenty Twenty one the individual ownership of federal cars will be up suddenly it will be over\nMuch of this is driven by you\nThe income parents who don't want to see a ton of must acknowledge the disrupt their products oil products cars and so on\nSo I tried to you said you think there's a storm coming back how quickly do you think this vision of robo taxis will destroy the internal combustion engine\nTen years after autonomous vehicles already and approved by regulators which we expect\nTo be twenty Twenty one the individual ownership of federal cars will be ups on it will be over\nHow much of this is driven by your desire to see an electric revolution because you're anxious about climate change\nThis is purely gonna happen for economic reasons we've ... this has nothing to do with climate change his sense a disruption\nDriven by people and companies making the right to economic choice\nSo Tony ... believes the revolution and transportation will happen regardless of any environmental arguments\nThere she says is all about cold hot cash and even the oil industry the industry most likely to be a ended if Mr Sievers correct recognizes that radical change is already underway\nIn transportation [noise]\nThe I think I wrote for about three million vehicles today to between a hundred and even two hundred million vehicles for twenty first so that is a very high rate of growth\nMatthew ... is

quickly if there's a high another show in changing the fleet around them and vehicles can live on the road for Fifteen Years or more and then the\nGross from about three million vehicles today to

batteries with electric cars I mean there is a very compelling argument when you marry at a ton of ... and something like ... ... what was the ... coup back powerful driver of baby a change in the ...\nI think it could happen quite quickly in parts of your major cities where and when ... when I listened as we've ever had gotten buses someone like this you think could transition quickly yeah cities like London San Francisco Boston\nSingapore maybe Shanghai I think electrification is here already but it is likely to scale within the next five to ten years what is harder to coal is the degree to which we will ... off the coast and I think it's also hard or too cold the degree to which\nDriverless vehicles will will really take off and we'll like technology really deliver on the problem is\nBut I think you have to keep in mind that is probably an open model and I think we're going to see different ways of the courtroom ability in the countryside and indeed different parts of
