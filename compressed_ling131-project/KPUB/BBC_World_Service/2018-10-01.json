why is that what does it tell us about the culture here because I'll tell you what what what would it locks in in in London and the surrounding areas and he'll be make eye contact and that in itself can be quite low in the right\nYes and we did also people will if it was about their neighborhoods and and whether they would talk to people not and it was interesting looking because we have people from all over the world type part\nAnd in in nine countries in particular we were able to do more detailed comparisons and that we found that um the the UK and then and I'm from some of us have kind of comfortable uh levels of letting us and India there was a bit\nUm the the UK and then and I'm from in the U.S has kind of comparable levels of letting us and India there was a bit lower in New Zealand which was interesting and we also looked in in terms of bigger regions we looked at a which countries\nAre places where people really value that independence and northern Europe has a place that would very much be the case and they had higher levels of lending us in the country where people were very independent than in the places where people tend to depend on each other more and be happy to depend on each other\nSo being independent does not necessarily a good thing now the prime minister any this year to set up time levy aid loneliness and social isolation with a warning that millions of people were suffering from a lack of regular contact with us which is what you were pointing to in being independent how'd you sold this though what's the strategy\nWhere we off people ... solutions they found it was for them and of course with its own put his biggest is to find out what is actually what for people for people they know that it is amazing\nUm number one was finding distracting activities or oh dedicating your time to work or study all hope is max was joining a social club that also came on the list of most unhelpful suggestions that people make so it's not for everybody\nI'm changing your thinking to make it more positive to to look at them on the bright side of things are obviously sometimes are easier said than done\nAnd I don't know before it was interesting that you're starting a conversation with anyone because it hasn't got to be deep meaningful long conversations that people have that can alleviate loneliness chanting somebody when you buy your paper in the shuffle or your milk or or whatever those little things remind us we connect to everybody else in the real human and we wrote in the same well\nAnd you can listen to the full results

La Nina setting and the other matching the twenty eighth team was going to be held comma every year has some extremes the world is a big place after all but so many my impressions being that this is remarkable\nThat impression is absolutely correct and that's what made some are twenty eight teams so unique and so unprecedented\nThis is Michael Mann director of the system science center at Penn State university\nIt wasn't just that there were these regional extremes in heat waves floods wildfires droughts um it was sort of the large scale\nCoherence to these events where they were breaking out around the entire northern hemisphere and there's some interesting connections there that may hint at certain aspects of climate change and how climate changes impacting extreme weather events that aren't actually well captured in the climate models yet\nMichael Mann is well known as the author of the original hockey stick jobs a gr off putting global average temperatures over the centuries and revealing the dramatic increases in recent decades the first version was released Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight yeah fired up by another dramatic El Nino event\nBut which now ranks at least nine among annual average is a ... degree behind twenty sixteen\nBut Michael Mann admits that these global averages or any parts of the climate\nBridges ... degree behind twenty sixteen but Michael Mann that ... these global averages Ernie parts of the climate story ... ... the ... masses to us\nToo often we take a narrow view and I say we\nSort of climate scientists and in our efforts to communicate to science to the public into policymakers too often we take this narrow view that climate is about averages and yes we expect average temperatures on the earth to continue to increase and\nThat has huge ramifications for global sea level rise for melting ice sheets et cetera but climate\nMore generally refers to the statistics of the weather and those statistics can be the averages because averages are statistics but it can also be the extremes and so it is relevant from the standpoint of climate to talk about how many are logical extremes\nAre changing and indeed as you allude to that's where the rubber hits the road um when it comes to\nYou know people becoming aware and concerned about the impact of climate change uh there's no greater way to connect the dots than to help them understand that these extreme events that are impacting us now it isn't just about polar bears up in the Arctic it's about\nUnprecedented heat and floods and drought and wildfires that are impacting us that are unfolding in real time on our television screens in our newspaper headlines that is the face of climate change this is the face of climate change\nNevertheless I voted wants to be cautious weather of some kind of group does happen every yeah\nOf course you know write that one into what Iran is not necessarily harming our town which is the reason why we do ... do you think of them are\nAnd I think this summer and it's right to say this is something different or something that the news to me\nAnd I think this summer and it's right to say this is something different something that we used to be\nQuite rare and is now ready to call in and then\nNot just the fact that there were heat waves and droughts and floods and wildfires we expect those to become more frequent around the world\nAs the world warms up a world warms up well of course you're going to get more intense and long lived here it's of heat heat waves\nThe atmosphere gets warmer can hold more moisture so when it does rain you get more of it at once you get bigger floods\nAt the same time those warmer temperatures cause more evaporation from soils you get worse droughts you take extreme drought you combine it with extreme heat you're going to get wildfires\nSo the science there is pretty basic as I said before it isn't rocket science or as we say here in the states but what is interesting is that there may be something more than just those factors those factors we understand they're fairly well captured in the models\nWhat isn't well captured in the models is the fact that climate change may be impacting the behavior of the northern hemisphere jet stream in a way that actually causes these weather systems to become larger an apple two ... and to get stuck in place\nChanges in the ... jet stream wins one reason the Europe stood baking for so many weeks\nThey also put another high over Siberia with high heat that and over North America where the most dramatic effects were extensive wildfires in British Columbia Canada and in California with seasonal conditions on combating a multi year drought says Michael mine\nCalifornia is getting warmer in warmer it's warmest summers have been the last few years um it's getting a drier and drier in part because those weather systems are getting pushed to the north denying it the winter precipitation that would help suppress um the summer droughts are so you know you've got a dry and conditions\nYou're getting pushed to the north denying it the winter precipitation that would help suppress um the summer droughts are so you know you've got a drying conditions you got warmer conditions and all of that uh feeds into the potential for worst wildfires and what we saw happen for I Would say the first time\nWas the disappearance of the notion of a fire season used to be that summers fire season to California Winter isn't\nNow California appears to have a perpetual fire season because the worst wildfire it ever had seen as of last winter was the Thomas wildfire last winter in Southern California\nOnly this summer did we see an even worse wildfire in in the Mendocino Complex fire northern California and some of the other wildfires that broke out so California now has in essence a perpetual fire season and that is an indication of the\nThe profound challenged the climate changes already\nPosing to us\nFrom our historic emergency the largest fire forty now bigger than the size of a fabulous [noise]\n\nThese are the conditions lived inexperienced fine then yeah queen David some fire experts at the University of California\nCompounded the tree stressing effects of long term drowned was enough rain in northern California last winter to stimulate a surge of bras gross to add an abundance of drawing on the gross which fueled far storms\nIn some parts of California we had a hundred and eighty percent of normal for graft production so I think a lot of fire people were thinking\nYou know this just isn't looking good and all it's gonna take is an ignition on the right day with the right whether to cause a real problem and so when the Carr Fire started I was over here I live on the coast and suffered from\nThe right whether to cause a real problem and so when the Carr Fire started I was over here I live on the coast and suffered from some of the hot weather and things like that but pretty immediately that fire was raising hairs and my husband actually went over and worked on that fire and\nUm I I think we we're all feeling tension that we're not used to feeling around fire in California we've had it you know the last\nTen years we've had unprecedented fires almost every every year every other year but the Carr Fire felt different\nBecause ... affecting a major residential turned walls and it's so terrifying but the big one was the far in Mendocino have actually a pair of funds started on July twenty sevens early finally confirmed extinguished last week\nThere was the ranch fire and the river fire and those were burning nearer to each other on the north and west sides of clear lake which is one of the largest lakes in California it was during the height of the summer so the hottest days over a hundred degrees solid winds blowing through those areas it was\nJust all the right conditions for fast fire spread and extreme fire behavior and so the fires grew so quickly\nThey were sometimes burning twenty thousand acres in a twenty four hour period or or more maybe\nThe the rate of growth made it very difficult for Cruz to to get a handle on it and they ended up burning four hundred and ten thousand acres and I we all have heard that that's the biggest fire in California history I think that the next big us was last year in Southern California at two hundred and eighty thousand acres so\nA very large area\nOf course is not just being heat waves and fires while California ... in ... and yet they have the worst monsoon funding in a hundred years [noise]\nRain comes to care\nBeing heat waves and fires well California bunt in camera south India they had the worst monsoon funding in a hundred years

say labor party view and breakfast is extraordinarily confused so I ... the sound fusing issue\nIf you're not confused when you're facing a confusing issue if unethical but given the Kobus position on bricks it remains even off the Labour Party conference unclear I Can't see how bricks it can be the driver of them\nBut given the opens position on bricks it remains even off the Labour Party conference unclear I Can't see how bricks it can be the driver of the moments undoubtedly\nAs I said it was it created a light station in this country\nThat British democracy and its role in the world and not be taken for granted it means to be invented let's look at look at the the bad side this gives the people who have Britain and opportunity to reconsider their position in the world and I believe that the judge me has been doing a very good job\nAt a recognizing that the last ... years of privatization of moving towards a business model that effectively tied the economy's growth on two bottles on the housing bubble and on the city of London and he's causing any assessment of they even with that or it's\nInteresting so you would say because you talked about the last generation of politicians in the u._k. who in your view played that sort of neo liberal economic ... you would say that Tony Blair was in no way a left of center politician would you\nWhat does it mean on the one hand he was because he gave a lot of money to their health service money that they thought he said stop the national health service off but at the very same time\nHe did it by aligning himself fully with the city of London turning a blind eye to the private money men thing of the private banks and creating the circumstances that lead to disaster than an eight and to the collapse in two thousand and eight\nWhat I'm getting too is that the John Macdonald the the the current shadow chancellor of the exchange or here in the case has made a big speech where he's painted a picture of a radical economic program including just one example\nThe man the tree imposition on business in the u._k. of a need to have ten percent of ... given to the workers in the company the dividends would then go to those workers and that would\nBusiness in the u._k. ever need to have\nTen percent of ... given to the workers in the company the dividends would then go to those workers and\nThat would be a cap on the amount of dividend to be received by each work on the excess beyond that would go to the government so it would actually be a huge new corporate tax it would fundamentally change the relationship between the state and the corporate sector in the u._k. in a very sort of left of center way\nDo you really believe the British people are going to vote for that\nI think so and I'm very glad to have hut or John Macdonald put forward there have been proposing to McDonald about the program we eras things you've been saying for cyber opposing it precisely that\nWith one difference I've been proposing the creation of a social ... fund where that ten percent of the shadows after every ... or capitalizing by corporations go into the public will fund\nAnd then the dividends are

goals to huge amounts of public debt ... how big is Chinese public debt well uh it\nAbout ... at the end of two thousand Seventeen was around three hundred and thirty percent of its national income which is just over three times as big as it was ten years ago\nThat sounds like a very big number it is a big number I mean we don't really know to be fat whether that there is any magical number at

... neighborhood of that trade within the last night but said he didn't want to lose that jeopardize that no matter how they stop it's like President Trump evidently was with the current arrangements

industry particularly when ah they agree to high percentage of caused destined for cross border trade would be built in higher wage factories that pushes down that competitive advantage\nOr on a means

at this stage those down at both sides so at least sounding pleased with the result\nThanks very much well let's turn to the Canadian side of things uh this is what President Trump had to say about American farmers\nThe deal includes a substantial increase in our farmers opportunities to explored American we poultry eggs and dairy including milk butter cheese yogurt and ice cream to name a few I Want to be very specific\nI Want to reverse [noise]\nI've been Trump likes to scoops of ice cream we understand but will the Canadians like this part of the deal Jessica\nWell look if this is considered a win for you as far as it is very much less though for Canadian dairy they're definitely a couple of concessions made by the Canadian team not including increasing the slice of the dairy market available to us producers from er about one percent two three point six\nPercent and the dairy farmers are not at all happy that they're saying that it really this is putting their their future of the future of their families at risk in Canada that this is not the first\nThe deal Jessica\nWell look if this is considered a win for us farmers is very much less so for Canadian dairy they're definitely a couple of concessions made by the Canadian team that's including increasing the slice of the dairy market available to us producers from a about one percent two three point six\nPercent and the dairy farmers are not at all\nHappy about it they're saying that really this is putting their their future of the future of their families at risk especially since Canada this is not the first time that Canada has increased access to its dairy market as part of a trade deal notably a with a ... seat a deal with the European Union\nNow this could spell trouble for Trudeau in uh the upcoming election which is coming up in twenty Nineteen especially in the province of Quebec were there are a lot of dairy farmers\nAll that said what to do is saying today is look at first off the U.S was really seeking a complete dismantling of Canada supply management system around dairy\nThat was the original us demand it is very much pare down there just getting more access he's also a promising a full compensation for dairy farmers in Canada so that should take\nSome of the sting out of his concession\nOn what about the personal relationship that brings up a pretty ... times between the leaders of kind of getting the United states in recent months but they're also founding courtroom today what what's your assessment\nTesty I think is the word a U.S president Donald Trump or use to today describing\nSome of the the the um the the relationship between him and Trudeau in recent months and I think that's fair I think it was the most heated around June around the G. seven meeting and come back we're Trudeau came out saying that Canada would not be pushed around by the U.S on trade a Trump came out calling him Meek mild week I\nBetween the leaders of Canada and the United states in recent months but\nThey're all sounding quite warm today what what's your assessment testy\nI think is the word a U.S president Donald Trump or use to today describing\nSome of the the the um the the relationship between him and Trudeau in recent months and I think that's fair I think it was the most heated around you and around the G. seven meeting and get back where true came out saying that candidate would not be pushed around by the U.S on trade\nA Trump came out calling me ... miles a week I and and not really just showed that there was a lot of tension between the two when it came to trade\nNow at least for today it looks like it's water under the bridge this may sound like a bit of a ... but\nThe Canada and us relationship has weathered a lot of storms I'm between its leaders leaders have not always gotten along and I think that that ties you go deeper than than sometimes politics and sometimes these disagreements that happened between between leaders\nJessica ... thanks very much a governor don't here in Washington just a quick thought you mentioned that this is a kind of deal that will appeal to some of those votes as in the er the post industrial Midwestern states which will be so important to President Trump and his presidential victory do you think this will have an impact on the midterm elections that are coming up\nI think it's possible and I think it's possible that will motivate some of the base of the voted for him to come out and say sign cute or in some in that sense all their votes has\nNever really thank you for things you've done any refer things you promising to do or the farmers may may do the same but so the president has out to sacrifice something he's given up for example he's insistence on on scrapping like who the chops and Nineteen policy of NAFTA which is the arbitration mechanism Canadians of\nOf their own why on that and of course the other big thing was still in place is the steel and aluminum tariffs\nThink it's possible and I think it's possible that will motivate some of the base that that voted for him to come out and say thank you are in ... in that sense all their votes has\nNever really thank you for

extremely protection um you know we have to deal with all\nOf a framework ... deal incredible and uh you know junior to to work this deal and to make things better for for all three parties in in this particular agreements not\nEveryone is happy though one one a Canadian companies direct to the United steelworkers said Canada's sold out some stealing Ali many workers by not getting rid of the twenty five percent steel tariffs and the ten percent a highly medium terrorists has that had to be some compromise that or not if not all of your votes as well let's take will be happy about\n[noise] well not particular matter the American president used to thirty two\nYou know we continue to to work this deal and to make things better for for all three parties in in this particular agreements not\nEveryone is happy though one one a Canadian company direct to the United states ... by not getting rid of the twenty five percent steel tariffs and the ten percent a highly medium ... says that had to be some compromise that are not ... not all of your votes as well let's take will be happy about\n[noise] well not particular matter the American president used to be to a national security measure than to this\nUm ... will separate from the than the negotiations to put\nTariffs on steel and aluminum around the world including Canada and uh our government is committed to um you know supporting the industry that two billion dollars to play to a a support workers and the industry and to strengthen the steel industry in limited streets along and that's one piece\nAnd put in place dollar for dollar um counter terrorists and\nUh so with today's deal it's very positive because it's moving forward\nA in a in a positive manner and I've spoken with prime minister and I've spoken with the ministry of trade I Amish are they are committed to a you know getting this positive the momentum to continue\nTo grow shading and getting rid of those tariffs because that will be a win win for both of us 'cause of businesses are affected on board ... both sides of the border\nYou started your comments by saying the U.S administration is is fundamentally protectionist\nThat's no change that has it and and despite this deal us still going to have a fight on your hands to keep the kind of a trade that you want with it on you\n[noise] we gotta keep ... you know redouble our efforts and

forward or you know we gotta keep on this momentum and just keep keep working at a law obviously we have the number of months or had us where we roll up our sleeves and you know we continue to work\nOr to gather because we put dollar for dollar no steel and aluminum but we've also put tariffs on a number of other a steel products and um you know it will be a and everyone's best interest for us to to get rid of those tariffs the two or three to\nWhich which is a ... century\n[noise] it ... it is it's not good economics it's it's not a good for anyone so I think that you know cutting off the ministry ... of putting the two thirty chew on autos which would have been devastating for the economy is on both side was critical in this agreement\nAnd also supports the steel industry because that's one of the number one places where the steel ends I\nBriefly Yemen and President Trump said he was in love with Kim Jong un ah yesterday did you think he's back in love with Justin
