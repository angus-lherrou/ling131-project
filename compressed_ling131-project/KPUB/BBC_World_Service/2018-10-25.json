that's not something that we're seeing are still seeing lower level executives attending the conference they say you know they want to\nBe in Saudi but the image is still important and that's why the

definitely a very heavy presence of Gulf area individuals\nSo essentially if the Americans or Europeans were staying away it's pretty easy to find others to step into that that place\nIs definitely a

anticipating a change of direction from Saudi Arabia will this play out in terms of policy irrespective of the leaders\nIn general I think that they are committed to their economic diversification plan I don't think that would increase any other types of the farms main focus is really on improving the economy improving employment through major investments from the government at the very top

percent more likely to wake at young children the American study that's just been published used a recording also mother's voice of the children that they studied and they again so a significant

for the work that we did it was the combination of that\nBeeping sound intermittent sound but it was the frequency of that that was important and the combination of office of voice the American study has shown just a just a voice and so I think it's a combination of of different types of the sounds that are the things that is critical and crucial\nThe research done in the United states was with children and all the less likely to wake up more than ... than an adult\nThat certainly being the finding that we've had an under the American study\nHas provided very similar results to the study that we did the difference between the two is that we studied children and their own home so we launched a very large citizen science project to do that um we studied the children that were were in their own beds in their own homes where is the American piece of work has done the work in a sleep\nLab or a tree so there's a little bit of a difference in that regard but it certainly was showing

to keep some prison drug policy expert at Stanford University what could politicians on this new legislation white has\nJust said drugs crisis in the U.S gather such momentum\nBut we have three waves of it so initially it starts due to poor regulation of pharmaceutical companies that make opioids which led to quadrupling of prescribing in the United states from the mid nineties for about Fifteen Years\nAnd that brought us to level like about six times per capita what you would see in Great Britain for example\nThe bad guys many people addicted to prescription opioids and then came the second wave was that heroin traffickers are reasons correctly that if they opened up shop in a lot of American towns where they had previously not had a presence\nThere would be able to convert a lot of people from opioid pills to heroin and they were right and so then that started our second phase\nAnd then most recently in the last five years or so has been the infiltration\nOf the heroin supply with fentanyl which is a synthetic opioid far more potent than heroin and that has turned a disaster into a catastrophe or you know upper scale we haven't seen and drug policy and in several generations\nI mean what does tend to know and why it has become so popular among uses\nSentinel is entirely synthetic opioid that means that does not dry\nWhy has it become so popular among uses\nSentinel is entirely synthetic opioid that means that does not drive from the opium poppy you can make it in a lab you can make it in your sink\nTherefore many people can produce it and at the moment the main producers are in China which has a large chemical industry in large pharmaceutical industry they're not tightly regulated\nAnd with the Internet they've been able to get markets where they sell directly to Americans and sometimes deliver a it here in our postal service\nAnd the other thing they've done is established links with Mexico where they deliver federal benefits blended into the heroin which is very appealing to heroin traffic or because now you have a drug you can make just as strong it at a much lower price than heroin cost and then that is then imported and the U.S over the U.S Mexico border\nSo serious is the problem now in the United states the Democrats and Republicans have come together to back this legislation in an attempt to a ... ... one of the main ended up and solve that legislation\nProbably the first thing to note is it what is not there which is there's not an enormous amount of money the parties were far apart on that issue nonetheless they did find a lot of sensible policies that weren't expensive but are should be helpful things like\nA reimbursing the training of people who specialize in addiction having our Medicare program which is our program for senior citizens cover opioid addiction treatment which had not done up to that point\nOf supporting efforts to use a different insurance program called Medicaid for people who are in a jails and prisons because they're extremely high risk of overdose and so there's going to be demonstration projects where there'll be able to get access to health care before they leave prison and hopefully that will preserve their lives but\nAnd so there's going to be demonstration projects where they'll be able to get access to health care before they leave prison and hopefully that will preserve their lives but there are many things like that that together I think we'll add up to saving some lives even though is is not a transformative piece of legislation\nSo how we get a measure the success of this legislation would it be the reduction in the number of deaths from drug overdoses\nThat would certainly be a very good outcome although it's you know only one of multiple outcomes that ad or being addicted to opioids is very hard and people's health and also just they're functioning in daily life and their ability to you know hold a job or succeed in school or just play an active part in their families so also be measuring\nThe prevalence of addiction in the country and then we're going to measure the prevalence of new addiction in other words if we're providing health care properly it's not just a matter of people who are already addicted surviving we should stop creating as many addicted people as we have in prior years\nThat was a case I'm preserve drug policy
