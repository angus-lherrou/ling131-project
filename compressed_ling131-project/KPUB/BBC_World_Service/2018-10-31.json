I think one of the key findings rallies by by looking back over an extended period of time we're able to to track how place in governmental responses have changed at all to the ... to to to the new information of our but I Am one of the things that's quite clear is\nIf they say nothing if they do leave that vacuum that other people will come in and make mischief so it's really important\nFor all the place of government and politicians to be able unclear to say in these kind of moments of emergency in crisis what people are very ... you know this is what we can tell you said that you don't leave a cat so others can come in to fill the misinformation and disinformation\nPops mountain in ... and ... and you read that report what did you make of it um I think it's really important what freshly because it's it's ... I Need to be you know it's one of the things this is just sensible it it is clear that this will help because what it does is allows organizations the uh\nYou and it is you know it's one of the things this is just sensible\nIt it is clear that this will help because what it does is allows organizations that are responsible in some way for the inflation flow around these terrible events\nTo think about how they respond to have a strategy in place which we can follow that makes it much less likely that they would just do something to magically or make a mistake because you formal like be to get you roll if you go on your instincts at a time like this\nAnd I think it offers also advice for all of us made overseas outside of journalists who are taking this information coming out but also

doing because you're a therapist\nAnd then when they haven't done that and it's pretty easy to tell but they lie that left on their exercises because they you get them to perform at and I've got no

stable so the center over to the terrorists go in the phone that you already have are perfectly capable of measuring these movements and basically it's measuring the angle on the balance board and thereby your center now\nSo you got till then measured the movements you make on that balance board and transfer them to the computer which runs the games which turns those movements in something that

as we cover what are the most serious problems America faces today the opioid epidemic\nWhile you're about to hear is or journalists following this story as it unfolds\nNo and what isn't children\nIt's friday the fourteenth September\nI'm Laura ... investigative reporter with the Courier Journal\nI'm working on a story about babies who are born withdrawing from drugs\nMy name is dawn forums and I am in the in ecology is I take care of sick babies that are in the ICU I'm after they're born said to me and now I [noise]\nWhen babies are not born addicted that is a common misnomer that addiction is a complex and complicated disease it has multiple facets to it they're babies are not born addicted they're not track babies their infants that were exposed to a substance in utero that exposure is\nFacets to it so babies are not born addicted they're not drug babies their infants that were exposed to a substance in utero\nThat exposure is a long enough lead to a dependency and because they became dependent on that substance once airborne and they no longer have that substance being provided\nThey become at risk of going through withdrawal and what sorts of um withdrawal symptoms debate has so babies have the same which all Simpsons as adult they have symptoms that affect their GI systems so vomiting diarrhea\nExcessive volume off they have respiratory symptoms so they read fast they had difficulty breathing retractions and grunting and what we call it the kidney a which is just fast breathing\nThey also have temperature instability these kids tend to run hot but the categories that we worry about are the ones that are going to compromise their wellbeing so babies are in control of oil and crying that is babies don't handle that\nYou and I can cry for hours and days and we'll be fine babies can't cry for hours because as they cry for hours they become physically exhausted and that leads them to actually start having symptoms of really being sick babies typically when they're born sleep twenty plus hours but these little ones that go through withdrawal in part because of their distress in part because of their crying\nThey sleep substantially less than that and then the absence of sleep any of us will get sick but babies that happens within hours today's instead of weeks\nAnd what kind of trend have you seen 'em in the last few years um

about how we ought to welcome all people who are basically law abiding peaceful well meaning people\nPeople tend to neglect that this would really entail a radical change in the nature of our society's the nature of our welfare states are in much else and also on the other side you have people\nWho often times are very concerned about the change in character of their societies but you know they don't appreciate that to some degree the character of these societies are already changing regardless of what happens these have you migration so I think that there's a lot of confusion in the debate because of\nThat well you on this issue than my answer is pretty straightforward my answer is that if you're thinking\nAbout the coming decades we're going to face major challenges of off shoring\nStraightforward my answer is that if you're thinking about the coming decades we're going to face major challenges of off shoring automation and much else\nWe do need to have somewhat more integration somewhat more cohesion in our market democracies which otherwise risk coming apart at the themes in class terms and many other terms besides and because of that with that in mind we ought to adopt a more integration friendly\nMigration policy one thought is that you're not necessarily going to radically increase the number of a new migrants when you will do is perhaps move towards selecting them on the basis of skills selecting them on the basis of a who will be in a position to help finance the safety net for\nThe various migrants we've absorbed over the last thirty or forty years because that to my mind is the really big challenge it's the second generation challenge how do we ensure that the second generation the children of working class immigrants are properly integrated into our society and are allowed to flourish\nIt kind of changes the whole nature of what America is about though is well doesn't it I mean the America's always been about people coming to see the American dream is being always be in the country what people just go to realize what they call it ...\nWell ... I Would disagree with that for this reason when you think about our immigration policy it's always been embedded in a larger context if you look in the Eighteen hundreds for example the early Eighteen hundreds\nThat was a time with the birth rate in the states with about seven per woman it was an extraordinarily prolific birth rate compared to today and that really made the context very different because immigration was not a hugely\nImportant part of\nPopulation change in the United states in that era\nIf you look at later you're us this was still a time when the journey to the United states was arduous and you did not have instantaneous communication there are many different changes\nThis was still a time when the journey to the United states was arduous and you did not have instantaneous communication\nThere are many different changes another is that you used to have an enormous appetite for low skilled workers who could fuel the growth of the manufacturing sector the agricultural sector which needed desperately needed large numbers of new body is if you look at a post industrial knowledge intensive highly urbanized economy\nThan the situation is quite different and it creates new class stratification that entail new social programs and that also mean that we have different pressures and challenges when it comes to integrating folks who come from very low income very deprived background so I think that when you\nThink about the story of American immigration it's important to remember that it was always changing it was always evolving in response to larger global economic changes\nRe ... Saddam editor of the national review conservative magazine in the U. S.\nCurbing immigration as he suggests would spell the end of a classic American narrative that's just the panelists immigrant who arrives to seek a new life and through hard work and determination goes on to prosper and thrive\nSo would that be a dramatic change to America's history of immigration after all the United states is often described as ... the largest immigrant population in the world\nIt's a question I put two of these that Trump ski she's professor of history at Salem State University in Massachusetts\nIf you look at the history of integration and how immigrants who've been treated in the United states you see a big change happening after the civil war\nPrior to the civil war citizenship was restricted to white people in the United states it was a racial citizenship and in the grants were welcome to that is white people were welcomed there were no restrictions on immigration at all\nBut the restrictions were placed on citizenship\nThey were welcome to that is white people were welcome to there were no restrictions on immigration at all but the restrictions were placed on citizenship and there was in fact the importation of a huge non white working class people from Africa who were enslaved and brought here\nWho did the manual labor the agricultural labor but they were not eligible for citizenship and they were not considered immigrants so when we see this has always been a country of immigrants it's really a very racialized narrative and it's connected to labor and the idea that white people are citizens\nAnd people of color are workers to be exploited and not eligible to citizenship now after the civil war African Americans are granted citizenship citizenship by birth is created\nAnd this is when we start seeing restrictions on immigration and these restrictions are absolutely racialized the purpose of them is to prevent workers of color from becoming citizens so we have huge categories of people defined as racially ineligible to citizenship\nAnd they are not allowed to immigrate in order to prevent them from gaining citizenship by birth\nThat would imply that the American dream is a myth\nIt's a very racialized myth that is it's been a dream for white immigrants it's a dream that was created for white immigrants and the people of color have always been excluded from\nThat in that sense what President Trump is doing today is not really that much different than what happened previously\nNo it's not and I think that we make a mistake when we talk about\nThe idea of the American dream in the midst of upward mobility that this is something that when we look over the nineteenth and twenty a centuries have applied to primarily to European immigrants we look at the period of the late Nineteen ... early twentieth century of large European immigration where this suppose that American Dream was created this\nP. N. immigrants we look at the period of the late Nineteen ... early twentieth century of large European immigration where this suppose it American Dream was created this was not a period of the American dream for Mexican immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for Chinese immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for immigrants from Africa\nNow people of color have also accepted this mythology that is the idea that the United states as a country of opportunity the American dream but if you look at how the economy functions today it is still heavily reliant on the exploited labor of people of color the immigrants who are coming into the country today\nIt's a bifurcated immigration that is there is a very elite immigration of highly educated uh people in technology but the majority of immigrants do not fall into that category the majority of immigrants are poor\nLow educational levels and they are filling a very important role in the U.S service economy there are jobs for them but there's not upward mobility for them\nAs a dean a period in American immigration history when the opportunities for say an Asian or African or a Latin American immigrant with the same as those for European nope there haven't even more recent on\nThat doesn't mean that there has never been an Asian or Latin American or African immigrants who have succeeded in gaining upward mobility and I'm becoming very successful in the United states but if you look at it that typically those populations have been permanently marginal\nAnd clear that you're on a different and the political spectrum to\nAround ... the editor of the national review who had from the other what do you make of his argument that in order to safeguard democracy in America in the moment to allow the current population to adapt to changing economy what's needed is a cook on immigration\nA democracy in America at the moment to allow the current population to adapt to change it calling me what's needed is a cook on immigration because what is happening is that the economy in America is changing to one that founded on knowledge on stem subjects rather than a Monday factory well\nThat Dan knowledge economy requires a huge service economy to service it who is cleaning the house is taking care of the children making the food growing the food for all of the wealthy people in the service economy it's poor people of color who are providing those services\nProfessor a visa Chomsky at Salem State University and in case you're wondering yes she is the director of the famous American ...
