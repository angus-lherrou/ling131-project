process\nYou know the qualifications are\nPrimarily a country object as we go into countries that have a a GDP of less than Fifteen thousand US dollars per person and that's a hundred and thirty

because\nThere are people now who have no medical care\nWhere one of the few countries in the world or the supposed to be civilized that doesn't take care of our people through healthcare so this is

mean it's just like I said Social Security Medicare Medicaid\nThis is just the next logical step I think it's progress number ...\n... you might if I Do a couple more questions are awry\nAs young bacon campaign volunteers campus votes we get the view of the wise old man of the Republican Party how do full term congressman and to to the mayor of Omaha he says the bacon Eastman contest has national implications\nSo think about this race for the house seat here as a bellwether indicator\nNot only of how things are now but how they may be drifting over the next two years\nSeems to me that if done bacon the Republican nominee wins here that will be a signal that the composition of the voter me that Republican Democrat male or female rural or urban or suburban\nIs still leaning objectively moderately to the right\nNow at this point in time or\nOn the doorstep congressman seems to be winning hearts minds ... votes but would it be enough for victory was brutally conservative

for victory was brutally conservative state like Nebraska send the progressive punk fund to Washington a question for the support says she's just spoken to that don't ...\nI Believe that there is potential for a movement based on current political standings and maybe I should say I hope versus I Believe\n... rather than belief and without a democratic votes will only or spoke to Rosen morning she's political reporter with the Omaha will Harold she told me that this race is shaping up to be the most expensive one this congressional swing district has ever seen or the mom and she said the funding momentum seems to be with Kara Eastman\nEastern raise one point five million dollars in the last three months that triples what she had before and she got a lot of money from\nIndividuals as opposed to committees are groups are companies or whatever and and it's from all across the country she's become it shows that she's become this kind of figure head in the progressive movement\nAnd does that mean that this race and this one district does as we heard that from the former ... become this bellwether for how the Democratic party is is running and wherever it is going\nYet so the um progressing groups that want to prove they can win in swing districts are looking to this state she is one of the one in the only ones with this kind of new crop of leaders that in a conservative area so if she can win\nFigurehead and progressive movement\nAnd does that mean that this\nRace and this one district does as we heard there from the former ... become this bellwether for how the Democratic party use is running and where it is going\nYet so the um progress in groups that want to prove they can win in swing districts are looking to this state she is one of the one in the only ones that this kind of new crop of leaders that in\nA conservative area so if she can win here you're going to see a lot more progressive trying to make the case in other swing districts that they can win and then they should get national support because look parties and did it\nIs it something about what's happening here in Omaha Nebraska has brought to to the top in the Democratic party or is it simply a a national picture\nOh so the demographics of Omaha haven't changed all that much but I Do think that this is the year for progressive and you're seeing that here as well as elsewhere ... we had progressive in Omaha\nBefore um but they never had a candidate to rally around like this and a lot of her policies are becoming kind of mainstream democratic principles and so you're seeing and she she has more opportunities this year than she would have previously\nNow we're talking about midterm elections which don't generally get huge turnout so I'm not going to be key to this so she's got some money she's got a bit of momentum she'd go energy nationwide but we'll let necessarily translate into votes\nSo that's a good question so her whole hypothesis is that she needs to give\nVoter that Democrats in Nebraska should give voters a reason to be excited and then they'll show up for and they haven't shown on previously for the more moderate so she's doing a lot of door knocking and be heard and she's doing a lot of outreach to voters directly because her whole strategy is trying to turn out the boats and you don't see many of us\nPreviously now we're talking about mid term elections which don't generally get huge turnout so and that's going to be key to this so she's got some money she's got a bit of momentum she'd go energy nationwide but we'll let necessarily

ads she's not focusing on it as much you might see more ads from her because she got that one point five million on but she also has been a lot of her money on voter outreach which isn't the traditional typical path they take\nOn what about the Trump ... how does how does he play into this race in this state\nSo Trump um came here and spoke and bacon spoke on stage with him on right now it seems that cabin his nomination of cabinet in particular is actually turning on both sides so Democrats are really mad about cabinet but you're also seeing Republicans mad about how Democrats handled it and\nOne thing that I'm hearing a lot from Republican women is that\nThey are upset that liberal women have kind of been speaking for all women and they want to send a message no we're
