R. T. V.\nAnd that in addition to what we call multi drug resistant tuberculosis it's one of the top five countries in the world and so they had a difficult time in treating patients\nUsing the capital and they were able to find that these very very difficult patients that they were able to actually have an extremely good success rate of Ninety three percent is one of the two new drugs that we have for tuberculosis\nIn the last fifty years so uh this is a ... is a big breakthrough but it points out the need for more\nKinds of drugs like this\nAnd it's important because with tuberculosis you cannot treat with just one drug you must have at least to effective drugs so just didn't developing one and and just giving that alone is going to cause resistance to that particular drug\nIs this is ... ... so that's the only way to be tuberculosis is to have one drug and combined with the others was does that mean it was simply a case of mixing a cult sounds gathering the right way and then eventually you know ... bingo\nThe others who does that mean it was simply a case of mixing ... doing the right way and then eventually you know ... bingo you've done it\nRight now since we only have two new drugs that means that you do have to combine them with the drugs that we already know about ... and uh but that's not going to be good enough pretty soon you're going to need at additional new medications in order to get to the to the bottom of treating tuberculosis in all its forms why\nIs the book you know it's just so from aids points of view so successful\nTuberculosis is successful it's it's an organism that can live in your body in a dorm at fashion you can live there for years maybe never even develop if your immune system is healthy you may never even actually develop the actual disease all just like dormant in your body\nAnd some ... and then other times if your immune system is weak for example when you have HIV when you have diabetes or in other conditions that where your immune system goes down certain cancers a kidney disease that can actually make the organism\nCome alive again to actually develop to actually develop the deep disease of tuberculosis\nAnd tuberculosis is spreading to to rich countries is that correct\nI think that the tuberculosis is a disease of low and middle income countries in countries like the United states or the the numbers and the rates are very low but there is something very interesting that's going on in especially the middle income countries like South Africa China\nIndia needed the countries that have some of the highest burdens of tuberculosis there now middle income countries they're rich countries are becoming richer and with that becomes better nutrition and in some cases a lot of obesity why is that important because obesity is linked to diabetes and diabetes is linked to the curriculum is is because\nIf you have diabetes your risk of coming down with tuberculosis is three times higher so that we can have the think about\nAnd diabetes is linked to tuberculosis because\nIf you have diabetes your risk of coming down with tuberculosis is three times higher so that we can ... the thing about it's like putting fire\nOn something where you're tuberculosis is common and now you're going to have diabetes adding feel to that fire and I can see a a gross of the tuberculosis in somebody's especially middle income countries that quarter of the world faces and it is in India\nOkay and then if there is the obesity is going up there then you have the ... the people who have a dormant in their bodies growing in a place like the United states where the where the background a level of tuberculosis very low\nEven you when you have obesity you're not in diabetes in term it's not you're not going to see the effects as much\nFor ... for countries like India South Africa China the priority will be to find a base of the would die and we'd lifestyle and through that way you can be to back you know is is\nThat that's one of the ways that you were able to beat tuberculosis ultimately what you need for tuberculosis it to make sure that people are treated appropriately with the right combination of drugs\n[noise] took to pull the food you are there from the international union against tuberculosis and lung disease telling us about discovery by scientists but to Ninety percent of patients who had a form of a drug resistant tuberculosis and not to send to them recovered very significant indeed\nFour years ago a bunch of friends came up with the deal should you know feature film impoverished bad no money no ...

I'm going to go out on a limb here and suggest that if I buy one ticket mild on winning up ...\nThat's correct in fact your odds of winning or I'm exactly one and three hundred and about one in three hundred and two million and that's true no matter what the jackpot sizes\nBut win the jackpot ... gets large then more people buy because they they're just imagining themselves those billionaire so\nEven if my one in three hundred million show comes off that possibly others who will be sharing it with me 'cause most people have signed up for a ticket\nThat's correct I Believe the the lottery commission has said that they expect Seventy five percent of all possible combinations to be purchased by tomorrow so there's a pretty good chance that someone's going to win\nSaid he also knew me winning a pretty ... 'cause I'm not in the U. S. but the old some someone winning considerably better\nI think it's pretty likely someone will win well or or possibly many people will when depending on how the how the numbers law\nWould it technically be possible\nTo buy some many tickets that you would guarantee yourself a victory\nIn principle you could buy all possible combinations but in practice it's impossible there are three hundred million combinations and the tickets cost two dollars each so if you had six hundred million dollars that's the first obstacle and then\nYou wouldn't be may be willing to invest it in the lottery and win over a billion\nHundred million dollars that's the first obstacle and then\nUh you wouldn't be may be willing to invest it in the lottery and win over a billion dollars but the trick of course is you're not guaranteed that you'll be the only winning tickets so you're jackpot might be cut in half instantly or even further if there's multiple winners\nAnd I spent on top of that the sharing logistics of buying that many tickets I'm going to be easy\nTo absolutely not or if you do a back of the envelope kind of calculation or you will find that even if you have somebody filling out of all possible numbers\nIn a certain range\nAbout one ticket every\nTen seconds you might be one person might be able to fill out about ten thousand tickets between now and win the\nLottery is drawn but you need to fill up three hundred million so you're going to need to hire a thirty thousand people and that ... going to want to share with my ... greedy I Would imagine that they're all going to expect a share maybe they could do a little uh\nYou know if you get the the winning tickets like a Charlie and the chocolate factory you might be the one who gets it\nIn ... I'm probably not going to win this last round my\nI I Would say that's the safest bet I know and in fact\nI Would say that no one listening to this program is likely to win the lottery I Know the BBC has lots of listeners but I'm going to go out on a limb if you're listening to this program and you win the lottery called me up and proving I'm wrong\nYou know what color south and print out and that\nCould have happened she had the money that's what I was thinking you know exactly because you know someplace six billion dollars to get a little bit over a billion I think he said in the ... you know [laughter] not at my he says he's actually gonna buy a ticket say you know statistically things has no chance but he's not falling out advice not maybe there is is that what they see us\nNot at my says that she could have bought tickets so you know statistically he thinks there's no jobs but he's not going to buy not neither is maybe there is these days to us a\n\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

I'm a business person\nSecond to last quick question but we're not pitching while cutting an idea very passionate about it I can see I can taste it I can feel it I Do everything from the when you look at the dress you're going to wed the props he's actually the entire\nVision is what you just have to show up in your boxes\n[laughter] you know let me let me I can get 'em\nGimme talks about repeat listening so the songs over and over again she's brushing my teeth which is drinking wine what about you how do you come to to get that vision for that so\nYeah I really relate to that I've definitely listen to some ... many times where I can listen to them anymore [laughter] oh [laughter]\nAnd I also find that sometimes you do just need to exhaust the listening practice until you just can't you don't miss it ...\nAnd and I also find that sometimes you do just need to exhaust the listening process until you just can't you always it's subliminal you know you almost like yeah you don't even hear the lyrics anymore you just\nSometimes it's good to just sit with that you know if you can't the problem is sometimes you get a truck and I like\nCan you get a treatment by the end of the week and it's like a Wednesday and friday you know so that's kind of tricky and I think for me personally I don't know if it's because I might be in like a slightly bigger market well maybe I'm just not as popular with director Comey but you know occasionally I Do get out of that come to me directly\nBut more often than not I am actually pitching against other directors [noise]\nSo that's a little tricky because sometimes an artist cannot talk to study directors or twenty directors have many ... hours\nI recently pitched on the cot is a B and C and Jay Z and I knew that there was some big guns in the ... pitching on that project and I knew I was lucky to be invited you know but I knew that I definitely wouldn't be able to get on the phone with them because in a busy schedule I'm not sure that had time to talk to Cuba [laughter]\nSo I just had to come up with an idea and like what's the best you know I didn't quite nail at that time but that's the part of being a director is that there is a little bit of a risk involved you have to say I haven't had a hundred percent success to show\nThat maybe it's being a director and pitching on American artist and you ... out of it can potentially be more competitive out that because there's a lot of direct it out there\nIt's the biggest skill you if you're fishing for me on the energy project [laughter] that's a that's a larger scale up what you need to working of course with some amazing artist but then I think I'm lucky\nThat's a that's a larger scale I didn't I had the opportunity to watching of course with some amazing artists but then I think I'm lucky by the time to come to me that kind of made up their mind but then then again it's not genes look beyond say\nYou're listening to the conversation my guests to would we need music video direct his ... and Kenny ... from Nigeria so you Bruce operating at a level where many of the artist you worked with on huge big names and know exactly what they want\nTo think cadmium specific examples where you have to navigate accommodating to sing holding on to create a vision and I knew him he said that you had a hundred percent success rate but they must have been certain points way somebody went to something a little bit differently so just in does well yeah\nYou got to understand initially in the beginning it wasn't this way 'cause I mean I have to put myself in a specially being a woman in the industry and competing with of course jumps going to matter because there is a male dominated field and then at the added cross all starting off on television so I was a pretty person\nThat now want it to to be the girl with the camera so it was an obstacle that I needed to jump over to change people's minds and the only way I could do that only weapon I had was every time you get the opportunity you have to knock it out the park\nThe first ever project that I did one official project and I did music video was a music video for an award ceremony at I was one of those\nAnd they had a a song that was going to be the theme song and then they had a lot of the big names pitching for it\nAnd I'm like you know what do you do not like you know I'm an artist but yeah I mean that's what we want you to start when you come out of the stage and things like that\nAnd I remember just one thing I had one day I had a dream about the concept attracted me as a visual as possible and I sent it to the guy that you know it was running the show and he called me like I was like absolutely loved it\nThat tries to be a visual as possible and I sent it to the guy that you know it was running the that the show and he ... it was like absolutely love this treatment can I buy it off you know like that's the I call with this one and I need to make a decision that position and I said you know what how 'bout you do this\nHow about you don't pay me\nGave me just what I Need to execute this project and you get a better deal because of course you're gonna have to pay these big name just give me what I Need to execute this project so at that point I caught that chalk eventually\nTo position myself and it wasn't heritage that I knocked it out the part I might not have gotten a lot more boosted tuition but that is the only project and I had to pitch for it\nBut then once I was able to deliver it wasn't always like a business card to universe and a lot of people call me they don't even though I'm a girl so [laughter] because they just need a music video and like I Want that person and and that's just how it's been\nOkay can we talk about how much you're charging [laughter] I'm very expensive very kind you never know how they ... you don't have to give me the exact figure to give me a sense of how much you're charging a fence it depends on the project\nThat things I charge denied that things are charging ...\nI'm ... ... they're probably like I'll give you their projects do that I Do for nothing at all but that would have made me the most money when they came to me my budget with a little bit too much for them I really loved the project I wanted to be parts of it I thought it was something that I needed to be involved in\nThat particular project might not have\nLied my pocket at that point in time when I was probably made me the most money down the line because people have seen that and gone\nI needed to work in this project right throw that somewhere\nIt's an effort is going to be given that you can get ... now I mean I can you give me a sense of how much she challenging\nAnd it's funny because actually my\nCan get at your level now I mean I can you give me a sense of how much he's challenging\nAnd it's funny because actually my family has not increased because there's a rule of thumb that older actors get temp set of budget\nIs what would be typical budget I mean can you give me an example of a budget or we took him out of hand hundred thousand US dollars and we do about ten thousand US dollars\nIt can be that it can be either hum let's say a low budget project is around ten thousand\nAnd that means that direct to get a thousand dollars but that would be like a month sweat sorry you would get more working at a supermarket [laughter]\nBecause a matter of hours you put into a project where you drop everything and literally just do that you're not making much per hour but if you're working on a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand dollar project you can end up with a little bit of cash in your pocket\nOf Arizona today Flagstaff eastward high temperatures were cast your in your average today

years ago and now she regularly suffers with those freezing episodes oh that sounds scary yeah they they are very scary however health ... stop in London\nThinks they might have come up with a

about besides for much books and there's one on each for now when you switch them on a laser beam projects on the ground ... green line a few inches in front of each ...\nWho has a guy I Try and get

was\nStrange will come after office where they just cut you off my feet\nSo the places they switch on and off as you take each step forward yes so when I put my right foot forward a small horizontal line about ten centimeters along with a pair of few inches in front of my left foot sound quite cool and\nA line about ten centimeters along with a pair of few inches in front of my left foot\nSome quite cool and good fun to laugh but I'm Wondering how they help people who have freezing of gates episode\nYeah so behind the solution is not just Lee's ... she works closely with professor ... blue him who is ... ... puff scientific advisor and in your own interest\nThe essence of Parkinson's disease is that the so called automatic pilot\nIs defective people with Parkinson's you and I can walk without cultures the paying attention to it that automatic abilities lost and people with Parkinson's\nBut you can actually literally trick the brain by bypassing that automatic pilot which is more or less to start engine of the brain by consciously\nRecruiting the motor areas of the brain so what the lasers basically do is offer an external visual trigger forcing or allowing the patients do very consciously take a step forward and stepping over the laser beam\nAnd in doing so they ... they are defective automatic pointed\nRight okay I think I get this for people that have Parkinson's the will to my way of moving at and walking which we all take for granted if damaged so having this visual trigger helps the brain received those messages in a different way yeah another\nReally good way to think about it is generally Parkinson's patients don't have any issues ... says\nThat's because the status going up woods acts as a visual cue or obstruction by policies that effective power fight the sensory illusion of the ladies as ... in the same way it tricks the Brian by constantly placing a key and from out\nThe sensory illusion of the lasers walks in the same way it tricks the Brian ... constantly placing a cue and from out who as we heard a bit earlier has had freezing ... episodes in supermarkets and railway stations this device is pretty useful\nIf I come down in the morning without the shoes on\nYou know can I can manage to says okay and then I get to the corner the kitchen and I\nFind it really difficult to stand up and to get my feet moving so I Will have to pulling my leg some holding like putting it around the corner for dragging myself along the the unit\nAnd then I get to the capital and I can't stand up straight to fill out a lot in the capital and I'm guessing from the capital to the sink and back again it's just a real asset it's really exhausting and then do you have to going to get the milk when I go in to take it with me\nIs all those things it was a she is on it still hard what but it makes it possible to do those things instead of almost impossible [noise]\n\n\nSounds like in these issues than have\nPeace of mind yet she told me broadly speaking she can now go to places like the supermarket with the knowledge that she can get out of a freezing episode if she knows it's going to happen however there are still occasions where episodes suddenly come on without warning\nSometimes I Do cross quite badly and I I can I Can't predict when that's going to be there's nothing I can do except wait for the medication to what the name and\nIn those situations even if she's got the shoes and by ... move ... put the mom and she says there are other limitations as well\nI Can't really see them very well outside quite often if I'm On an uneven stuff is like the ground so that kinda fits in Haiti place and that's the surface is flat yeah I was going to\nWell outside quite often if I'm On an uneven stuff is like the ... so that kinda fits in Haiti place and that's the surfaces flat\nYeah I was going to ask about that I imagine a calm the very easy to see delays is on a sunny day\nYeah mount did mentioned to me that when she goes in ... in a field is one of the time she freezes quite a lot and she can't really see lasers on so that is one of the drawbacks and she felt a independents not peace of mind would massively increase if they were more visible outdoors\nSo it's not a pass at solutions from out by the help so do we know how well the ... other people with Parkinson's\nSome study was done and it showed the freezing of gay episodes decreased by forty five percent for those participants of medication and when they were on medication the effect was still positive is the decrease the episodes by about thirty seven percent\nHowever that was a really small sample size or in the Nineteen participants in study\nYeah that's no and I wonder how do these shoes ... do they make it stand out they do a lot of attention to yourself\nYet definitely that was an incident in one of the early models of this why someone in the Netherlands were on a train and it caused a lot of panic people food it was a weapon from what I understand what

otherwise wanted to be quite private about\n[noise]\nSo these two ideas don't pull and lays issue both of them are about manipulating the mind to make us feel old act differently than my own thoughts\nThen uh about manipulating the mind to make us feel old act different and they must be all sorts of ways we can trick the brain fall out of the ...\nYes it's definitely a growing area what's happening is wearable tech startups like ... she's\nA kind of tracking you are a scientist labs and that means that the solutions are reaching the real world a lot quicker\nPreviously they would have been but among the lab for a long time so it's definitely becoming more prominent not kind of coming together of start ups and you're a scientist and professors and you are assigned to show up and speaking to set this very likely we're going to see more of these kinds of solutions in the future [noise]\n\nThis fascinating and Q A ma and things to all of you for listening to all tax if you want

started getting a lot of pushback and very quickly\nPulled their relationships with the n._r._a. which was something that we haven't really seen before and I think it was pretty shocking and new and surreal for people to see that\nYou could chip away at some of that are as power\nDid we see any of the major retailers pulling back from the sale of forums for example\nThere were a number of major sporting goods stores that said that they wouldn't no longer sell assault weapons so that was a very big deal we also saw among that list of a few dozen companies I mentioned that offer discounts all

effects of that like I mentioned earlier is if you look at the end are a spending in these twenty Eighteen mid term elections they're spending far less on candidates that we would have expected them to go all in for\nNot much does appear to be true recent filings in early October showed that the n._r._a. with spending less than two million dollars this year on political campaigns one tenth of its
