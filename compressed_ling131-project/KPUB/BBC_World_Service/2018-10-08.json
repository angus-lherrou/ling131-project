week's program climatologist Michael Mann explains a several ways in which climate change should exacerbated the events but as the hurricane season started his mobiles suggesting we were heading for something of a coma\nLet me issue and mia ... because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season in that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event and it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event in debt usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average to slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but I woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got an ... heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical and sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before farms made

simulations that we did which are very similar to a a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there was the most pacification overland after impact of the storm was fifty percent increased due to climate change\nI'm very interested in the description is different from the kind of description I've heard from friday also which is as a great the likelihood of this kind of event ... this is very specifically giving a number to the amount that the strengths of the event is being changed\nYes so what we're doing is slightly different than looking at what was the probability of this event to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it makes landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the enormously bloom Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in the ... tradition you could pinned down Pacific Ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nWe basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature

that storm as it makes landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the enormously bloom Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in the ... tradition you could pinned down specific ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nSo we basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that's an estimated as part of past research by climate scientists and that pattern isn't uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so they're warmer areas and cooler areas but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal\nFrom our forecast initialized ... so that when we run these modified forecast without climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction in the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nAs well as changes that that has on the atmosphere temperature as well as on a certain temperature changes that have on once during the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and a belief that particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific ... that's ... associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform a changing of the F F T we actually have a pattern change of the SST that come from

Michael Mann\nParticularly in the light the Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see it while still far out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that's somewhere in the range of twenty six to twenty seven degrees Celsius so there is a very large region in the Atlantic\nThe sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms and that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming\nThat region where temperatures are high enough to form those storms is actually\nExpanding quite a bit it's expanded quite a bit because you have so much of that marginal territory that's right on the threshold a little bit of warming can suddenly create a much larger region it's warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms are intensifying earlier

against not if I send you you have to fight against it\nGoing back to my question all my point about humanity has a color your view of what we human beings are really like and what we're really

humanity\nOpinion not I desperately want to get him and put him away for the rest of his life that's not our job and you have to fight against not if not then you you have to fight against it\nBut going back to my question on my point about humanity as a color your view of what we human beings are really like and what we're really capable of\n[noise] um I think we've always known what the human is capable off but what I find is that in these horrendous circumstances and they really are truly awful there is always wonderful humanity so you might have a widow who has lost her husband her children her entire family\nAnd when you come along to zoom that grave she's still there with you for you with a cup of tea\nHer way of expressing her thanks for what you're doing\nAnd I've never find a horrendous situation in the world that has an absence of some humanity somewhere and that's what you have to look for because that's what really reassures off of humans are genuinely capable off and you can't concentrate on the negative\nI Wonder if you've ever been just overwhelmed by the scale of something that you've had to face I'm thinking of the show me for example are probably many of us remember how awful\nIt was to hear that news in in the very end to think of two thousand and four that this this you know made a destroyed so many coastal areas from Sri Lanka Thailand Indonesia touching holiday makers local people and hundreds of thousands of people died and you were cold\nWhich I think you decided to send yourself even before you were really cold you went to Thailand to helping the victim identification of it but but it was so overwhelming\nAnd what people were doing was they were collecting bodies and they're putting them on the back of flatbed trucks and they were driving them into the cities and leaving these bodies the tent poles and\nHe had had destroyed so many coastal areas from Sri Lanka Thailand Indonesia catching holiday makers local people and hundreds of thousands of people died and you were cold\nWhich I think you decided to send yourself even before you were really cold you went to Thailand to helping the victim identification effort but but it was so overwhelming\nThat wall and for people who are doing what they were collecting bodies and they're pushing them on the back of trucks and they were driving them into the cities and leaving these bodies at the tent poles\nAnd so in theory heat she would have these policies sit in front of you were rose upon rose to become passing in the heat as you're almost wants them blue tang to the point that the skin would break and we had you know as you can imagine just flies everywhere and knock it everywhere rats everywhere\nIt was really ... if there was a hell on earth I think it was the early days in Thailand and predict ...\nLet me change tack a little bit and talk about\nAnd here we are to a festival devoted to literature and crime fiction is a huge thing and I know you've become great friends with a\nFellow ... there's a great crime writer but she writes a lot and quite gory detail about violent crime and youth\nI Believe offer some advice and I just wonder whether sometimes you fear that you run the risk of feeding a somewhat ... voyeuristic tendency in in us to want to know about how to dismembered body what happens to a body as it\nAs a sort of inroads over time we were sort of intrigued repels\nBut are you feeding a voyeurism in all of\nAn eye it's definitely there\nThere's no doubt that we all like a good murder mystery and if people are going to be scared by crime I drop it they were scared like true crime then by absolute and utter fictional crime that makes things\nYou run the risk of feeding a somewhat ... voyeuristic tendencies in us to want to know about how to dismembered body what happens to a body as it as a sort of inroads over time we were sort of intriguing where repelled\nBut are you feeding\nA voyeurism in all of 'em I it's definitely there\nThere's no doubt that we all like a good murder mystery and if people are going to be scared by crime drama there were scared by true crime then by ... author fictional crime that makes things totally unbelievable\nSo in your view is important if we're talking about how a ... they can be ... you think it's important to get into detail how difficult it will is\nBecause there's so few people will ever become a member and for the chances that what I'm doing is educating them is extremely slim\nBut those people who reads forensic novel are probably more forensic fully aware than any any part of the public has ever been before and they can quickly smell like something that doesn't find right\nSo what I have is a huge amounts of respect for the crime writers who actually go and research what is it really like so that what they're doing is they're respecting their readers to say this is reality I Know it's just made the salt this is actually ... with the\nYou've written a

time to die because of all climbers and what was hard once they're dying\nThat that wasn't hard and then being that wasn't hard it was watching what they went through in the dying process\nSo whether that was painful whether this protracted whether it was there was somewhere that they they never wanted to be um that ... death came for both of them it was an absolute an altered release for them and every body and being that\nThey were a lot smaller than they weren't in life they look very small very shrunken but they were going on there was something\nThat is a metaphorical thing as well ju ju feel I mean again it's digging deep into sort of difficult things but\nWhen you saw your shrunken dead father did you feel that his soul\nThat my father let alone but that point my father had\nBeen on relieving the soul that so I guess what you get to\nKnow because if something happens then something changed I was there I held his house\nAnd everybody and being that they were a lot smaller than they weren't in life they look very small very shrunken but they were going on there was something\nWas amiss before opening Israel ... again it's digging deep into sort of difficult things but\nWhen you saw your show can dead father did you feel that his soul\nAt my father let alone but that point my father had\nBeen older than even the so that so I guess you know\nBecause if something happens then something changed I was there I held his hands when he took his last breath\nIn life and I felt there was nothing more than I could have done from as adults and that it was the most privileged place that I could ever have been and it was such a gentle process for him that he decided he had enough he stopped drinking he stopped eating he turns his face to the wall and he decided he was going to die\nAnd when he took that that last brass on on the rocks all that you hear when they talk about the detrimental is pretty much the fluid that goes into the lungs that comes out was the last breath\nThan I knew he'd gone and I had no trouble leaving my father's body but I Would never have left my father is still alive and in the last breath\nSomething changed but my father ceased to be on the boat he that was left was not my father it was just a vessel that he ... for his entire life my father had gone he had died is there something beyond\nI don't know until they get their thoughts to teach and fear your own and\nNot just all I think it is the last great adventure you're going to do it once in a lifetime\nIf you're going in a long journey you'll always prepare for that journey why why do we know prepare\nFor telling and I think I Want to experience every single moment to offer I Want to know what's it like to like if I Can't remember\nIt was just a vessel that he occupied for

there tell us more about the costs decision and Lucy\nWell it was a strange kind of a topic today um and what is that it was found to have taken and as much as they got from her mother straight off the hub us in Nineteen sixty nine he was found to have forced to have busted his good end was found to have given her to another couple as a gift\nBut the court also decided that too much time but pause to actually convict him that the statute of limitations in this case only extended to ten years off to the child in his turned Eighteen of course this was some forty nine years ago now so does that a walked free\nWe spoke to and it's often the verdict she had mixed feelings about it she told us that she would appeal the verdict but that she was happy the truth had been officially established\nBe ... when the one that I feel good because the Spanish court has said yes maybe have been done in Spain and also that mother wasn't lying she always told the truth I don't mind that he's\nOff to the child in his turned Eighteen and of course this was some forty nine years ago now so to that or walked free we spoke to in his off to the verdict she had mixed feelings about it she told us that she would appeal the verdict but that she was happy the truth had been officially established\nHim I think there'll be it in with him to be able to get when they went out and I feel good because the Spanish cool test said yes maybe have been stone in Spain and also that mother wasn't lying she always told the truth\nI don't mind that he's not going to jail it's not the most important thing because he can't leave his house people will recognize him and everyone knows who the gate\nAnd he's condemned anyway now the second phase stop getting to the Supreme Court and let's see what they decide on the statute of limitation\nReaction there in his mouth or go Lucy one woman one snatched baby them one doctor in this case but this has always thought too much much wider war is a reaction bringing women around the country have their babies taken away\nYes exactly this is a case between one doctor and one woman who he helps\nDeliver forty nine years ago but it's been watched across the country and the reason is that it's not really just about confronting innocence history this is about opening up a really difficult chapter of Spain's paused at least that's how the campaign to see a dark part of Spain's history\nAccording to the campaign is head perhaps tens of thousands of mothers had that baby stolen in the post war years\nLike in his his mother by medical stuff all members of the Catholic Church mostly because they were judged on fit to raise that children either they were seen as political opponents opposed to general Franco's dictatorship\nOr in later years just because they were on marriage or simply judge to pool they throw in\nOpening up a really difficult chapter of Spain's paused at least that's how the campaign to see a dark part of

marriage or seen the judge to pool\nLater on in the Nineteen seventies and eighties complain and say I think it became a master of trafficking the children for money\nBut this was the first trial of anyone actually involved in those alleged practices and there's a small group of mothers outside cool today waiting for the verdict some of them said they were angry that do it because I had walked free free without any punishment one described as a slap in the face\nBut there were others that were happy the state headed knowledge this for the very first time\nWe spoke to one mother power to an end as whose baby was taken away by a nun in Nineteen Seventy four before pilot could even give her firstborn child and name she told me or even learn it's gender\nImmediately off the bus she said she was injected with a drug that left to unconscious the following day ... the baby had died when pound demanded to know what happened the doctor said it was an act of ... when she also the the puppy she was told it had already been buried\nForty four years later talking to us she still cries at the source of the child she never got a chance to hold\nThe line you know but when I got it done if you're going to go through\nIreland hit on the day if he'll have best I I right to not to say you and nine months and my ... the five second managed to get him to them by there have you ever seen\n... the baby had died when pound demanded to know what happened the doctor said it was an act of gold when she also see the both the she was told it had already been buried forty four years later talking to

not to say you were nine months in my belly and I left Jean the five second really managed to get him sit on there have you ever seen which first child I was from the time he says it intimate tendons heal simple\nLots Paulos story or Lucy or just one story one case will it be more\nI think that's the first thing people are waiting for now is to see what things Supreme Court makes if this appeal and what they say about the legal time limit for trials of this kind that's always going to affect\nUm how many trials abroad in the future that have been thousands of complaints we understand but a lot of them are very difficult to follow up because it's so difficult decades later to find the evidence that prosecutors need to really bring a solid case I mean it up to the vet himself is believed to has destroyed evidence relating to the case he was tried on\nAnd of course many of those involved and now very elderly um innocence adopted mother in fact confessed the situation to her\nBefore she died but because because she was handed in this as a baby a mother of course had no idea who the biological parent was\n... is the man who can tell how but despite this landmark trial in is it still close to the finding out who had the mother is or even if she said alive\nThanks very much the BBC's Lucy Williams some ... in Madrid and if you go to the BBC website BBC don't come forward slash news or you look on the stone in baby steps\nDid not in fact confessed situation to her before she died but because she was handed and it's it's a pain the mother of course had no idea who the biological parent was\n... is the man he can tell but despite this landmark trial in is it still takes place at finding out who had the mother is or even if he's still alive\nLucy thanks very much the BBC's Lucy Williams and that in Madrid and if you go to the BBC website BBC don't come forward slash news\nAnd you look on the the stolen babies story you can see the video of a\nCatch ... confronting duck to Eduardo valid there from her assignment program from a few years ago\nThey stay with us here on the program we'll be looking at the new climate change reports in the second half and we'll also be hearing a conversation that the are missing Saudi journalist ... had with my colleague Julian marshals just a few days before\nSo will assign PCC report have any impact in the United States I've been speaking to Gina McCarthy former administrator of the U.S environmental protection agency who was the lead on President Obama's climate change policies\nThe United states at least people understand that climate change is happening I Know the president is out of touch with that but the American public understands that\nThe real problem that we have is that people are seeing it as far away problem or a problem that impacts the coastlines are maybe those forested areas that are going on fire in California or in the west\nWill is only PCC report have any impact in the United States I've been speaking to Gina McCarthy for administrator of the U.S environmental protection agency who was the lead on President Obama's climate change policies\nIn the United states at least people understand that climate change is happening I Know the president is out of touch with that but the American public understands it\nThe real problem that we have is that people are seeing it as a faraway problem or a problem that impacts the coastlines or maybe those forested areas that are going on fire in California in the west\nBut frankly you know climate change changes everything it really is the biggest threat that we have to public health today to us safety you know to uh wellbeing to our economy's to jobs this is about national security as well and people need to understand it and personalize it\nAnd if you look at American it's not monolithic picture as good as you say the the White House the current administration so he takes a different views the administration usa but if you look in the Twenty one state say they're still signed up to the Paris or agreements many cities many local ministry rations bought\nWithout central government providing a lead how much difference can make\nWell it makes a long term difference but I'll tell you I a lot of people in our country a feeling like the federal government is letting us down than not following the science and not following the law they're trying to roll everything back but frankly they're not that good at it\nAnd so I feel confident that the rules will stay in place but it's that long term signal that you want to send\nYou know this isn't a short term problem this is this is a a challenge where we have the solutions today which is why on mayors and governors and why the business sector is really motivated to

this is a\nA challenge where we have the solutions today which is why on mayors and governors and why the business sector is really motivated to act because in the absence of federal leadership we can still do a lot of things at those other levels and in the business sector\nBut it's a long term investment that we're not seeing\nOne of the things you talked about his marriage jobs and you know and it's been the arguments of the current president and his administration that actually jobs were on the line because of some of the decisions that were taken to get rid of coal and gas how do you argue against that\nWell you probably look at facts which this administration sometimes doesn't look that closely that you know the facts are that clean energy is winning in the marketplace that's where the job growth is it is not in the old fossil fuel sectors\nWe see clean energy taking off in the United states and it continues to move at a pace that's faster than we ever intended that doesn't mean we're nearing any finish line\nBut this administration doesn't understand about the jobs of the future versus trying to make what they call America great again by looking backwards\nClearly one of the the way that individuals can change their carbon footprint is the type of comedy Dr Americans love cause and it's and it's proved very difficult though hasn't it to get America change that habit\nHad

comedy Dr Americans love cause and it's and it's proved very difficult though hasn't it to get America change that happened\nWe had to actually regulate not to get our car companies to sell fuel efficient vehicles that Americans actually wanted to buy\nWhich is one of the reasons they were going bankrupt when President Obama came in he rescued then we we actually work with them we settle long term strategy and they've been doing well ever since mostly record breaking years they're they're adding jobs\nThey're selling cars that people want to buy in this saving consumes money as a result if you want to revert to really expensive fuel efficient vehicles that doesn't save consumers anything at the pump\nAnd it also doesn't save lives by cleaning up our air pollution today in addressing the challenge of climate change for\nAll of us to talk about saving lives look at some of the the extreme weather America seems to be having to to do with more and more I mean is that having an impact do you think on the white people look at the climate\nBelieve that it is which is why people know what's happening but we haven't yet turned from talking about how bad climate is to make the change to talking about what what is a a a future that we all want to move towards\nWe have to think about this a little bit smarter and instead of focusing so much on the bad let's talk about the opportunities let's talk about how many lives saved if we move towards cleaner cars let's talk about how when you don't burn coal you don't spill mercury into our atmosphere that's an or a toxin for kids\nPeople look at the climate\nI Believe that it is which is why people know what's happening but we haven't yet turned from talking about how bad climate is to make the change to talking about what what is a a

lives saved if we move towards cleaner cars let's talk about how when you don't burn coal you don't spill mercury into our atmosphere that's an or a toxin ... kids\nLet's talk about the contagious diseases that are moving in a changing climate to places where we have never had them before or the drought we're facing let's talk about the opportunities we have to lift every buddy up and move to a future that's better for everyone\nI feel like we're fighting about nothing instead of grabbing the future in running towards\n... and this report would it make any difference to the conversation in the United states including just be seen as another more of the same that washes over people's heads\nI don't think people have grabbed climate change because I think they think it's a problem for the planet instead of the people that live on the planet I'm hoping that this will reignite a conversation but that conversation will turn from oh woe is me and how afraid am I\nTo what the opportunities of future can be\nI was Gina McCarthy former administrator of the U.S environmental protection agency\nThat I just now in the disappearance of the prominent Saudi journalist ... the U.S based
