I think it's used in ways\nThat are very questionable and that have left to do with the identity of a sudden than with questions of justice\nWe can talk about that is a little bit more Adrian past what does it mean to you that politics is really about individualized I didn't see individuals and small groups very often focal minorities that's how rocky arguing for quality of inclusion and democracy but I think there's a danger that\nDifference is now elevated of a commonality that we're stressing Everytime makes us different from other individuals and groups and we don't talk enough about the things that binds us together citizenship\nHumanity the fact that we inhabit at the same places that maybe we are part of the same work places and also the same communities in and countries so there's a problem I think in that it's a response individual lives and but I think it's an individualized response rather than a more communal or collective\nIslam yeah ... yeah to me into politics as crops two very different phenomena that are going on at the same time it's a lot of confusion stems from mixing goes up so I'm the one hand what we're seeing at the moment is\nA lot of a minority groups claiming equality claiming riots in the face of real historical injustice an ongoing discrimination and on the other hand I think we are seeing\nBeing coded as oppression and that's a real difference between actually being oppressed and actually feeling that\nYour loss of ... which is outrageous so is that rather an important point Adrian ... does it simply that the majority of finding themselves challenged by any number of minorities\nOr the the problem is that you have on the one hand very technocratic leads believing obstruct things are done resonate with a very sizeable number of people in the one hand and then you have lots of minority majority responses to that and I think none of it is very healthy\nIt's not healthy to engage in victim and whether you are black or white or whether you're a venue ... gender and sexuality whatsoever\nThe real victims those real oppression exploitation\nBut the way to go over that is to name it as an injustice die affects everyone because it violates human dignity so it's always appealing to what we have in common ... just to say I'm a victim because I happened to be ... ... what's that\nThat doesn't ... if you like it\nThe ... of what we have in common ... just to say I'm a victim because I happen to be ... that\nThat doesn't ask to see if you like a commonality of belief that may not exist if you think about algae Beatty writes could you have complained that you'll suffering your impression was an offense against humanity many people would have simply don't recognize it but that's exactly in fact\nWhat the tea movement did they said look\nThis is love we love like everybody else so don't discriminate against us don't distinguish between us and that was actually realize that what we ultimately want in ... exactly the same as what heterosexuals want and that's part of the reason why the movement has been so successful we agree I think all of us in this conversation\nBut the Israel discrimination real injustice and that we want to fight against it\nBut I Do think that more and more it is also a distinction about how we visit with them will just aside what looked like\nLast summer I watched a romantic comedy called the big sick\nAnd very nice movie which is autobiographical about Pakistani origin American stand up comedian who falls enough with a wide them how can we go then to sort of dramatic life story they have no spot is\nUm I was amazed by the way in which movie which tells in the mainstream romantic comedy a story of an interracial marriage started to be attacked from the left\nSaying well isn't that problematic that this round protecting us has to find a wide wife couldn't you have found a brown why couldn't you found a wife who's also from Pakistan and I was struck by the idea of a sudden the in that debate the right was saying\nWho has if you find somebody who he was enough of a different race we should celebrate that and was parts of the left but some of food that was probably ... size leaving me is the crux of a disagreement about what society one ...

Hollywood wrong call\nModel I worked for you and 'cause he wants to come into the air I think on the issue of algae beauty rights and the way that's changed but feel free to comment on what pre as well I think\nThe what has been so alienating about the texture of the conversation and identity politics is that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian and all about imposing an orthodoxy from what you may not venture off even buy a millimeter and\nThat's a turn off it also creates a social atmosphere of fearful illness\nA an an ordinary social level not necessarily just on ... special little social media boards I think that we are generally\nOn a an an artery social level not necessarily just on ... special little social media boards I think that we are generally much more anxious about socializing with\nPeople who are different from us be that a sexual preference or race or ethnicity and uh you know if you're at a party\nAnd there's somebody across the room you're white person there is someone who looks interesting they're black or they're Pakistani\nBut you've had a couple of drinks maybe you're going to think twice about approaching them and not ugly or as they get to ... fly because you're afraid of saying something wrong because you might use the wrong word me might express something that's a little you know not all perfect\nThere's this sense that there are all these new rules out there and they keep changing and they keep multiplying\nAnd they make people socially fearful agents\nIt's intolerance that line will just mentioned it's also a political correctness on all pots and it's the fact that we simply keep on saying\nWe'll so different that there's nothing that binds us together to somehow to differences defined as more than the ... of course they're real differences out than it should be celebrated\nBut they also the commonalities that's how we all citizens we are human beings and we don't really bring that into the Democratic political contest enough even those notions of citizenship and she reminds you of course contested there's no sense of of a consensus on that shouldn't be one\nBut the moment we simply thinking that gender or race religion and other differences somehow from everything else and that's I think that politics has become\nSo do you live ... I I really would like Exxon pillows I mean I I I'm hearing all these kind of a generic I hadn't bringing about authoritarianism and\nLack of commonality and differences but I'm not hearing an example the only example that would give unless black lives matter which was immediately contradicted by they lie that was played on the radio just now\nSo so let me give you a couple of examples of first what I Want to make the um\nGet annoyed with black lives matter which was immediately contradicted by they lie that was played on the radio just now\nSo so let me give you a couple of examples but first what I Want to make clear but I think a lot last night in many ways is an important movement and one that has actually contributed significantly to our understanding the death of a problem of police violence in the United states\nAnd I think there's one argument that back I met a mix but it's absolutely right which is that there's a disproportionate police violence against African Americans and that this is a huge scandal\nNot when you look at the numbers is also true\nBut the majority of the people who are killed by police in the United states on fact not African American and that's not surprising given the relatively small ... off the oval American population but as black so I think actually this conversation would be\nA more fruitful and we'll put it to the education is if we sat there is a specific problem with police violence against African Americans and this is particularly deepen justice\nBut you know what if you are a teenager or a pound of a of a white teenager who likes to go to parties you should also be worried because actually there's two white people who got shot by the police as well\nI Want one last quick question to you before we wrap up this tough people have never lived in multicultural multi religious monolingual states this is new new situation that we find ourselves in why is it so difficult to negotiate now Adrian\nOf the reasons why I think it's difficult and I guess is because a lot of institutions and practices that used to build bridges between clause between ... and other\nGroups in society simply no longer function fiscal policies trade unions churches synagogues temples mosques some of them may still be growing but on the whole these institutions that bridge building institutions and Ken situations and the communities are not working and I think that's why people fail\nThis was a sense of powerlessness as a sense of of the ... and then they're holding\nThe ... and the communities are not working and I think that's why people feel this was a sense of powerlessness is a sense of of the ... and then they're holding on to something which can be a centralized and I think the problem with the center than she is by definition exclusive\nBriefly ... I think mass migration has something to do with it we are talking about minorities but they're very large minorities which means that collectively they have a larger voice and then of course technology is an amplifier Russia\nWell that's not to disagree with premise I Do think about the tree or democracies in the world was founded on a mono ethnic mono culture self conception of themselves and thank God we've started to challenge that and we now live in societies which most people embrace the idea of it the more to ethnic societies that if something has talked quite new Priya\nI think we have a situation where a very small number of people in the world have a very large proportion of the world's wealth\nAnd one of the ways in which that are addressing inequality and the upset around any quality is putting a false and indeed authoritarian narrative out that\nWay by its minorities and black people and women and ... people and gay people who are ruining lives with their so called identity politics and this means we're not looking at the people who are actually uh you know responsible for inequality and suffering\nOkay pledged to think about that thank you for now to our panel\nGrandfather Gopal yes among ... and Adrian ... we have to take a short break but just to remind you do let us know what you think of the program or any ideas the topics you'd like us to look into you can email us that the real story at BBC don't care what UK or tweet me ... and if you enjoy the program we have a podcast you can subscribe to\nJust such a BBC the real story in your poll cost up\nOf the b._b._c.

suffered in often suffered more than the white working class but saying the other people who suffered more doesn't mean that those who have suffered who happened to be wide\nAlso you know will rebel against the status quo and and who are we to tell them that somehow that I didn't see much less than half of all there's no that's not I'm not saying I'm not saying you did what I'm saying\nThe idea that somehow we can just say\nWe're able to look at the most depressed people in the early ... an Indian everyone else should just you know hold back on bad feelings is is is not the Persian Gulf in a rational utility maximizing preaches\nWe are people who are involved each we're people embedded in relationships institutions are not since feelings do methane St or a longing and they were going to place to people to communities and countries masses we kind of feeling out of politics or will it got to\nThe obvious question that footage and that has been loaning who onto wet and ease positive reason for identity politics that actually it is people\nThe obvious question that follows from that has been loaning so who onto wet and ease parts of the reason for identity politics that actually it is people expressing a sense of on the longing that actually that that identity that was that the full whether it was the nation whether it was the town whether it was the religion didn't express who they were\nWell you had a noted about how there that these are the rise of the extremes and um I saw the same thing in Northern Ireland or after the good friday agreement ... on the one hand and the UP on the other\nTook over completely and they were at the far ends of the political spectrum and the middle just dropped out they became tiny little no account parties\nAnd I think that's because Northern Ireland was a place in and has been for some time\nThat thinks in terms of group memberships very strictly you're either Protestant or you're Catholic and it's not an especially religious distinction it's a tribal one in fact that's a boring observation\nAnd northern Irish politics but this that's what you get because when people are mostly adhering to their tribe then they want representatives who are going to put their case most forcefully\nAnd advocate for their interests not the larger interest but their interest and that's why you go for extreme\nIs there a ... here though is the people who are advocating for this old political policies because as you say they shrill voice is a very clear that on Nick durable\nIn some ways it was six if you'll never end or a movie in India and you a pre ... the idea that an overarching Hindu history to India a Hindu view of India it winds bodes\nWell one of the problems is that especially if you've got a large country the idea of simply identifying with that country is a bit unrealistic\nProblems is that especially if you've got a large country the idea of simply identifying with that country is a bit unrealistic\nUm in the same way that asking people to identify with all of humanity is laudable and lovely but it's just not the way people work and we we do naturally I think as\nAs a species break up into what are often very competitive clumps sorry I'm confused I thought tribalism was the problem now we're being told that we have no choice ... tribal it is a problem\nBut I Would just being told that everybody wants to be tribal they can't identify with larger groups it's a natural tendency of people to especially when the\nLarger amalgam is just a bit too big to get your head around to break into smaller groups and we have to deal with that I'm not going to go away but it but it's all the politics happens because those tribes are bad but although tribes are okay\nI mean I'm very bad at all I don't know I mean I think the\nQuestion is that I think clearly humans do have a natural instinct to care more about people who as close to them as possible so that starts off with a family at some point it becomes village it might become a particular religious ethnic group and the question is how do we deal with this in highly diverse society in a productive manner\nBut one on such which I've ... been quite attractive to growing up as a Jew in Germany is to give up on nationalism altogether to try and overcome any kind of need for collective belonging and to become a form of cosmopolitan\nWhen I look at the politics of the last twenty twenty five years and I don't think that's realistic because actually especially in the age of globalization nationalism retains an incredibly powerful force and so now it seems to me it's the best response is to try and domestic hated behalf wild\nIncredibly powerful force and so now it seems to me for the best response is to try and domestic heated hop wild feast of nationalism to try and claim it for ourselves to make that inclusive to say that either hire\nA collective uh it is a level of the kingdom of looking at states uh but obviously we fight for inclusion of all different groups under the common identity but how do you make that journey from being a cause and pulled us in a member of the metropolitan elite to being if you like a flag waving patriots ...\nOf patriotism if I might just come in here is something where if you love your country with all its faults and all its you know adopt a size of its history but if you love your

line up and we saw that across Canada people lining up outside of these new legal stores are waiting for it to open to be among the first customers of legal cannabis in the country\nSome of them said you know they'd been waiting for this for forty years for fifty years\nAnd you know others said they never thought they'd be something like this and the lifetime so when the door open to attend in the morning first customers walking you know big cheer corrupted and throughout the day as people were coming out they were showing off what they thought they were really just excited to be part of of that day that legalization in Canada\nCanada goose is only the second country over to Europe wide to to legalize cannabis legalized why this decision well the reasoning by the Trudeau government is that prohibition has been a failure in their view that Canadians we're still heavy users of the drug especially Canadian youth miners teenagers and so on\nSo they said look we're going to try and bring in this you strict control regulation framework instead and in doing so they hope to reduce what they see as a failed system with a more effective is the one that keeps drugs out of the hands of miners\nProfits out of the hands of criminals and and would reduce it some of the health and social harms that they've seen with the drug use and you talk about strict controls that are regulations will still be in place then\nWell just briefly what it looks like what is legal federally 'cause it's a bit of a patchwork across the country depending on the province the federally an adult so that's about Eighteen or Nineteen years old depending on where you are\nWill be able to purchase from a license producer and possess thirty grams of the drug and dried form or its equivalent in Cedar oil

you can use it offends the the same way you would if you were smoking cigarettes huge youth tobacco so that's roughly what it looks like now\nIt is regulated so a you have to buy it from a license producer it's still illegal to buy it on the black market\nTo possess over thirty grams there are actually some new and fractions around selling minors which carry a charge up to fourteen years in prison now of course the Canadian Medical Association journal called it a national uncontrolled experiment not everybody is thrilled with this development all day\nNot everybody is thrilled a lot of especially health organizations health groups\nPutting out press releases urging a lot of caution so there was that organization that you noted an organization representing psychiatrists warning about use of the drug\nFor people under twenty five so their concerns around developing brains issues around mental health\nA society representing gynecologist an obstetrician saying there was a growing body of evidence that there was risk of using the drug among pregnant women concerned about the development of the fetus so again both organizations were saying be cautious make smart decisions\nNow we're hearing a lot about a green rush about the possible boon to the economy that this development could have what are people thinking about that in the\nUp to legalization here in Canada I mean one of the headlines that you saw almost every day it was just talking with the stock prices of some of these big license producers just rising and rising and rising a lot of speculation a lot of people

doing this and it's a it's amongst the first to do it all the countries will be watching very closely they absolutely ... and across the world there's just been a bit of a shift around the attitude towards marijuana we're seeing obviously\nCanada is taking a very big step of the kind of a bold step I Would say and it is an experiment into this full legalization model but a lot of in the U.S of course a lot of states were ahead of us in terms of legalizing the drag on the state level it remains illegal federally in the United states\nAnd we're seeing other countries bringing on line medical marijuana frameworks for seeing other countries looking at decriminalization so having this experiment in Canada seeing whether or not the Trudeau government\nIs able to realize the goals they put forward and if that is a successful thing I think there may be you know obviously other countries looking at that and seeing how that plays out\nThat was Jessica Murphy in Canada and that's it from

out of the grounds\nTo be able to make locks we can then imagine how much time do we have used to be able to make that\nThe relationship is not only about the west it's about different parts of the world and how we're working how we're shifting things from one place to another\nHow we're making wholes in other places and creating structures in other places and that also affects the erosion of

have a chance like we are and it's like I said\nYeah you don't get a good conversation with the right but you know\nLet's move on the smartphone has revolutionized all kinds of industries but one businesses trying to show that you can transform farming in developing countries with much simpler phones we from is a social network for farmers in Kenya and Uganda with plans to expand elsewhere in Africa and Asia\nIt depends entirely on text messages which the farmers used to see you can share advice and he's just signed up its millions member I spoke to ... founder and chief executive Kenny you and and I asked him what kind of people used it\nAgainst their primary level we're targeting people here don't have those other ways of communicating with each other or so roughly speaking the world about a billion a small scale farmers are mostly in sub Saharan Africans East Asia who have no connection to the Internet and therefore a massive information gap of finding\nA information knowledge and how to improve their farmer or bottle a disease so we farm or we need all those farmers to be able to ask a question on anything to do with agriculture in just about any local language for free or get spoke content back or even off line so using a an SMS message\nSo that technology is very simple technology it's SMS does does that ... well\nSo it's it's simple in the front and a son that's a message obviously a hundred and sixty character it's it's a very simple information format but I think that's inversely related to the complexity of the data science and technology that has to be behind the scenes in order to get get confidence people in such a simple\nFormat but I think that's inversely related to the complexity of the data science and technology that has to be behind the scenes in order to get good content people in such a simple format\nOr so when the former U.S as a question for example on on SMS\nWe'd unease machine learning and to understand everything that farmers trying to tell us you know what is their intent of the question where are they order the farming and essentially use that analysis to match them to ... you know three or four people in our entire network that we think can answer that one individual question and get this bill content back to the original farmer\nNow you you go to a million members I think he just signed up and then in the millions member ...\nWhat evidence do you have that he's making a difference to people [noise]\nYeah so it would pass a million which is as I was a great milestone for us having to one point two million I'm I mean I think that the force than biggest uh indicator of of how much people value it is that they use it\nOr even people who have been with us for two or three years since we launched\nUm so about twenty five percent of all those users actively contribute content every month or which you know it in context as is probably in your seven or eight percent on Twitter\nUm you know we know protest more than a million questions and answers every single month which gives you an indication of the level of content that we find is necessarily a fun systems here there's not a social system itself I value for their businesses and people don't come back and keep using things for business unless they're getting some sort of value out of it so I think that's probably the primary indicated he would say\nUh we also obviously speak a lot to our farmers on the ground or we need to understand how they're using it and what sort of benefits they're seeing from it and we've got some you know many great stories of farmers have um you know literally had information it's help them save their their livelihoods and farms through reform\nWas an example of how it's been used a ... I mean the example I\nGave is a there's a chicken farmer that was using we farm in in Kenya called ... he kept on the in the region of of fifty chickens I'm as and this was his entire livelihoods you know paid for his kids to go to school up at dinner and he finally table or on a disease was ...\nOf of fifty chickens hum as and this was his entire livelihoods you know paid for his kids to go to school up at dinner and you finally table or on a disease was ripping ... killed so you know roughly half of them in the space of a couple of days or any ask questions about this and we farm and go get information back\nA witch boxing's used to I just thought the disease spreading a and he managed to save the rest of east chickens um which is I mean that's that is the minds entire livelihoods and that's that's the kind of vital you know often seems to us really basic information but it incredibly fundamental to these farmers that that we found is able to to to provide\nA kind of you in from we from a Mona El sol from ... in a special gifts to\nA that was one of those red nail public a positive stories about social media or five years or so ago everyone was going to say the world it was a positive uses we're all that changed only yes\nTo sound that I live in was the year we celebrate and social media we thought it's going to the world and ... people and other retiree genes to move to towards democracy to mobilize masses\nIt was the voice of opposition but this was in ... near where government and regimes weren't involved in these platforms it was a platform only for activists real people are very very few\nPeople doing practical things like that yeah\n... exactly will use the social campaigns to reach people aren't as about stuff but\nLater on we started moving to regimes and the bad guys as we can call going there and propagating to to their own benefit\nSo it's now a battle between two items the that the people people who want to have a voice and people who want to manipulate them so this is why we now we're talking about the negative effects however we cannot forget that social media still can connect people together so have many many many positive effects but of course the propaganda against the highlight all the time\nUh I mean commercially still very important um I\nSo have many many many positive effects but of course the perfect and that gets to highlight all the time\nUh I mean ... very important um I and eighties eighties connecting people in positive ways as well or is it do you have a kind of overall view of whether we are getting more good than bad from it\nBut we're still getting good but we are getting better now in the last seven maybe seven years ago I Would have failed because we're getting all the good but now we're getting good and bad on the bad maybe can't take over if we couldn't control it's regulated and make sure it's it's under control maybe we'd done that one\nVery brief word from use every climbing are you still positive about social media\nI think it gets a big kicking and right and you say that I think that's another good that comes out but it's not I for one another\nThat's we've got time for anything on a positive thanks to my special guest Mona El ... from the opposite ends of the Institute thanks does every climbing read over the stories in mind that BBC don't comb flushed technology\nAnd they forget to join us again in the tech tent at the same time next week [noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

resistance to move Cardiff University is an expert in detecting the development and spread of new resistance mechanisms in bacteria\nOnce they get resistance mechanisms they become very difficult to treat and we're left with a few clinical treatment options wonderfully cheese ... quite frankly there are very few options clinically we have left\nAnd so it's extremely precious resource quite frankly technically speaking so to be using it on farms is just quite frankly bones because\nOf course we'll start seeing animals need not be a human problem if it stays on the phone but of course

we poppy seed clinically in India although trying to get the facts on the evidence out of India to rectify that is challenging\nBut once you have a broken system on a broken infrastructure it is extremely difficult to contain anti microbial resistance if you have a large proportion of the country that don't have toilets at least seven hundred million Indians don't have toilets\nThey're also very poor sanitation and buying the dashing Pakistan as well\nAnd the majority of the population each with that thing goes so you don't have to be a genius to work out that you have this continual recycling within the community between peoples normal Flora and contaminated food and how that might she might spread throughout communities\nAnd so trying to fix the infrastructure in those countries

parties\nAnd I think that's because Northern Ireland was a place in and has been for some time\nThat thinks in terms of group memberships very strictly you're either Protestant or you're Catholic and it's not an especially religious distinction it's a tribal one in fact that's a boring observation\nAnd northern Irish politics but this that's what you get because when people are mostly adhering to their tribe then they want representatives who are going to put their case most forcefully\nAnd advocate for their interest not the larger interest but their interest and that's why you go for extreme\nIs there a ... here though is the people who are advocating for this old political policies because as you say they shrill voice is a very clear that on the door a bull\nIn some ways it was six if you'll never end the remote the in India and you a pre ... the idea that an overarching Hindu history to India Hindu view of India it winds bodes\nWell one of the problems is that especially if you've got a large country the idea of simply identifying\nIt winds bodes well one of the problems is that especially if you've got a large country the idea of simply identifying with that country is a bit unrealistic\nUm in the same way that asking people to identify with all of humanity is laudable and lovely but it's just not the way people work and where we do naturally I think as as a species break up into what are often very competitive clumps\nSorry I'm confused I thought tribalism was the problem now we're being told that we have no choice ... tribal it is a problem but we've just been told that everybody wants to be tribal they can't identify with larger groups\nIt's a natural tendency of people to especially when the larger amalgam is just a bit too big to get your head around to break into smaller groups and we have to deal with that I'm not going to go away but it but it's\nPolitics happens because those tribes are bad\nBut although tribes are okay\nI mean I'm very bad I don't take it out yeah I mean I think the\nQuestion is that I think clearly humans do have a natural instinct to care more about people who as close to them as possible so that starts off with a family at some point it becomes village it might become a particular religious ethnic group and the question is how do we deal with this in ... the society in a productive manage\nA one on such which I've ... been quite attractive to growing up as a Jew in Germany is to give up on nationalism altogether to try and overcome any kind of need for collective belonging to become a form of cosmopolitan\nWhen you look at the politics of the last twenty twenty five years I don't think that's realistic because actually especially in the age of globalization nationalism retains an incredibly\nPowerful force and so now it seems to me the best response is to try\nGlobalization nationalism retains an incredibly powerful force and so now it seems to me the best response is to try and domestic hated behalf wild feast of national news and to try and claim it for ourselves to make that inclusive to say that he's a high or\nA collective uh it is a level of the kingdom of looking at it states uh but obviously we fight for inclusion of all different groups under the common identity and how do you make that journey from being a cause and pulled us in a member of the metropolitan elite to being if you like a flag waving patriots I'm\n... I think patriotism if I might just come in here is something where if you love your country with all its faults and all its you know doc a side of history but if you love your country and you love the people of your country wherever they from you can also respect patriots who left that country it's a question of mutual respect\nTo play on the other hand over all the things that he's saying that you love about it how do you enjoy it isn't the arrogance of toy what's wrong and loving your country and its people accused other people of identity politics but I'm saying your national\nTo dream of your poster nationalism I imagine you are and you know your as your your national hold your thing making my country\nBut but I Know my ex enough majority in a suburb of of Hindu majority of them\nSo I look at nationalism that's something that had served its purpose in the anti colonial struggle with today has become a very deeply dangerous beast\nWhat is the writer response would be the ... end up for it is the author nationalism over Congress party but sad but we're all Indians respect it\nFor me that is is not true I mean it's not as though the older a form of nationalism the Congress party didn't have an ... elements to it the one\nWe do our days of areas of angry as well as looked at what age it if if I can bring you back then in a sense there\nHave ... elements to it the one hand we do our days of areas of angry as well is that what age it if if I can bring you back then in a sense that there is a we we do seem to be making a distinction between\nFigure identity groups saying that a national identity is a good thing but an identity that takes and single mothers with one leg is not necessarily such a good\nThing well 'cause I think the problem is how do we build bridges between all those groups and sometimes you need something more overarching that can build a bridge you know we can be worked as we can be people of of a place like a village or a city we can be lumped in us we can be people from Manchester\nBut also sometimes that national element is still within the glass 'cause it's bound bound up with culture with language was if you go one step further that kind of cosmopolitan and they all spoke about\nThat can doesn't have to uh can be a bit abstract I think at the ... isn't that option I think a lot of people feel European British or German or French but I also feel they have a little ... as a possible\nSo that's a very simple guiding questions yeah which is how do we manage to sustain a common life in a country like the United kingdom with its great diversity of people here and the answer is that if everybody identifies primarily with the national try and\nSay I'm Jewish I'm a Hindu Muslim I'm black and brown then we're not going to have enough in common in this country to live to gather productively and peacefully whereas if we've had our sense of collective pride at the level which coincides with the actual ...\nInnocence doesn't everybody carry multiply it of course on the edge of the English in between the identity is what she choose for yourself on the ones that have foisted the of course they do\nIn the people like ... like a Martin Luther king emphasize that I Am black and at the same time I'm an American and the way but I fight for the cause of people who share my identity is to emphasize our common interest is ...\nI'm an American and the way but I fired for the cause of\nPeople who share my identity is to emphasize our common interest as Americans and other than just an emphasize the ways in which discrimination against this group goes against the ideal of a ... a member of the counter vision which says let's celebrate some national identity groups to such an extent\nAnd let's demonize any form of collective flowing above it level to such an extent but we no longer have what we need in order to sustain a common\n... that's a bit of a false distinction because one can argue that the version of British national at something that let's to breakfast at which is a big nationalism was on the paint by a sub nationalism that anything less nationalism the way the Brexit vote broke down\nHeld and moist air from our south the warmest temperatures of the week despite cloud cover it a little bit of afternoon rain sixty one forecast in Flagstaff today wins the Seventy Sedona Seventy six and pace in Seventy one on Sunday expect another round up scattered rain showers and thunderstorms a little more active than we are on Saturday\nYou're listening to Arizona Public Radio's Kagan a huge news talk and the b._b._c.

explanation of how Mr Grisham you died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damaged limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a ... tale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president or how much of this damage limiting exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both Washington and ... we're trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual but we can't\nHave business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancelled that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a writer for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior\nIn the U.N Security council second lead to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have\nDo supply weapons as well to to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a better sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies\nOr to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is that is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid an foreign society\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries to a point of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept to Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a president the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it does not the only factor we have other interests\nAre and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in the in the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the ...\nInterests but at the very least in the in the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just to expressing outrage there practical steps that can be take\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arm shipments of that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that do not hurt our economy\nAnd that make clear that the kind of behavior we've seen top two weeks is not acceptable ... thank you thank you\nSo during for profit is it new you probably remember

go in and they kill or capture and they've been doing it at a pace that's unprecedented yeah\nYou're right in the article that the number of us special forces has doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects so changing the way a lot of wars conducted around the world doesn't it\nThis has doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects show of changing the way a lot of wars conducted around the world doesn't it\nThat's right a military targets are used to be thought of as you know air fields um bridges barracks those have been replaced by just the targets are people and we don't often like to use the word assassination button that is what it is\nMhm but your investigation uncovered people we would have to call mercenaries\nI see no there's not many other names for them at the N. word it definitely works in this case they were former soldiers hired to do military operations combat targeted killings for the military of a foreign power\nYou open your story for buzzfeed or by talking about the war in Yemen the proxy war being fought there what happened in Aden and twenty fifty\nThese special forces or an unsealed veterans Navy SEAL veterans'\nDay deployed on a mission to kill the leader of the eight and branch of al Islam\nAnd all this law is that right is very important political party in Yemen to this llamas party but it's not viewed in the wider world as a terrorist group and unless the UAE e as we writes hired this company to kill this local political\nLeader the LA and Saudi Arabia are leading the war in in Yemen against rebels in Yemen and they have us support now you you suggest in this story that somebody in this group was a member of the active military\nReservists he was reservists and he was a seal reservists he he was at that level of of command of one of the nation's best most highly trained and he was still you know technically he had a ... a top secret clearance sources told us even when he was doing this very strange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know\n[noise] I guess I Am among those Americans who who just assumed that that had to be elite\nStrange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know\nI guess I Am among those Americans who who just assumed that that had to be illegal the Jewish citizens couldn't do that there are laws that do govern whether the U.S whether us individuals can service officers can enlist in foreign militaries but it's unclear if there ever enforced and what the penalties really are because of various Supreme Court decisions\nOr you've seen how Americans have served in the French ah well I've I've mentioned French foreign legion in the article the Israeli defense forces\nAnd these are not ... a lot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during world ... short right yeah and these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries but I I don't know that there's a distinction if you if you can join a foreign military just for the money now and and by the way this doesn't apply to people who joined ISIS or\nThe Taliban or somebody who fights against the u._s. or or us ally that really is against the law that is ... ... this is a buzzfeed story\nNot an NPR story hasn't

Simon we've learned over the past few years the opioid crisis that the face of addiction can be just about any face an obituary that appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touch many readers this week it included a photo of the smiling face\nThat appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touched many readers this week it included a photo of the smiling face of metal to Lynch in there\nWith her toddler son Aden who was grinning from his perch on her back\nThat photo shoot a good day for money but she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old when production ... party a drug took hold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son\nMetal and limbs and Mir died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her sister Kato Neal wrote that obituary in joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Berlin to thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me\nFirst we're we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing a she wanted to be an actress and starring Broadway musicals and she really had\nThe voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew in lived and then there was the uh Matty who suffer from a disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm into farm and\nThe painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Maddie this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nYou're drug ... more than one program I gathered yeah she tried many [noise] what made you sure all of this in Europe which were\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define\nThe way she lived and certain not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted and now I'm we carry that hope for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so\nLet's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone\nDo you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or buprenorphine there's evidence that they work very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications to help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one face of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about Matty with her son and her back in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\nI understand there's going to be a service from ... there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nThrough song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a a video of Matty singing a Bonnie rate songs is just sitting in the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction and recovery and family members and that's been a huge source of support and solid\nStories about their own addiction recovery and family members and that's been a huge source of
