transforming that the transportation sector that we have here in in our way and\nWe have at the moment a lot of new electrical vehicle is coming into and driving around all across the highway and that's something that that I Believe that we should be quite proud of Kent Goodman says\nI agree last month a fifty percent of all new cars where electrical and that's a ... a a major leaked towards a more green society especially when we know that the transport sector is a big country bitter into the CEO to\nCredits yes so for me I think it's very important that we have an active policy towards thinking new technology that drives the green shift and still has the oil and gas sector because it gives us the money to do all the research and have\nAnd the it's actually part of making Europe more green\nGay we have to remember the sheer scale of this because if you take in consideration the Europe screen batteries the new region hydro power in the region hydropower is one tenth the energy of what we export natural gas to Europe which is important because\nIf we don't export from Norway it will be other countries who will take place in Europe\nI don't think that you can take out twenty five percent of the natural gas coming into Europe of the equation and and just relax and sit sit back and say that nobody will replace it of course it will be replaced him\nThis cascades not to view this shed by much of the Norwegian public can actually ... we do it well it's not safe policing when the power comes from Norway we take it out cleaning from the ground\nAnd where the good guys and all of this I think that's been a very important part of the story that we've been telling ourselves in the way over the past twenty Thirty years or being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame of south as a climate friendly country in a way\nAnd what we're seeing now is basically a shift because we're also taking into account both that the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries in the world and in Europe we're seeing this\nThe consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big and the ... transition now from fossil fuels and being depended on importing for ... in in many countries\nTo want to be energy independent and building more and more renewable energy and ... in a lot of renewable energy\nAnd that's a whole new transition that we are seeing and and that's happening in Great Britain it's happening in Germany and that's going to change the markets\nTo which we sell our petroleum at the moment as far as you can sense should the Norwegian government be granting new exploration licenses for it and places like the parents see in the ... I Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and Main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debates so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we accept and say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the ... today they will be still be producing and twenty seven\nTwenty eight and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero zero climate got submissions\nCan Goodman says well I think we have to see it on a great escape because if you're going to shut down all the ... power pounced based on coal\nIn the work but it does not oil we're talking about oh yeah but my point is that if you have replaced coal plants for example of gas\nOr even oil that will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the bird greener re first has to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for example in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce them fast enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worst agree in this society I'm totally agreeing with us\nProduce them false enough so we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worst agreement society I'm totally agreeing with us but we have to do it in a way that actually if you do ...\n... Christopher in this in this movement of transition it probably does make sense then to join in the ... seat because actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than say many of the alternatives that are out\nThere I think it's very limited have long a county and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the strategy we've had over a hundred and fifty expiration of the parents the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw in the ... when I was next incident and I came back a few years later\nAnd my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about the climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said\nNow China should do something about it because they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to the international conferences where we are discussing climate change and plus I feel if I was in Oxford last week and that was at the summary of the whole conference\nIt was saying that Norway is the bad guy and to put it into words of the students and when I talk to them today and told him I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world why can't we afford making a plan\nTo get off that feels good ...\nI Would look at the time frame because college but says well it could be dragging on two twenty Seventy yeah it will and it will be like that if you base your numbers on I eat a international Energy Agency does have to still in twenty fifty\nOne third of the energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers and they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of noise globally so we have to replace production until we're able to make shift without it\nYear for the total production of noisy globally so we have to replace production until we're able to make shift without it and remember that is\nBased if we go to do a big big job you're going to increase renewables about six thousand percent another huge huge drop ... on on how are you going to ... just to mention also\nThat we will also double or triple nuclear power globally\nIf this was true we're not going to reach the climate targets the Paris Agreement the target is that you like to know is soft and we've been debating a those are\nThose numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time and it's going to take a lot of drastic measures but it's also important to understand that the speed of the renewable energy at the moment how sauce it's being built ... new investments are being made into renewable\nEnergy and it's so many different types of renewable energy which are cheaper than gas and oil in competition with the do as a politician and in a country like Norway which you largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks of itself is green it's still difficult to sell these ideas\nHow enough does anybody else going to buy and well it's difficult in Norway that it's become easy I've I've been working environmental issues for for ten Fifteen Years at the moment and\nIt's become you see here but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and it's important to understand that why why do you do well because we have been producing country for so long and it's been so large part of who we are and how we identify ourselves and it's been I mean a lot of people\nHas been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that we're not talking about shutting down production that we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in more oil fields for the future can convince kinda we have to look on what are our options\nNow we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in more ... in the future can convince citizens\nWe have to look on what are our options what are the renewables\nFor example where are discussing to mix in a more a bio diesel into our airplanes to make their more renewable\nBut where do you get the ... do so well uh you get to a perhaps if you're a lucky from ah organic waste and it's part of the circle but ah if not you have to produce it by making\nSome of our lands part of\nThat ... de Soleil production instead of making foods\nSo I mean we have to be realistic and\nIf you want to have more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and who are going to develop that well it's the engineers that they now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry and we see that a ... that's called actually knew now they changed their name it's part of the stresses they because\nThey understand they are also part of the green shift\nSo my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's stop with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green it's a long process\nAnd oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the word more green gay or\nThe same time we have to address CCS and sees you because carbon capture and storage on carbon capture and use it as both a central themes in the transition into\nThe ... successfully than no trial with ... again it's a lot of the things we have to do at the same time and this is one of the great things we can use our engineers to\nThis is one of the great things that we could use our universities for the ... from the burned see is like another new regions state you can stack them up on each other and they thrive when it's cold and it's dark so this could be one part of the solution\nThere's a lot of things we have to do and we can do\nEach other and they thrive when it's cold it's dark so this could be one part of the solution there is a lot of things we have to do or we can do because we are in the situation we're\nCarry you wants to connect with CBS is definitely important and we are in the situation in Norway led effort political party actually agree on is let me just explain what we mean by that cash or sorry it's essentially the idea that you could somehow take the call them for the environment and and put it away the underground or under the ...\nYeah that we've been trying to develop that technology in no way for for some time now\nI think the technology exists it's a matter of making it profitable and making it possible for companies to actually use and the government to no way are shifting governments have spent quite a ... a lot of money to trying to make that tough but fair is\nGetting down to the details again and the staff has been focused on in our right for Twenty years I think also an to challenge to politicians here with a greater sense because I don't think when you were saying the solution is more oil and gas I don't think when we know what the harm is doing the climate changes if\nYou're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to plan for it or not\nWe have to take a short break now but just to remind you please do less and know what you think of the program or if you have any ideas the topics ... the real story a BBC ... UK and you can subscribe to the ... such a BBC the real story about cost up [noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c. World Service of the U.S has made possible by American public media producer industry bitter of award winning public radio content with support from beard financial part they're guarding families businesses communities and institutions since Nineteen Nineteen or W Baird dot com has more information\nAnd we're working with local or energy company here are the regional and we're actually looking at it together with the communities and the company is how we\nDon't have to put another long cable to supply them but actually for a couple of solar power will be beneficial and I think this kind of way so creating viable energy future it's it's really the way to go if you can see how it benefits their own society and if they think more locally and regionally about the way we plan\nWith energy I don't think we will be in a situation that he's growing up with\nThat they have to pay so much more for the energy I think actually we can\nMake really good energy future\nHe's growing up with that we have to pay so much more for that energy I think actually we can make really good energy futures here\nI'm interested all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way it can be a model for anybody else\nI should think that we should sign certain area certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the markets and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical cars it is it is in ... in creating a market for a new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house buildings we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and chips because we're a shift nation and I was being so\nThere because of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to walk into anything other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because you want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy is secure it is of supply will come from renewables not to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this exploration stuff we talked about there's only two developments and then to reach the Arctic oil and gas fields\nWhen the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries were really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export of Norway they have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of tourists ... actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so we sort of this other it's just we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of northern Norway and nobody's really thinking that's\nSo that people are starting to complain so we sort of this other it's just we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of northern Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields that benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you were an engineer in in terms so I think he would rather studied renewable energy at our university which you can\nFor other than oil actually had developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students ask for it\nCan come and say well no no this is the opposite to each other I mean you have the development in the uh the American I'm a business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to have the green shift or even though we we have a increasing tourists man I'm a I'm a great expansion and the a matter of time sector or because they weren't picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down the coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to wonder why don't you think you've made that I Know but it's ... it's it sounds like it doesn't ... sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well\nIf you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got a got them a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe that that shift and the ... now in the energy sector is really happening in these happening\nIn other countries that the moment I mean look at China that the the speeds of over ... new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well with the coal fired power plants absolutely but my argument if you will see now that ...\nIt's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well would a coal fired power plants absolutely but my argument if you will see now that renewable energy will indeed be more cost effective\nThan fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really live at the moment today by producing and exporting petroleum\nWill that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't this a country that much if Europe is Jolie grateful to buy new reached gas say twenty five percent of your supply because actually that pulls away a little bit from Russia\nGave and does it does a good story about interpreter in Lithuania there's the port city there is an elegy terminal which taking natural gas\nIt's named independence by the president there because it makes them independent from Russian guys an older guys\nOn board ducked terminal comes from the barn she comes from her first comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than on not only to get energy but also the right kind of energy\nThat she can argue that new region energy as plain as some people might not so reasons to buying it but it will say that it means that new ways a counterweight to these powers that are trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new routes round the north pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia or China or ...\nIn the ... have drilled about twice as much U.S Russia and we have sort of this\nExpression ever that we need to drill before Russia to set the standard in the parents see and I don't think it's necessarily get that Norway goes to Brussels and law bits for better conditions for gas because you have this problem in Europe that gas and renewables are competing so that it's not a

the carbon browsing on if you see the court and Brazil has been originally excuse to summer it is a totally different picture coming up now so if the carbon prices high and Europe\nGus will exclude

guessing would do as well I'm Emma may be a question too\nOf course I miss it and I wanted to say you said it was green today I mean how how can we see this in China now what is the effect of me to turn on the ground [noise] yeah\nWell I mean it's so interesting because originally when made two went viral globally I thought that that it can't take off to that extent in China because there's so many obstacles there is very very heavy Internet censorship there is no press freedom so unlike in the U.S square\nOn the news about Harvey Weinstein in you know sexually abusing all these famous Hollywood actresses that was broken by news organizations but there is um the news organizations in China are basically now propaganda outlets they're not allowed to do this kind of reporting for the most part\nUm and then then finally there is no independent judiciary so any victims of sexual abuse in China have virtually no recourse and yet made to has really taken off in spite of all of the obstacles and and\nSquare on the news about Harvey Weinstein you know sexually abusing all these famous Hollywood actresses that was broken by news organizations but there is um the news organizations in China are basically now propaganda outlets they're not allowed to do this kind of reporting for the most part\nUm and then then finally there is no independent judiciary so any victims of sexual abuse in China have virtually no recourse\nAnd yet made to has really taken off in spite of all of the obstacles and and today you still see young women emerging up all across China um across sectors even across class\nComing out with their accusations their personal stories of sexual abuse for me to post to being censored coming on well they a lot of them have been censored but it's not a blanket censorship on on the meat to hash tag so\nThere are definitely stories that are getting through 'em and and also the feminist activists themselves are very creative and imaginative about finding new ways to get around the censorship\nOn for example one young feminists when when I made to hash tag was being censored um really aggressively one activist came up with the idea of using him oh jeez I'm for the characters that sound like me too and Chinese so she used a rice and Bonnie emerging me\nToo [laughter] I should get around and and and it worked for a while but then the benefit right Patricia\nI'm I just wondered whether this movement to the given some ended by the fact that I'm trying to start some Chinese from this change so much with the sort of one child policy on that because there were probably a few a woman but in more than ... than the than they might have been a generation of but whether this play\nJeez I'm for the characters that sound like me too and Chinese so she

given some ended by the fact that I'm trying to start some Chinese from this change so much with this or the one child policy on that because there were probably a few a woman but in more than ... than that then they might have been a generation of but whether this played into it is it's all\nWell I think it may it it's really hard to tell it at this point if there's any direct correlation it may have played a role because there have been studies that show that um when there's only one child and that the child has a daughter\nThan she doesn't have to compete with a brother for parental investment\nAnd so she may be better educated than she would have otherwise been had she had a brother or more brothers\nWhy do you think we all ... apparently sued troubled by some and when you look at ... ideology that doesn't necessarily safe to use it you should be worried of women complaining for equality or does it\nKnow of course not and this is why the jailing of these young feminists and twenty Fifteen provide such outrage because the Chinese government itself was founded on the principle of gender equality and it's written into the constitution of the People's Republic of China\nAnd

today we're discussing the results of all study the b._b._c. lending us experiment\nProfessor of mine ... to one of the team he's been analyzing the data is with me now with Jack the issue seems to be spending so much time on his own but I was interested to see the in the study not everyone thinks that loneliness is about being on Iran today\nNo no uh we had a sort of participants believing deadline and this is about being on your own but all the rest associated with very different things\nAnd I was surprised to see the full ... percent of the people who responded told us they think that loneliness can sometimes be positive that seem surprising when it's such an unpleasant feeling\nHas so much is a little bit like a social first let's say so when you are very very thirsty it's not pleasant of course but it's there for a reason is there to tell you you need to drink your body is is aching for that drink\n'em and you do it and it's gone I'm learning is is a little bit like that in the sense that yes it is painful and it has to be painful so that you pay attention to what's happening and what's lacking\nBut as long as you respond to it by redirecting your attention to others and to your social connections it should go away and it should be fine um so it's not necessarily negative and in fact it can sometimes be positive because it it leads to an anticipation of social connection for it\nAnd of course but it's there for a reason is there to tell you you need to drink your body is is aching for that drink 'em and you do it and it's gone I'm learning is is a little bit like that in the sense that yes it is painful and it has to be painful so that you pay attention to what's happening and what's lacking\nBut as long as you respond to it by ... directing your attention to others on to your social connections it should go away and it should be fine um so it's not necessarily negative and in fact it can sometimes be positive because it it leads to an anticipation of social connection for example\nBut of course where it goes wrong is where either you don't pay attention to those signs or you count because for example like jak as we heard just now you you have no uh no sufficient mobility no sufficient resources to actually be able to connect to others\nNow this was a global study and people from all over the well chose to take part did you find that people everywhere experience learning is\nWell the short answer is yes we did find on in us in every country and in every age group all over the world\nIn terms of age we can also say that the H trend that we spoke about earlier was the same in every country the only minor differences was that in some countries the slope was steeper so there was a bigger reduction in in ... a cross the lifespan than in others but the trend is always they\nAre but we also found that culture can make a difference\nNow there were nine countries where we had enough people taking part to make some comparisons\nAnd levels of loneliness will almost the same in the u._k. to us from India I was interested to see slightly lower levels in New Zealand now this isn't a representative sample of calls but I wanted to know whether this made any sense to talk to my taste Lucas and from the university who hails from New Zealand as thought his mental health and young people\nThis isn't the first time that um this is being hogwash statistics museum and talked about\nSell as they are but we also have that culture I can make a difference\nWhen nine countries where we had enough people taking part to make some comparisons\nAnd levels of letting us well almost the same and the u._k. to us from India I was interested to see slightly lower levels in New Zealand now this isn't a representative sample of calls but I wanted to know whether this made any sense to talk to my taste Lucas and from the university who hails from New Zealand and studies mental health and young people\nThis isn't the first time that um this is being highlighted statistics New Zealand talked about the proportion of people that we're experiencing loneliness all of the time most of the time and it was around ... percent and then you see ... population based on the ceiling quality of life sit by\nAnd that compares to a previous see if I Am from the u._k. was about six to saint of people so it's interesting that the

the mess of pain I can see through the ah the windows outside so how did you do this\nWe went to the studio and two two thousand shots of the place in just two hours then a little bit of number

modeled in here\nWith us from just moving down now I can see down to the ultimate is truly that's right in front of me and this this is the paint spices on the bottom of a a little letter\nCan banks the head of social impact of the digital identity from your study was that our Jake fruit right here put it to him that digital IDs hadn't been fully embraced in developed countries so why should they do better elsewhere\nWhen you look at developing countries as a starting point it about fifty percent of children in sub Saharan Africa still aren't registered as being bullied by the fifth birthday so it's about a billion people out there who don't exist basically\nSo is this the kind of way as to be seen with other technologies in Africa and other developing a place\nKen Banks the head of social impact of the digital identity from your city was that average I recruit right here put it to him the digital IDs hadn't been fully embraced in developed countries so why should they do presser elsewhere\nWhen you look at developing countries as a starting point it about fifty percent of children in sub Saharan Africa still aren't registered as being borne by that fits the stay so it's about a billion people out there who don't exist basically\nSaid it's just the kind of way as we've seen with other technologies in Africa and other developing um places of leap frog gang existing wasting things and gang straight to ditch too tentative\nIt is absolutely a pipe is still quite important in many of these places but if you're going to end says they got into West African countries all\nAcross Asian countries and they're gonna try and help them to register\nChildren being bowl which is the best starting point of it registered as being bowl and then they tend to be have an identity going forward so that's the that's the point that people are focusing on quite a lot but absolutely if you can go in at that stage and gives them a digital identity rather than giving them paper then um that sets up for life as they take politician the growing digital economy\nAnd what are some of the suggestions of how we could provide these teach to license teeth\nSo a couple of

registered well over a billion people a biometric play into it to a large government base a base\nUm but on the lower level there's all sorts of solutions coming out which enabled us registrations in registrations at lower level as a company called element to have a phone based registration to where they take babies fingerprints and footprints\nIn order to give them an initial biometric identity\nAnd there's a company called sim prince based in Cambridge who use I bought ... which they take ... to various places and again use that to to register pass you know we've heard stories of doctors giving patients to injections for something that I should have one because they had no way of knowing that being in the week before\nBut without having and having any way of identifying them\nThose very very kind of basic problems an average creep in and they can be life threatening\nDid you like ... an ID causing general often feel people with worry about privacy concerns um how can you set up camp today's consent\nRight well there are a number of different solutions and and uh ideas can vying for the mainstream if if you should say so recently of the world bank event that I attended looking at digital identities there are people looking at blog chain and centralized versus decentralized solutions\nI'm centralized solutions work well because you can control everything in one place and you can avoid duplicate identities and so on but at the same time that our favorite political for hackers an odd how recently got ... uh again reactor number of times recently got hacked\nAnd that's the system in India was over a billion people people register so absolutely there's concerns they're all um some ideas about you\nIt's kind of vying for the mainstream if if you should say so recently at a wealthy banker event that I attended looking at digital identities there are people looking at block chain and centralized versus decentralized solutions\nUm centralized solutions work well because you can control everything in one place and you can avoid duplicate identities and so on but at the same time that our favorite political for hackers an odd hall recently got ... uh again it's behind the number of times recently got hacked\nAnd that's the system in India was over a billion people people register so absolutely there's concerns they're all\nUm some ideas about using cell phones or an identity is way you have your identity on your mobile phone only you hold it and then you can choose who you present that to when you're interacting with the service and that's the way we look at the icy we actually have it on your smartphone so it's actually held by\nYou rather than being held in the central place it can be hacked but at the moment there's a number of different solutions that are vying for the time um but the centralized ones which are the most common at the moment all the most vulnerable\nThat's Ken Banks now what have you done to minimize your carbon footprint and use less energy costs out ed travel perhaps so made your home more energy efficient but maybe you should also consider giving up Netflix Amazon Prime video and other on the amount

Amazon Prime Netflix rule\nThat this is where my husband gets a little less screen\nThere's a lot involved when you flip on your television and watch something on Netflix for example\nDon't see Mike has lots of Lancaster University has been researching the growing energy use self video streaming which now accounts for the majority of Internet traffic\nThe Internet the data centers the digital devices all account for about eight percent of global electricity demand and that's about three percent of carbon emissions which is roughly equivalent to the airline industry\nAnd because video streaming at such a large share more than fifty five percent of all Internet traffic um you could say that around three percent perhaps of global electricity demand goes towards video streaming and supporting that\nBut how does streaming video compassion energy use with good old fashioned broadcast TV critic praised is professor of computing sustainability at Bristol University\nI think we can definitively say that broadcast TV is definitely more efficient than video on demand a but on the other hand video on demand is more sophisticated service the Brokaw Stevie broke us TV effectively you're providing the same for everyone\nAnd if you can provide the same for everyone then you just need one a system to dispatches to broadcast\nTowards video streaming and supporting that but how

us should we stop streaming Mike has us from Lancaster University\nIf you're concerned about the environmental impacts of your your everyday life\nAre the main thing to think about with regards to streaming is whether that stream video is really being watched as a lot of times uh our research has found that video is used to provide a just background noise and and as it turns out\nA broadcast radio is an excellent way to provide that sort of that same sort of ambience and does not require that extra energy that that streaming video does\nThe professor Chris priest in Bristol says we

interruptions are triggered by earthquakes or vice versa those kind of events are connected by the stress field in the interior of the earth or the earthquake will cause a ... a distress field and that might have some kind of\nInfluence on the magnetic plumbing system of a volcano and it's more likely to happen if the volcano was already close to a rupture and and it just took either the stress

have the oil industry and that we are exporting a lot of oil and gas our green credentials are quite a significant and should be taken into account especially I Want to mention what a\nVarious political parties have done the wreck or several years transforming that the transportation sector that we have here in in Norway\nAnd we have at the moment a lot of new electrical vehicles coming into and driving around all across Norway and that's something that that I Believe that we should be quite proud of Ken Goodman since\nI agree last month a fifty percent of all new cars where electrical and that's a ... a a major leaked towards a more green society especially when we know that the transport sector is a big country bitter into the CEO to\nOpinions consent no I mean it's a quick or easy now because we have a political platform other government where we have to agree to let this area and be left as it is but it's very important that we have activity on the other parts of the of the continent because uh\nWe produce a lot of oil and gas that's very important for the European production of electrical power\nAnd the it's actually part of making Europe more green\nGay we have to remember the sheer scale of this because if you take in consideration the Europe screen battery the new region hydro power in the region hydropower is one tenth the energy of what we export natural gas to Europe which is important because\nIf we don't export from Norway it will be other countries who will take place in Europe\nI don't think that you can take out twenty five percent of the natural gas coming into Europe of the equation and and just relax and said sit back and say that nobody will replace it of course it will be replaced him\nThis cascades massive view that shaped by much of the Norwegian public can actually ... we do it well it's not safe policing when the power comes from no way we take it out cleaning from the ground\nAnd where the good guys and all of this I think that's been a very important part of the story that we've been telling ourselves in the way over the past twenty Thirty years or\nTake place in Europe I don't think that you can take out twenty five percent of the natural gas coming into Europe of ... I'm just relaxing sit back and say that nobody will replace it of course it will be replaced and\nCarry this because he is not to view this shed by much of the Norwegian public that actually better that no way does this we do it well ... it's not safe policing when the power comes from Norway we take it out cleaning from the ground where the good guys and all of us\nI think that's been a very important part of the story that we've been telling ourselves in the way over the past twenty Thirty years or being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame myself as a climate friendly country in a way\nAnd what we're seeing now is basically a shift because we're also taking into account both that the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big and the ... now\nFrom fossil fuels and being depended on importing fulfills few in in very many countries\nTo want to be energy independent and building more and more renewable energy investing in a lot of renewable energy\nAnd that's a whole new transition that we are seeing and and that's happening in Great

in the debates so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we accept and say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the barn see today they will be still be producing in twenty seven\nTwenty eight and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should\nAs far as you can sense should the new region government

today they will be still be producing and twenty seven\nTwenty eight days and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero zero climate guessing mission\nCan come and says well I think we have to see it on the great escape because if you're going to shut down all the power pounced based on coal into work\nBut it doesn't ... talking about oh yeah but\nMy point is that if you have replaced coal plants for example gas or even oil\nThat will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the bird greener refers tests to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce them fast enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worst agree in this society I'm totally agreeing with that but we have to do it in a way that actually is yeah do all\nThat stuff is in this in this moment of transition it probably does make sense then driven the Baron seat because actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than say many of the alternatives that are out there\nI think it's very limited how long are camped here and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the strategy and we've had over a hundred and fifty exploration in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nA way that actually if you do\nAll this stuff is in this in this movement of transition it probably does make sense then driven the Baron seat because actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than say many of the

gas fields because that's the strategy we've had over a hundred and fifty exploration in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw ... find out what's next fenced in and out came back a few years later\nAnd my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about the climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said now China should do something about it\nBecause they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to international conferences where we are discussing climate change and plus I feel if I was in office for last week and that was at the summary of the whole conference\nIt was saying that Norway is the bad guy and to put it into words of the students and when I talk to them today and told him I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world why can't we afford making a plan to get a false that feels good sunny stuff\nWould look at the time frame because college but says well it could be doing until twenty Seventy yeah it will and it will be like that if you base your numbers on I ... a international Energy Agency they say that still in twenty fifty\nOne third of the energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers\nAnd they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of noise globally so we have to replace production until we're able to make shift without it and remember that is based if we go to do a big\nBig job you're going to increase renewables about six thousand percent unless it's a huge huge\nIt will be like that if you base your numbers on I ... a natural Energy Agency they say it's still in twenty fifty\nOne third of the

production until we're able to make shift without it and remember that is based if we're going to do a big big job you're going to increase renewables about six thousand percent another huge huge drop ...\nOn on how well do you want to just to mention also\nThat we will also double or triple nuclear power globally\nIf this was true we're not going to reach the climate targets the Paris Agreement the target is that you know it's not and we've been debating a those are\nThose numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time and it's going to take a lot of drastic measures\nBut it's also important to understand that the speed of the renewable energy at the moment how sauce states being built ... new investments are being made into renewable energy and it's so many different types that renewable energy which are cheaper than gas\nAnd oil in competition with the whole as a politician and in a country like no way which you largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks of itself is green it's still difficult to sell these ideas\nHow on us as anybody else can I buy and well it's difficult in a way that it's become easy I've I've been working environment fallacious for for ten Fifteen Years at the moment and\nIt's become you see here but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and it's important to understand that why why do you think that well because we have been producing country for so long and it's been so large part of who we are and how we identify herself in this I mean a lot of people have\nDid you largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks of itself is green it's still difficult to sell these ideas\nHow long does anybody else can I buy and well it's difficult in a way that it's become

important to understand that why why do you do that well because we have been producing country for so long and it's been so large part of\nWho we are and how we identify herself in this I mean a lot of people\nHas been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that we're not talking about shutting down production that we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in more oil fields for the future can convince the kind of\nTo look on what are our options what are the renewables\nFor example we are discussing to mix in a more a bio diesel into our airplanes to make their more renewable\nBut where do you get the ... do so well uh you get to perhaps if you're a lucky from ah organic waste and it's part of the circle but uh if not you have to produce it by making\nSome of our Lance part of\nThe ... de Soleil production instead of making foods\nSo I mean we have to be realistic and\nIf you want to have a more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and who are going to develop that well it's the engineers that they now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry and we see that the ... that's called actually knew now they changed their name it's part of the stresses they because\nThey understand they are also part of the green shift\nSo my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's stop with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green it's a long process\nAnd oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down to\nMore green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and\nWho are going to develop that well it's the engineers that they now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry and we see that the ... that's called at three new now they changed their name it's part of the stresses they because they understand they are also part of the green shift\nSo my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's stop with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green it's a long process\nAnd oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the word more green\nGay or at the same time we have to address CCS and sees you because carbon capture and storage or carbon capture and use it as both a central themes in the transition into\nThe ... down of which have successfully than no trial yet again it's a lot of the things we have to do at the same time and this is one of the great things we can use our engineers do\nThis is one of the great things that we could use our universities for the algae is from the burned see is like another new regions they stack them up on each other and they thrive when it's cold it's dark so this could be one part of the solution\nThere's a lot of things we have to do and we can do because we are in the situation we are\nOf you wants to come back and and she's yes it's definitely important and and we are in the situation in Norway led effort political party actually ... let's just say yeah what we need cash a story and it's essentially the idea that you could somehow take become for the environment and and put it away the underground or under the ...\nYeah that we've been trying to develop that technology in no way for for some time now\nAnd I think technology ... it's a matter of making it profitable and making it possible for companies to actually use and the government in no way are shifting governments have spent quite a lot with a lot of money to try to make that happen there is getting down to the theater\nEvery political party actually ... let me just explain what we need cash a story and it's essentially the idea that you could somehow take the call them for the environment and and put it away the underground or under the ... yeah that we've been trying to develop that technology in no way for for some time now\nAnd I think technology ... it's a matter of making it profitable and making it possible for companies to actually use and the government didn't know they are shifting governments have spent quite a ... a lot of money to trying to make that happen barriers\nTo getting down to the details again and CCF has been focused on in order for Twenty years I think we also need to challenge to politicians here with a greater sense because I don't think when you were saying the solution is more oil and gas I don't think women know what the harm is doing the climate changes if\nYou're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to plan for it or not\nSo it's not that easy to just to shift and there's also another concern that's huge that season to unions because of\nIf you're export the power you don't use it for industrial production in no way and that's the discussion about your work about where you live what you're going to do it's a problem\nThere is I just want to come with an example again and we have this island big island outsider called ...\nIf you're export the power you don't use it for industrial production in no way that's the discussion about your work about where you live what you're going to do it's a problem\nThere is I just want to come with an axe awful again and we have this island big island outside of your calls from now which is very beautiful and it has a lot of seafood production and it's expected to increase the two hundred percent in terms of how much power the need for all this new production\nAnd we're working there with local or energy company here are the regional and we're actually looking at together with the communities and the company is how we\nDon't have to put another long cable to supply them but actually for a couple of solar power will be beneficial and I think this kind of way so creating viable energy future it's it's really the way to go if you can

else\nI should think that we should sign certain area certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the markets and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical cars it is it is in ... in creating a market for a new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house buildings we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and chips because we're a shift nation and I was being so\nVery cause of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to walk into anything other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because you want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy security is of supply will come from renewables not to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this explorations that we've talked about there's only two developments and then to reach the Arctic oil and gas fields\nWhen the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries were really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export of Norway you have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of tourists ... actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so we sort of his other it's just we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of northern Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields to benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you were born and\nTo oil and gas fields when the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries were really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export of Norway you have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of tourists may or may actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so we sort of this other it's just we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of northern Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields to benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you are an engineer in in terms so I think he would rather studied renewable energy at our university which you can\nFor other than oil actually developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students ask for it can't given\nFalse none of this is the opposite to each other I mean you have the development in the er and merit to him a business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to have the green shift or even though if we have a increasing tourists man I'm a I'm a great expansion and the a matter of time sector or because they were on the picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down to coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to think you've made and I know but it's ... it's it sounds like it doesn't say some times when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well\nIf you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got a got them a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe that that shift and the ... now in the energy sector is really happening and they happen\nI think you've made it out there I Know but it's ... it it sounds like it doesn't actually sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well\nIf you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got a got them a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe that that shift and the ... now and the energy sector is really happening and they just happening\nIn other countries at the moment I mean look at China that the the speed of of a new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well with the coal fired power plants absolutely\nBut my argument if you will see now that when you have energy will indeed be more cost effective\nThan fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really live at the moment today by producing and exporting petroleum\nWill that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't this a country that much of Europe is generally grateful to buy new reached gas say twenty five percent of your supply because actually that pulls the way a little bit from Russia gave\n[laughter] there's there's a good story about interpreter in Lithuania there's the port city there's an elegy terminal which taking natural gas\nIt's named independence by the president there because it makes them independent from Russian guys an older guys\nOn board that terminal comes from the bar and seek comes from her office comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than on not only to get\nThere is an elegy terminal which taking natural gas\nIt's named independence by the president there because it makes them independent from Russian gas and all the gas\nOn board that terminal comes from the barn and seek comes from Homer fest comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than on not only to get energy but also the right kind of energy\nThat she can argue that new region energies plane as some people might not reason to buying it but it will say that it means that new ways a counterweight to leave Palestine ... trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new route surrounding North Pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia and China and ...\nAnd the parents said they have drilled about twice as much as Russia and we have sort of this\nExpression ever that we need to drill before Russia to set the standard in the parents see and I don't think it's necessarily get that Norway goes to Brussels and love ... for better conditions for gas I guess you have this problem in Europe that gas and renewables are competing so that it's not a black and white picture\nThat ... that is according to the carbon pricing and if you see the current price hasn't been originally since the summer it is a totally different picture coming up now so if the covered prices high and Europe gas will exclude cold if because of\nWhat you mean by that call them price\nThe price you pay for the admissions you'd you produce energy by\nAnd there's a market inside Europe and the prices are being artificially low for a lot of years and that has made it possible to run coal plants in Europe to a low cost when those prices starting to rise then you guest will push out cold enough push out renewables\nAnd ... to understand that renewable and gas are competing\nIn Europe Gus will exclude coal\nWe've recorded lay on what you mean by that call them price the\nPrice you pay for the admissions you'd you produce energy but\nOn the market inside Europe and the president or be or to fishery low for a lot of years and that has made it possible to run coal plants in Europe too low cost when those prices starting to rise then you go to will push out cold enough push health renewables that he's\nStill a ... to ... to understand that renewable and gas are competing in Germany they are afraid they'll be able to carve approaching no but also the way the energy system works\nAnd since renewable energy is so much more cost efficient when it's producing electricity than coal fired and the gas fired power plants are they are actually competing and you mentioned Russia and\nThe situation in Europe and in terms of that and I mean\nObviously Norway can't we can't take Russia's place when it comes to to guess and an exporter of gas but that is also why Europe and so many European countries today are wanting to be more energy independent an are investing in renewable energy\nSo I mean we're gonna keep exploding gas to Europe for quite some time it's a way already made those commitments but but this is about what kind of you do we have for your past twenty fifty and Europe's committed to have\nSierra ... get greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector of the twenty fifth day so that's the picture that we're looking at\nWon't says how little psycho drama for you which you may disagree with\nNew way relatively poor country in the

that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school making the colonel columnist for the Washington Post has expressed\nA diversity of views [laughter] which we will come and she joined just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you wrote at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause and the Senate vote to investigate allegations\nOf sexual assault by Christian blushing forward now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter] um what's that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes I don't\nThink so I think well I mean yes and now right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes or perhaps not as often as we'd like\nUm I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with as it doesn't look to possible\nThat they should confirmed me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote you know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise]\nUm and also for you know even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all information out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also you need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate the city did the investigation do its job [noise] I\nBut also you need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate ... did the investigation do its job [noise] I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh um some people say that's actually pretty normal and people say it wasn't\nA I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true and they had both of them had testified at length\nAnd you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative by not providing she had basically two pieces of crowds I wasn't aware of the fact because she was well so she had basically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she had told and sort of two thousand Seventeen to those and they tend to should\nPeople there basically to his of cooperation were her therapist notes which would seem to say look she talked about this all they're not we have another name and two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes\nTo the committee 'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear\nBut the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contacted the committee for her you know and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen\nFoot ... let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's ... Christian bushy Ford a sincere\nA book that she couldn't let a church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support right a judge no the world heard from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel\nSo since victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time and as an inherently difficult crime because you know some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated to consent you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have\nNecessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible um and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in this neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy and being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews Republicans kept saying presumed innocent ... ah until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrence\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved\nFrom people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth\nUm it's not the same as being put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it's it's way worse than what ... making the colonel thanks so much thank you

about some of the allegations jumbo Brian he's author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald and of course is executive editor Bloomberg opinion Jim thanks so much for being with us wonderful to be with you Scott is the head or is this the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nThat easily the head or of this one I don't think that's a news though\nI think the nuts and bolts of that story or some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump used a variety of tax shelters are a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious impossibly fraudulent\nTo protect the family's vast wealth about a billion dollars or so and in wealth\nTo keep it in the family to keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump tasked on several hundred million dollars to his children or he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid\nInheritance and gift taxes or in other words the trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars it was transferred and instead they they paid or around fifty million or so\n... when when Donald Trump has said over the years I've built what I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm President Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father's shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing for low to middle income people and uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time realist\nIncome housing for low to middle income people and uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that is Fred Trump hadn't co signed the loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that the times really flashed that out with a lot of\nNew numbers and the scale of his dependence on his father was really laid pretty bare and that story so that's another important theme of the story which is the president is that on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n[noise] is there anything that you did you can recognize that maybe people are going over the story now can recognize this distinctly illegal\nYeah there's a couple of interesting pieces one is when ... and his wife Mary transferred a large portfolio of buildings to Donald Trump in his siblings they used an appraiser who essentially low ball the value of the building so they would be taxed at a lower rate\nAnd everything in the times reporting suggests that that was improper in addition they found an example of a company called an odd little company it was essentially a shell company called all county that the Trump family used to inflate how much they were spending on equipment and supplies for their\nArmada of buildings so they could then pocket the differential themselves rather than pay income tax on it\nWill track how the
