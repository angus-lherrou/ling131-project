are you thinking\nI'm this is in sharp contrast to his previous statements that he thought that she was court compelling in her testimony\nIt's also by the way factually erroneous I'm Dr Ford actually gave detailed testimony that the assaults occurred upstairs she described the room describes the stairs going up to the room or so he's wrong about that last part\nCould Mr Trump's comments then

week to the FBI to investigate these allegations\nAnd that was in many ways a gesture to moderate Republican senators who felt that they could not vote without some inquiry and President Trump sort of took the high ground\nAt the time and said well yeah let's go ahead and have a fool and open investigation he lost a lot of that\nGround with this with this speech obviously because it it it really

was distributing these food basket\nOn certain people are buying well politicians local politicians are effectively buying votes I guess because they control the mayor's office and in Brazil controlling the mayor's office gives you access to a large amount of money\nThey've got all these savers going on and actually outright the buying as well the going rate was around a hundred hey ice or twenty five dollars\nAnd then what happens is the mayor of this town basically tries to get all of the people living in this town to vote for the politicians that he's in a coalition with an in

life expectancy is relatively high but for men as he mentioned is around about sixty seven a nationwide as an average so raising the pension age to sixty five is a pretty significant leap\nA given that the life expectancy is is a low still I'm particularly given that many regions of Russia especially in the east it's not too far below sixty five so\nSo many people this is really a problematic

Sarah remind us why these proposals have been so controversial\nWell because of the life expectancy here in Russia actually this is a move that President Putin says as a matter of national security says that the pension system is not sustainable as it stands that people are retiring to LA it's costing too much\nBut the problem is that said the proposal specifically for men to raise the retirement age to sixty five\nNow that's in a country where the average life expectancy is still only sixty seven I was just on a quick tough talk of the regional\nA variations on that show me that in ... the ah thirty five I think it is also an eighty two regions of Russia men will only left to sixty five or under so essentially what people are saying it's just not going to live\nTo see this time ... pensions and that's another point is well I think this is essential\nToo much up but the problem is that the proposal specifically for men to raise the retirement age to sixty five\nNow that's in a country where the average life expectancy is still only sixty seven or just on a quick Tulsa of of the regional\nA variations on that show me that in ... the ah thirty five I think it is also have a two regions of Russia men will only left to sixty five or ... or so essentially what people are saying is we just not going to live\nTo see this time in ... pensions and that's another point as well I think\nThis is essentially people have been telling me recently this is about sort of breaking a social contracts\nThe fact is that many people in Russia yes they were ... any but they actually carry on working and the point is they have low salaries once they reach retirement age they didn't get that pension on top of that and essentially it doubles the income are so many people and that's still a small amount of money but for many people that makes a big difference\nIs it pretty much a done deal no what needs to happen for these proposals to be approved\nWell essentially this has managed democracy isn't it I mean the the the lower house of parliament passed it to the upper house of parliament has just passed that just five people voting against it now President Putin has to ah sinus into law asked his spokesman today\nWhether we can expect that soon I he said that Mr Bush will make his decision without putting ... this is something that we can expect I think in the next few days\nAnd a new group claiming worried about the political consequences\nWell that's exactly what I asked Mr ... for the Kremlin spokesman and he said essentially no he didn't deny that there were consequences we've seen the President Putin's that racing slip we've seen for example some of his candidates for governor in the regions are key points\nA key positions are being a defeated at the polls in recent days and weeks that we all sing political consequences value my piece in the Clemens argument is that this was something that could not be pulled softened that Mr Putin is\nBut this is something that we can expect I think in the next few days\n... climbing worried about the political consequences\nWell that's exactly what I asked Mr best go for the Kremlin spokesman and he said essentially no he didn't deny that there were consequences we've seen President Putin's that rating slip we've seen for example some of his candidates for governor in the region the key points\nA key positions are being a defeated at the polls in recent days and weeks that we all think political consequences value my piece in the Clemens argument is that this was something that could not be pull it off and that Mr Putin is less concerned about his rating\nThan the good of the nation that's how he described it and he said essentially this is about ensuring that there are fewer pension as a few of pension is receiving a larger amounts of money\nSo thank you sir and for the most group now jumped him have some other stories from our new drift\nFurther than Trump has mocked the testimony of

an international\nDispute so in this case Iran and as I think many others felt that it had won a partial victory because the court ruled on this narrow area of humanitarian\nAre effective sanctions or acknowledging that the U.S had said it would make sure the humanitarian\nAid continue to flow but saying that that in principle was not good enough because uh it's difficult if not impossible for Iran to conduct trade under the sanctions that you've got to do more than that um\nBut the Americans have said uh you know it's a it's a defeat for Iran not for us they again took the sort of narrow ruling as the evidence that the wider case against us sanctions\nOr was it didn't have any merit and again repeated\nUm that they would be taking whatever measure as possible to ensure that there wouldn't be a humanitarian impact so you have an international educator um nations can or can't decide to accept them or ignore it and frankly in ... in this case Iran and the United states in the past have

coughing and ... was that it was so awkward bits and pieces\nShall I Want my life that because if you remember last to goodness gracious she was coughing and ... I was that it was so awkward\nBits and pieces fell off the set this was entirely different she gave I guess what I Would only described as a remarkably confidence and steady defense of capitalism Marvin moderate conservatives and she called it an most particularly of calls\nHer approach to ... she was basically scientific sort of gather activists look you may not like my dad was sort of free trade area deal with the European Union but think about all the old Senate serves the chaos of no jail over chaos of domestic domestic political turmoil and as you just sort of suggesting that possibly not ...\nBut as we all know she was speaking to a very divided audience were the signs of healing between the two sides here's\nWhat I'd say about that that she was left still standing despite scathing attacks by pro but particularly anti Europeans she ... a much relatively unscathed but look she has no fans of the woods\nIt really is important to remember these divisions over Europe have not gone out of way and one of the speech of course doesn't change the view of many are in her policy about her weaknesses as a leader but here's the thing pull you could say that time a lot of people are thinking well maybe she's not perfect but time is running out through a place where after all\nBritain is supposed to be leaving the EU next march\nShe seems to have survived the competence then but I become friends even but the really hard task because you can lie ahead\nI Would say so I mean she survived this but looking ahead she has just a matter of weeks now to try and get a deal with the European Union but she has\nSo little room to maneuver I don't think the u._s. gonna make many concessions because they see a divided weak governments in the u._k. a divided country why should they make concessions but she has little room to maneuver um she was to give too much away they infuse yeah stick Brecht citizen a policy wouldn't like it if she went for no deal the pro Europeans and businesses\nLittle room to maneuver um she was to give too much away\nThe ...

party conference this is news now\n[noise]\nNow astronomers believe they found the first some evidence of the existence of an XO movie night some moon that old but it's a planet outside our own solar system\nThe team from Columbia University in the U.S had already use NASA's Kepler space telescope to study the premises of nearly three hundred planets the professor David keeping told me that use it the more advanced Hubble Telescope had been the game changer\nWe always thought they were very likely to exist because so many like ... solar system we see so many of them so I think the real question was not so much whether they exist at all but one of the properties how big do they get\nWhy is it important to establish this\nWe're interested in ... for a few reasons one of them is that these moons could be habitable worlds in Iran right obviously that's something that science fiction has a lot of fun with that idea\nTwo reasons one of them is that these moons could be habitable worlds in that Ryan right I Would say that something that science fiction has a lot of fun with that idea things like ... and ... for example in Star Wars or need the idea is that maybe means my effects that happened to those of the planet that they ... we think\nThe moon does influence the U.S how to build a scene in fact by stabilizing the liberty of thee for example\nAnd finally we want to understand how moons form we only really have a few example was a ... system the moon appears like a maybe a one off event but is it maybe it's inevitable outcome upon formation by looking at the Nunes outside of our solar system we have to be able to build a deep understanding of how these things are built in the best place\nSuggests typically is there an assumption that if a planet has the moon going round it's at least one there is more chance to do that that might be life on the plan\nIs not necessarily but I think if we find another twin for example one of the questions you might ask if you're interested is how about the bill is whether it has a moon twin as well for example what heights we near the ocean tides\nOn the U.S are driven by the presence of the main and those early tied especially when the main was much closer to us early in our history\nAnd they even ... played a role in kick starting life on a planet\nWhere is this possible ... discovered XO moon\nIt's a long way away eight thousand light is say we might be traveling the anytime soon missed one is that for the most distant stars that kept to look at I mean that's why it was challenging for us to pull off this detection and why we needed additional tell us get time to do it\nRight the Hubble Space telescope enabled days did it\nRight so we saw a hint of their signature with a capital data we had three ... of the planet in front of the stock three transits of the time in front of the stuff from that as we thought we saw a wiggle that could be a moon but we didn't have a conclusive evidence to that point so we asked for time with the Hubble Space telescope which is more powerful space telescope\nFrom that as we thought we saw a widow that could be a moon but we didn't have a conclusive evidence that points that we asked for time with the Hubble Space telescope which is more powerful space telescope and we're able to get a much more convincing sticking out of that\nYou must be looking for the tiniest ... said some way so distant\nThat sort of these that tiny signatures in ... we really see two signatures which give away the moon we can tell the planet comes into its eclipse early about an hour to LA that tells us that something is pulling on the planet gravitationally and we think that some in\nAnd the second signal that we see is a ... in the brightness of the style which has caused by the moon passing in front of the style the shadow of the moon if you like\nIn front of the south so these are tiny signatures but we think we have strong evidence for them\nIs this thrilling possibility of extraterrestrial life that that most people have felt at some stage in life something that actually drives the scientific Korea\nTo me it's always been the last ... point of this endeavor when we're looking for planets lacking some means I think a fundamental question of fundamental driving force behind why we do this has to understand a uniqueness in the universe how unique
