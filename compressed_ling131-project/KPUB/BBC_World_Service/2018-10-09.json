they trying to stop you\nWhere we the people who need it to that's why we have I think you got them recording surviving now have you had an interaction with them yes admitting that they started cutting the pipes at Fox they started cutting you'll pipe yes so that was really terrible so what I did for several of them will really be on to the wives or their children\nTo be the ones that didn't want to you know a kiosk so I was an income that's why we're able to survive than there is I Believe also well by that is that some times that they sell their water we noticed that mostly on the

are paying for that you know quite significant amount of money ... they delivering at the moment well they're bringing in a lot of money shelf go just want to two million dollar prize\nFrom the Hilton

... to ... and I'm thinking one woman she's in one of the woman with ... she was a ... a few years back if you remember that yeah okay well she runs a foundation that are also dreading bullet holes that pumping oil syrup right from the ... of Kibera\nBut that delivering it in Jerry cans on caught so they just putting it up and passing it out so they got the ... the same way by different methods of delivery yeah exactly and the Kenyan authorities themselves they're not doing nothing they do have some pipes going into the slum they're trying to improve that situation\nBut several experts told me the cartels can still be involved with those processes may be the most will be held legally during the daytime than illegally at night so\nWell she runs a foundation that are also dreading bullet

different players involved as you said it's how to surf co fits into that\nWell it's interesting one expert I spoke to said that this ... whole system might actually be quite limited because at the amount of water or you can produce this way and he said that ultimately the real solution was what with governments and private utility companies to convince them\nThat you could actually make a profit by building ... piped infrastructure in Islam itself so that means working with the big guys but as we know that they can be a bit slow sometimes that Congress and\nPeople like short Cohen Kenya a bit more fleet to ... you know fast doing things on the ground they know how it works yeah exactly and that is the whole point of shelf guide their grassroots organization led by the parents as folk barons\nThey didn't want to hang around waiting for help and that's why they're trying to solve this problem themselves why did I leave you with a clip from my interview with Kenny when he talks about how all of those mental it's been but he said he had invisible mental was\nMy mother in law mountain that unlocks the Rosa Parks this is how he said they influence the way he thought about trying to help people in Kibera\nMen and women who don't just sit down and watch when this was happening\nAnd what they did they organized people transform their own life they didn't sit down and

thinking more about it's probably unfair to I'm Talking about the Democratic party because the organizations in this country are so diffuse [laughter] they aren't really even organizations\nBut I'm Talking here about the sort of pundit class\nIn America that really sort of determines what nice liberal people think and that\nPundits class is how would I put this a doubling down on this sort of the philosophy of two thousand and sixteen intensifying their commitment to that philosophy and how would you describe that philosophy a it's a professional class plus various other groups women and minorities\nYoung people that is you know the Democratic party and that's devoted to the Democratic party and that's you know all fine but the important thing is what do you do about the white working class what do you do about this enormous group of voters that have slowly but surely over the decades\nMoved from the Democratic column and to the Republican column and for many years the answer that this sort of pundit class in America would give is\nThat's not happening we don't need to worry about that and then all of a sudden in two thousand and sixteen it became undeniable that that was happening and so their answer now is to say there's nothing we can do about it what if they're going to win big as you suggest in the midterms what's wrong and if they get\nAll fine but the important

wrong then if they get power back\nThat's the name of the game isn't it it's a short term thing is the problem Democrats often when because when the Republicans screw up and then the Republicans come back a couple of years later and and get them back this is the natural coming and going of American politics but let me remind you of the way\nThe sort of political situation in this country used to be after the Nineteen thirties and that was at the Democratic party controlled Congress from the year Nineteen thirty up until the year Nineteen Ninety four with only two brief interruptions or the Democratic party was\nOverwhelmingly dominant in this country and the reason for that was because they were a party that was obviously and clearly identified with the interests of working people and that's not the case anymore and they you know they did the Democrats deliberately turn their back on that version of themselves\nBeginning in the seventies but sort of a coming into fruition in around Nineteen Ninety four and they turn their back on that version of themselves and they have never really recovered from it you posit at the end of your book the unthinkable to Democrats of President Trump getting reelected what would you give his chances at the moment\nYou know remember I had all sorts of ... there that\nI said if if he you know this is all off if he gets impeached or if he does if he messes up the economy with one of his dumb trade wars or if he gets in a real shooting war you know which he could easily do\nThan all bets are off but the way things are going right now\nIn the seventies but sort of a coming into fruition in around Nineteen Ninety four and they turn their back on that version of themselves and they have never really recovered from it you posit at the end of your book the unthinkable to Democrats of President Trump getting reelected what would you give his chances at the moment no remember I had all sorts of ... there that\nI said if if he you know this

off but the way things are going right now I hate to say this as you have no doubt guessed I'm pretty far to the left I think Trump has a very good chance of being reelected in twenty twenty\nYou don't think the Democrats have a candidate up their sleeve who can talk to those votes as they need to get back into the fold they do there are Democrats out there who can do that the problem is that if\nThe country stays on the track that it's on right now\nThe economy running flat out the accelerator\nDown unemployment getting less and less and less if that continues I\nDon't know who can I remember the um period of the Nineteen nineties when we had the sort of boom economy of the Nineteen nineties and there was real wage growth for a couple of years and Bill Clinton became incredibly popular you know like sixty Seventy percent approval ratings and this was this was when he was in the middle\nIn the process of being impeached you know it was it was the most incredible thing and I can't help but think that if you get that kind of economic situation again almost doesn't matter what the other side does that\nThe American that Thomas Frank on his new book Rome they've ... with
