scattered showers and thunderstorms\nSaturday and Sunday\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow for anyone having a baby the decision to have a C section is not unusual but what is unusual is the number of C sections happening all over the world listen to this to worldwide rate has nearly doubled from twelve to Twenty one percent\nIn the past Fifteen Years and in the United states one out of three per se is by C section now\nA series of studies in the journal the Lancet looked at this trend to see what is behind is uptick what are the effects on mothers and babies\nAnd what into vengeance can be done to decrease that number and that's what we're going to be talking about C section rapes globally also what's happening here in the U.S and my question for your listeners is did you or your partner you get a C. section\nWhat factored into that decision what was your experience like you can phone it in or you can tweet us our phone number eight for for seven to for eight to five five\nYou can tweet us at ... fry let me introduce my guest Holly Kennedy is an author author on that a Lancet series he's also professor of midwife midwifery\nAt the Yale School of nursing thank you for joining it to the alley Kennedy\nThank you uh tell us the Lancet series looked at a hundred and sixty nine countries in overall there is a rising C section rates can you give us some of the ...\nAh tell us alliances series looked at a hundred and sixty nine countries in overall there is a rising C section rate can you give us some of the numbers of different regions of must have buried around the world\n[noise] well it does and um what we found was that over sixty percent of countries overuse C sections and twenty five percent under use the the procedure so there's a quite a disparity and there are multiple reasons I'm part of it has to do with um\nThe um sort of socio cultural acceptance of surgery is enormous his um thing to do part of it has to do with um insurance and um access\nAnd a and a large part of it has to do with um women not being able to get a ... birth after they've had their first this area and so it's it's it's it's complicated we've seen the rise I'm\nIn a particularly in North America Western Europe Latin America and the Caribbean for example in Latin America it's gone from thirty two percent to forty four percent\nAnd um it it there's a bit of a paradox when what we would call 'em\nToo much too soon and too little too late so in the countries that overuse says area and they are probably intervening too much in low risk women that really don't need the procedure and in countries such as in Africa that um\nDon't have enough to access probably are under using it for the world Health Organization suggests that Fifteen Percent is about ... and about right so when you you think about one in three women in the United states having 'em as his area and we're way\nWas talking about over ... there's just to for example in Brazil Ninety percent of the women that go into a private hospital getting C sections are they are they requesting that before they go in\nFor example in Brazil Ninety percent of the women that go into a private hospital getting C sections are they are they requesting that before they go in what is the mechanism what happens there\nWell I Can't speak specifically to ... you know the the interaction but but you write women who are wealthier who have insurance are much more likely the majority of them will have a C. section and it's um it's an accepted norm of this part of the culture in in Brazil\nMhm are there are big differences within countries in China the rate ranges from what four percent sixty two percent depending on the problems [noise]\nExactly and again that has to do with access and a wealth education um interestingly enough I'm women that are have greater education are more likely to have this as area and and um which is a bit of a paradox in itself because\nI'm ... says area and is not a low risk um surgery it is it's a major surgery and and things are\nThere are small but serious risks are both with the immediate surgery and then later in terms of the scar and still birth and preterm birth leader and with um subsequent pregnancies and it's one small part of the piece of ... of the puzzle in the United states who are increasing maternal mortality rate\n... you mentioned that the in some places there's too much in some places not enough what are those not enough places like and\nThey're not enough places are places that don't have access in particularly in Africa and and countries that have lower resources so they just don't have the facilities to to do is his area and sometimes when a woman really needs it and I think it's important to stay in at the outside there are women\nWho and babies that that it is a life saving procedure but it's\nI think it's important to to stay in the ... there are women who and babies that that it is a life saving procedure but it it's not one that should be done for the majority of women\nI Want to focus on a little bit about what's happening here in the U.S and why she sections are increasing your Tony Golan it'd be\nVice chair of quality and the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center in Boston Welcome to science friday Dr going thank you for having oh let's let's talk about this um\n... there's also this idea of of planned C sections right the do the do you have to approach this do you have ... have you seen this in your experience\nIt's quite interesting I think there's a natural suspicion that this is a major contributor to the C section epidemic in the ... in the United states at this point and well it's true that a family's women can request to have the delivery of biases area and\nIt turns out that that's not really the most significant driver on in our experience at Beth Israel Deaconess for example which is\nA tertiary care institution academic hospital I'm In the middle of Boston I it really only contributes to about one percent of our deliveries per year\nSo while some of this could be attributed to patient opinions are patient desires or their perceptions of what safer\nUm the truth is is that I think that we as health care providers need to um realize that we are probably the major major contributors to the rise in there and delivery right here in the U.S\nWhen you say health care providers you're talking about the doctors who actually are performing and\n[noise] yeah uh so certainly the doctors the obstetricians um they're the ones who make the recommendation versus area and I'm at the end of the day um\nYeah uh so certainly the doctors the obstetricians um they're the ones who make a recommendation versus area and I'm at the end of the day on that who's responsible\nUm it's a complex environment to practice obstetrics there are other things that put pressure possibly on obstetricians um we had incomplete somewhat inaccurate data about health fetuses during labor that might contribute to our decision making\nOn the progress string labor in terms of the cervical dial Asian I is subjective so that can contribute to some inaccuracy\nThere's other things that happened on our unit that might put pressure on us other emergencies that might be happening on only Brent delivery unit that might put some pressure on us to make quicker decisions to move toward delivery\nBut at but at the end it's really our decision on as obstetricians to make that recommendation and generally speaking when we make a recommendation like that on patients and families do say yes um and they ask questions but they generally do say yes\nAnd a highly what's your reaction to\nAll I Would completely agree with her the the culture of the unit\nWhere a woman who's giving birth is very instrumental um there's a number of strategies we can do to promote of a first time mother having ... birth and but you have to have

G.\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we've been talking this hour about the increase in the number of C sections and what that means for women's health\nMy guests are Dr highly Kennedy professor of mid were free at the Yale School of nursing director Tony going vice chair of quality in a department of of obstetrics and gynecology at the famous Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center\nIn Boston and though lots lots of folks on on the line let's see we only uh gosh can't get everybody let me ask you how you you worked in research midwifery in the u._k. how does the approach there compared to what we do here in the U.S [noise]\nWell it it it deters in several ways and actually when the land is slanted series on C. section came out that Debbie World Health organization also issued new guidelines to help help on us look at decreasing says ... and and one of the things that they had recommended\nSo issued new guidelines to help help us look at decreasing says Erin's and and one of the things that they have recommended is what the UK does which is to have\nA collaborative midwife obstetrician model of care where the midwife\nDoes most of the primary care and that's what happens in the u._k. all women have a midwife and some women have an obstetrician too when it's when it's really needed\nIn the Lancet also published a series on midway free very extensive review of the evidence and they found that ... was a a sociology with improved outcomes increasing including decreasing C sections until one what I'd like to just mention is in the United states\nThat study came out this earlier this year that mapped\nThe integration of mid we're free across each state to see how ... how friendly the state was in a regulation um and reimbursement independent practice to midwifery practice and so if you look at the at New Mexico which has the lowest sea section rate of of just about Eighteen percent\nTwenty six percent adverse are attended by midwives in that state\nConversely with New Jersey has the highest rate of thirty three percent and only seven percent adverse are attended by midwives\nAnd then they met that with outcomes and uh if you look at Alabama Alabama has some of the worst maternal and infant outcomes in the country and only one percent of births are attended by midwives so that's not a causation it as an association type study\nBut it is paused for thought and that is what we saw in the u._k. is that um when you have a model of care when when women have access to continuity of care with their midwife midwifery knows then they feel respected um you have better outcomes\nA tornado when you work to drive down the rate down at your hospital dealing after a decade went from forty\nRespected um you have better outcomes\nOh Tony go when you work to drive down the rate down at your hospital dealing it for a decade went from forty to twenty nine percent in a in a decade what did you do there\nWell first we recognize that we had a problem and I think that's step one and trying to solve it and then we looked toward the evidence I'm not just our own evidence but the national evidence about what was contributing\nTo mostly and ... mostly in terms of the indications forces areas and focus very narrowly on primary says area and a first looked at the interpretation of how we monitor fetuses um while women are and labor\nThat kind of monitoring called fetal heartbeat monitoring is very tricky\nIt's quite inaccurate and it predicts quite well for us when babies are well but does not do a good job of telling us when babies are on well\nAnd nonetheless obstetricians base decisions on this test um I often say that and no other area in medicine would we make surgical decisions based on such a such a faulty test\nNonetheless it's ubiquitous and people use feel heart rate monitoring so we focused on really trying to focus on describing the fetal heart rate chasing using science and objective criteria rather than subjective words um we focused on our documentation our communication\nWe also really try to make sure that people were using scientific modern definitions for progress in labor\nA old definitions were assumed that women would move much faster and labor than newer more modern data really proved to us we want it to make sure that people use modern definitions for what we thought was normal labor\nAs I mentioned earlier we focused on improving access on and uh and I'm enthusiasm for ... back and then also some other operate\nAs I mentioned earlier we focused on improving access on and uh and I'm enthusiastic for be back and then also some other operations issues for our unit to change the culture of our unit\nFor misspoke here at the Beth Israel and I said you if you were only from so blown down here in Boston and so does this all mean that a fair to the hospital you go to determines more or less if you'll have a C section or not\nUnfortunately it does a and so I one of the reasons why we know that we have room to improve on Syrian delivery rates is that if you look from one hospital to the next event separated by one or two miles from one another\nWho take care of patients who have similar medical problems are of similar demographics\nThere's is there an delivery rates may vary by as much as ten percent\nThis is unexplainable by any other reason other than the environment the unit that you work in the people that you work with and the general enthusiasm for ... birth\nOr we have a tweeter vets relevant to this and services I have to wonder how much of the increase has to do with how much money insurance companies make on them versus a typical delivery did did you study that in your your your report Holly\nWill or not specifically except that it is the recommendation is that the financial strategies women who are having more money or where wealthier\nWe'll have more C sections so which implies that\nUm they can get reimbursed for that and one of the recommendations that the series made was to not pay more for this area and to really\nUm level that playing field in in any in addition to liability reform um many in studies that I've conducted obstetricians have said to me you know I won't get sued if I Do a C. section but\nTo liability reform um mini in studies that I've conducted obstetricians have said to me you know I won't get sued if I Do a C. section but all I can get sued if I don't do one in in time or perceived to be in time [noise]\nMhm ... you're you're ... the main issue of reimbursement as is interesting here in the U.S a where by and large physicians are obstetricians do not get a a vastly different amount of money for ... delivery than necessary and delivery however the hospital does\nAnd that is something that I think isn't quite transparent for patients I'm and probably reimbursement itself\nDoesn't influence a lot of obstetrician decision making here and the U.S a reimbursement is greater but it really goes more toward the hospital side because of the length of stay let's go to Sharon in Somerville mass harsher\nHigh um I've had two C sections and um they were mandated by the doctor due to complications from Crohn's disease and so I I really appreciate this nuance discussion but I just wanted to get a perspective of how this is actually playing out I'm\nAmong laypeople and patience and um I think a lot of the talk about this has become very anti woman um when I told people that I was having a plan C section\nDue to my chronic illness complications I had male friends saying things like well are you sure you don't want to just labor for a little bit maybe you could just ask if you could labor for a little bit and I really interpreted that kind of as questioning you know can I be a woman if I don't you know pushed the baby out ...\nAnd and that was really upsetting to me because my two beautiful daughters wouldn't be here if the C sections were not available to me\nAnd I you know I think um I just think it's really important for those at the academics\nTwo beautiful daughters wouldn't be here if the C sections are not available to me and I you know I think um I just think it's really important for those at the academic and and provider levels to understand that that people are hearing these discussions\nAnd I think taking them and sort of inappropriate um in different directions slides I'd love to hear the response\nOr I got about a minute or Tony are only would I Would I Would completely agree with you that one of the most important things in this in this conversation is for the provider and the woman to talk through what is important to her\nAnd and so that she can make an informed decision about the best strategy for her so it it is I Would completely agree that it's important that\nYou have that conversation and and the risks and benefits of both ... birth to Syrian or fully ... fully discuss I'm Antonia what about this the charge of sexism here\nPoint well taken I think you know any extreme is going to be dangerous I think it is important to realize that regardless of how a baby is born\nI'm the person who gives birth to the baby becomes a parent's uh after that happens on its know lesser no more ... regardless of what the motives delivery ... delivery on certainly makes you just as much as the mother on as having a vegetable every\nSupport for gay and

get into this stuff music and combined with electronic\nOkay easy story there and my mother is from a family of musicians and my father was an electronic engineer and I came out like this uh [noise] you were\nBorn with a soldering iron and keyboard and the other hand um let's talk about music and technology are specifically piano roles which inspired your latest project\nAnd you brought this machine here tonight the echo load Ian right\nThat's what I'm calling it you know how we're going to hear from it a little bit later but first what he does\nWell this is a ... a few I don't know what

they are in their own vital parts of our ecosystem weather is food or pollinators are predators and they have another thing in common complex social behavior I think about the term hive mind right\nThis idea that all the individuals in a group are working together to keep each other alive in this crazy world\nBut how well does that actually work out what factors make a colony more or less successful and can individual behavior still pills the hand of fate for the whole group\nOr the hives indeed the legion my next guest looked at these questions how his word is an associate professor at UC Riverside studying the lives of bumblebees and know a pitcher woman is an associate professor at UCLA\nLooking at these social behavior of these ants and even spider [noise]\n\nSecond what did you know I if you ask everybody you they'll tell you that honeybees get all the attention right now but you gravitated to bumble bee why was\nMy did my PHD in a honeybee lab\nAnd then I went round and worked on bumblebees instead I started a PHD in two thousand sex which is the year that the honeybee genome sequenced and when it we sequence we suddenly had this tool kit\nThese instead I started a PHD in two thousand six which is the year that the honeybee genome sequenced and when it we sequence we suddenly had this tool kit that we could use to answer all kinds of really cool molecular questions and honeybees and so I started fell in love with bumblebees and wanted to develop something similar for them\nAnd compared to only these bumblebees have a very different like circle right out of the colonies gets dark\nFirst honeybees there what we call perennially social so they're always social um there's never a point in their lives in the life of a hobby queen\nOr she's living on her own bumblebees are different um they have an annually social life cycle where queens in the late summer season new queens will emerge in the colony and these queens will leave the nest on their own and they'll go off and mate and they over winter all completely on their own\nAnd then in the spring I these queens have to crawl out of there over wintering spot and start their own nests so they're spending most of their life living on their own and so even though there are social insects and they have queens and workers\nAnd the sort of complex social behavior they're also in a sense living like solitary insects are part of their life cycle to\nBroadway show us with ...\nI did yeah you'll notice from the get go that it looks a lot different than a honeybee nests it's really interesting because I'm to the best of our knowledge honeybees and bumblebees actually share a common origin of sociology so we think that\nThe ancestor to both of these groups they shared an ancestor about a hundred million years ago and we think that that ancestor was social but since that time you know a lot can happen in a hundred million years and so they've all these differences and today they look really different the way they nest away that they live\nTo patrol Ming a meanwhile honeybees are extremely social all the time right yes they are and we tend to confuse the two kinds of bees was having equals lifestyles all the time\nDream we social all the time right yes they are and we turned to confuse the two kinds of bees was having equals lifestyles all the time we really well to be to be\nRight well I consider honeybees is a ... and swings my lab actually studies ants um we do a little bit of work on honeybees but mostly focused and the ants and so some of our work on honeybees is looking at how they forge and how different individuals in the colony contribute to forging ... home\nYou're brought from ants were too jarring Jarvis\nHarvest France from I'm here in California oh it's like for partially on the sidewalk ... slightly larger than what we are a little bit longer there but yeah and they score sheet and the ones you see on the sidewalk and ... why are you interested in the cities\nArea and the blacks are the true ... and and the nice thing about this this particular species is that they tend to move between nest sites\nSo a colony of five to ten thousand individuals will just when they decide to pick up and move from one site to another\nUm and it turns out that the structure of the nest it determines how quickly they for it and how quickly they call their friends to food so another thing I brought here as a cast ... flip it over I was on its head\nOh so it was like that that's a cast of a an ad Smith yes you is that like pouring plaster Paris\nIt's exactly fast their players from Home Depot how far does that go down and just the whole life I Know that's just the top part\nAbout six or eight inches long it looks from just describing for audience but it could go much deeper than that\nSo you can pour down other materials we did one ... um which is a type of metal that when you heat it up like water and so it slows down much deeper and then when it's heartening that's easier to dig around and it won't break like the plaster and so we can see that it's ...\nThat's like water and sewage slows down much deeper and then when it's hard to it's easier to dig around and break the plaster and so we can see that it goes much much deeper probably a few feet down and it depends on the environment to so and then my mentor I said he's the these there's a lot of ... that determines how they can go\nTo our house there's so much focus on queen bumble bee what about the drones and the workers can they make a difference in whether a colony succeed\nNot the drones so that the Germans don't do too much for the colony itself they don't do much work um but the workers are definitely important to you we're focusing mostly on queens in my lab because they have this part of their life or they're living on their own and\nWe've done a few studies now that show that cleans are actually very sensitive during that stage uh so it's important to point to to study\nSomething that ... that when I was reading about this and we are those really amazing is that when we talk about honeybees we know that to make a queen or what something called royal jelly but that's not what the bumblebees do we how do you make a queen\nWell for the most part we don't know I guess what we do know is that it looks we know what happens during larval development so just like in honeybees and there's a some point\nDuring really early larval development where a female larva she can start becoming a cleaner worker and if you think about the implications for that and what will happen to her and what she might do in her life is completely different depending on this one or the other search trajectory\nUm and we know it has something to do with food and buy movies we know that it's something that they're they're either getting more food or they're getting more food at a very specific point uh but we think that there are probably also factors in regard to just like there are and honeybees and bumblebees and people just have to look for them yet\nInteresting lots of questions from the audience let's start right or were there on the right side yes go ahead please\n... and people just haven't looked for them yet well interesting lots of questions from your own and foot start right or were there on the right side yes go ahead please\nUm my um my mom is\nAllergic to me I was wondering if there was any way that you could dish extracted DNA from the bees and use it to 'em\nLike helped her heal her when she gets style that is a great question I'm allergic to bees to\nBack that up first or do you work with ... and you're allergic so I'm allergic to honeybee okay but not by movies um that's\nA really great question so the the things that are in the venom that caused the terrible reaction on that your mom would get if she were somebody being me to\nUm those a lot of those components are encoded by the genome of the bees and so if we sequence it and we learn more about what those factors are and they how they trigger an immune response I that there are researchers working on that to try to figure out how we can understand how the two things the immune system and the human and the victim and the B interact\nInteresting ... requests yeah great question uh no longer answer also live in big groups with the queen Howard their lives different from something like a honeybee\nThere's a lot of species and so there's different types of sociology and um there's some similarities and differences in first of all many of them live underground ... will and\nPut their hives and say the same three cavities\nAnd so that's one difference for example um they're interesting similarities for example the honeybees in some species offense will relocate from one to say to another so honeybees will\nGo and look for a new nest site and can the way the shape of the entrance of the cavity did they find in the side of the cavity will determine whether or not they're going to go there and certain other ants will off there's a species of ... that will look for certain privacy is that again have small entrances and dark places are there some somebody's in some differences I think the\nAnd that will look for certain privacy is that again have small entrances and dark places are there are some similarities in some differences\nI think the sizes and one thing there is some species that have the colonies that are only up to you know fifty or a hundred and then there's some that are thousands tens of thousands and even up to ... million so the leaf cutter calling it can be I have two million individuals\nAnd just in time for Halloween I Know that you also started his social spider borders social spider\nSo upset about more than forty thousand species of spider is only about forty species are so our social um and what happens is they are living groups and the reason we think they leave in living these groups is so that they can capture pray that is larger than them and so they offered lead build these\nFunding for K.

Paul associate professor of integrative biology\nOne of these genes in a surprising place nowhere near the brain welcome back to ... Paul associate professor of integrative biology and physiology at the University of California Los Angeles [noise]\n\nIs that right you need to get seven hours of sleep a night that's what the usual requirement is yes\nFor um the majority of long term studies that have looked have found that if you get significantly less or significantly more than seven to a point five hours a night than that doesn't work out well for you in\nTime in a lot of trouble yeah 'cause I get like six if I'm lucky I get seven I Know someone who gets two hours a night and seems to be doing fine with that but you're saying that that\nWell that is not going to end in all honesty I'm In a six hour crowd myself why do we need to sleep and the first place that's one of the biggest questions actually is why it was one of the reasons I have a job actually what we do know is bad if you don't sleep adequately\nBad it impairs your health so they're kind of two categories of consequences if you're not getting sufficient sleep every day the first are where we can sort of short term\nSo many of you may stay up tonight after you leave here you may go hang out to a party or you just made me up with the kids not getting enough sleep tomorrow\nYour memory may not work as well you may have a harder time focusing on things you may make more errors when you try to do things that you normally do those tend to be um cognitive affects there are more longer term effects if you continue Bailey on a regular basis\nNot getting enough sleep than their health consequences I'm it impairs your immune system which makes you at a higher risk\nBasis not getting enough sleep than their health consequences I'm it impairs your immune system which makes you at a higher risk for infectious diseases and it also increases your risk for chronic diseases like heart disease stroke and diabetes\nAnd I mentioned about genetics and sleep what what is there about genes are they involved in sleeping\nAnd interestingly enough I think our genes are pretty much involved in everything we do uh what what does it what about sleep\nWhat our genes control would it be the hour the than the number of hours of the quality what what one of the genes\nDoing that's what we're trying to figure out um the interesting thing when you're talking about genes as you're not just talking about how genes are expressed but you're talking about how they interact with the environment\nSo I was like to point out the study of genetics is the study of genes and their expression but also the study of the environment if you want to understand how genes work then it's a pretty smart idea to try to understand how the environment works I'm from a kind of line of research that has shown that genes play an important role in timing sleep\nUm be at a time of day you prefer to sleep at the time of day you prefer to wake up but they also play an important role in consolidating sleep um we're awake most of the day recently most of the night on what we're trying to understand our what genes are responsible for the restored if properties asleep\nThe things about sleep that preserve your memory and your ability to focus\nAnd the things about sleep that improve your health\nThe genes that regulate these aspects of sleep are still largely unknown and that's what my research is focused on\nNow what fascinated me about reading about your research also was that these genes that help with our control sleep or not in our brains they're not in our heads\nWell they're everywhere yeah um what they're expressed in the brain they're expressed in the ...\nAre not in our brains they're not in our heads\nWell they're everywhere yeah um what they're expressed in the brain they're expressed in the body\nThe gene that I focused on in my most recent study be on one has expressed in the majority of tissues in which\nWe have analyzed so be my one is what's known as a clot seem you have clocks in every selling your body very real clocks in order for\nSomething to be characterized as the clock there has to be an input mechanism to set it it has to be an ... and the timing mechanism like gears I talked to my students about gives on the clock most of them don't know the clock is er [laughter]\nSo I talk about their electronic mechanism in their phones that keep time it is an output mechanism that allows you to tell the time the majority of cells in your body have these clocks and we know that these clocks regulates sleep\nFor a long time we've been very interested in how these clocks of regulated sleep till we've looked primarily in the brain because the clock that regulates most of your behaviors in the brain\nAnd most of the things that drivers sleep or in the brain but what we found quite surprisingly was that the clocks in the skeletal muscle\nCan speak to sleep regulatory areas in the brain and tell your brain how to sleep more importantly how to recover from sleep loss\nAnd what do you mean how to recover so the mechanism we study asleep homeostasis it kind of works like a thermostat if you set a thermostat to a certain temperature if it goes too low a turn the heat on your terms that's how the hit on the goes too high a thermostat turns the air on\nYour sleep processing works similar there's a certain amount of sleep that you need to function correctly every day if you don't get enough sleep your body will try to compensate by having usually more if you get too much sleep it will go and the other direction the clock is the same as the clock on your thermostat in the morning it's set to go to one temperature\nIn the evening it says to go to another and works the same way in our bodies in the morning your clock tells you\nSame as the clock on your thermostat in the morning it's set to go to one temperature in the evening it says to go to another it works the same way in our bodies in the morning your clock tells you to wake up in the evening your clock tells you to go to sleep\nOn for a long time we suspected that the clock mechanisms are more involved\nIn the ... mechanisms that allow you to recover from sleep loss and what we're finding in my research and the research of many that have come before me is that the genes that are as like the gears on the clock the genes that are responsible for timing\nAlso play a role in your ability to recover from now so when you say\nThe clock is that the the circadian rhythm we've been talking about\nThe circadian clock that regulates your daily rhythms of behavior and physiology so we have a twenty four hour light dark cycle sun comes up in the morning goes down it might um synchronize are clock but if you were in a consistent lighting environment constant darkness\nI'm a constant light than clock will still continue to isolate\nIt hasn't been dodging Tommy mechanism and it would isolate at a period or frequency close to twenty four hours Russian overhear yes I had a question about napping as I'm getting older I'm discovering that are really cool thing to have an ... [noise]\nHow might that play with the a clock that you're speaking\nSo napping as it is a very interesting phenomenon big fan of it by the way they win by ... an hour and I do have one of the great things about being a sleep researcher as if I take a nap in my office in the afternoon and no one can complain you can write at all I mean I Know what I'm doing research [laughter]\nBut you're saying napping is important is the mapping is very important if you're not getting daily sufficiently and most of us to have children or have jobs or live in a busy environment may not beginning um sufficient sleep so if you're not then getting an afternoon nap\nMost of us to have children or have jobs or live in a busy environment may not beginning um sufficient sleep so if you're not than getting an afternoon nap an hour's usually was about recommended but everything from a half hour to an hour is healthy however you if you are getting sufficient sleep and you're still napping\nThat goes into hypersomnia which is like I said getting sleep too much much that suggests that there may be an issue however in relation to the clock my lab is currently conducting studies to determine if the ideal time for napping is driven by clock mechanism\nUm especially those of us that get sleepy or the afternoons\nSometimes between one of the three which is currently the same time of course I'm teaching right now\nOh gosh I have to be pretty animated when I'm teaching\nBut you can't blame them either exactly right that's why I don't try to understand but that's just me let me go to the questions on this uh yes\nHi my question is about the adolescent brain and sleep ah ever since I was in high school we were talking about shifting the start time for high schoolers to be later in the", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "19"}
