the Nobel Prize in chemistry um [noise] ... you know a lot of people think you're a scientist but you were very proud of engineer are you not\nI Am tell us what the differences well I Love\nTo build things and I can make new things that didn't exist before of course chemists do that as well they build new molecules so we're we're blending together chemistry and engineering in evolution of new proteins\nHow do you build that I was watching it to a Ted Talk you gave it was quite fascinating and you talked about being able to sit down at a keyboard and type out a recipe for some form of new genetic smell it out and and what a new gene comes back to you\nWhat the differences well I Love to build things I'd like to make new things that didn't exist before of course chemists do that as well they build new molecules so we're we're blending together chemistry and engineering in evolution of new proteins\nHow do you build that I was watching a to a Ted Talk you gave it was quite fascinating and you talked about being able to sit down at a keyboard and type out a recipe for some form of new genetic smell it out and and what a new gene comes back to you\n[laughter] yeah it's it's really amazing has changed so much and the thirty years that I've been doing this\nSo that today you really can't type out a DNA sequence now whether it's a recipe is a different story and we can talk about that but you can type out a DNA sequence email it off to your favorite supplier of DNA and they will send you back in the mail that DNA\nYou you're saying that talk that I I Want to write new DNA what does that mean to you\nActually it's easy to write and you know DNA what's hard is composing it you'd think about it DNA is the code of life it's the product of almost four billion years of evolution\nWe don't know how to compose new DNA we can ride it we can read it we can edited but we don't know how to compose it how do you compose something codes of of a complex biological function that didn't exist before\nSo if you if you ... what is the problem in the composition why can't you compose\nWe don't understand how DNA encodes function remember biology molecular biology is a brand new discipline it's been around the the structure of DNA was published in Nineteen fifty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynthesize DNA and put it in a test tube I can go direct the DNA and\nCombined DNA from different sources different species I can dial in levels of random mutations that can direct negotiations so I have control over the underlying DNA diversity and then I decide who goes on to parent the next generation\nAnd then how do you get a useful product that I'm that what's the next step [noise]\nSo you put the DNA into a microbe and they start reading it as if it were their own and are they in they then take the DNA and create the proteins that the DNA encodes\nThan I as the breeder of molecules so to speak I have to decide who is better than what I started with\nWhich one of those microbes makes a bitter protein and that's called good old fashioned analytical chemistry so are you um take the DNA out of that and feed it back and I do it all over again\nIt is it's sort of creating life in that cell is a new you're creating a new form of life or you're not [noise]\nWell I think that's probably exaggerating because life was there for me to work with were using the tools of biology to make new things I'm making new proteins they're not alive but they do do some things inside of cells but\nYou do you need the cell to help you make the ... [noise]\nWell actually so you don't have to have the cell there is now very powerful systems where he can do everything from DNA to protein inside of a test to with no cells at all\n... and so uh where do you rent truly see this research going what is what is your ultimate goal here\nI run my ultimate goal is to allow human\nTeams they're not alive but they do do some things inside of cells\nBut you do you need the cell to help you make the ... [noise]\nWell actually so [noise] you don't have to have the self there's now very powerful systems where he can do everything from DNA to protein inside of a test tube with no cells at all\n... and so uh where do you bring to really see this research going what is what is your ultimate goal here\nI run my ultimate goal is to allow human beings to use the power of biology the power of biology to do chemistry to make molecules to make materials to make\nTherapeutic agents and an end pharmaceuticals and and basically all the things when we need in our daily lives from renewable resources without producing excess waste\n... I saw on you talked to said I have fun for us we molecules to have sex\nOh yes [laughter] I Do [laughter] [laughter] well if you think about sex you have to wonder why nature would devise such a a a strange process and have all these half the population that doesn't carry the next generation\nSo there has to be some benefit to re combining your DNA with somebody else\nAnd that benefit is the innovation that comes around\nIf you we combined DNA you get progeny\nRe combined DNA dieting coach something novel\n... she would get a phone call or two before we have to go let's go to ... Adrian and Hamdan I imagine\nThere who are gone and hand on um [noise] I grew up in Southeast Asia where my parents my cousin's everyone around me were just starting out their math or engineering my son who\nYour DNA with somebody else's and that benefit is the innovation that comes around if you read combined DNA you get progeny we combined DNA betting coach something novel\n... she would get a phone call or two before we have to go let's go to an Adrian and Hamdan I Adrian\nHi this is a non and hand that um [noise] I grew up in Southeast Asia where my parents my cousin's everyone around me were just starting out their math or engineering my son who is about two and a half years old\nWhat I'm trying to figure out how to identify his mind said whether it be towards chemistry sports um math so may not be completely irrelevant question but I Would love to hear your thoughts on this subject how to identify your kids\nOr younger generations um your skill sets that they can go towards chemistry or science physics\n[noise] did you know did you know what an early age that colonel that you want to go I I\nI was lucky my father was a nuclear physicist and he always thought the girls could do math just as well as boys could so he never discourage me and I also had four brothers to compete with\nAnd I like being the winner [laughter] so I had a father who encouraged my natural tendency never discouraged it and had plenty of people to compete with\nWell you know I hear this from so many scientists we've talked to over the years that they had a role model a mentor somebody could even be their parents who kept them or you know kept alive ... encourage their interest in science same thing for you it seems\nIt seems so and I miss my father he passed away two years ago but he would have loved this news\n... I'm a ... and he's the right to add to to answer the listener's call is there any way to identify\nEncouraged my natural tendency never discouraged it and had plenty of people to compete with\nWell you know I hear this from so many scientists we've talked to over the years that they had a role model mentor somebody could even be their parents who kept them or kept alive or encourage their interest in science same thing for you it seems\nIt seems so and I miss my father he passed away two years ago but he would have loved this news\nMhm I'm a ... and he's the right to add to to answer the listener's call is there any way to identify any young age was talented in science\nI think all children are talented and if they love it they will ask questions they will do it I think the most important thing is not to discourage someone ...\nHave a tweet from Sydney who says\nPlease ask what she knows about how instinct is encoded in DNA example dogs urge to bury things\n[laughter] I Wish

change your mind about something some some listeners are phoning in and first one Alex's from Chicago hey Olin neighbor\n[noise] hey Sallie they're either in go ahead so odd\nBy previously identified myself as a an aspiring feminist\nUm and I had done so because my logic was that I really couldn't fully empathize with some of the issues that women face I'm at the mail um and I was met with that logic from a coworker of mine who um had said you know\nHow it's as a black male\nYou know you might be doing things that contribute to I'm white supremacist systems that you might do so knowingly or unknowingly but that doesn't necessarily make you no longer a an African American male in the same way\nUm women or being a man who contributes suicide journalistic systems unknowingly\nWasn't necessarily make me I'm unable to to identify as feminists um it would just mean that I have to do more to aspire to um to contribute to feminist systems and so I'm being able to see the fact that you know I can still be a male male experiences while existing ...\nI'm In identifying myself in such a way it really changed my mind\nI'm In the thought about that that's great thanks for calling that is great that very heartening\nHe's he's you know as part of the problems that we don't see how we are there see yes\nI think that is part of the problem but I think a big problem is\nThat we often spend cheat on trying to defend our end points of view instead of trying to understand somebody else's points of view and we often focus on trying to change someone else's mind instead of trying to see that point of view and see what it's believed that he is and one thing I found very interesting in that the coolest experience is that\nI thought about that that's great thanks for calling that is great that very heartening\nIs you know as part of the problem was that we don't see how we others see us\nI think that is part of the problem but I think a big problem is\nThat we often spend you know trying to defend our own points of view instead of trying to understand somebody else's points of view and we often focus on trying to change someone else's mind instead of trying to see that point of view and see what it's believed that he is and one thing I found very interesting in that the call has experience is that\nIt was a great example of using some abstract structure to tap into the person's own experiences\nSo in a way I think the logic was used very cleverly using emotions as well to say let's find an analogous situation that this person will understand from their own experiences and then hope that they can translate that\nTo somebody else's analogous experience\nI have a tweet from James who says to me logical discussions doe requirement he requires empathy empathy is caring enough to respect and their their view and listen to it is that emotional I don't know\nI agree I think the logic does not require math but logic is in a way pauses math\nThese things have poorest boundaries I mean we've constructed a lot of us official boundaries between subjects the bureaucratic purposes but I Am a mathematician and from my point of view because I Am so deeply steeped in the discipline of mathematics I find that the full discipline of mathematics helps me\nWith logic in the real world I'm not saying that you have to be a mathematician in order to use logic and that's a good thing because I think everybody can use loaded whether they're a mathematician or not\nWe'll talk about some some er current events or let's turn out to the artist topic and current events and that is voters and Congress are divided over whether to believe accusation\nTwin subjects the bureaucratic purposes\nBut I Am a mathematician and from my point of view because I Am so deeply steeped in the discipline of mathematics I find that the full discipline of mathematics helps me with logic in the real world I'm not saying that you have to be a mathematician\nIn order to use logic and that's a good thing because I think everybody can use logic whether they're a mathematician or not\nWe'll talk about some some of the current events or it's turned out to the oddest topic and current events and that is voters and Congress are divided over whether to believe\nAccusations of sexual assault a good show a judge Brett Kavanaugh and whether that should affect his confirmation to the Supreme Court and you write than in terms of how people respond to stories about sexual assault there are a number of different logical process as at plagues tell me what you mean by that\nThat's a whole other our whole lot of different\nParts of this argument that we can analyze starting with what we mentioned before about Rome definitions because most of the people claim to the principle of the presumption of innocence and the thing about the presumption of innocence I think is that it's technically for court cases and criminal trials\nAnd it's something that gets bandied around as a general principle but it's really a very specific principal and similarly the idea of freedom of speech is often bandied around as a general principle when in fact that's just about whether you can be in prison for saying certain things\nSo going on from the presumption of innocence\nThere is a paradox because some people say well we have to presume ... someone innocence until that until that proved guilty and the thing is that if you have an accuser\nAnd an accused Boston or let's just say the accuser is a woman and the accused person is a man then what about the fact that we should also presumed a woman to be innocent until she has proved guilty of a false accusation and so then we have a ... because we can't actually hold the man I'm the woman both innocent at the same time because that ...\nJust about whether you can be in prison for saying certain things\nSo going on from the presumption of innocence\nThere is a paradox because some people say well we have to presume ... someone innocence until that until that proved guilty\nAnd the thing is that if you have an accuser\nAnd an accused Boston or let's just say the accuser is a woman and the accused person is a man then what about the fact that we should also presumed a woman to be innocent until she has proved guilty of a false accusation and so then we have a paradox because we can't actually hold the man I'm the woman both innocent at the same time because that causes a contradiction\nAnd mathematics and civil Sufi have studied paradoxes for a long time and studied ways to resolve paradoxes by shifting levels are finding that things are to a different level and the thing is I think that we we can start with the axiom of\nPresuming the accused person to be innocent and then we can look up ... will that creates for us and what mathematics does all the time and it starts with some basic assumptions and builds a logical will run out and then we look at that world and good what do we think of this world\nAnd so we can look at the world that we've created by presuming accused people to the innocence until proven guilty and I think what we should see is that we've created a world in which people know that they can get away with sexual assault because there is almost never actual evidence that can prove that it happened\nAnd if they know that they can get away with it that means that they will do it more and so we've ended up in a culture where sexual assault can it can happen does happen on happens all over the place because people know that they can get away with it so then the question is do we care about that\nAnd that becomes a question of false positives and false negatives so do we care that so many people are getting away with sexual assault all we more afraid of what some people are worried about which is that that will be false accusations and innocent men will be have their lives destroyed by a false accusation\nAnd and if they know that they can get away with it that means that they will do it more and so we've ended up in a culture where sexual assault can it can happen does happen I'm happens all over the place because people know that they can get away with it so then the question is do we care about that\nAnd that becomes a question of false positives and false negatives so do we care that so many people are getting away with sexual assault all we more afraid of what some people are worried about which is that that will be false accusations and innocent men will be have their lives destroyed by a false accusation so\nHaving a false accusation um would be when somebody is innocent but is thoughts is accused of being guilty and the other way is when somebody is guilty but ... isn't proved to be guilty and so it left off\nAnd that's really about whether you were prioritizing the plight of victims of sexual assault or the the potential innocence of men and we have to have a discussion about that and about the fact that we have some help prioritizing the the men who might be accused\nWere prioritizing them over the thousands and millions of women who are suffering sexual assault over time and so the question is are we going to do anything about that\nSo and then ... them is a a question of black and white thinking\nAnd this happens a lot where people get into arguments in extremes on so many of our arguments at the moment ton divisive because we take extreme opposite positions instead of something more moderate in between I'm so there is a an argument's around saying something like um you\nAre making everyone into a rapist or watch one that professor land but said on his book that that we are ... just spin the bottle crimes as rape and that's taking a very black and white view of thinking that we're calling all forms of sexual assault and harassment right\nPeople get into arguments in extremes on so many of our arguments at the moment on divisive because we take extreme opposite positions instead of something more moderate in between\nI'm so there is a an argument's around saying something like um you are making everyone into a rapist or ... one that professor lung but said on his book that that we are ... just spin the bottle crimes as rape\nAnd that's taking a very black and white view of thinking that we're calling all forms of sexual assault and harassment rape which is not what is happening there is a scale that are all things that are as bad as rape and there are other things that are bad but perhaps not as bad as rape\nWhich comes takes us to the issue of false equivalence is and straw puffing arguments where you can take that false equivalence and then you can declare it while you're saying everyone has a rapist which is not what people are saying\nOr your ... some people say you're saying any woman should be able to destroy the life of any mind just by accusing him of sexual assault which again is a very extreme position that I don't think that anyone really is taking\nAnd finally um that's the question of knowledge and alternate hypotheses which comes up in scientific testing law where you have to decide what you'll default position is and then to say you say in the absence of further evidence I'm going to take this default position and I'm going to wait until I found enough evidence to change my mind\n[noise] in the Nineteen hundreds the ingredient

off instruments like Kepler and the Newark test had been racking up the planet count but this week astronomers writing in the journal science advances\nBrought the whole thing to a new level describing the possible discovery not have an exoplanet but at the moon orbiting an exoplanet to be specific\nKepler sixteen dashed twenty five ... be and his some four thousand light years away has to do that well joining me now to talk about the research is Alex T cheese and antiseptic graduate research fellow and the department of astronomy right here in New York at Columbia University welcome to science friday\nThank you very much for having me first what what moon is this where it give us a little thumbnail description sure yeah so\nIt's a a moon as far as we can tell if we're not quite claiming it as a discovery yet there's still some lingering uncertainty but as far as we can tell it's there are a large moon about the size of Neptune actually which is sort of strange um orbiting this plant called Kepler sixteen twenty five be and it's about eight thousand light years away as far as we can do\nSo but so what is the relationship with the size of the moon to the size of the plants\nSo the size of the planet is ah about the same size as Jupiter it's a little more massive as far as we can tell a and then the moon is uh like I say about the size and the mass of net\nBut even at a pretty unusual well known that big well it certainly unexpected right where if\nThe moon's in our solar system ah we've got a lot of them are they're all ... significantly smaller than the earth so uh when we spotted this we said to you know this is what it looks like about the size of Neptune that are sort of a raises new questions for people how how do you get something that big it's a little prima ...\nThe size of the planet is ah by the same size as Jupiter it's a little more massive as far as we can tell\nA and then the moon is uh like I say about the size and the mass of net but even at a pretty unusual well known that big a well it's certainly unexpected right where if you look at the moon's in our solar system ah we've got a lot of them are they're all ... significantly smaller than New York so\nUh when we spotted this we said to you know this is what it looks like about the size of Neptune\nThat are sort of a raises new questions for people how how do you get something that big it's a little premature to say how common are how rare something like this might be because ah this is potentially the first so we don't have any sort of population statistics on these things\nAh but ah you know you could argue that because it is the largest you know because it is so large a it's sort of the lowest hanging fruit so maybe it's not entirely surprising that the first one we see is so large\nYou know because we think of our moon we think of another body hitting earth and knocking out a peace it doesn't look like that in this case uh yeah\nIt's funny you know there's so there's basically three mechanisms that we think we get the moon's from an impact or scenario like how we got earth's moon ah moons coalescing out of a disk of material swirling around the planet in the early days of the planetary system like the way we get the moons of Jupiter and Saturn Uranus\nAnd then finally a capture scenario like a Neptune largest moon Tritan as far as we can tell that was captured from the ...\nSo uh that this is sort of the first question that everybody thought of when when we announced this large moon how do you get something like that it's not necessarily a ruled out by known mechanisms but it certainly has the the theory scratching their heads or\nBut yeah and we like it when they scratch [laughter] how do you do how do you detect a moon I Know the theory but that detecting the exoplanet is that what you tell us how\nYeah so ah there's a variety of ways to go about looking for\nScenario like a Neptune largest moon Tritan as far as we can tell that was captured from the ... [noise] so uh that this is sort of the first question that everybody thought of when when we announced this large moon how do you get something like that it's not necessarily a ruled out by known mechanisms but it certainly has the the theory scratching their heads or\nBut yeah and we like it when they scratch [laughter] how do you do how do you detect a moon I Know the theory but that detecting the exoplanet is that what you tell us how\nSure yeah so ah there's a variety of ways to go about looking for planets but the the most popular the most successful way so far\nIs using this thing called the transit method when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view it blocks out just a little bit of the starlight that we're observing so if you're monitoring the brightness of the star over time you see a little bit in the intensity of the store like\nIf there's a moon around that planet than we would expect a big dip from the planet and then a smaller dip as the moon blocks on some of the light as well in addition to that uh we try to see the gravitational influence of the moon on the planet the planning of course is pulling on the moon but the moon is pulling on the planet\nAnd so that makes the planet ... around a bit as it as it orbits the star and so sometimes that planetary transit comes in early other time it comes in late\nAnd so those are really the two lines of evidence that we see for this X. them not just this depth this transit of the moon but also a something ... folks are pulling on the planet that uh that uh we're attributing to them\nHey ... and that's the point I Want to pick up on because when you came in and talked about you say well this is the evidence but we're not totally sure right when did they doubt well so\nIt's an extraordinary claim and as the famous thing goes next door now claiming is ah one of my favorites are extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence so ah we've done what we think is a pretty thoroughly\nNot just this depth this transit of the moon but also a something ... folks are pulling on this planet that uh that uh we're attributing to them\nHey ... you know and that's the point I Want to pick up on because when you came in and talked about you say well this is the evidence but we're not totally sure right when did they say out loud\nSo it's an extraordinary claim him as the famous thing goes extraordinary claim is a one of my favorites are extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence so ah we've done what we think is a pretty thorough and rigorous job trying to\nRule out other possible explanations for this signal a question naturally comes out is there something weird going on with the telescope is this maybe something happening on the surface of the star could there be another planted in the system that's that's pulling on this planet and making in wobble around\nA those are all plausible explanations a but we've done our best to rule out those alternative explanations and uh as far as we can tell you know the numbers are saying the moon's there but because it is such a an incredible claim\nOr it may be incredible it's not quite the right word it's an extraordinary claim and so we really think ah additional observations of the system are needed to really confirm it\nWell it was so unusual I Am I reading from my notes you that you were able to get viewing time on the Hubble for this that you write very hard to get so you must have been other people might want to know about this very sure yeah yeah you\nSo we had a a observed three transits of the planet and the Kepler data a this was a phenomenal mission that lasted about four and a half years we saw three transits in with a Kepler they looked tantalizing but it wasn't enough to make a claim\nA so we really thought at that time we needed to follow up and observe this thing again Hubble was really the only game in town it's a very long duration event uh we observe this system for about forty hours altogether so if you think about it uh you know the earth is turning and so you can't UBS\nThe other people might want to know about\nThis very sure yeah yeah you know so we had a a observed three transits of the planet and the Kepler data a this was a phenomenal mission that lasted about four and a half years we saw three transits in with a Kepler they looked tantalizing but it wasn't enough to make a claim\nA so we really thought at that time we needed to follow up and observe this thing again Hubble was really the only game in town it's a very long duration event uh we observe this system for about forty hours altogether so if you think about it uh you know the earth is turning and so you can't observe this system with any single telescope uh from the surface of the earth\nSo you'd have to stitched together multiple datasets from multiple telescopes or to make this observation and that would be\nA very challenging so you know you really have to go to space and uh obviously we made a a convincing enough case that uh that they gave us the time\nThey're they're talking about the wants to ... is gone and I'm I'm I don't know why it should be but that's not for me [laughter] um it can be used up uh the Webb telescope is that right ... a better for you guys were looking an extra point\nGoing to be like why yeah if it had been spectacular instrument it's a very very large mirror a and a sitting aware as Hubble orbits the earth\nOr when we perform this observation you know you can imagine how people staring at this target\nBut then the earth gets in the way for about forty five minutes every single urban ... takes Ninety six minutes or so to go round so half of that orbit is just totally blocked out a James jaded just he won't have that problem\nAnd like I say the mere is going to be really spectacular so uh that data is going to be phenomenal the bigger problem is that these observations as I mentioned before are so long yeah uh that you need a lot of time to perform them and uh this a telescope is going to be highly over subscribed to many more people want to use it then they can possibly for the times Oregon\nStaring at this target but then the earth gets in the way for about forty five minutes every single orbit ... takes Ninety six minutes or so to go round so half of that orbit is just totally blocked out a James jaded just he won't have that problem and like I say the mere is going to be really spectacular so\nUh that data is going to be phenomenal the bigger problem is that these observations as I mentioned before are so long yeah uh that you need a lot of time to perform them and uh this a telescope is going to be highly over subscribed to many more people want to use it then they can possibly afford the time so we're going to have to have a very good case\nYou know there are downsides officer there isn't\nA matter of obsolete is the wrong word but they're all everything is always an obsolete by the time he gets built whether it's a highway or something else I think so long ago as well I mean we shouldn't made it twice as big we've spent whatever and I'm sure yeah you\nKnow so there's other telescopes coming down the pike that there are people bidding right now to well that we've talked about a W first and then there's a\nA telescope called ... more than ... ... yeah that's a\nAh I I don't know who's working on it but it's it's a ultraviolet and read and optical that's L. O. U. V. I. O. R. and I think so uh that they come up with great names for these things are so there's going to be some fantastic instrument stadium Estee will definitely be an improvement on Hubble\nBut you know Hubble is over twenty five years old now and it's still a top of the top of the line instrument to use it ...\nIt is All right so if this is a strange jar planted situation does it can it tell us anything about our common ordinary solar system planet situation\nA great question and one of the things that I Am always saying to people is you know they always come with the question why do we care about these moons what why what's interesting about these things and uh you know I think a big part of it is that every time we look out at these extra planetary systems we are learning\nBoys over twenty five years old now and it's still a top of the top of the line instrument to use it really amazing\nIt is All right so if this is a strange ... planet situation does it can it tell us anything about our common ordinary solar system planet situation\nThat's a great question and one of the things that I I'm always saying to people is you know they always come into question why do we care about these moons what why what's interesting about these things\nAnd uh you know I think a big part of it is that every time we look out at these extra planetary systems we are learning or by extension more about our own solar system and the question is very much still open how common are we would is is the things going on here\nThinks we're listening to you know you Arizona Public radio

is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we're talking with author Deborah Blum about how food safety protections came to be the topic of her new book\nTo poison squad one came a single minded crusade for food safety at the turn of the twentieth century our number eight for for seven to for eight to five five I'm let's turn that the the clock back\nTo that time period Deborah or you have an entire chapter on ketchup\n[laughter] what was going into that ... why devoted well I read and I know why or why devote the tell our listeners an entire chapter I catch up [noise]\nSo this is it gets it it's just an amazing story at this point for a couple of reasons one is we have\nThis is a catch up it's just an amazing story at this point for a couple of reasons one is we have this very twenty first idea scrawny first century idea of catch up which is you know kind of a sick tomato based kind of a but\nIn the nineteenth again at tended to be a kind of thin nasty a sauce with a lot of vegetable ways in it people would put pumpkin ... people would put tomatoes that they might be riding they would die them sometimes what's called Tara dies and then because of the whole mess of it\nTended to kind of be rotten anyway they dumped preservatives and it like sodium ... which is actually still with us today and so this ... because of this kind of battle ground or food safety just as meat did was Upton Sinclair\nAnd in this case I really love the story because\nIt makes a point that you know not every business is evil and a Henry J lines of ah the Heinz\nFood manufacturing company took it upon himself to get preservatives out of his ... his products the reinvented catch up so the catch up we know today was really created by Heinz\nAnd he did it so there was a lot of tomato and I said that kept the bacterial count down and then he really went to war a mean this was a battle between business and advocates and and ... business friendly government\nAnd Heinz although he was a big believer and profit really pushed for safer products and actually sent his or some of the people who work with them to meet with Roosevelt and say you have got to regulate food safety\nThe things that we make are not being trusted because consumers are afraid of food there were afraid of meat they're afraid of preservatives\nThat kept the bacterial count down and then he really went to war a mean this was a battle between business and advocates and and ... business friendly government\nAnd Heinz although he was a big believer in profit really pushed for safer products and actually sent his or some of the people who work with them to meet with Roosevelt and say you have got to regulate food safety\nThe things that we make are not being trusted because consumers are afraid of food there were afraid of meat they're afraid of preservatives\nI Want you to do something and catch up kinda catches all of that\nPlus you know there was major combat over the preservatives and get er and that was pretty fascinating but\nLet's talk about a Harvey Washington where I was a little bit more than ... the focus of your book and the partisan squad um he actually started where people were volunteering to eat stuff for him to test out yes food safety ever tell us about that what is one of the ... yeah it was amazing it's just\nCrazy and you I mean when you read this experiment first thing you think if you could never do this today right you would never get it passed all of our control\nBut what happened was he had been working really since we're about Twenty years trying to get food safety trying to get labels you know at\nCompletely not able to move this forward politically and he finally said okay well let's just have some better evidence and I'm going to skip those you know a less important other species I'm not going to do any animal safety testing and all I'm just going to dump these things in the human beings\nAnd so that's the amazing part of it and so he came up with this experiment in which he persuaded young government employees are mostly young men in their twenties to basically dying very dangerous Lee and the deal was they would eat\nLabels you know at completely not able to move this forward politically and he finally said okay well let's just have some better evidence and I'm going to skip those you know a less important other species I'm not going to do any animal safety testing at all I'm just going to dump these things into human beings and so\nThat's the amazing part of it and so he came up with this experiment in which he persuaded young government employees are mostly young men in their twenties to basically dying very dangerously and the deal was\nThey would eat three free meals a day seven days a week and it would be beautifully cooked by a professional chef and all kinds of wonderful ingredients but half of this group at any given time had to be adding capsules\nOf the compound that he was testing at various doses from very low to very hot\nAnd so during the poison ... squad experiments he looked at formaldehyde and food\nHe looked at bore acts which is a cleaning product he looked at ... which is a fever reduce or a you know a medicine\nAnd he kept ... rotating these through these tests and what he said was he hadn't expected the young men to get as sick as they did but they almost immediately started having all kinds of gastrointestinal problems and other problems\nAnd because this ... this study had caught the attention of American newspapers [noise]\nIt was the Washington Post that nickname at the poison squad this is front page news all across the country you were food is poisonous and now you start seeing this kind of rise of public outrage which then was amplified by the Sinclair but\nWow that's so ... did he have some experience in his own life that motivates\nStarted having all kinds of gastrointestinal problems and other problems and because this ... this study had caught the attention of American newspapers [noise]\nIt was the Washington Post that nickname at the poison squad this is front page news all across the country you were food is poisonous and now you start seeing this kind of rise of public outrage which then was amplified by the Sinclair but\nWow that's so ... did he have some experience in his own life that motivated hymns wanted you know create this poisonous ... gets to the bottom of the food safety\nYou know that's a great question I think he was kind of a holy roller cameras spray he his dad had been a preacher a farmer but also night ten or a preacher\nConductor on the underground railroad during the civil war\nAnd he had imbued his kids are with this kind of sense of higher calling\nAnd and ... really I mean what was interesting about him was that he took on this issue of food safety which the USDA had never really been interested in from the very beginning and then he just starts feeling at a party spilling the layers of it apart\nAnd the more he realizes how at risk people are the more he becomes really increasingly I write and you'll hear him saying\nWe'll say OK I'm testing these on young healthy people but what about children what about the elderly what about the sick and so he has the sense that uh the role of the government [noise] hang on ...\n[laughter] they can take a drink of water that are there you go [noise] um\nHe has this very early sense of the ...\nFor the more he becomes really increasingly I write and you'll hear him saying\nWe'll say OK I'm testing these on young healthy people but what about children what about the elderly what about the sick and so he has the sense that uh the role of the government [noise] hang on travel golf\n[laughter] they can take a drink of water that are [laughter] there you go um\nHe has this very early sense of the role of the government when we say in the constitution promote the general welfare this is kinda how I said\nHe really means promote the general welfare and your everyday life that part of what we do is we stand up for the citizens that I think he became perceived as an advocate as much as a scientist and that's probably right\nBut he wanted to use this position to make a difference and he actually did that's the thing that one of the things I Love about this story it's a story of a single person\nWho drives a conversation right for thirty something years but changes the conversation on our way we think about food safety\nSo did he actually we're in we're in our laws created because of his crusade where the Congress actually put teeth and the FDA and things like that can be angry\nI Am so after you know he's like battling away stymied by eventually in Nineteen oh six to laws passed then one was the meat inspection act and that was a direct result of Upton Sinclair as the jungle and the ... the horrors\nAnd then about a week later the food and drug active Nineteen oh six passed a somewhat carried by that kind of tidal wave of fury that brought us the meat inspection act\nTeeth and the FDA and things like that can be angry\nI Am so after you know he's like battling away stymied by eventually in Nineteen oh six to laws passed and one was the meat inspection act and that was a direct result of Upton Sinclair as the jungle and the ... the horrors\nAnd then about a week later the food and drug act of Nineteen oh six past somewhat carried by that kind of tidal wave of fury that brought us the meat inspection act\nAnd that was an and I we've forgotten this but that was the first great consumer protection law\nEver pass by the federal government and so it was the moment in which we all agree as a society that the government's job is in part to protect the average citizen from harm\nAnd to stand up in that way if you asked why he would say\nOkay that was a star but the law was immediately weakened by business interactions which it was to the point that he he ended up extremely frustrated I don't think he ever fully gave himself credit for what he accomplished", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "05"}
