environmental scientists were raising the alarm about the tiny beads of plastics and face wash\nAnd now these tiny invisible polymer particles seemed to have worm their way into everything else on

find these microbes\nSo the Bush were yes have you back nice to be here\nSo when we're when we go let's talk about this word directly to the researchers find is Margaret plastic\nSo researchers um they had a group of eight subjects I'm from countries all over Europe and Asia and they essentially had these subjects keep a food diary for a week and then at the end of the week they were they took a stool sample from themselves and sent it to the researchers and then the researchers had the fun job of picking through that\nThey were looking for ten different types of plastic\nAnd they found these these plastic types that on nine of them and they were in all of the samples stool samples to his own life or our bud and yet we eat them and then we send about the other end\nOnly a matter of time right with all the micro plastic around her\nRight researchers if on micro plastics in tap water in the er it's in seafood um because a lot of these plastic fragments get into the waterways and then\n... them and we eat the fish\nOr the other thing is that you know a lot of us drink water from plastic bottles or food out of plastic takeout containers are that's been wrapped in plastic and there's all sorts of chances for fragments to come off so the definition of a micro plastic is that it's smaller than\nFive millimeters but it can be much much smaller than that you know some of these fragments or on the nano meter scale\nAnd and we suspect that there is no harm coming from the\n... it's very difficult to tell you because it it's hard to sort of ... per se out um you can't really feed people some people plastic samples and not beat other people plastic samples at this point it's just not ethically\nFeasible but um it it's hard shell maybe they're just passengers harmlessly it's also possible that they could be accumulating and that um a lot of these plastics carry chemicals that they made in each into the human body so it's it's I wouldn't tell people I Would say don't don't panic because it could be yes it could be that there are harmless but it's very difficult\nKnow those of us of a certain age always thought that if\nTell people I Would say don't don't panic

I'm a shanty why she couldn't afford 'em commercial than she pads because he'd seen them in the market and she said well it's either a sandwich pad or milk and we need milk\nAnd from that I Am\nBecause he's a bit of an extraordinary fellow um spent twelve years coming up with a low cost sanitary pads machine that can be money they'll ... can be afraid to pilot ... women\nAnd there are now four thousand of them all over 'em pulled over the world but the way he got to understanding he had to do a reverse engineering to understand what was in ...\nAll over 'em pulled over the world but the way he got to understanding he had to do a reverse engineering to understand what was in commercial than if you pass because he thought it was just caught and yeah so he decided as the best way to do that obviously was to wake up his own uterus in the form of\nUm a a a goat Blatter filled with a goat blood\nAnd I'm Sorry yeah sorry with uh football's a filled with goats slogan blood and he had touched it to his clothing and had little pump and went around all day and every so often pumped it and so I Try to simulate the experience of aim instructing woman um and he learned a lot\n[laughter] I think a lot of men what if they did that [laughter] um and also because he lived in South\nIndia where it's hot he uh he was wearing white so which is pretty much everyone is night might not matter what century pad advertising has told us over the years and so you know there was stains and leaks and nice to have a lot of time checking behind themselves like women do a lot and um he eventually came understood what was in such pets and\nHas revolutionized synch pets in India quite an amazing fellow\n... to ... you know more men should try that I make sure how the trials and tribulations\n... women go ask him with football [laughter] I I think there's so many great little ... of moments in your book on a little statistics that just jumps out let me go through a few of them you have a staff that every three seconds someone received a blood transfusion\nWow ... ... you know the joke behind that is they ought to find that guy and stop him from there [laughter] but\nIt's such a ... in the states is that she every two seconds is that right yeah and uh I was given the breakdown of those figures and idle idle makes sense I how how\nAnd yeah and uh I was given the breakdown of the biggest and idle idle makes sense\nI how how how did this idea of banking blood first come about\nWell when I mean we haven't been this the system that we're all used to which is the mass donation and I'm supply and transfusion of blood it's really not very old a total of about a hundred and Twenty years old and in the beginning I'm In the U.S in the u._k. they\nThey ... they started in pretty similar fashion that\nPeople were selling that blood um they had this project that they could sell them on and so they did\nKnow leaving a union of blood cell is in New York and there are people who men usually who traveled around the country I'm selling that blood so they're with their own kind of blood market um but eventually in the Nineteen thirties uh adults in Chicago called ... to ... I'm trying to organize things a bit better and he was\nConvinced that the best thing to do 'em ... blood as a commodity really so he thought that was when ten must come out and if you used blood you should supply blood so he sets up a blood bank and I've actually that transformed\nI'm In the Nineteen seventies in in the u._s. um the notion of paying full blood um died out and it's now a whole donated not illegal to sell your blood in the U.S but it's just not it's frowned upon and not done\nOne of the you know I when I was in college a new lots of college students who was showing their blood for for money just you know for some spending cash\nCan still do that but you you what you're doing is telling blood plasma and so you're selling the yellow stuff fifty five percent of liquid in

selling a plasma us so yeah it's a good income stream for other people\nAnd no you're right that that the U.S is seen as the ... pack of plasma [laughter] like where do the cartel applies so\nWell that's it that wasn't my phrase that came from someone in the classroom or industry but it's it's certainly a global giant and and the selling off last night supplies Seventy percent of plasma in

studies suggest than breathing through your nose can be linked to improve memory\nAnd that's a new to view mouth breeders out they're here to untangle how olfaction is linked to deeper parts of the brain controlling emotion and memory is Christine is on oh there's this new professor at Northwestern University Feinberg school of medicine doctors on and welcome to science friday\nHi thank you I'm happy to be here we're happy to have you so what is so special about breathing through your nose\nWell a nose breathing is special because it's how we smell and smell is a fascinating and really unique sensory system so evolutionarily smell is our oldest sense it's also arguably the least understood\nAnd really unique sensory system\nSo evolutionarily smell is our oldest sense it's also arguably the least understood of our sensory systems and there are several\nKey aspects of smell that make it particularly interesting and that make nose breathing really different from mouth breathing so for one thing the smell neurons which live up way up at the very top of our nasal cavities\nThey actually touch the air as it flows in and out of our noses just during natural breathing and this is really unusual because these olfactory neurons are the only part of our central nervous system that makes direct contact with our external world\nAnd the way that this information gets from these neurons inside of our noses\nInto the brain is different from all other sensory systems so all other sensory systems information relays through a structure called the thalamus before it reaches the cortex and higher order brain areas\nBut in the olfactory system information flows straight from the nose\nInto the cortex and higher order brain areas as well without going through the thalamus um and what's special is that these olfactory structures are located in a part of the brain called the limbic system\nWhich is involved and emotion and fear learning and memory so this gives little faction of sort of privileged access to emotion and memory areas in the brain and and because a nose breathing is smelling\nNasal inhalation provides a sort of entry point by which breathing rhythms can modulate brain activity in these structures\n... or so just the act of breathing in through your nose was you know also since the air is coming in and alert\nSo just the act was breathing through your nose was you know it was also since the air is coming in and alert these this pathway on the end point in your brain and say hey something interesting was about to happen\nRight it yes actually it does so that the receptors inside of the nasal cavity\nOr not only responsive to chemicals so they're not only monitoring ah the chemicals in our environment but they also are ... so they can detect the air flowing in and out of the\nThe nose yes um and we found that these natural respiratory rhythms just breathing even in the absence of any smell\nOf drives activity in olfactory areas but interestingly these these respiratory driven brain waves they don't stop there so we found that they also propagate to nearby limbic structures the the ones involved and emotion and memory so what this means is that as we breathe\nActivity across the limbic system is rhythmically increasing or decreasing within hails enact sales I'm In this pattern what we found is that it's only present when you're breathing through your nose so if you breathe through your mouth that rhythmic limbic activity goes away\n... you know a lot of us believe maybe erroneous lawyer but you can suddenly smell something that you remember from Thirty years ago right is is that a ... a real thing or why and I'm a well for me it's real but why is that something special Tibet you sensory Oregon\nYeah you know the evidence is not clear that studies sort of conflicting on that um a couple of studies have found that perhaps olfactory memories memories tend to be earlier I'm not ...\nA couple of studies have found that perhaps olfactory memories memories tend to be earlier I'm not necessarily stronger um but I Would say there's no clear consensus on on whether or not that's true\n... one of ... what about breathing through your mouth or do anything for you I mean [noise] uh we we use as far as his tasting food we've always been told that you smell the food through your nose and it helps your taste buds taste what which were actually doing is there a connection there\nRight that is true that is a good point um and that's\nThat's what's called retro nasal olfaction so when when we have food inside of our mouth I'm the air can get from our oral cavity into our nasal cavity but it flows and the backwards direction so it's going out word rather than in word\nUm and it definitely impacts flavors and and taste yes us\nTo talk about your study how were you able to study this I understand that you were able to test this with an F. MRI\nActually I'm no that's an in that's a very interesting point um we did not use fmri right because in the human brain the olfactory structures are actually located very very deep almost in the center of the brain uh making them very hard to reach noninvasive Lee so we can't record from these areas\nFrom the electrodes on the surface of the scalp\nAnd functional neuro imaging uh we cannot really measure\nUm brain oscillation with that technique so to do this study we worked in collaboration with brain surgeons who implant electrodes wires directly into these Olympic areas for patients who are undergoing brain surgery for epilepsy and this provides is a really rare operates\nDirectly into these Olympic areas for patients who are undergoing brain surgery for epilepsy and this provides is a really rare opportunity to record this type of data from human olfactory and limbic structures\nAnd if it falls faction and memory or related you see people with memory problems also having issues with smell [noise]\nAh that that's a really good point um a lot of neurodegenerative diseases actually do present with early olfactory decline um\nAnd well I think are these findings that we're discussing or may not have direct implications for neurodegenerative disease I think um [noise]\nThe impact of of breathing on limbic activity certainly suggests potential new avenues and directions of research on on these diseases um for example it you know it'd be interesting to know if these mechanisms may be altered in nerd degenerative disease um and I I also think\nThat our data point to the possibility that neurodegenerative disease could result in all altered nasal breathing patterns I'm breathing is so easy to measure\nAnd this is something that we're looking into and in the lab so do um patience with different neurological disorders do they breathe differently do they have characteristic nasal breathing patterns\nAnd sort of something or you're going to be following up we're right yes under any mirror degenerative disease in particular\nUh we're we're currently collecting breathing data from patients with Alzheimer's disease and patients with Parkinson's disease to see if we can differentiate the two um states just by analyzing the shapes of their breathing wave forums\nOr were the only thing I'm going to just throw to talk of some really dumb [laughter]\n... they're breathing wave forums\nOr were the only I'm going to just throw this is talk of some really dumb [laughter] are I mean\nWhy do we need to breathe through our mouths if we have our noses and are we the only animals are breathing through our mouth\nYeah you know I I really I think are sort of like a great question and I spent a lot of time thinking about that actually I\nI mean I think the answer probably goes far beyond just the sort of immediate thought which is that if your nose is congested you have this alternate breathing route so that you can still get Erin and still live in one that was bite off and on one um\nBut we're finding that it really drastically changes our brain activity so I think that the full answer to that question really remains to be seen and I think it's a really interesting point I Know that um well most mammals that that I can think of do\nPant and parenting is is typically something that involves mouth breathing so dogs pant not only when they're hot but I think also when they're stressed uh cats as well and I think that's um something interesting about that\nSupport for Kagan ... comes from Prescott living magazine the fall of the nation is now

recently passed a resolution that supports their mass adoption\nAnd that will put the decision of whom to save and home to kill in the hands of a machine\nWho should the car decide to protect the passengers ... older people younger people a pregnant woman a homeless person\nMy next guest discovered that how we answer that question depends on the culture we come from and that could make designing an ethical autonomous vehicle a lot more challenging\nSo and as soon as it is a research assistant with MIT Media lab in Cambridge his research is in the journal nature this week welcome to science friday\nI thank you a pleasure to be on\nNice to have you why is the trolley problem the best way to think about the future of driverless cars\nWill a driverless cars promise to um I'm a lemonade a large number of accidents but the vast majority of accidents is currently happened due to human error but in the small number of cases where you know how to avoid it blocks on this they may be cases it's unavoidable harm\nAnd I know a typically we've had we've had our small there's a lot of robotics and those are really there was sufficient to look at situations where I'm at ... has to

Flagstaff around the Prescott region near eighty and the ... valley area in the mid eighties\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow [noise]\nSoccer [noise]\nReal science like [noise]\nNo I Am\nYes indeed it's time for another episode of science goes to the movies and this week a time honored story of a man a plan and the ...\nSpace exploration will uncover but I don't think it'll be flourish in just for the sake of exploration I think it'll be more of the fact that it\nAllows us to see things\nMaybe we should have seen a long time ago\nJust haven't been able to until now\nMm that's actor Ryan Gosling playing astronaut Neil Armstrong and the new movie first man he's talking about why he wants to be part of the Gemini missions astronaut crew which will later on down the lands in the first human does that food and set foot on the surface of the moon and\nWe've gathered a solar panel of space nerds to talk about the film what they liked and maybe could have been done a little bit differently abled and there were some areas in the film we want to hear from you if you if you could make a movie about space exploration\nWhat story would you want to town and is it a common stories we hear the famous ones\nWhat about some on famous people and famous stories that\nThat could be from the space race or right now at any decade your life give us a call\nOur number is eight for for seven to for eight to five five eight four forest tight talk you can also tweet us ... fry let me introduce my guests Miriam Kramer a science editor at Nashville welcome to science friday hey thanks for having me and is your neurons see is a human exploration mission\nMaryam Kramer a science editor at Nashville welcome to science friday hey thanks for having me and ... she is a human exploration mission that an analysis lead at NASA's Johnson Space center in Houston Welcome to New York\nThank you good afternoon nap and I have to sit ... he's a he's a history professor studying space exploration at Fordham University his most recent book is beyond earth chronicle of deep space exploration nice to have you nice to be here\nSpoiler alerts [laughter]\nThat's it we're deep diving into the movie and that means we'll be talking about the key plot points including yes does Neal Armstrong make it safely back to the moon and back because\nIf you don't know that much [laughter] we'll get we're going to be giving that away so if you want to take part in a number eight full force having to for eight to five five or you can also reach us at science friday I'm very much to let's start with the review thumbs up or thumbs down\nOh I loved it you'll hang up I'm In the tank for this movie I really liked first man at actually I said that's a kind of surpassed my previous favorites based movie a and is now in the top spot above Apollo Thirteen\nRarely yeah pretty I pray yeah I really I really enjoyed it I thought that it was sort of the space movie that uh that we needed\nIn a lot of ways why what do you mean we needed Garfield good movies [laughter] and not so much more uh I really enjoy the tone of it like I I have wanted for a long time a for there to be some kind of darker look at space history and I think that this kind of\nGave it to us in a lot of different ways from like the ... metal of the ship to a lesser launching lately I was\nYou know I was wondering if it was you know I and I moved in can as it was ... you know get an idea how the rattling I'm which vibration\n... ... I was you know I was ... he was\nYou know I and I mean can as it was ... you know get an idea how the rattling much vibration really was in their\n... like ... I felt that um and just also like looking at the portrayal of masculinity and kind of the way that the whole movie came together around that I thought was a really astute in a lot of waste ... what did you think\nOn a personal level I really enjoyed it for me it's the first person aspect versus just sort of watching it from the outside you can really put yourself in the movie and you know most of us will never get to fly in space so getting to actually experience it in a way I was really fun way to have a movie made\nMhm I sent for throughout the film we see Neal Armstrong as a dispassionate mhm reserved contained and that was all part of his engineering mindset here's an here's a clip\nPlanning on taking some jewelry to the new buzz sure what what fellow wouldn't want to give his wife bragging rights [noise]\nNeal when you take anything a better choice I think we're\nI think that's a real quote of is you you ... you know right I did I did I met him once I'm\nAt a conference I think you know the movie it really does justices character in a way and I like the movie quite a bit it's a it's a flood movie but it's really great movie I really think this is a a movie that captures the other side of the right stuff so to speak the engineering technical backgrounds and the kind of commitment these guys needed to have beyond just be fighter drugs and\nAnd that kind of internal narrative internal uh I'm kind of story in this movie about what it took to be an astronaut\nI think we do is communicated really effective was he as reserved as you went as you knew him well I didn't really I don't think I knew that well but from what I understand he was very reserved but he was not I think as perhaps a dour as portrayed in the movie\nOr you had a sense of humor he was a funny guy uh but I Do think he had\nReserve but he was not I think as perhaps a dour as portrayed in the movie or you had a sense of humor he was a funny guy uh but I Do think he had a lot of struggles in his life and as his biographer Jim Hansen has talked about uh [noise]\nUm you know there were some serious problems struggles in his family life and also with his colleagues announced runoff so you know I think it's a bit of both he was I think he was he was a bit um perhaps reticent but um but I think he was also a capable of just being kind of chilling out\n[laughter] you know you didn't get that impression too much\nIn the movie not so much in the movie but I think the movie was focused on those aspects of his career in life than required concentration delusions\nYeah and there's your urine and you're an engineer did you feel like there was a fair portrayal of any engineer\nI think engineers have a whole variety of personality so I think he saw a few different personalities that movie and if you look across a lot of movies you see that their son engineer there's a very serious one they're the ones that are super outgoing so it's certainly a fair perfect portrayal because pretty much every personality type exists in engineering\nAnd one thing that struck me about this film was how jarring and difficult Paul the scenes of space flight were there you had a Neal is cramped the launches were teeth rattling and it was just disorienting any time we saw people flying ... news you'd was that realistic to you\nI think there was a lot of realistic aspects that you know people assume you have this\nFund floating feeling but especially in the Gemini capsule the mercury there wasn't a lot of room that you were really crammed in there the cockpit right in your face the control panel so I think that with a very accurate portrayal ... all the switches engages are just right there so that and then of course the rocket ride up till can be um very bumpy so that was certainly true\nLet's go to the phones Andrew in Sarasota, Florida welcome to science friday\nOh hi Hi Saturday I think I got disconnect\nTrue that's got to the phones Andrew in Sarasota, Florida welcome to science friday\nOh hi Hi Saturday I think I got disconnected there for a moment um yeah I was saying it just since you happened to mention the program we hear a lot about mercury and we hear a lot about a but Apollo but I feel like the Gemini program is under served the first time\nMan stepped out into the void and Americans that space walks I think that's a story worth telling\nHey thanks for that call and you know I have a lot of people don't realize you know in that scene in the movie where he can control the orbiting the rotation and he had the right stuff to pull out of that that's why he got the first seat you know to go landing on the ...\nYeah I think that's definitely one of the factors that kind of um [noise] made it much more visible and they asked for an office there were I mean there were other candidates for the job but for sure the gym and I ate experience was a really key point I was a really dangerous mission\nAnd that was just looking at all life magazines from that month and it was widely reported that the time as a kind of really kind of a an amazing exciting moment in the space race\nA kind of success or failure in that sense but a fantastic a moment captured really nicely in the movie\nAs the one person in the room who remembers that real in real time I can say that it was very very concerning um uh the the big emotional punch of the story was Neal's grief over the death of his daughter when she was just two years old\nAnd then the last so the fellow astronaut and lead up to Apollo you know Lebanon Apollo one whatever and you think these humans just lost his shaped history has has played out a\nI you know I mean these things or if I I think is also communicate in the movie the fighter pilots test pilots were very familiar with losses 'cause they had been at um air force bases and there's many of their colleagues were um you know not making it back home from test flights\nMiller with losses because they had been um air force bases and they're many of their colleagues were um you know not making it back home from test flight so in in many ways they were used to it but nobody's really used to losses like that and especially losing a child is something that nobody can really knowing this happened to them\nFunding for gay and a new comes from the museum of northern Arizona announcing his it a skateboard

Carroll Janice and um you know there are very few African Americans and space exploration\nVery few women and he was the\nFirst African American woman to go into space exploration and not only that she just seems like a like a really cool person hang out with I mean she's done dancing and acting and\nWith an Star Trek and she graduated high school at sixteen and um you know and she was that very inspired by the civil rights movement I just feel like she's just all around up really multifaceted fascinating person to do a movie about and I'd love to\nAddress just see something about her or not and very much in agreement\nOh yeah I may Jonathan is is very cool I've I've met her a few times and it's just always a a treat to talk to her about a million and you tell us a little bit of ... um I I think pretty much what what the caller said yeah this is what I Know over ... ah she's just a lot like a really interesting life filled with a lot of different things from science to the arts museum [noise]\nA on a gym is heavy yeah there are certainly a lot of a background um she flew wanting to shuttle flights early ones for ah women and and I think there'd be a really interesting story to tell their\nJokes a movie I think it would be amazing stories or um you know elect as amusing than it is a treat from a tweet from Memphis says how about the early women astronaut to didn't fly\nMore perhaps what would happen would have happened if they did for\nSomething like an interesting topic yeah there are all these behind the scenes story right\nYeah there are I mean I think um [noise] it that's the mercury Thirteen right uh so I I ... I Believe was some kind of Netflix series about about them also some kind of documentary series that was or regard as you know\n... and all the people who were in control\nTheories about about that and also some kind of documentary series that was regarded\nYeah ... and all the people who were in the control room and all the other places and you know\nAll kinds of all kinds of stories\nUm it's interesting ah this this is the movie um about the heroes of astronaut certainly fifty years ago\nAnd it will be fifty\nYears since the moon landing next summer which I'm having trouble getting my head around [laughter] and we also have Apollo Thirteen we have the right stuff\nWhy is Hollywood still talking about things that happen fifty years ago when so much has happened since what do you think yeah I mean that's a good question I I think part of it is that\nYou know Apollo landing on the moon that was that was the big stuff like that was the big stuff that human exploration has has done\nIn the last fifty years I mean that the shuttle is exciting and incredible but it wasn't as exciting and incredible as like actually going to the moon [laughter] um so I I think that it's it's a deep wells that people keep coming back to you because of that\nUh and that is that like I think that there are plenty of stories to be told more in the here and now I mean I I think the robots should should get there do\nYou know that's what I mean we were talking about this I said they're all those robots we don't hear any stories about the trials and tribulations getting those robots yeah and they're ... and other places yeah and you know what we also hear about any stories of any other countries in the space for ... there are so many other asks if there are so many countries up there\nRight now I mean there is a story to be told that the tweet about the Russians I think there'll be a an epic story to tell about their chief designer and uh they're they're all they're travails and difficulties and the space dog like a ... there's many ways to make her into that story\nUh they're they're older travails and difficulties and\nThe space dog like um there's many ways to enter into that story um but I Would say that it's not all looking back in the past if you look at movies like um gravity and the marsh and those are sort of maybe imagining a kind of alternate alternative to these sort of looking backward movies I think\nMaybe there is something to be said about the interest in space in general but I like to believe we're not just looking back rules with imagine in the future\nIs your what are they talking about a NASA these days about\nAh so what what are big project is actually trying to get back to the moon so that's a bigger Ryan is the last programs and all of exploration systems ballot meant so\nYou know really I think once we can start flying those flights are there will be a whole nother a crop of a story to be told and one of the things I'd like to see I don't think the general public really understands engineering and how all of these things take to develop so on a personal level I think it'd be great if if someone could figure out how to tell\nWhat it takes to actually get to the flight ... the astronaut to fly on it mhm bend in Mesa, Arizona welcome to science friday\n... thank thank you my name's Ben and uh yeah I Would I Would think it'd be interesting to make a film about what the challenger accident from an engineering standpoint um they the engineers actually tried to stop the launching a and unfortunately that did not happen\nUm and it and then in the end it affected them in ways that many people did though of course it expects it killed the crew but oh I think that many of the of the engineers have a story to tell us well\nThat's a good point yeah absolutely I mean that's a ... that that will be an amazing story but um I I think there is a plan to make a movie about the challenger mission um but focused on the school teacher ...\nThe story but um I I think there is a ... plan to make a movie about the challenger mission um but focused on the school teacher Christa McAuliffe but I imagine these\nThe decisions made or the day and the ... the day before the launch which were critical will be depicted in some fashion in the movie which were all engineering decisions and uh I'm I'm and I'm sure it will be you know a crucial to understanding the accident Mm\nUh you know you mentioned the Orion mission that wants to get us back to the moon is is it going to be easier because of the lessons we learned from Paul\nIn order to know uh getting to the moon is just as hard today as it was in the Nineteen sixties I mean we know a little bit more and we have an experience space of one draw from a but actually going to the moon mission is going to be justice risky it's\nJust it's hard to do um that amount of a prop we need when Neal said he wished for more ... I Wish for more prop every day as well um so it's not any easier getting to the moon and it is risky I'm the second time around\nI remember after the ... the Apollo missions were cancelled there were three rockets leftover we only went to Seventeen years was to be twenty I remember going to Houston and seeing them lying on their side one lying inside as a home for nesting birds and everyone thought there was anything as sad as seeing a Saturn five being home for you know it's nice to birds at a\nPlace in an effort who's the most ... it's in a building now and it's been restored I I mean I I Know that has been couldn't we just turn that's put back in the family building and send them back to the moon is I mean\nI feel that the avionics are quite out of date at that point I don't think we can control it anymore [laughter]\nWhen what's the schedule for that and do we have enough money and is it going to be going\nSo we're working to uh twenty twenty flight for the first launch of the last ah and really the second lots of uh Ryan we launched in twenty fourteen for the first flight of a riot\nSo we're working to uh twenty twenty flight for the first launch of SOS a and really the second lots of uh Ryan we launched in twenty four came for the first flight of her eye on 'em and that'll be an unproven flight we are going around the moon or to a different retrograde orbits would leave and go way past and they went about Seventy thousand kilometers on the far side\nAnd that will be a long mission that's really a shakedown all of the vehicle systems on ... and the Ryan before we put crew out in the next flight we were in progress we have enough money um and it's just a challenge getting their back to the future\nYes said we do that or I Want to thank all of you are for ... for taking time to be with us and it's\nIt's gonna be the fifth anniversary next year it's really amazing\nAnd we'll all be looking forward", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "26"}
