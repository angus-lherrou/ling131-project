back right Joe thanks for having me Ira\nAnything more about what went wrong there\nYet so we know that about two minutes into the launch there was some kind of booster failure\nAnd they had to

away some of the um\nThe the force on on the astronaut string landing and this is where the rock literally coming down more like a projectile and this has happened before but only ever um during

the election data and science lab at MIT welcome to science friday\nLife to be here and it's nice to have you um\nLarry I mentioned the Russians hacking during the last presidential election what areas where the Russians or whether hackers compromising and what were they they trying to do there\nI'm not sure that we know in tire early what they were trying to do this for first of all I think it's really important when we're talking about um a lot of conversation about Russian interference\nThe third is a professor of political science and the founding director of the election data and science lab at MIT welcome to science friday life to be here and it's nice to have you um [noise]\nWell I ... I mentioned the Russians hacking during the last presidential election what areas where the Russians or where the hackers compromising and why were they they trying to do there\nI'm not sure that we know in tire early what they were trying to do first of all I think it's really important when we're talking about um [noise] there's a lot of\nConversation about Russian interference in the election and two thousand six team over there there are a couple of things that we're talking about when we mentioned that one is a tax on the election infrastructure um but there's also um [noise] that kind of political purchase of political ads social media propaganda and attack on campaigns\nAnd their emails those are those are two separate things ah if we're focusing on the election infrastructure itself\nA we saw them targeting a voter registration databases again not entirely clear what they were trying to do there um and and of course voter registration databases or the roles that had the names of people and says whether or not they're eligible to vote where they live where they can vote\n'em and um there were phishing attacks against um [noise] uh election officials we know that um it looks like at least one or election systems vendor which uh manufacturers e pull books was attacked but I think\nUm we don't we don't know exactly what was going on I'm unclear or just that there was certainly a lot of I'm looking around on their part\nWhat was that was that the vendor company that was putting PC Anywhere on the on the machines as maintenance but the softer wasn't taken off is that what you're talking about in that case there is that something different\nYou know know what I'm Talking about is um\nThat um it looks like at least one election systems vendor which uh manufacturers e pull books was attacked but I think um we don't we don't know exactly what was going on I'm unclear or just that there was certainly a lot of I'm looking around on their part\nWas that was that the vendor company that was putting PC Anywhere on the on the machines as maintenance but the softer wasn't taken off is that what you're talking about in that case there is that something different\nYou know know what I'm Talking about is um uh there there is a company the our systems might actually I think they may still [laughter] they may still a U.S not have confirmed whether or not there there certainly was an attempt to hack them\nUm and again they manufacture pull books and and deal with registration databases\nOr electronic publics or what you can kind of what our use their off in a a tablets or art or or computers that are used to check people in\n'em and uh uh as I said I last I checked and I think they have they they may have denied that they were actually successfully breached but at least in one of the Muller indictments there was an indication that there was\nSome dinner and it sounded like them uh that was actually breached\nCharles Stuart than we were talking about these kind of acts but how else could a voting machine be compromised [noise] well\n[noise] ah well that's actually quite a controversial question him ... you mentioned um well so let's start off by making distinctions and I am and Larry really helped\nUm I'm making the distinctions among the Russians um what they were doing in various ways um you know perhaps to influence the the elections ranging from\nUm affecting the campaigns to may be affecting the infrastructure is I think um if we're asking about um\nCharles Stuart than we were talking about these kind of acts but how else could a voting machine be compromise well\nI'm a well that's actually quite a controversial\nQuestion if you ... you mentioned um well so let's start off by making distinctions and I am and Larry really helped um I'm making the distinctions among the Russians um what they were doing in various ways um\nYou know perhaps to influence the elections ranging from um affecting the campaigns to may be affecting the infrastructure is I think um\nIf we're asking about um what can be done to hack into say machines and systems um in the first um distinction we would make is between you know the voter registration systems which um where he was just talking a bit about 'em you alluded to at the Twenty one states\nUm they got attacked those are voter registration systems um and then there are the voting machines themselves which can either be electronic voting machines that are used in several states um\nPotentially the scanners that are used to scan\nScan paper ballots and\nIf we're thinking about voting machines themselves either the electronic ones or the scanners um that's actually the answer that question is actually quite um quite controversial you made a reference to that Khan um activities and\nSo what we do know is that if you have um access to I'm a voting machine and especially if you have access for a long long time and the vulnerabilities are well known\nThat um you know a a decently competent computer science student can open up the machine and do things to it um the um what election officials will say is that first of all I'm In general the machines\nTo the DEF CON\nUm activities and so what we do know is that if you have um access to I'm a voting machine and especially if you have access for a long long time and the vulnerabilities are well known\nThat um you know a a decently competent computer science student can open up the machine and do things to it um the\nUm what election officials will say is that first of all I'm In general the machines that have been broken into and DEF CON I'm either had been retired or in the process of being retired and then secondly\nUm that the types of attacks that have been demonstrated to be successful against these machines\nUm require such a degree of direct access that in order to have a actually ineffective attack on them\nUm and you need some sort of inside job um that would require 'em a lot of attention to particular machines and we'll be easily detected and so um but I mean I think that's where the controversy is that um it's my sense that the computer science community thing is it's easier\nTo actually affect this type of kind of brute force attack against the the guts of the voting machines than the election officials do\nOur they right um well I mean I tend to kind of um if I have to go\nWith one side of the other I tend to my take on it is I'm I've learned a lot from DEF CON about what the um what the vulnerabilities are I think that the election officials are aware of those vulnerabilities\nAnd are taking 'em um are are taking steps to try to um try to deal with them I think that the important thing nonetheless is that um the election officials that that are using like\nThen the election officials do our they right\nUm well I mean I tend to kind of um if I have to go with one side of the other I tend to my take on it is I'm I've learned a lot from DEF CON about what the um what the vulnerabilities are I think that the election officials are aware of those vulnerabilities\nAnd are taking 'em um are are taking steps to try to um try to deal with them I think that the important thing nonetheless is that um the election officials that that are using electronic machines especially the ones that don't have any sort of paper record of the election\nBeing there in that position where they have to say well you know given everything we do to try to protect the machine is physically we're confident that they're not being attacked and we're confident because of the logic and accuracy testing we're doing that um there were mistakes made\nBut a skeptic can I think rightfully so even if you think the election officials have done everything they could\nI think there is still room for a skeptic to say yeah but wouldn't it be great if one could independently verify that the machines weren't monkey with and there weren't mistakes in the programming so um so I I I tend to you know I I tend to fall on the side of\nThinking that the machines right now for twenty Eighteen are well taken care of and are highly unlikely to be subject to the sorts of attacks that we see a DEF CON but it would ... who it would be good for the state's the moving directions to make it easier to demonstrate to skeptics that that was\nI I could just jump in real quick point um I I I I I think there to to build on on what Charles just said uh I Do have a concern I I'm not sure but I really buy the argument because these machines are generally not connected to the Internet that we don't have to worry about um\nKeener well taken care of and are highly unlikely to be subject to the sorts of attacks that we see a DEF CON but it would ... who it would be good for the state's the

concern I I'm not sure but I really buy the argument because these machines are generally not connected to the Internet that we don't have to worry about\nUm uh problems with them and potentially somebody reaching them in various ways but but um [noise] more importantly there's there there's a lot of the election infrastructure of course that is connected to the Internet um and an example of that my an obvious example was election night reporting which comes out\nAnd yet she is fluent in squirrel monkey and it's all on science friday from WNYC Studios [noise]\nAnother hour of science

nations took their first steps down a long unclear road to addressing climate change\nIn signing the Paris climate agreement nations agreed to keep the increase in global average temperature\nTo quote well below two degrees Celsius a critical point at which the planet gets locked into a future of catastrophic impacts such as rising sea levels more devastating floods and droughts widespread food and water shortages and and more powerful storms\nAnd to ensure that we don't get too close to that to degree tipping point\nThe agreement ask countries to limit the temperature\nAddressing climate change in signing the Paris climate agreement nations agreed to keep the increase in global average temperature\nTo quote well below two degrees Celsius a critical point at which the planet gets locked into a future of catastrophic impacts such as rising sea levels more devastating floods and droughts widespread food and water shortages and more powerful storms\nAnd to ensure that we don't get too close to that to degree tipping point the agreement ask\nCountries to limit the temperature increase\nTo just one point five degrees Celsius but how much does happen to agree save us from the most devastating impacts of climate change a new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the I. P. C. C. this week has shed some light on that\nIt highlights a number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to one point five degrees compared to two degrees or more\nThe conclusion every bit of warming even that full point five degrees matters here to break down the report and tell us how world nations have been doing trying to curb emissions over the last three years\nIs Dr Kelly the vendors she is senior associated with the world resources Institute Dr living welcome back to science friday\nThank you so much to do that you want to send out a shout out to our listeners and with this question as we barrel toward a one and a half degree increase in global temperature oh your worries are you worried about climate change impacting\nWhere you live give us a call our number eight for for seven to for eight to five five eight four four seven to four to five five\nYou can also tweet us at ... fry up so that could live in the the the goal is to prevent it to a degree increase in average global temperature\nDr living welcome back to science friday\nThank you so much great to be with you\nOr wanted was to shout out to our listeners began with this question as we barrel toward a one of the half degree increase in global temperature oh your worries are you worried about climate change impacting where you live give us a call our number eight for for seven to four to five five eight four four seven to four to five\nFive you can also tweet us at science friday I'm\nSo Dr living the the the goal is to prevent it to a degree in Greece in average global temperatures but this report tells us but even a one point five degree increase is gonna bring some pretty big changes [noise]\nYeah that's absolutely right so the Paris Agreement actually has these two goals as you said\nTo limit warming well below two degrees and pursue efforts for one point five degrees Celsius of warming and that was because for some of the most vulnerable countries you can think about small island developing states on one point five degrees Celsius is also going to harm wellbeing to a tremendous extent [noise]\nSo what this report did was look at what are the differences between warming of one point five degrees Celsius and two degrees Celsius of warming and how much harder to get to one point five degrees Celsius as opposed to two degrees Celsius and they found that indeed we are definitely not on track\nOn and and the half a degree of warming actually can make a tremendous difference\nAnd good for example\nSo for example on what they found is they looked across a number of different systems and they found I for example for extreme heat\nThe percentage of the global population exposed to a severe heat wave which we've already started to experience with one degree of warming on at least once every five years is two and a half times worse with two degrees of warming instead of one point five degrees Celsius of warming if you think about um\nNot on track 'em and and the half a degree of warming actually can make a tremendous difference in ... for example\nSo for example on what they found is they looked across a number of different systems and they found I for example for extreme heat\nThe percentage of the global population exposed to a severe heat wave which we've already started to experience with one degree of warming on at least once every five years is two and a half times worse\nWith two degrees of warming instead of one point five degrees Celsius of warming\nIf you think about on sea ice free Arctic in the summer on when you don't have any ice on on top of the Arctic\nOr this could happen at least once every hundred years with one point five degrees Celsius of warming but at least once every decade under two degrees Celsius of warming and that can impact climate change even further\nBecause you have a dark service that opens up underneath the ice and it absorbs more warmth\nSea level rise is point oh six meters more with two degrees as opposed to one point five degrees and while that doesn't sound like a lot that translates to millions more people being impacted a species losses um two times worse\nFor both plants invertebrates that lose at least half of their range under two degrees of warming as opposed to one point five degrees of warming three times worse for insects\nI'm almost forty percent worse or under two degrees versus one point five degrees for the amount of permafrost that would have thought in the dark in the Arctic\nI said these are some really big numbers one of the most um devastating and surprising wants to me was for coral reefs\nWhere the report found that under one point five degrees Celsius of warming we would see Seventy to Ninety percent of a further decline and coral reefs with two degrees more than Ninety nine percent ah which is just trawling\nPush to one point five degrees of warming three times worse for insects I'm almost forty percent worse uh under two degrees versus one point five degrees for the amount of permafrost that would have thought in the dark in the Arctic\nI said these are some really big numbers one of the most um devastating and surprising wants to me was for coral reefs\nWhere the report found that under one point five degrees Celsius of warming we would see Seventy to Ninety percent of a further decline and coral reefs with two degrees more than Ninety nine percent ah which is just tremendous\nYou know does it look like there's any way we're going to be able to stay on the river to orange or degrees\nSo what the report finds is that both um two degrees Celsius of warming and one point five degrees Celsius of warming is technically feasible on\nThere have been a lot of modeling studies were analysts come together and see what would have to happen um to make that transition happened on right now a emissions are roughly fifty to get get tons of carbon dioxide equivalent\nThey're projected to increase even with the climate change commitments that we've made under the Paris Agreement by twenty thirty\nInstead we essentially need to have that amount and go down to twenty five to thirty gig tons of carbon dioxide per year by twenty thirty and then we actually need to phase out net emissions altogether by mid century\nSo this is a tremendous transformation and the combination rates that are truly unprecedented at the scale of what we're talking about on it also would require behavioral and technological shifts across the board\nSo for example by twenty fifty we're talking about renewables projected to supply Seventy to eighty five percent of electricity or to be able to me at one point five pathways we're talking about reducing energy demand increasing the efficiency of\nAnd then we actually need to phase out net admissions altogether by mid century\nSo this is a tremendous transformation and the composition rates that are truly unprecedented at the scale of what we're talking about on it also would require behavioral and technological shifts across the board\nSo for example by twenty fifty we're talking about renewables projected to supply Seventy to eighty five percent of electricity\nOr to be able to me at one point five pathways we're talking about reducing energy demand increasing the efficiency of food production changing dietary choices\nUm a lot of different measures ah which were I'm just starting to do in certain locations but none of them do we need\nA you know the president said he wanted to know quote who drew the reports I won't go there with that can can you answer at least who commission did what they do they use\nSure so on the way that the IPC she works um is on in this particular case under the Paris Agreement there was an accompanying decision and that decision\nOn requested the eyepiece ISI the inter governmental panel on climate change to put this report together\nOn and what the scientists do they commissioned about a hundred different scientists\nUm had had a very lengthy review process of several different drafts being um reviewed publicly reviewed and I was one of the reviewers for that on the scientist basically assessed all of the recent literature and in this case on one point five degrees Celsius and see what the science says\nI'm up to a certain cut off point where the literature is published\nOn and then they put together a detailed technical analysis interestingly in this case there's an accompanying summary for policymakers which was agreed upon in Korea um about a week ago and that all of the government signed onto including the United states and that is actually\nBeing um reviewed publicly reviewed and I was one of the reviewers for that on the scientist basically assessed all of the recent literature and in this case on one point five degrees Celsius\nAnd see what the science says I'm up to a certain cut off point where the literature is published\nOn and then they put together a detailed technical analysis interestingly in this case on there's an accompanying summary for policymakers which was agreed upon in Korea\nUm about a week ago and that all of the

with study scores so\nI'm I'm from Brazil and uh I went to grad school here in the states and uh I knew that I wanted to work in the Brazilian Amazon for my research\nAnd I started reading about square monkeys and became fascinated with them and then I saw them in the wild and it was just the perfect combination to look at the questions that I was interested in\nSo off I went to um Amazon and Brazil for twelve months\nAnd I thought it would just be one you know one project one season but the more time I spent there the more I became fascinated with all kinds of questions about them\nAnd I couldn't find a lot of answers in the literature because there really aren't that many people studying them in the wild\nUm I kind of know why now after so many years there are a little bit of a pain to study they're very challenging [noise] um but yeah that's how it all started\nWow I'm a big show how many do you study how many of the group a number of your study\nYeah so um the groups are very large a there but my groups have thirty to fifty animals so I monitor to a sweet groups regularly\nAnd I do do they each have each personalities of the room and you give them names like you keep track of them\nSquirm one of the challenges of working with squirrel monkey to that because they're so small and by small I mean we're talking a kilogram max so that's about two pounds\nThere's fifty of them and they are they move quite fast they're pretty active so it's not that easy to individually identify them I'm particularly the juveniles because they they kind of look very similar but there are\nSo I monitor to a sweet groups regularly\nAnd I do do they each have each personalities of the room and you give them names like you keep track of them some\n... square one of the challenges of working with squirrel monkey to that because they're so small and by small I mean we're talking a kilogram max so that's about two pounds\nThere's fifty of them and they are they move quite fast they're pretty active\nSo it's not that easy to individually identify them a particularly the juveniles because they they kind of look very similar but there are some adults that stand out you know if they have a a certain more dominant or forceful personality or yeah they do stand out\nOkay give me a typical day in the life of a squirrel monkey [noise]\nOkay so square monkeys wake up really early I'm usually by five AM they're already moving out of their sleeping tree and uh they spend a lot of time active all day they they're nonstop\nOr they eat a fruit and they eat mostly insects and so they spend a lot of time forging in the morning for insects but really that goes on all day when it gets a little hotter in the day they tend to rest but rest for a group of ... monkeys is about ten minutes [laughter]\nUm and then they keep on you know forging and um they don't go to sleep we followed them a pretty consistently and um they don't usually go to their sleeping tree until about seven\n... for their practice or twelve hours I hear that they have a strange way of eating grasshopper yes\nSo grasshoppers are one of their favorite uh items so to speak and um they catch these pretty large grasshopper sometimes and the way they do it the way they handle it once they grab it is they hold it by the bottom\nOn you know forging and um they don't go to sleep we followed them a pretty consistently and um they don't usually go to their sleeping tree until about seven\n... for their practice or twelve hours I hear that they have a strange way of eating grasshopper\nYes so grasshoppers are one of their favorite uh items so to speak and um they catch these pretty large grasshoppers sometimes and the way they do it the way they handle it once they grab it is they hold it by the bottom\nAnd a with a head up and then they bite off the head\nKind of like an ice cream cone and then they slurp the insides and then finally they'll eat the legs and the wings sometimes\nAnd they seem very happy while they're doing it wow\n[laughter] and I understand they're not afraid to attack a ... a wasp mess right why don't why haven't they do that yeah so\nI've only seen adults do it but I've actually seen it quite a bit so what what they do is they will approach a ... a particular species\nAnd um they will knock it down very quickly to the ground so these are nuts that Hank pretty low and once the adult lost desert the nest\nThe adult a squirrel monkey will basically move in and eat all the larvae that ... left abandoned in the nest\nWow for their pretty brave they're pretty bad and patient and patient [laughter] those watch for not leaving so far right yeah I've done this myself we have a clip I'd like to play and then maybe you can translate for us what's going on here let's\nOf ... of of of of the other one of the spider monkey let's let's hear that clip\n\nDesert the nest the adult a squirrel monkey will basically move in and eat all the larvae that left abandoned in the nest\nWow so they're pretty brave they're pretty bad and patient inpatient [laughter] it was once we're not leaving so right yeah I've done this myself problem we have a clip I'd like to play and then maybe you can translate for us what's going on here let's of ... of of of the other one of the spider ... let's let's hear that clip\n[noise] I\n... I said spider monkey everybody does that ever is that right yeah okay tell us when we're listening to [noise]\nOkay so this was recorded in captivity um and what it sounds like to me is that these are contact calls but these are made by animals that are not very close by these are longer contact calls\nI'm so they're basically talking to each other from you know not not a very close spatial proximity\nCan can you actually tell the individual monkeys in there you can you recognize their own\nUm I didn't recognize yes um the the the sender and the receiver yeah um but when there's you know ten of them in a tree it's kind of hard to figure out exactly you know who's who's making the vocalization\nWe have another clip that sound a little bit more how shall I put a contentious mhm [noise]\n\nOkay so that's definitely a little squabble um it doesn't sound like a serious fight to me like something we hear in the wild um my guess is that there was an adult male at least in there\nHard to figure out exactly you know who's who's making the vocalization\nWe have another clip that sound a little bit more how shall I put a contentious mhm [noise]\n\nOkay so that's definitely a little squabble um it doesn't sound like a serious fight to me like something we hear in the wild um my guess is that there was an adult male at least in there making one of the noises and my guess is that there is a quick fight over some food item\nYou know it's interesting as I was listening to that and it just struck me that when we we see movies of jungles or you know that that that's the sad that we hear is that right there there's usually this is those squirrel monkeys and we're listening to\nIt might it might be birds actually because squirrel monkey sound a lot like birds when you're in the forest um that's what my students usually notices that isn't that a bird and it's you have to listen to really closely to be able to identify that it's a group of square monkeys instead of\nBird and how hard was it how much time has it taken you to know the difference and to study this sounds to me\nSo it's not something that I personally study but just from studying there for Eighteen years I'm from being with the monkeys\nUm you just get used to it um it's it's probably took me you know the whole twelve months to figure out what the different vocalizations or but ah my field assistant who's a local field assistant he's\nThe monkey whisper and knows everything about square monkey then so he can tell right away if it's a bird or a troop of monkeys\nAnd how long have you been doing that for a little longer he started with with uh\nBut just from studying there for Eighteen years I'm from being with the monkeys um you just get used to it um it's it's probably took

do this and well like\nAny good trip you need a map and not just a compass that's just telling you where north is you also need to know the location of the place you're going to get to is it straight north ... and more north east east and south well you know a few years ago researchers concluded\nThat what if they had long to suspected that Pacific salmon can detect\nThe magnetic field lines of the year their map is they're magnetic and what about their land to dwelling cousins and when you let fish living quiet landlocked lines you know lived their whole lives with dozens of generations landlocked what happens to that map\nHere to explain Moore's Michelle Scanlon a faculty research assistant Oregon State University in Corvallis welcome to science friday\nThank you for having me\nYou know I just I just said it but but salmon live impressive lives right they travel all that way how many miles do their journeys tech\nThere is pretty impressive and their journey can be hundreds or even thousands of miles to their oceanic forging grounds ...\nAnd and they usually ... of these tiny streams miles inland and I have to go back there that's correct and they don't just have to navigate upstream they have to find the right stream to go how do they do they said that they don't have a well maybe they do have a GPS of some sort in there\nYou know I just I just said about but salmon living impressive lions raping travel all that way how many miles do their journeys to\nThat is pretty impressive and their journeys\nCan be hundreds or even thousands of miles to their oceanic forging grounds ...\nAnd and they usually actually these tiny streams miles inland and I have to go back there that's correct and they don't just have to navigate upstream have to find the right stream to go how does he do this and they don't have a well maybe they do have a GPS of some sort in\nThis ah same and have a diverse\nArray of tools that they use in order to navigate and so when they reached streams uh they generally would use their sense of smell but in terms of the oceanic journeys and voyages they use something more broad scale and in this term we think they're using magnetic maps and magnetic information\n... now I Know that your research is looking at a different group of salmon be lapped exam and what what makes them so interesting to you\nThis is rather interesting opportunity because the Atlantic salmon that we use for this study are actually descendants\nOf individuals that were transferred from a landlocked lake\nIn Maine to a landlocked lake in Oregon over sixty years ago for recreational fishery so these fish have never had access to the Pacific ocean and have never sat than outside of a lake or in the instance of our fish outside of the hatchery\nAnd yet you found that they still have these Jew magnetic maps in them that they would have needed that they not been ... that's correct and and how were they able to retain these and why\nAn interesting question a so CNN when they use\nYears ago for recreational fishery so these fish have never had access to the Pacific ocean and have never sat than outside of a lake or in the instance of our fish outside of the hatchery\nAnd yet you round but they still have these Jew magnetic maps and that they would have needed that they knocked ... that's correct and and how were they able to retain these and why\nThat's an interesting question a so Salman when they use magnetic information they can use different aspects of the magnetic field especially for maps and so the earth's magnetic field has a couple of different components one is the strength of the magnetic field\nOr also known as my dad field intensity and so those intensities are stronger at the polls and weaker at the equator another aspect\nOf the field that they can use is called a inclination angle and that's the angle at which magnetic field lines intersect the surface of the earth\nAnd so they're steeper toward the polls and shallower at the equator and both of these components predict are favorably are predictably variable across the surface of the globe\nSo super convenient because these gradients of intensity and inclination angles aren't parallel so they form a type of by coordinate grid over much of the earth and so animals can actually derive both latitude and longitude all information from the magnetic field\nTo have little magnets in their bodies that can do them\nThey're the mechanisms behind Meg NATO reception are are still unclear but one of the leading hypotheses is that a salmon and other species have tiny chains of\nThe intensity and inclination angles aren't parallel so they form a type of by coordinate grid over much of the earth and so animals can actually derive both latitude and longitude all information from the magnetic field\nTo have little magnets in their bodies that can do them so\nThey're the mechanisms behind Meg NATO reception are are still unclear but one of the leading hypotheses is that\nA salmon and other species\nHave tiny chains of magna tight and that is an iron oxide mineral that has magnetic property ... and so these chains of mango tight are associated with nerve cells and the thought is that the change can be pulled by or strength magnetic fields\nAnd so changes in both the field strengths and or the inclination angle can result in action potentials\nSo these made ... structures are thought to be found in the nose\nAnd also the latter alliance all along the sides of the body of a fish\nBut the ... meter receptor itself a is still elusive\nAnd worry winds may be important to you why why does it matter that they can still detect these\nWell it's a rather interesting question [noise] so we wanted to know whether landlocked numbers of species that could go to the ocean retain a map sense just to point of curiosity and we also wanted to know um if it lent examine\nAlso possess disability it's another group of individuals that\nDoes ethnic maps and a lot of diverse amount not amounts of species but we also wanted to know what happens when you test animals in novel sort of magnetic\nOne can they even detect a magnetic field\nTo know whether landlocked numbers of species that could\nGo to the ocean retain a map sense just to a point of curiosity\nAnd we also wanted to know um if it Lennox\nSalmon also possesses ability it's another group of individuals that does ethnic maps of diverse and not know amounts of species but we also wanted to know what happens when you test animals in novel sort of magnetic\nEnvironments one can they even detect the magnetic field but to can they actually differentiate between those fields and three how did they actually respond\nMhm and so how did you go about testing research\nSo the eggs from the individuals at the lake in Oregon and were transported to the organ hatchery Research Center where they were rewritten subsequently tested\nAnd so we tested these individuals' using a series of magnetic coil and essentially it's a series of wouldn't frames that are wrapped in copper wire and when you attach copper wires to an electrical power supply\nAnd crank electric current through the magnetic coil a byproduct of that\nIs a magnetic field and the really cool part about are coils is that allows us to\nAlter the direction and also the average of current in order to allow us to simulate magnetic fields from almost anywhere on earth\n... so what you're doing I Know for my basic physics you know great schools and if I take a magnetized object and put it next to some mentally will magnum pi the mental in a certain direction\nSo that sounds to me basically what you're doing to assure you magnify them shutting beer magnetic structures up to to know where they are in a certain direction\n... is that allows us to\nAlter the direction and also the average of current in order to allow us to simulate magnetic fields from almost anywhere on earth\n... so what you're doing I Know for my basic physics you know in grade school of if I take a magnetized object and put it next to some mentally will magnetized the mental in a certain direction\nSo that sounds to me basically what you're doing to the fish or you magnify them setting beer magnetic structures up to to know where they are in a certain direction\nIf that were present them with magnetic fields essentially that hopefully interact with what we think are these tiny chains\nOf NATO type right that somehow connect with an herself right and and so having a fish respond to this\nSo we evaluate the movement ... by censoring the fish in the ... so there's a a platform with a bunch of testing arenas we have one fish Purina and then we have cameras that are mounted above those testing arenas to give us a bird's eye view of the test subjects during the trials\nSo what this means is that we are generating thousands of photos of our fish and so we take photos and we assess the position of the fishes head relative to magnetic north\nThat's terrific and and you know um do do you know how good the resolution they have is I mean how just how accurate they can be to these magnetic fields\nThat is a question for future research so we don't know the how finer course scale to maintain a resolution of those ...\n... so what so ... speaking of looking forward what would you like to do what kind of other experiments or equipment\nTo have to magnetic north\nThat's terrific and and you know um do do you know how good the resolution they have is I mean you know how
