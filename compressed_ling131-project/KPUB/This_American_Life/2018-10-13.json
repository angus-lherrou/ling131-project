they're running their first drill in the school building with a gun French and the boxes [noise]\n\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around the district um rural Ohio they let us record on the condition that we not see their name on the air\nThe day people on this team only two teachers volunteered for the rest of the guidance counselor to custodians through administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman on the team that issue is pollock watch them doing this we used to so I'm explain how this work exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations of at the school [noise] I saw the ride a bunch of drills and then all of them the goal was to run to the nearest safe get the gun out of the safe and then get to where the shooter as as soon as possible\nAnd they time each drill okay we're going to pay for this is one of one listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks that he fired during these drills\nSo the first little glitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble getting into the ... you had to put your finger on the sensor is like a fingerprint\nAnd it's a little tricky my\nThere's a sheriff's deputy he's playing to shoot [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John he's the principal for grade six to twelve [noise]\nAnd he's running from his office starts by the cafeteria\nHe's got a gun Israel bullet proof vest he's holding a walkie talkie very focused\nArea where the clock is ticking he told me that every few seconds and one of these shootings another kid getting killed\nHe's holding a walkie talkie very focused\nArea where the clock is ticking he told me that every few seconds and\nOne of these shootings and other kid can kill enough of this way [noise]\nElementary awareness in the elementary when [noise]\nUnless you're willing to building also has middle school and high school right so the principles\nRunning down the hallway and it's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there's a door there and it's like this happens automatically when the school goes into lockdown the heat and the two guys with him are stuck ... for his keys and he's trying to find the right one\nHe's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\n\nAll right here we go we go [noise] door opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there [noise] so that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything they're just timing the response and it wasn't great\nThat wasn't attorneys appeared at the first yeah oh yeah it was it was the doors [noise]\n\nWe said so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seem like the best option to though\nI I talked to John the principal about this yeah um for a long time he agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even though he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he says he's not a gun guy did grow up with guns had never used one\nThey came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have its own police force ... so if a shooter gotten the building they could be waiting a long time\nThey came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have it some police force so if a sitter gotten that do things they could be waiting a long time for help\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right\nThing to do but\nYou know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you worry you worry because you realize that you're on your own\nAnd and so I wanted to learn [noise] so I went out and started learning how to shoot a gun and how to handle it down\nAnd which is different you know first time you shoot a gun that's pretty scary it was scary to me\nAfter that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd would exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target ... close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision\nThis is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around how close to you have to get before you're ... you're going to hit that target\nYou've got to shoot that target Cindy can mess [noise]\nI Can't miss\nBecause if I miss\nThere's a possibility or somebody else getting hurt [noise]\nAll right and I can't let that happen [noise]\nI Can't let it be me who hurts\nUs doing it in my school\nOf course he might have to she wanted a student and a lot of these shootings that to the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking [noise] I I wouldn't have believed but\nThings don't stop happening they just continue to happen\nAnd I wouldn't have believed but\nThings don't stop happening they just continue to happen\n[noise]\nThese shootings do just continue to happen [noise]\nDid they interpret them we have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare\nLike the staff at the school\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shootings it looks at past to just be the future knowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish the shooter gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nThat one of our show today where people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put in measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly\nCan and it's still not enough to where people who invented something that actually seems to work and help\nThe b._b._c. Chicago it's this American Life America ... stay with us [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] ...\nEdwin ... will never be\nPretty school just trying to figure out the best ways to prepare for gunmen there's an example out there that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained their students are new procedures they should follow in that exact situation\nJust came after a total over how the schools emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nDon't think they could have been more prepared than worse than in a new way to get me\nEven sell even when we still had\nPast okay I'm going to return to their families\nEven still even with that and we still had\nCats are the people that are going\nDid the training they received save lives that day or didn't it such an open question what about producers Robin semi and went to park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for what they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane warnings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDouglas is a school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments\nMultiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher and that news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner she believes in a good hard think and being proactive\nOnce she and the other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills those school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying when you know the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures\nThis is what we do for ... for every period for every ... this is what a code black is this is what we do it for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kid was you have to do it with each and every class\nBecause they wanted to make sure that the kids [noise] knew the procedures that it was like ingrained in their mind and that they knew so if they were asked to non silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nSchool colors silver burgundy their on an alternating schedule [noise]\nMelissa says her kids took the drill seriously\nThey would get it on a burgundy day school colors silver burgundy their on an alternating schedule [noise]\nMelissa says her kids to the drill seriously\nOn a scale of one to ten I Would say we were totally prepared like attend\nI see like hundreds of kids running out of the freshmen building flicking terrified\nYou know when you see terrified kids running like that and it's they they're not there there is no rhyme or reason it was chaos and then you hear that you can hear the gunshots and it's just it's that is not what the drill was\nKnew it was real [noise]\nThat is not what the drill was she knew it was real [noise]\n[noise]\nFor like the next Ninety seconds as kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running don't stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group\nKids that are running towards the freshman building oh man I was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nWow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total body is in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people in\nYes it was [laughter]\nYes it was laughing\nThere were terrified people running and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that I\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol and follow your instinct for some teachers that wasn't a choice at all [noise]\n[noise] ... ... ...\nIn her classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency folder you kind of Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway the group is small enough to fitness apply apply that someone had told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and move there\nFrom the hallway [laughter] group a small enough to sit in a supply of closets almost had told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and moved there in the closet it was hot and dark except students faces look by their cell phones and Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third for the freshman building she ... she's on the tax to us that says there is a shooter there's a shooter and my floor\nUm and so my ... my friend Sara says\nDrill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been raised by a bullet she was raised in her arm by a bullet\nAnd I didn't hear from her for a while\nIn our one by\nWe heard noises in the hallway um we've got really quiet um I had had a flashlight part of my phone on so that we could kind of like eliminate the closet without having the light on when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody that's comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police officers that this is a police anyone in here and then there was like\nKind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police as anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is a police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is the police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time they set it on like afterward I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly at the hands all and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they had their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shooter saying there\nFor the shooter so I Know they have their weapons drawn she really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were cops and so I just\nVery slowly ... than you pulled on the handle pushed it up and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] was uh told me that actually it was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy held her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yells to you know Scott below the closest door and grabs the handle with two hands and pulls it closed\nUm [noise] so her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nStacy is the teacher who's our most grazed she survived Scott Beagle and the room next to Stacy is at the same things stay seated\nWaited a little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the doorway be\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting drills of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare but now Melissa and actually have been in that rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both told me that having a playbook\nFor what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class and now I Move us all to a closet [noise]\nThey also both had ideas coming out of this about ways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has saved lives and mass shootings\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has saved lives and mass shootings\nI really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help\nDid more kids survive because of it\nWhat might have worked better Cheryl Johnson researches what's effective in these drills at Xavier University and as a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters\nAlice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international has its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew that done at Douglas like paper over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much it's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms\nAlso code ran all the codes their colors and meanings consumes I talked to said no to this too\nI'm a big advocate for not using codes at all I if I say could read your takes a split second for your brain to go pay code red meat fad means active shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I say there is a gunman in the fall [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked ... but\nThat this is all you do [noise] that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways to respond to a shooting sometimes you stay in your room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more exits like a cafeteria gym\nAs a last resort\nLike if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more exits like a cafeteria gym\nAs a last resort you cite basically trust your ability to make a decision [noise]\nI told her to ask her how she eats dinner doorway grabbing of dozens of scared student I'm a rose up right from her school's protocol Cheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed actually did the right thing pulling in kids the problem with\nThat and unless you're there you don't know you know what exactly happened now does she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with the gunman being in a different building yes\nOne thing that was part of their training at Douglas was barricaded on your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against your classroom door but most of them actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did they actually had done it\nAnd she followed the protocol locked him barricaded her door right away\nIt would have been way harder to pull those kids into her room from the hallway\nShut the on barricade herself first\nFewer kids would emitted in\nOn this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school\nMy daughter's nine fourth grade\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school squatting hide\nBut when I asked her what the journalists for she said I don't know exactly and say\nI keep thinking about this one shooting the red lake Indian reservation shooting and how that one\nClassroom students did a traditional lockdown squatting high because they practiced it\nAnd how it investigator on that case told me\nThat Israel did not help them at all\nThat have been better off without it\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drills at school\nThat have been better off without it\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drills at school\nTo traumatizing for kids\nWe don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nI don't agree with no drills at all\nI Want my daughter to know everything\nAllowed her to know about barricaded\nAnd I want her to know about running in fighting back\nI Want her to know that active shooters because the thing to reckon with\nI Want her to know there's nothing that can keep her completely safe\nName is Tom present ski he graduated last year there across the set up for three people he knew well one of them with that\nHis name is ... he graduated last year\nThere were crosses set up for three people he knew well one of them was a teacher named ms Perkins we really loved\nHe said she always tried to be strict with them can never keep coming up front for very long\nJust breeze taken nice the press he can nice the rat [noise]\nOkay okay [laughter]\nAfter a few minutes he's caught his breath enough to talk\nHe tell Sandy he wants to shoot him to stop you want to take action somehow\nAnd then Chad's suddenly switches gears and start filling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nYou know is is the evidence is going on in this world [noise] taking drugs or was this ... because they're strictly drugs drugs doors are still able to do and\nHe plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turned Twenty one later this year to fill those are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun they believe in a Second Amendment but they're also advocates for universal background checks and tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and accessories like bump stocks a person can buy\nHowever Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach their primary goal is to support but it's impossible for grieving parents\nTo avoid the politics around guns there is a whole movement a conspiracy theorists who believe that the U.S government stages mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are fake he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the Philips has ran into him face to face and a gun control of that\nIn that mass shootings are fake he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the Philips has ran into him face to face and a gun control of that he accused him of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and then I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of them it looked like a shouting match with about to start until Sandy stepped in and broke it up I reached out to jump through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nNoticed truth ... trolls families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting this can get dangerous after the Philips is on gave interviews and Aurora he got death threats and had to get the FBI involved the man who was\nThreatening him ended up in jail cell hoaxes or one of the things that Philips has warned parents about they tell families to brace themselves\nMhm Mm mhm [noise]\nMhm after watching Lonnie and Danny in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with her daughter shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home in Texas this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time she got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at the multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started just his friend called Sandy from the theater\nMinute I picked up the phone there was screaming dress [noise] horrible screaming in them\n[noise] [noise] screaming just\n[noise] horrible screaming in the background panic and he said um there's been a shooting and I like what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been\nAt a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left a food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in an open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but he's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been hit twice and it was when he said that that I went\nWhy isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I tried\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was so low it was so horrific and took to never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their ...\nJesse with one of twelve people killed that night another Seventy people\nWere injured and then five months later there was another mass shooting\nWere twenty first graders insects educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the Philips is\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and asked that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents they're\nSandy said they didn't even have to think about it they immediately said yes\nBecause they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died [noise]\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown Sandy says\nThey felt nervous uncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence you know it's like walking into a funeral of people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband and we walked in\nWe feel angry are grateful about their presence you know it's like walking into a funeral of people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and\nI saw their faces\nAnd he said that's what we look like five months ago\nThat looked like\nThey're hanging on to each other um they've been crying so their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like\nTheir bodies are moving that they're not really there\nI realized that's what I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nShe wanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back Sandy says it was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw\nBut the Philips has said there was also a strong and in some sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away from well they were there they ran into parents from other mass shootings to parents from Virginia Tech\nIn Tucson these parents had lots of kids suddenly and violently in places where they thought that they were safe\nTo Philips has now had parents that they can lean on to\nThis is the moments that launched the Phillip says into what's become their life work they could see the need there no experts on what to do when your child dies in a mass shooting the only experts are the people it's happened to help them find each other money and Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things everything from medical bills and charity scams that use kids go to to raise money how to get your child's body home if you live out of state however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nThey want you to move on which they want you to get back to normal my own brother should they should you not the same as you were\nAnd they want you to move on with you they want you to get back to normal my own brother should face should you're not the same as you were shouldn't you know let me explain children you're right I'm not the same person I never will be they should as we're obsessed with it well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nThe Phillip says in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief never fades old relationship start to fall away people who were closest to disappear which makes us informal support groups even more crucial [noise]\nWithout support looks like over time what it means to the parents who get it [noise] I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida who lost their son in the shooting in Parkland Monica in that store at\nAnd let them at their house there is something was Nick he was the captain the Parkland swim team was about to go to the University of Indianapolis honest when scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid\nWho collected different flavors of Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops Mitt said they'd just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play less and watch Scarface together the day of the shooting ... phone calls and tax all day from people who said they'd heard Nick was okay one person said they heard\nHe'd been moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting another set of police officer was giving him a ride home\nAnd then a nurse at a local hospital said she saw patient who mash next description but by that evening the door at still hadn't heard directly from Nick they went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated as a meeting area they sat in a ballroom with other parents and waited\nEvery time the phone rang he jumped in and gets Nick calling from somebody else's phone um media was telling you you have any comments can we help you find your son and as you say [noise]\nAnd I'm at\nUm [noise] the media was calling you do you have any comments can we help you find your son and I was just like [noise]\nAnd um at two o'clock in the morning we see this FBI car and then they start pulling one family into rooms at a time and the years like screams from these rooms\nThan their names were called out\nEven walking into that room you have this tiny little hope that they're going to say like we we couldn't even find your son you know and I hope that he was somewhere else and I'm taking keep I'm thinking maybe you walked home and and then you do the math in your head like to take that long to our house\nAnd then they told us the news that he was gone he was shot than he was never brought to the hospital it'll\nJust like a nightmare second ...\nNext body was still at the school because he died instantly and the building was still a crime scene it'd be two days before they could see him on a good wanted to look at his injuries Mitch did not\nOn a good
