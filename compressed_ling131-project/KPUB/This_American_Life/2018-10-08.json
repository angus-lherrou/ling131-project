these last few years\nWhere red America and blue America look at the exact same event and come to radically different conclusions and to me this one feels the worst I think because the original hearing itself with Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh\nTestimony was just so wow like it was so many hours and then both witnesses were so emotionally wrong\nThat even watching it was emotional it was upsetting\nAnd then since that hearing we've had this week of waiting for the FBI report which held us all for a week in that same state vegetation and disbelief\nRepublican disbelief that the

that was let's wait a week is Jeff Flake who made the Senate wait for a new FBI investigation than it was a yes again\nA British is do we choose to spend a lot of time with Jeff Flake of last year you may remember the hour long episode she did recording him for months and then he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill and she was with him in the days before and after the Kavanaugh hearing watching what is going through and talking to him about how we made his choices there's always\nThe first thing I Want to talk about is the elevator okay it's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because

tune\nIn this case though I think he was miserable he just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh ... dashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters and around the corner to get to the elevator to get to the boat and now he was stuck you\nKnow\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said in that elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country flick and declared that he'll be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination then he was confronted by a mob of screaming protesters the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake crumbled\nArch halo was one of the two women and that confrontation with her play good morning good morning when that elevator door closed
