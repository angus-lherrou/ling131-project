hadn't forgotten that are passed it happened she just forgotten that I witnessed part of it interfere it became clear the one that have been knowing it or or entire conversation was that I was calling to say she'd damage to me by exposing me to it\nI don't think I was kind of accent because there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family and that that's what my fear is that I might have had

the other I needed to remember the part of Susan that she doesn't think about much her talk mess in the face of hardship she said she mostly remembered the side of my family but I just take for

to her shiny red boom box\nIt was crude yes but the story sounded remarkably like story from this American Life not for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it onto the radio but this week's show however we had her put together another story using that same style\nWhich we added music to here at the radio station to make it fully sound like story on our
