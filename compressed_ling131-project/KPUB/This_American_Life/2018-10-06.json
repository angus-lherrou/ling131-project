you know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not the one time he spoke in the hearing he sounded just as I'm sure as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nThis is not a good process but it's all we've got a I Would just urge colleagues to recognize that and then we are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and
