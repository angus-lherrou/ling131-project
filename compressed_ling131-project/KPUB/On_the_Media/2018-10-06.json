Nineteen Seventy classic vary by heart when to me is the most widely read a book about American indian history ever published and Seventeen languages never out of print it sold over for a million copies I read that book when I was in college\nI was thrilled to be introduced to a book about me and and the very first pages the book he says something like this book is about the Indians planes wars from Eighteen fifty to Eighteen Ninety\nI start at the beginning of the wars and the end of the massacre wounded knee where the culture and civilization of the American Indian was finally destroyed if you ever happened to travel through modern Indian reservation and you notice the poverty in the hopelessness and the squalor I Hope I reading my book you'll understand why\nI I Can't tell

humiliating it was to be praised and and held up on one hand and then silenced and done away with on the other\nOne reason why you found dairy my heart at wounded knee doubly dismaying you put it is because your reservation leech lake reservation in northern Minnesota wasn't nowhere place when nothing happened and good ideas went to die\nIt took a great amount of effort to try and see myself the

intelligence to live fully realized and satisfying lives on our own terms\nToni Morrison once said that if there's a book you want to read and it doesn't exist for then you you have to write it and that's exactly what I've tried to do\nThe occupation of Alcatraz that was the year before the browns books came out described what happened there yeah Alcatraz\nSuddenly thrust Indians into the national spotlight they declared at Indian land and they camped out there and they had a bunch of demands they hoped would be met and they really weren't met\nWe wish to be fair a novel in our dealings with the Caucasian and having this this land nearby all for the following treated real purchase ... for twenty four dollars and glass beads and red cloth precedent set by the white man's purchase of a similar island about three hundred years ago\nI think it was kind of tune from the start there was a lot of chaos that occurred on Alcatraz and that kind of tolerance for dissent for drama and even violence came along with subsequent activists movements in the seventies\nJust as we got down there the whole the whole courtyard was covered with a FBI agents right they all had rifles and shotguns and and they and they searched me\nI don't think it was meant to achieve a direct and but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our plight but our continued existence

was meant to achieve a direct and but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our plight but our continued existence and also direct people's attention toward the responsibility of the government toward the first people of this country and it did definitely do that\nIn Seventy two you were a baby when a few hundred Indians led a caravan to Washington dubbed the trail of broken treaties\nSecure than was the brainchild of both the American Indian movement and tribal leaders from places like Standing Rock my own personal view is that\nThe takeover of the bureau of Indian affairs which ensued was in many ways skewed by the kind of unhealthy self promotion of people like Russell Means who was a Lakota activist who was one of the founders of aim and who thought a great deal of himself\nWas it really an effort to get a meeting with President Nixon\nYes I mean they hammered out sort of a a bill of rights if you will that they were going to present the government\nThey one of the bureau of Indian affairs to be revamped from top to bottom because it had done a dismal job it was paternalistic and it was short sighted and\nIt lost billions of dollars of native money that it was holding and trust that were the result of grazing in timbre in mineral leases among other things the government still hadn't cops to the fact that it was ignoring it's basic treaty obligations and this takeover supposed to draw attention to it\nBut then the people who are in the trash the place and did something like six million dollars of damage to the building itself\nAnd the whole occupation ended when these sort of dark agents of government like Frank ... one of next\nFrom top to bottom because it had done the dismal job it was paternalistic and it was short sighted

something like sixty six thousand dollars to get them to leave which they took none of at sixty six thousand dollars or it's not that I can tell made its way into the rank and file and the very poor Indians who put themselves on the line to join the caravan\nAnd then there was another\nDramatic act of protest and this time it was that the symbol of Indian suffering and injustice\nThat's right in Seventy three there was the takeover in the siege of wounded knee\nI Believe that the current that we have the virus in order to be heard [noise]\nI don't want to see him when he killed [noise]\nKind
