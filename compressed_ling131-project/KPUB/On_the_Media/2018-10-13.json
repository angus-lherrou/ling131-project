history Aristotle actually use that story to try to understand himself where money came from and what the kind of good and bad functions of money could be\nAnd in the nineteenth century as economics was becoming professionalized economists picked up this barter origin story for money and kind of set it forced into the world\nUm the thing is that we just don't see that situation ever happening if you go to a New Guinea village and the highlands and see people exchanging shells for pigs you might think a ha there it is\nThis is for instance you attack a plated string decorated with calories and

stories are serving contemporary interests so if we want to believe that the market as it exists today and that money as it exists today is natural normal inevitable\nThan something like the barter origin story helps us justify it continued existence helps disabled look you know this is a rational response to the problem with a double coincidence of wants which is what economists call that
