A. M. U. dot org glad to hear from some of you across the state of Florida\nAbout what you're looking for from the next governor Larry tweeted I Hope that when he wins mayor Gillum will remember the poorest counties in my former home of the northwest Florida panhandle\nThey may be the ... parts of Florida but represents a real opportunity for a Democratic Party reaching out to the working class citizens of our state\nThat is a such an important point and I have to tell you having just helped to lead my community through the impacts of hurricane Michael er we had Ninety percent of our power knocked out thousands of trees come down roads that were blocked\nA within a week uh we had Ninety nine and a half percent of people with their power restored roads cleared\nAnd a sense of normalcy returned to my community and the first thing we did was dispatch a our utility workers or to the western panhandle just west of us\nAre to begin that recovery effort for our neighbors are the Gulf Coast region will return we will return stronger than ever but the next governor will help to preside over that restoration\nUh when when we are hit with natural disasters we come together as Floridians ah whether or not that that politically that that is a community that will be for me\nIs of no consequence there Floridians and there were a part of a of our state they is often been forgotten whether forgotten coast would not be forgotten under a governor Gillum not only are we going to see that community restored we're also going to work with them to help to\nWhere the forgotten cos would not be forgotten under a governor Gillum not only are we going to see that community restored we're also going to work with them to help to define in economic future for that region that again makes them the pride of the state of Florida\nBefore we had one more voice to our conversation let me follow up with you on that a little bit one of the conversations that constantly comes up whether it was after Hurricane Harvey last year after hurricane Michael this year Hurricane Florence earlier\nIs about the future of these coastal communities you know parts of Florida like Mexico beach in of basically the whole Florida coastline all the way around the state or in areas that are very much at risk for rising water levels ... Gulf levels ocean levels\nAs climate change progress is and it becomes increasingly difficult matter as to whether or not people are allowed to live\nRight next to the shore I mean you saw the satellite or the the drone pictures of homes that were built up to the two thousand one building code and homes that weren't the whole world were standing and homes and weren't we're we're we're toothpicks basic that's right that Governor that that's got to be a tough decision kind of considering whether or not the state of Florida at a certain point has\nTo tell people we know you love the ocean we know you love the Gulf but it is not safe to live here\nYou know it's it's such a fair point uh and and and and and in fact speaking about building codes or we may have to revisit a building codes again and light of the fact that we're seeing stronger in and and more increase storms I'm particularly up the Gulf where the Gulf waters are so warm\nI but then if then if you tell people where they can't live that affects the property tax base that affects the economy I mean well less than\nRight now we have the insurer a last resort in this state have undercover homes I'm Better nice in luxurious and yes you know ocean front properties but private insurance companies are refusing to write policies there and so that puts the entire state at risk\nAnd yes you know ocean front properties but private insurance companies are refusing to write policies there and so that puts the entire state at risk for having to ensure a homes that are being built in areas that are increasingly becoming\nUm a a threatened by rising sea levels so so what I Would say is is that we are deserving of a real estate why conversation likely county by county around how it is that we are going to be building more resilient communities\nThat in the face of sea level rise and climate change that it doesn't make sense and some of these areas that we allow for properties to be built\nAnd to be built and frankly in an ... way when we know that they are going to be susceptible to being wiped out\nUh with these increase storm of events and with sea level rise I I Can't I Can't tell you that there's a panacea [noise] I Can't I Can't tell you in this moment what exact part of the state we would be having to begin this conversation I think is going to be a statewide conversation and it's one that we're gonna have to lean into with county and local governments\nI Want to reiterate by the way we did invite the Republican candidate for Florida governor Rhonda ... take part in this discussion or a feature discussion we have not yet heard back from his campaign but the invitation stands we would certainly loved to have him on the program\nLet's add one more voice of the discussion now to the questioning now joining us from W ELL are in public radio in Miami is least Hernandez who's the host of its daily talk show son dial Luis welcome to want to a\nA Joshua thank you so much I appreciate it\nAnd mayor again thank you I appreciate the opportunity I Do want to note that ah thirty one of sixty seven counties in Florida have started early voting and the counties are most of the counties here in the VW all around listening area including Palm Beach Florida Miami Dade County have begun early voting\nI'm Mr Mayor it looks as though Republicans are going to hold the Florida\nPalm Beach brought in Miami Dade county's have begun early voting I'm Mr Mayor it looks as though Republicans are going to hold the Florida House and Senate so how do you plan to get any of your ideas through if the opposing party is in control of the two chambers\nWell one ah Luis good to hear your voice again uh um it to 'em and well aware and thankful for your reminder of the early voting we actually had some of our supporters who overnight it\nLast night watching the debate and where the first in line to vote down in Miami for early voting but to your question one I Am not joined the conclusion that Republicans will hold the Senate um I think they will likely be in position to to hold the house but I think Democrats will get some gains\nThat being said we will have a divided government um um I Would say this I think we've got to look too aware of the areas where we might be able to find some cooperation\nI mentioned earlier that I thought criminal justice reform was one area where we might be able to bring Democrats and Republicans together to help get a salvage solution that might lead to a saving money\nAnd modernizing or a system that is in desperate need of update 'em and I will tell you I'm I'm willing and prepared to work with or what might be a speaker holy oh a lever\nI'm here and I spent some time together or for two years making our way through\n'em and Aspen Institute fellowship when we got to know each other pretty well now I don't take that to mean that I'm going to convince them\nTo believe in everything I Believe or vice versa but I definitely think that we begin from a place where we don't think of each other as you know our enemies if you will um were sent there to do the bidding to do the job of of of the people of the state and it's my hope to find areas where we can work together maybe on affordable housing\nOr maybe on dealing with health care in some ways can I convinced them that it makes sense to pull down that six billion dollars for health care which is for the state of Florida\nOr maybe on dealing with health care in some ways can I convinced them that it makes sense to pull down that six billion dollars I'm for health care which is by the state of Florida one of the most exploding parts of our budget\nUm so I'm I'm not beyond working with the other party I also don't draw the conclusion that you have to be the same party in order to work together you probably recall that there were a number of sessions where governor Rick Scott couldn't get his budget through and he shared the same party or with the speaker of the house and with the with the Senate president so\nThere there there may be some benefit in my opinion to negotiating into them negotiating with me\nAnd trying to ah find solutions I Know Floridians are tired of us getting nothing done they want their government to work for them and they're not interested in our part isn't you know squabbles they want to make sure that we can produce\nAnd and you mentioned a couple of different things or want to I wanted to approach you on is the criminal justice issue you know been public about the fact that your family had run ins with the law on both Miami Dade County and when you went to Gainesville\nOr one of your brothers was arrested on drug trafficking charges you mean criminal justice reform one of the critical points of your campaign for governor yeah how did your family's experience with a law at a young age inform these proposals for updating the state's criminal justice system\nI mean so first I mean it shape it shaped it a lot I think if if you recall from my opening video when I introduced myself I talked a bit about\nYou know watching my mother you know two years well up in her face when uh you know the the ... come by the house and say you know your son's in trouble again right um that that's a difficult thing for any child to have to see and experience\nFrom Arizona Public radio in Flagstaff

I think Trump won putting in thirty points Flagler about the same much we've been to the villages\nAre but we are here you know I I Will be at the University of South Florida where I Am today I'm with students um uh just did a roundtable with a Puerto Rican leadership in Orlando a hosted an event\nI'm I'm ... I'm a a little while ago and was in Little Haiti and did a video because I couldn't make it down there a ... doll\nEr which way it really well so we're we're communicating across constituencies and just to give you an example of I think how it is impacting us\nIs that in a primary election we saw a hundred and fifty thousand voters turned out to vote who either one we're voting for the first time or two we had not voted in the previous three elections a hundred and fifty thousand\nOr the last two races for governor Democrats lost by less than Seventy thousand votes\nUm it's my plan to double that number in this general election of unlikely voters and many of those voters will be younger voters of color are more women are more poor voters and I think we're going to perform very very well but the reason why I'd been going to diverse parts of our state\nIs because we got to stop treating the race for governor as if it's the electoral college you don't win one area\nWell but the reason why I'd been going to diverse parts of our state\nIs because we got to stop treating the race for governor as if it's the electoral college you don't win one area and lose another when one county and lose another the one who wins\nIs the one who gets one more vote and that one vote may come through from anywhere throughout the length and the breath of distasteful unprepared to go there will go in because we're going to give voters a reason to turn out and vote for something and not just against\nThere are so many things I Would love to ask you mayor Gil in so many great policy questions we've gotten from our listeners perhaps we'll have a chance to talk to you again but one more matter of policy I'd like to ask you about before we let you go and that has to do with a gun policy in the state of Florida ... two questions from\nTwo of our listeners by email Jim emailed mayor Gillum given that at least the house will be in Republican hands what can be done to reduce the impact of Florida's Stand your ground law it seems unlikely you would be able to repeal it\nAnd then Ryan emailed what do you plan to do to better enforce current gun control laws before trying to pass new legislation ...\nYeah well first I'm a I think we have to work hard I'm at the repeal the stand your ground it is an unnecessary law and the state of Florida we already had castle doctrine which allows for individual to protect themselves and their businesses against intruders um onto their property right\nI'm Sorry I I I hate to interrupt I think we should probably be cleared the difference between what you're talking about just by way of context the castle doctrine you're referring to basically is that kind of your home is your castle idea that says you have the right\nTo use deadly force to defend yourself at home weren't worth stand your ground carries it farther and says you have the right to use deadly force and they feel ... anywhere you have a legal right to be\nBe anywhere yeah and again that's that's vigilante gives them a that's the wow wow west and the city streets of you're able to make a decision or about whether or not you consider some\nThat's the wow wow west and the city streets of you're able to make a decision\nOr about whether or not you consider somebody to be a threat I'm Out of your own imagination or in the recesses of of of your own mind and I think that that is dangerous\nCastle doctrine already protect you and your home there's already common last self defense which means\nAnd places where you are in public square and you result to having to defend yourself with deadly force there's already case law on the books where you been able and you've seen cases where people are able to successfully argued the case that it made sense to be able to use deadly force\nBut to not take that two hundred different extreme and to provide under the cover and the color of the law people being able to sniff out innocent life based based off of their perception of threat\nTo me is is is it is a stretch too far\nUm as it relates to what we can do obviously on that\nI I Want to make the case and I want to use regular voices of Floridians to make the case or to outlaw makers around the absence of common sense when it comes to these kinds of laws and help them understand how families like mine and like others who are raising black children\nAnd black and brown children feel particularly a under siege by laws like these take the case of Trayvon Martin and trace of ... the case of murky smug locked in a and there are many others and quite frankly talk to prosecutors who are saying and are seeing\nA criminals on both sides who are using stand your ground as a way to take out there you know they're they're gang enemies\nBecause they both have weapons so it has also been extended to giving cover for for legitimate illegal practices in our communities and prosecutors are left to do nothing about it because folks are able to ... years as stand your ground as a fan of fans\nWho runs for before we let you go with regards to enforcing current gun laws before trying to\nNothing about it because folks are able to ... stand your ground as a ...\nPoint before we let you go with regards to enforcing current gun laws before trying to pass new ones what would you say the ... so I Would say one\nYes we must enforce a current laws but we also got to do things like ensure that if you want to carry the power of God at your waist but you ought to have a background check\nTo do things like a convicted a domestic violence abuses should not get access to weapons where they can sniff out the lives of their loved ones closing the gun show loophole these are extreme these aren't radical I was too by the n._r._a. in Tallahassee because we refused to repeal an ordinance that our city was simply said you can't shoot guns in city parks\nYou can't you guys in parts for our kids play and our in our families picnic\nAnd that was considered to be too extreme we we've lost the common sense of balance here we're not talking about in the front of the second amendment was simply talking about how do we keep our kids safe in school how do we reduce the level of of ongoing everyday gun violence that pervades our neighborhoods\nAnd we got her it was some decency here and unfortunately they enter re runs roughshod over the state of Florida right now we got to put some decency back into it\nGillum the mayor of Tallahassee, Florida running for governor as a Democrat mayor Gillum we really appreciate you

A. M. U. dot org\nSarah there was one more thing I did want to ask you before\nWe had to let you go we heard from a number of listeners about their thoughts on being in unions not every teacher is satisfied with the union that they're in granted I Can't think of any union that makes all of its members happy but we did hear from John in San Diego who left this voice mail in our inbox\nI'm a member of a teacher's union and while I Do appreciate all the things that union negotiated for us honorary halfway salary health insurance all that kind of stuff um I Do feel like that sometimes the unions can prevent it higher level Caesar accountability\nThat will ultimately lead to higher salaries\nMore competition within the profession I feel that sometimes wants teachers achieved tenure that's negotiated underneath of the union contracts\nThat were unable to continue to drive competition and the teaching market and ultimately compare ourselves to other business areas where competition drives salary growth\nJohn thanks very much for getting in touch with Sarah I'm Wondering what you think of John's commented does have a point to unions allow workers to sometimes rest on their laurels\nWell and and like make a couple of comments about that first off I've not always been happy with everything\nOn their laurels well and\nI'd like to make a couple of comments about that\nUm first off I've not always been happy with everything that my union has done\nBut one thing that I really realized especially this past spring is that the union is the numbers the union is not just your union leaders union movements are driven by members and members need to demand\nAnd you know what they want to see the union do also I Would say I think there's some misunderstanding about you know teacher hiring practices and firing practices um it's actually not that difficult to fire a teacher but what unions has done is made it clear that\nYou can't just fire a person for no reason you do have to give them due process you have to observe than\nYou have to evaluate them you can't just say well we don't really like what you said so we're going to let you go or\nYou know and part of the reason that so important is because\nTeachers that have been around for a lot longer receive higher pay\nAnd if we did not have that due process in place you would see a lot of teachers let go simply because they make higher salaries and you know counties can save money by not keeping those teachers around\nBefore I let you go see her I Know that your goal is to get into the west Virginia House of delegates in trying to work with your dog it's about improving policies for teachers what about West Virginians do you think the residents of your speed\nOr really motivated to see the kinds of changes you're trying to bring about I mean if they were motivated and I wonder if it would have taken the strike\nTo make things happen in West Virginia\nI think that they are motivated and I do believe that that is why the strike was so successful we could not have done what we did without the support of our communities and I think that our communities realize you know it was portrayed in the media as if this\nWe could not have done what we did without the support at our communities\nAnd I think that our communities realize you know it was portrayed in the media is that the strike was just it out hey are just about health care it's not about that not just about that it's about improving conditions for students\nFor teachers for families and for working people in general and I had seen with my own eyes\nLegislators repeatedly putting interests that outside corporate interests over their own people in this state and that is what I Want to stop\nSarah Duncan a candidate for the west Virginia House of delegates also a visual arts teacher Sarah we appreciate you making time for thanks very much thank you\nLooked at a few more voices to the conversation now but first let me read a few of your comments bill in Cleveland emailed\nI don't think workers should be forced to join a union but I also don't think that those who choose not to join should receive the benefits of the union's efforts non union members should go it alone and individually negotiate their pay and benefits with their employer you can't have it both ways\nLuke tweeted how we govern unions seems to be the wrong question if working conditions were good or fair equitable enough unions would be a necessary so maybe ask how do we govern employers\nScott I think we should be clear with regard to bill from Cleveland ... comment about non union members\nGoing it alone and individually to go shooting just to be clear for people who've never been part of a union correct me if I'm wrong but a union contract is a floor not a ceiling it's the basic wages and working conditions workers can negotiate for more if they want\nBut a union contract kind of sets the minimum the basis for all the workers working conditions right\nI Believe that's the case I mean there's a lot of variation from state to state and workplace or to work place when it comes to um union rules and and the sort of um uh uh differences\nTo state and workplace or to work place when it comes to um union rules and and the sort of um uh uh differences that you were talking about\nI Know someone that we should put that question too I think is an expert on drugs now and she's joining us was NYC in New York Randi Weingarten is the president of the American federation of teachers which is the second largest teachers' union in the U.S Randy welcome to want to say\nHey Joshua and that Sarah and Sarah is one of these awesome members and I she's running in in a very upscale district and I hope she makes it run of the three hundred teachers is running\nI Do want to talk to you a little bit more about that in a moment I should also contract I actually I don't really contracts I should also introduced Vincent for new CIO he's a senior fellow at the Mackinac Center for public policy and senior policy adviser at the state policy network and he joins us from Michigan Radio Vincent welcome\n[noise] hey thank you for having me on principle if I was gives me Randy before we continue could I just put that question to you in terms of members going it alone just for the sake of clarity a collective bargaining agreement is a floor it's not a ceiling you could negotiate for more but the point of a CPA is to save these or at least the minimum working conditions and wages right\nWell um it's in in some in some industries it's a floor now to sealing it\nDepends on what the clause is about ... city um and the beginning clauses of a union contract\nSometimes it's for everyone and sometimes it's a floor and sometimes it covers all of the conditions of um of employment including pay okay so it it it it changes from place to place it's not monolithic\nOkay good that's that's that's a good con ... ... a context for folks maybe who never been in a union to know that it can be that they're they're mileage may vary Vincent you you have said that the oral arguments in the gym is case that Supreme Court case we mentioned earlier\nWho never been in a union to know that it can be that they're they're mileage make very Vincent you you have said that the oral arguments in the Janice case that Supreme Court case we mentioned earlier led to the teachers strike this spring house so\nWell that's right but before we get to that let's just go back and to find exactly what right to work isn't exactly what Janice brought to public employees across the country\nAll right to work all Janice means is that a union can get a worker fired for not paying them it doesn't affect collective bargaining in any other way unions workers can still negotiate with employers over wages hours working conditions\nAnything they could before right to work before ...\nThey can negotiate for after it\nExcept for the ability to say you're ... you must pay us or you're fired\nAnd going back to that contract is a a floor at not sell like uh the vast majority of collective bargaining agreements especially those in the public sector\nHave seniority built in or the only way to get a raise is by logging and other your other job hey I'm andme all the way to go ahead and finish off um so I I I actually agree with Bill um you know workers should have the ability to negotiate individually if they want to the Mackinac center has model legislation it's called the workers choice\nYou too can be okay you know you

A. M. uses station they care about and so they choose to give and so the barometer we have\nOf whether we're doing what people want is their willingness to become members to become sustaining members to give to write us into their wells to donate their cars to be you know cashed out to to support the station\nIt feels like a similar argument with folks and right to work states where they say if unions are doing what they are members want them to do you don't have to compel them to pay their dues they will pay gladly because they'll know that what they're getting from the union they can't get on their own it's absolutely essential what's wrong with that argument\nSo Joshua it's frankly the arguments and the point that Janice case has ... has decided\nThat you know everything is completely voluntary the argument used today this that if you are creating a staff and I'm an entity that is a bargaining contracts and representing all of everyone\nThen it shouldn't just be that people with the loudest voices that get the attention it should be everyone who gets the attention and that just\nThe the people with the loudest voices\nAnd they get the attention it should be everyone who gets the attention and that just like in terms of taxes to the United states of America or to\n'em or or bar association fees or student loan fee or student organization fees\nThat when you have an obligation to serve all that all pay a fair share and that was the argument that actually had a unanimous Supreme Court ruling in the booth case\nAbout forty five years ago and six successive Supreme Court rulings that affirmed it which leads to a gym is overturned exactly so but look Janice\nThat Alito Sam Alito judge of the Supreme Court\nHas wanted this case has asked for this case for years most people thought it was it a a logically base because the issue was really on the outside that that the the case that the Mackinac center I Wish they were being more honest about it\nThat the Mackinac center that Donald Trump that others made was that you know the Democratic party used unions as their foot soldiers so let's defund unions that had really nothing to do with other kinds of things and therefore they want us to a defined us however the cases done\nAnd what has happened since is that members\nHave stuck with unions and and and and and Vincent said something else which I think was\nOr Scott which I think I just want to raise which is that the Mackinac center actually violated all sorts of school board policy and all sorts of norms and laws by the day after the genocide case sending an email on school email to ... to virtually every single teacher in ten states\nIf we we if we had done that\nPeople would be slapping us around rightfully what we do is we actually organize I'm outside of school and what we've tried to do is basically\nWith the slapping us around rightfully what we do is we actually organize I'm outside at school and what we've tried to do is basically say to to the states just give us some time so we can introduce people to the union\nOkay let me give a ... and the chance to respond to them then we'll keep moving by the way it is worth knowing that the Mackinac center did file a friend of the court brief in the uh Janice versus ... case but go ahead Vin let me give you a chance to respond\nWell hey thank you and you know there's groups across the country that are communicating with public employees to tell them about their rights mackinaw has their my pay my say dot com website I'm In Ohio to go back to your previous caller there's the workers choose dot org website\nAnd these efforts are needed because unions like Randy's are trying to trap public employees into paying them or trying to limit the time that they can exercise their rights under jazz um in some cases in credibly confusing time periods\nOr in some cases only about a week also that\nUm states like New York New Jersey California give unions the ability to essentially have captive audience meetings or make their sales pitch to a public employees while at the same time forbidding anybody else from talking to the employees and this is during the work\nThat way clerk clerk what you mean by a captive audience ... what what exactly are you referring to [noise] um well\nRecent legislation passed in several states gives unions the ability to do what they call a orientation sessions with a with new employees so basically think it's time share presentation on steroids where the union can come and", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "22"}
