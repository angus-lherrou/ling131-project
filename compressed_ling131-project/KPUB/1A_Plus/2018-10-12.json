T. I. P. C. C. set forth\nIt's kind of crazy until you do it really and California is very serious about doing it\nIt's a very serious about doing it and you know Paul Romer talks about\nThe problem isn't going to be solved until you build consensus on and political will is really at the heart of that there's there's really a huge divide in terms of political well not just here but also you know I just moved here from Canada that same thing there you had prime minister Justin Trudeau trainer and a\nAnd posted a carbon tax across the country and he's running into real opposition at the provincial level there\nBefore we move on let me get one more comment a few more comments on this not my academy tweeted why are we still talking about the credibility of science when it comes to climate change\nA good point not my kind of me I don't know if you listen to this program but we are not questioning the credibility that's kind of a done deal on this program but I hear what you're saying\nLeery tweeted it's frustrating to hear criticism of citizens in some of the poorest parts of Florida for not upgrading their homes ability to withstand hurricanes they may live where other people vacation but they're mostly stuck\nThis storm will expose that contrast\nShane Harris I Wonder if you could respond to Larry on one hand\nI disagree with him as a Floridian like the state of Florida has programs to help you hard in your home and if you want to live in Florida that as he Faisal risk of living within ... yards of a rising coastline if you want to live there you just have to absorb that\nOn the other hand I totally hear what he's coming from Mexico beach where the hurricane Michael made landfall\nHad to be moved back from the coastline for safety sake the town could incorporate

totally hear what he's coming from Mexico beach where the hurricane Michael made landfall\nHad to be moved back from the coastline for safety sake the talented and incorporate it it's it's a tough one [noise]\nNobody's really tough and when we're we're when we're thinking about climate change in the sort of thirty to forty year are tied and I were just talking about the strength to break\n'em their existential risks that are opposed not just to a community is close to the coastline of them are talking about today but large cities you know like Miami in Florida and other places that really in the long term are going to have to make serious profound choices about\nSurvive ability about resilience or whether people want to continue living there and there is an element of risk that you take that also has to give people some agency and what I think is missing from the conversation about climate change is a real honest discussion about long term risk\nAnd what the responsibility is for people living in these places and they're elected leaders both at the local and the national level we're not having that conversation\nAnd Joshua ... ... one small point just to and if you think that that risk and getting your heads around the risk for lower income or poor people here in America is something we need to think about\nUh Americans also need to think about what some of our international leaders leaders generals like Colin Powell advisers had been saying for years if you think it's a risk in this country imagine what storms increased drought\nAnd conflict means for millions and millions of poor people around the world when they started to migrate when they upset the ...\nConversation and Joshua ... one small point just the end if you think that that risk and getting your heads around the risk for lower income or poor people here in America is something we need to think about\nUh Americans also need to think about what some of our international leaders leaders generals like Colin Powell advisors had been saying for years if you think it's a risk in this country imagine what storms increased drought\nAnd conflict means for millions and millions of poor people around

from fighting for our country that I Will say that I think\nNikki Haley speaking on Tuesday about resigning as US ambassador to the un this resignation was different from some of the others we've seen in this administration because it seemed to kind of come out of nowhere by surprise last month ambassador Haley published an op ed in the Washington Post declaring her loyalty to and respect for\nThe president Shane what is your read on Nikki Haley's resignation announcement do we take it at face value is there more at play here what do you think\nYeah there's always more apply particularly in this White House um it was a surprise there is no doubt about that it was a surprise even to people in the administration uh Nikki Haley [noise] also I think had found herself increasingly politically isolated in the power centers of foreign policy\nAnd the administration with John Bolton the national security advisor and Mike Pompeo now secretary of state\nA sort of absorbing a lot of that energy and then of course this administration being quite hostile to the United nations\nBeing UN ambassador is not necessarily the most powerful position\nUm Nikki Haley has presidential ambitions I she she said today or an ... meeting with Trump this week she's not running and twenty twenty she plans to be campaigning for him a twenty twenty four is not that long away a and it's I think there's an element of that as well the question of\nPower centers of foreign policy and the administration with John Bolton the national security advisor and Mike Pompeo now secretary of state\nA sort of

presidential ambitions I she she said they are and and her meeting with Trump this week she's not running and twenty twenty she plans to be campaigning for him a twenty twenty four is not that long the way a and so I think there's an element of that as well\nThe question of wine now is a curious one that'll keep people in Washington guessing she may have thought get out before the midterms\nI'm there may be of demagogue certainly of Democrats take back the house they're going to become a subpoena factory this administration will be under investigation relentlessly and Nikki Haley herself is under scrutiny for a private jet flights that she accepted from friends and associates there's been some investigation to that\nUm it might have just a ban that now with the time to head for the exits and and I have to say she really does leave\nI'm probably one of the best positions of any senior Trump admission official she's not leaving under a lot of scandal\nUh she won generally plaudits for her work at the un she was seen as a stabilizing force within an administration that many people feel needs them uh and she can leave with their head held high and I think uh certainly someone as

Shane Harris and Todd's will still time to get into more of your questions and thoughts on the week's top stories won a asked W. A. M. U. dot org cuts will look let's talk a bit about Brett Kavanaugh we're seeing\nThe Supreme Court nomination and confirmation heavily politicized going into the midterms President Trump\nIs using the issue to energize Republicans Democrats are doing the same thing on the other side of the aisle I Wonder where we see this going especially since Democrats some of them seem determined not to let the Kavanaugh's confirmation go it seems to have had\nOpposite effect certainly so it seems these numbers are a little sketchy I Want to put the provide so around what I'm about to say ah that the polls are fresh\nLet's talk a bit about Brett Kavanaugh we're seeing\nHis Supreme Court nomination and confirmation heavily politicized going into the midterms President Trump\nIs using the issue to energize Republicans Democrats are doing the same thing on the other side of the aisle I Wonder where we see this going especially since Democrats some of them seem determined not to let the Kavanaugh's confirmation go it seems to have had opposite effect certainly so\nIt seems these numbers are a little sketchy I Want to put the provides though around what I'm about to say that the polls are fresh and we don't know exactly what this means yet for the upcoming midterms we will know in four weeks however it looks like now it's having an opposite effect on Senate races and house races we've seen several Senate races places like\nTennessee or places like North Dakota where races that seemed to be closer where the Democrat who is challenging the Republican and a red state actually had a chance of either surviving or in the case of Tennessee or maybe picking up an open seat\nTo now a search for Republicans that Brett Kavanaugh phenomenon seems to in Senate races have solidified Republican base voters behind Republican candidates in most cases and then curiously\nIn house races where so many Republicans are vulnerable\nUh I Can't say that has had the opposite effect because I'm not sure that the Supreme Court fight as a cause and effect relationship on house races house members don't really have much to do with Supreme Court fights in at least not not in confirming them up but there doesn't seem to have been the same erosion\nIn a lead or in democratic support in the house however looking forward and you mentioned that a lot of Democrats are promising their base that the fight isn't over on Brett Kavanaugh not necessarily because of his ideological positions on a rower executive power\nA but what his behavior was in\nSay that has had the opposite effect because I'm not sure that the Supreme Court fight has a cause and effect relationship on house races house members don't really have much to do with Supreme Court fights in at least not not in confirming them up but there doesn't seem to have been the same erosion\nIn a lead or in democratic support in the house however looking forward and you mentioned that a lot of Democrats are promising their base that the fight isn't over on Brett Kavanaugh not necessarily because of his ideological positions on a rower executive power\nA but what his behavior was in high school and college and more importantly perhaps whether he was truthful under oath in front of the Judiciary Committee and in his statements when he talked about his drinking when he talked about his behavior in high school and college\nUh I Would look to the house most likely house members who may if the numbers hold true control the house after January\nThey will control the Judiciary Committee they will control the investigations committees they will have chairmanship sing like and like a shame said before they\nWill become subpoena factories they will also have to respond to a base that wants Brett Kavanaugh statements investigated a lot of this Joshua ... comes from dissatisfaction over the extremely limited nature of that FBI background check that week in between when Christine Blasey Ford came forward and we had that high profile\nHighly emotional and remarkable hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee\nOr the FBI really investigate did they get to the bottom of anything did they ask\nTen twelve fourteen people who may have been witnesses in some form to some of the alleged behavior it appears that they didn't and people might be relying on Democrats to pick up that church ...\nI'll add to this you know senator Harris is not just on the Senate Judiciary can they she's also in the homeland security and government Affairs Committee and in that capacity she had the cancer can grill at the director Christopher Wray on their face to face\nWitnesses in some form to some of the alleged behavior it appears that they didn't and people might be relying on Democrats to pick up the church Louis\nOh activists you know senator Kamala Harris is not just on the Senate Judiciary committee but she's also in the homeland security and government Affairs Committee and in that capacity she had the chance to grill\nFBI Director Christopher Wray on this face to face um how much intervention did the White House do in this supplemental background check\nWill click also on ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee Dianne Feinstein her six year term in the Senate is up so she's up for reelection you can bet that this is going to come up in the debate between her and state senator Kevin daily own who wants to know why she sat on that letter from Dr Christine Blasey Ford for two months\nAnd last thing I'll say is she just last night um was trying to take the fight from you know on the SCOTUS thing too\nThat the way that Trump is trying to remake the courts writ large talking about the Ninth Circuit court here in California Trump's nomination this is a court that's been a real store and in from outside the White House just put forth as three nominees there and she didn't get to sign off on them she's very upset about that and Trump\nAre tempted ministry shouldn't really breaking from tradition by not giving the home state senators any say in these ...\nI Do want to see if we can leave time it's all California politics for the roundup is up but a few more things out to be see we wanted to discuss including the president's stepping into the middle of the feud\nBetween Taylor Swift and Kanye West he publicly just miss swift for endorsing two Democrats in Tennessee but he

now we know that the the planes that were those to play movements at different times that came into his stumble ... and then went back to Riyadh\nWho was on them ... that designation was within the state type of racist widowed one hundred percent no but you get the distinct sense that uh the ... the Turkish are telling the authorities here\nAmong your thirties here in the U.S to understand is not a million miles from what I have just sketched out because I think that there has been a willingness to believe and that is why you're seeing\nThe deep expressions of anxiety and on these over

best of our knowledge because she'll be is not a United States citizen is that right or is that a permanent resident okay we don't like John we'd all like it and we don't like it even a little bit\nBut as to whether or not we should stop a hundred and ten million dollars from being spent in this country knowing they have\nFour or five alternatives to very good alternatives that would not be acceptable to be okay but we're looking for the answer and I think probably you'll have an answer sooner than people think\nThe president speaking at the oval office yesterday and when we was referring to the human Saudi Arabia and the four or five alternatives would be other countries from whom the Saudis could buy arms the hundred and ten billion dollars is an arms deal a military deal between the U.S\nAnd Saudi Arabia worry I Wonder if you could give us your sense of how this case\nFits into the relationship between the U.S in Saudi Arabia especially in light of the comment that I

were king for a day all the weapons we've sold them would be rendered useless and Jared Kushner would be banned from any policy making\nLaw the sharp elbows thrown in that comment I Wonder if you could help us fact\nChecked that yeah I think um it's it's a really a fascinating point and also that that um clip you played of Donald Trump was really striking because I'm the one hand\nIt seemed so I'm cold lead transactional in the sense that he was saying you know we have billions of dollars pouring in why am I going to stop that just because they have murdered a dissident journalist in other words I I'm so you know I don't care about human rights I mean we usually stand up for I care about money pouring into the United states economy\nAnd that attitude had activated a lot of\nUm people in Washington who are against our alliance with Saudi Arabia for example senators on both sides of the aisle that Chris Murphy and Rand Paul who have an argument for a long time just as the commentator said I'm\nNow we're supporting the war in Yemen that it's unconscionable that is starving civilians and killing civilians killing civilians and you know bus attacks and other things that are just horrendous um\nWhy I'm Sorry to cut you short but since you mentioned Rand Paul I'm really sorry to interrupt you but we have a clip of Rand Paul speaking to a reporter this week on that very thing he said he would try to force a vote on us arms sales to Saudi Arabia I'll let you finish your thought but first let's hear from Senator Paul\nThink that the early reports have shown that this is linked to the Saudi Government and nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without the government's approval so no I think that ah and less and less of a sudden the journal\nIs starving civilians and killing civilians killing civilians in you know bus attacks and other things that are just horrendous um\nWhy the hell out of the country short but since you mentioned Rand Paul I'm really sorry to interrupt

let's hear from Senator Paul\nI think that the early reports have shown that this is linked to the Saudi Government and nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without the government's approval\nSo no I think that ah and less and less of a sudden the journalists turns up alive I think that we should we should just continue our arms sales to Saudi Arabia [noise] plus I think we need to be voting in the Senate and debating whether or not we should be involved in the war in Yemen\nThat was Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky where we go ahead\nSo I was gonna say people like Rand Paul are going to push back against arms sales about about our support for the war in Yemen um even saw a ... of lawmakers invoking the global Magnitsky Act which said that the u._s. Trump Administration had to investigate what happened and if they find Saudi officials responsible they need to impose sanctions all that being said I Want it there is a counterpoint to this deal which is that\nOur relationship with Saudi Arabia has always been transactional Trump kind of said the quiet part out loud a little bit in the way he in a way he framed it yesterday because we have never had a relationship an alliance faith and values since World War two it had all been about money\nAnd oil think about nine eleven Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers were from Saudi Arabia that didn't lead to a permanent rupture in our alliance because we've always seen them as a strategic ally not at the values based allies in Europe and I think that's important to keep in mind that Trump said it in a particularly accentuated way and he feels you know is very transactional way past presidents have\nBut this is somewhat reflective of what us presidents have said quietly for a long time yeah sure sure if I could chip in the Nazis here I mean I think Donald Trump said out loud what other presidents and other primates\nWorld War two it had all been about money and oil think about nine

Leigh Tony Blair intervened with a ... an independent investigation and said right we're canceling this investigation and he used his power as prime minister because he felt he had to because Saudi Arabia was to the customer\nToo important an ally and you've seen with Donald Trump you know one of the first places he went to when he became president was to Saudi Arabia I traveled with him on that

what this means for the larger sense\nWell he's been a long time operative of the the Chinese government and their arguments being made that this is part of an effort to purge non loyalists to the

swept off the streets and his wife sent a knife ... the day the day he disappears that no one in China's safe and and at the time of all this there was talk from\nParty officials about the importance

his wife and how outspoken she has been she has been ah she's in French protective custody\nBut she's been speaking out in a way that we wouldn't normally see out of China and I thought it was an

time of the dictatorship as a time when there was law and order one other point to know is it he ... with Donald Trump a lot of conservatives feel that Donald Trump has the right formula be pro business you know loosen regulations ah you know be nationalistic\nAnd be about cracking down on crime and he has promised to be a really close ally of the United states all of this is\nI'm very a shocking because Brazil for many ... for decades has been led by a leftist government or there was a little more ambivalent about its relationship with the United states and certainly a didn't espouse kind of the right wing view is that he espoused so this is a real shock to the system I think it really goes to the fact\nThat Brazil I mean in the perception is embroiled in a massive corruption um\nCrisis or that affected all parties except for both an arrow who was actually not been implicated in this and that was his\nThat was his winning point I'll say one other thing we you know the Atlantic wrote an article in which they interviewed\nA a cab driver who said you know things are so bad maybe we need someone with crazy ideas or who else is going to fix this myth and so I think that that is that is the sentiment that is worth keeping an eye on because that was a similar sentiment\nIn ... in Donald Trump's victory in the victory of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to Mexico I mean this is a sentiment that people are feeling against the establishment in many countries\nWorld but to hear from some Brazilians who are listening today and looking ahead to the election one listener emailed I'm a Brazilian listening from me sitting next to Brazil's capital Brasilia I'm very concerned about the future of our democracy\nEver who said you know things are so bad maybe we need someone with crazy ideas out who else is going to fix this math and I think that that is that is the sentiment that it's worth keeping an eye on because that was a similar sentiment and bread that and Donald Trump's victory in the victory of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and Mexico I mean this is a sentiment that people are feeling against the establishment in many countries\nIn the world glad to hear from some Brazilians who are listening and today and looking ahead to the election one listener emailed I'm Anna a Brazilian listening from a city next to Brazil's capital Brasilia\nI'm very concerned about the future of our democracy the candidate leading the polls is an ex military who has a very anti democratic discourse which is also racist massage and this and homophobic\nSince last Sunday the election day more than fifty people have suffered physical and verbal aggressions from both so NATO supporters social media specifically what's app\nIs playing a very important role and lots of fake news is circulating I really believe that with ... out of our democracy is at risk John ... what's projected to happen for the runoff is there any sense of whether ... could win this\nFor the last poll I saw suggested yes that the latest post suggests that he is at fifty eight percent\nOn the opposition leader is at forty two percent or ... for them to her dad and so I kind of thing that you'd have to say that it's ... with that sort of margin of error is going to take some quite something for the left is kind of candidate to come back from that position um I mean you know they talk about violence and the other thing about both ... he was stabbed\nIn September as a rally I'm so there's been a lot of violence round about his men that he's been able to say\nI really love to take part in debates but I really count at the moment because I'm Still you know slightly getting for the stopping that I had ... I'm afraid I might be able to come to your studio this evening and so I think that there is kind of a feeling that you know he is he's got his head down he has said what he said people know exactly where he stands on us\nIt's got to take some quite something for the left is kind of candidate to come back from that position um I mean you know they talk about violence and the other thing about ... he was stabbed in September as a rally I'm so there's been a lot of violence around by his men that he's been able to say\nI really love to take part in debates but I really count at the moment because I'm Still you know slightly getting stopping that I had then so I'm afraid I might be able to come to your studio this evening and so I think that there is kind of a feeling that you know he is he's got his head down he has said what he said people know exactly where he stands and I think he sees the finish line\nOne story that much of the world has been talking about has to do with a new report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the IPC see\nThe report says that the world is quickly running out of time to stem catastrophic climate change scientists predict we're on course to go beyond a crucial threshold of the world's average temperature rising one point five degrees Celsius or to point seven degrees Fahrenheit\nIn just over about ten years they save that would leave us dealing with the risks of extreme drought wildfires floods food shortages for hundreds of millions of people we talked about this report on the program this week one comment from a listener stuck along the lines that at least here in America\nThis is just not a big enough issue I mean people will vote for a lot of reasons and the state of our climate is not something that lawmakers talk much about or that voters demand to discuss Nancy use if what is your sense of that of whether or not this report has made an impact around the world enough for people to start demanding action\nI think it's made an impact but the problem is the effect said that's already been seen in various ways around the world so where one country can say it's not a big impact and other countries could see it as an immediate impact and something that needs to be dealt with aggressively and of course the kinds of changes at this rate\nPeople will vote for a lot of reasons and the state of our climate is not something that lawmakers talk much about or that voters demand to discuss myth use if what is your sense of that of whether or not this report has made an impact around the world enough for people to start demanding action\nI think it's made an impact but the problem is the effects of this already being seen in various ways around the world so where one country could say it's not\nA big impact another country could see it as an immediate impact on something that needs to be dealt with aggressively in of course the kinds of changes at this report says need to happen are so I'm\nDrastic that it demands sort of a uniform world agreed upon action and we're not there yet and so um you're seeing a variance in response and I think it really reflects the variants of impact that nations are already seen\nAnd you know as a as a war correspondent and one of the things I see it come up most often as as a cause of the start of wars and conflicts environmental changes changing where people live how they're able to eat so I'm\nYou know it's an area that doesn't just hit the environment but really hits other parts of of national security and government writ large but there's because of the complexity in terms of its impact\nI think it's hard to get a uniform agreement particularly to in such a polarized time um so it's hard to be optimistic that that will see at least in the short term the kinds of drastic changes at this report says needs to happen to stop literally famine drought wildfires really severe consequences", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "12"}
