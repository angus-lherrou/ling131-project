for sharing your thoughts with us ah speaking of the corporate path there are some corporations who are taking a position in the fight against climate change including with regards to the carbon tax Melissa tweeted\nChina uses more than twice as much coal as the U.S hard to believe some carbon tax is going to make much of a difference considering their population let's talk more about carbon taxes with one more of our guests joining us from London\nTed holstead as the chairman and CEO of the climate leadership council Ted welcome to want to a\n[noise] good to be with you Joshua what is the climate leadership council\nIt is a group a that is co founded by a by actually the brought us climate coalition in us history to back a national solution is pushing for a carbon tax where all the money is related to the American people in the form of ... of ... of a dividend\nWho were some of the backers of the council where\nDoes the funding come from so um the council is ah does not accept corporate contributions but our founding members include four of the ah oil majors the largest car manufacturing\nIt is a group a that is co founded by a white actually the brought us climate coalition in us history to back a national solution as pushing for a carbon tax where all the money is related to the American people in the form of ... of ... of a dividend\nWho were some of the backers of the council where does the funding come from\nSo um the council is a does not accept corporate contributions but our founding members include four of the\nAh oil major is the largest car manufacturer in the United states the largest utility but also the largest a solar company in the United states a very broad coalition it also includes two leading environmental groups and opinion leaders from across the political spectrum ranging from\nBen Bernanke key to Janet Yellen to Larry Summers\nAnd of course our plan is named after former secretaries of state James Baker and George Schultz the Baker shields carbon defense plan but Joshua let me clarify we have there is a separate spin off organization that has a lobbying organization and that now has corporate funding including from Exxon\nOkay and that is connected to the organization or use it as a spin off but is there still a connection in any way or completely separate\nUh it is a separate organization that is the advocacy arm of the climate leadership council so the council develops this groundbreaking breaking plan were all sides wind and Americans for carbon dividends which is co chaired by former Republican Senate majority leader Trent Lott and a\nA center bro that group lobbies for this plan and it now has money from oil natural gas solar wind and nuclear power interests\nDavenport let's take a step back before we get into the planet the climate leadership council is advocating more specifically define this term carbon tax for what exactly is a carbon tax shore cell\nThis ground breaking plan were all sides wind and Americans for carbon dividends which was co chaired by former Republican Senate majority leader trend lot and uh\nUh sooner bro that group lobbies for this plan and it now has money from oil natural gas solar wind and nuclear power interests\nColder in Fort let's take a step back before we get into the plan that the climate leadership council was advocating more specifically defined this term carbon tax for what exactly is a carbon tax shore so um\n[noise] the idea of a carbon tax is um ... each ton of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere um you can put a price on how much economic harm it causes\nI'm and I'm In ... and ... and important to note on that as the the economist who came up with with that idea his name was William North house\nHe's a professor at Yale I'm was just awarded the Nobel Prize for this idea on Monday or the same day that the IPC came out with this report which heavily sites I'm professor north houses work\nUm so he came up with the idea of\nEvery ton of carbon um traps heat in the atmosphere and you can put a price on how much each kind of carbon hurts\nA the global economy um and and there's a range for how much that costs that it it can range from um fifty dollars a time to a hundred dollars a time when I'm you know there there's there's debate about about how much\nUm actual harm it can cost but once you sort of place that price on carbon um than you are can essentially um create attacks I'm at a price on carbon or attacks on carbon that you\nAtmosphere and you can put a price on how much each kind of carbon hurts a the global economy um and and there's a range for how much that costs that it it can range from um fifty dollars a ton to a hundred dollars a time when I'm you know there there's there's debate about about how much\nUm actual harm it can cost but once you sort of place that price on carbon um than you are can essentially um create attacks I'm at a price on carbon or attacks on carbon that you would impose upon polluters of carbon dioxide no no\nNo a carbon source or cruel or want to be really clear in terms of who the taxes paid on I mean if I Am a carburetor do I pay the what we're talking about pollution from automobiles does the carmaker\nPay a carbon tax for producing the vehicle that ... carbon dioxide or does the oil company pay the carbon tax for finding the gasoline loaded term lightly\nMost likely you pay at a as a car driver I'm those\nAnd and and and you you would so um we don't have carbon taxes in the U. S.\nUm so in some ways this this is sort of um you know an intellectual debate although other countries are are working are sort of further along on this but the idea is\nUm if this would affect how you drive it would probably um be taxed based on how much carbon monoxide would be a produced by burning 'em by burning gasoline show it would most likely be added to the cost of the gasoline that you put in your car so if you're going to put in\nAn amount of gasoline in your car that would produce a certain amount of carbon dioxide when you burn it that would raise that tax would raise the price of your gasoline and the idea is then you would be motivated to buy a car that use less gasoline essentially\nIf this would affect how you drive it would probably um be taxed based on how much carbon monoxide would be a produced by burning 'em by burning gasoline show it would most likely be added to the cost of the gasoline that you put in your car so if you're going to put in\nAnd in mounted gasoline in your car that would produce a certain amount of carbon dioxide when you burn it that would raise that tax would raise the price of gasoline and the idea is then you would be motivated to buy a car that use less gasoline essentially that that's how it would\nDrive the market so consumers would want to buy electric cars would want to buy efficient cars\nNot because not out of some sort of\nA moral sensibility but because actually up at a price on carbon would make it cheaper to use an electric car it's a it's a powerful market signal\nTo hosted the yesterday Exxon Mobil committed money to lobbying Congress for price on carbon give us a sense of what the plan involves and why it's getting support now\n[noise] so um the bigger shields carbon defense plant is based on four pillars of the first is a robust carbon tax starting at forty dollars per ton which would actually be the highest carbon tax of any\nA leading emitting country all of the money would go directly back to the American people in the form of a carbon dividend which means that the vast majority of American families including the most vulnerable would win economically from this plan\nAnd a third pillar is that we would trade a high price on carbon and a growing price on carbon for some of the carbon regulation simply because a carbon tax is a more cost effective way to solve climate change\nTo make sure I understand so the plan if the plan went into effect there would be a tax on the carbon that I Am it\nCarbon dividend which means that the vast majority of American families including the most vulnerable would win economically from this plan\nAnd a third pillar is that we would trade a high price on carbon in a growing price on carbon for some of the carbon regulation simply because a carbon tax is a more cost effective way to solve climate change\nWho I just want to make sure I understand so the plan if the plan went into effect there would be a tax on the carbon that I Am it\nWith my car or my motorcycle or whatever and then that the revenues from that tax would come back to me as a taxpayer in the form of a of a dividend is that what you called yes so a family of four\nWould get approximately two thousand dollars per year\nIn dividends and here's how the system would work the more you pollute the more you pay the less you pollute the more you win so Seventy percent of American families would come out economically ahead and that's what's so transformative about the dividend concept which is that we can have\nThe most effective climate lever which is a carbon tax in a manner that is popular populist and equitable for the American people\n\nCan use your source for NPR News in programming in northern Arizona\nFor updates on issues that affect you in your community ... dot org also find us on Facebook at Kenyon AU Arizona Public radio and follow us on Twitter at ease the public radio and thanks for listening\nFunding for K. and now you comes from the Findlay automotive group now in ... and the quad cities five brand name automobiles to choose among including Toyota Buick and GMC Finley automotive group not just an auto dealership a community partner\n\nThis was Arizona Public radio can a UK puberty Ninety One point seven Flagstaff cayenne eighty Ninety One point seven page K. and AG Ninety point three Grand Canyon and K innate you eighty nine point three Prescott listen online at ... dot org for Thirty years of public service of northern Arizona university where it's ten o'clock\nIs a classic love story one that Hollywood has told for decades\nWere audience is saying now that this star has been born for the fourth time\nFrom W.

you think of the movie\nHey well of course I loved it but I loved it for entertainment value but my big piece was that moment when he brought her onstage and knowing that was not her comfort down knowing what she'd been told that she wasn't going to be good enough\nThat no one would care that no one would find her interesting or attractive and she just went out and she killed it and they loved it and for that has second is the that she realized they were wrong and everything\n[noise] yes I mean I'm just like a little bit sick as a first that and for me her nose is like my weight so she owned it she's like this is my name is ... needs to take me as I Am and she worked at it\nYou know got to accept that this is me and it's not going to change and I thought it it kind of the ill\nYeah yeah how do I really appreciate your calling and thanks very much for talking to us and I love Ann Powers I Love that kind of commentary on the music industry that was kind of baked into the film particularly the thing about her nose when they're standing on the roof top in LA and there's that alley billboard and he says we should have just made the old billboard your nose\nI think the thing about the comments about our nose is also a guy guys\nHonoring Barbra Streisand [laughter] one of the greatest performers and greatest noses to ever a exist in and thrive in Hollywood as far as coming on the music industry it absolutely is a powerful comment on the music industry\nAs the music industry existed I don't know maybe ten years ago I think that where this thing has placed in time where this movie is place in time it's interesting to think about that because\nAlmost everything that happens still happens today and the music industry but there's really no acknowledgement of how things are rapidly changing with the advent of streaming and playlists and um the major record labels having less\nPower than they used to so it's almost like the old fashioned and its view of the music industry but only that view would would work for this film you couldn't really tackle or the collapse of the music industry in this in this movie\nHolmes could you also chime in but by the way for those who have not seen the stars born will not be seeing stars more just kind of want to be in on the conversation she tells Bradley Cooper character fairly early on\nBe changing with the advent of streaming and playlists and um the major record labels having less power than they used to so it's almost like the old fashion and its view of the music industry\nBut only that view would would work for this film you couldn't really tackle a the collapse of the music industry in this in this movie\nLinda Holmes could you also chime in but by the way for those who have not seen the stars born will not be seeing stars form of just kind of want to be in on the conversation she tells Bradley Cooper character fairly early on that she's dealt with music industry people who were like yeah your songs are good you're saying well but your nose your nose just isn't quite right\nFor music and that was kind of one of those petty impediments that had prevented her from getting where she wanted to go into homes I Wonder how you view that commentary on the music industry when I was watching the movie\nI felt like I was thinking about Lady Gaga because Lady Gaga herself has this kind of over the top persona that she created to kind of be the vehicle for her art\nI also thought about pink\nWho's very much an invention of pop music but who also have this kind of rye cynical style style but almost commented on it as she was doing it and that was what made people love\nYeah I mean I think that um I agree with and that\nThe view of the music industry in this found in order to be aligned with the view of Hollywood and the previous films in some ways\nIs very linear it's a very linear idea of there is the one I'm rose to fame there is one path you just simply ascend or D sand as opposed to there's no suggestion that either one of them that he or she\nMight have success in a a different kind of version of what it means to be famous like\nThat he would score movies or you know that she would develop her own you know following through streaming\nThis film in order to be aligned with the view of Hollywood and the previous films in some ways is very linear it's a very linear idea of there is the one I'm rose to fame there is one path\nYou just simply ascend or descend as opposed to there is no suggestion that either one of them that he or she\nMight have success in a a different kind of version of what it means to be famous like that he would score movies or you know that she would develop her own you know following through streaming\nWith out kind of going through that traditional Paso agree with Anna about that but I think that um I'm not sure that you could do it any other way I think the purpose is to have them pass each other on this fame ladder and I think you kind of have to construct it that way and what you're saying about Lady Gaga\nYou know I'm the caller was talking about kind of seeing\nA alley the character talking about well I have to and I'm really afraid and I don't have confidence in my nose or whatever it is funny to see an artist's like Lady Gaga who has been so able to make such an indelible mark on the industry and on popular culture I mean\nThe funny thing about this movie is she is way more important to culture than he is um if you're talking about the real people so it's kind of funny to see\nHer big personality taking advice from you know Bradley Cooper was at a much more traditional Hollywood leading man type of career right um it's odd and that way\nExcept for the voice in rocketing guardians of the galaxy that's a little bit more of a diversion but you're right I mean she is much more of like typical leaving me an actor I Wonder also John in terms of the story line you know one of the big parts of the storyline is the love story and Bradley spent a lot of time sitting up that's\nYou're talking about the real people so it's kind of funny to see her big personality taking advice from now Bradley Cooper they've had a much more traditional Hollywood leading man type of career right um it's odd in that way\nYeah except for that voicing rocketing guardians of the galaxy that's a little bit more

I've actually seen the other versions and this one seem particularly well updated to today um I thought it was the the irony of her being discovered\nBecause he was a drunk and looking for a drink and their life being torn apart at the end because of drink I mean that was the continuing thing and one one thing I don't think other people have mentioned is the part that her agent\nI guess he was her agent uh the guy who made her over\nThe manager down agent played yeah what what is your main character\nI didn't like him and I I guess I wasn't supposed to but uh the men had he had that conversation with jacks and um and and basically getting ready to accuse ... are accusing him\nOf being a problem in that whole relationship\nI just I just knew that that was going to be the start as of something really bad happening\nYeah yeah I I I hear Eugene a hundred percent of ... and I I figure I heard you chime in as well\nNow that was a male dominated go yeah I think I think one of the tricks and this goes a little bit back to what you were all talking about about the mental health and recovery portions of this story\nHe had that conversation with Jackson um and and basically getting ready to accuse are accusing him of being a problem in that whole relationship\nI just I just knew that that was going to be the start of of something really bad happening\nYeah I'd I hear your dream a hundred percent of ... and I I figure I heard your charming in his will\nKnow that was a male nominee yeah I think I think one of the tricks and this goes a little bit back to what you were all talking about about the mental health and recovery portions of the story one of the tricks with the manager is I think they do such a beautiful job of explaining where he is in his recovery process and where he is\nI'm thinking about mental health and they made her seem like someone who is aware of what his problems are she's been wary of them\nFrom the beginning um but then they are ultimately headed toward this pre determined tragic ending in which um he dies of suicide and so\nI think the manager I think the conversation with the manager unfortunately seems like a forced element that\nIt doesn't feel organic to the story it feels like it comes into just drive that last you know to drive that ending and it doesn't seem organic necessarily to to the story as they've developed it because when he's been through these um recovery process is\nDoes it seem like without speaking to her he would hear that from the manager I mean obviously depression and an addiction can operate and a lot of different ways for sure but you know did the movie really do a good job of explaining why that conversation at that moment would be enough\nTo drive this enormous decision that that he makes and I'm not sure it did I think that's where I found the ending to be not as satisfying as I thought the rest of the film\nWas agree with you on that and on top of that I think that the movie had a ...\nTrey these um recovery process is\nDoes it seem like without speaking to her he would hear that from the manager I mean obviously depression and an addiction can operate and a lot of different ways for sure but you know did the movie really do a good job of explaining why that conversation at that moment would be enough\nTo drive this enormous decision that that he makes and I'm not sure it did I think that's where I found the ending to be not as satisfying as I thought the rest of the film was\nBy agree with you on that and on top of that I think that the movie had a way you know I was always taught you know in in writer school show don't tell\nAnd there was this moment in the film where Ali says I Want jak on my tour make it happen or or we're done\nAnd I feel like there could have been a moment where for example he goes on states to her with her and he can't keep up or he keeps we're getting the lyrics or he falls down draw like something could have happened to someone coming to him and saying you know your bad for her right so that would have like plead that whole narrative in a different way for me\nIt exactly someone he doesn't really know someone he hasn't necessarily trust they'd come in and is able to kind of up in his entire sense of his relationship with her I think that's part of that the narrative issue with the ending\nLet's all go ahead and go ahead\nOf course the the ways in which a Hollywood and the fame machine or the fame monster is like the guy got what's called it and one of her album ah destroys people is a major theme\nThroughout all of the versions of star is born in there and in fact oh the verge of the SARS going to have that manager character in a different embodiment\nUm that character in this film I absolutely agree was more personally slimy felt like you know a villain whereas in in some of the previous versions here\nWays in which a Hollywood and the fame machine at the same monster as Lady Gaga once called it and one of her album ah destroys people is a major theme\nThroughout all of the versions of star is born in there and in fact all the bridges of the SARS have that manager character in a different embodiment\nUm that character in this film I\nAbsolutely agree was more personally slimy felt like you know a villain whereas in in some of the previous versions he almost was a sympathetic enabler um of of the male lead and who then was like hey you know\nWe're trying to keep them afloat but he's going to mess you up\nEsther Esther was the first name of alley or in the star is born versions so the story of Hollywood destroying people um requires that a a stand in for the machine be part of being part of the cast you know has to be there um\nI also just want to say before we end got to get this out there that um\nThis is also the story of how a woman's rise leads to a man's fall [laughter] and that's an internal problem with the stars bar and you know um it's a melodrama it's it's a melodrama is traditionally aimed at women we feel very sympathetic\nA ... toward the lead female character but there is this underlying sense have to say it that even as Jackson, Maine is saved temporarily by the energy he he gets almost empirically from\nHis young protege ultimately he is destroyed because she has moved into the center and he has been pushing the periphery\nFeminist reading problematic\nDrama it's it's a melodrama is traditionally aimed at women we feel very sympathetic\nA toward the lead female character but there is this underlying sense have to say it that even as Jackson, Maine is saved temporarily by the energy he he gets almost empirically from\nHis young protege ultimately he has destroyed because she has moved into the center and he has been pushing the periphery\nFeminist raining problematic found\nWell but you're not the only one who's brought that up I mean Julian wrote on our Facebook page I fear the story of a rising female star nursing a feeling male ego is the wrong story in this meat to era\nWe get to a few more of your views of the film Harvey in Ann Arbor emailed I saw this film hoping to be moved crying deeply engaged that didn't happen for stars\nI deeply appreciative ... nuanced shyness in her early portrayal which made means characters advising her work well I'd like to have the same Eliot brother character better developed possibly a moment perhaps a moment could have been written in the car rides the bar possibly dropping him off from the performance\nHis scenes seemed a little too detached from Maine overall I Love the big venue concert treatments\nThat kind of gets to a comment from Argo in ...
