A. M. U. dot board Barbara emailed I still talk weekly by phone to a Yemeni friends in Sana'a and sort of the are living in hell and they ask\nWhy does America hate us so much why does America wants to kill us\nWhat do I say\nSome before we continue in before we bring in our next voices on the conversation I Wonder if you could just for those people who haven't been following the Yemeni civil war very clearly can you just boil down at the core of it what does this conflict about who are the fighters and what are they fighting for\nSo Yemen's conflict is actually quite complex ...\n... it's a it's a conflict that has many layers to it but ultimately what you're hearing the news is that's a it's a Saudi Iranian proxy war you also hear that he got ... at the who the government and sign on that announced itself is actually in fact\nCoup government that has drawn by militia and that the Saudi Government is trying to restore the legitimate Yemeni government at to power in Yemen now the problem with all of that as this conflict is\nFailing to do all of the things that they're saying it's a it's about for example when Saudi Arabia got involved in this conflict with the Arab coalition the aim is to bring back the Yemeni government the enemy\nThey're saying it's a it's about for example when Saudi Arabia got involved in this conflict with the Arab coalition the aim is to bring back the Yemeni government the Yemeni government has been residing in jail since the war started and a struggling to go back to places where there is no who's the Bush on the ground\nOn top of that the who the militia in a sense has gained so much more since the war started in the sense that at first they had to share power with\nUh the former president of Yemen where you know in two thousand eleven Yemen had a revolution and I'm the president was removed\nBut he ... himself with the ... and was president for some time but uh the shared power with him now fast forward three years into the war they had killed them and and now they have their own control of the majority of the north of Yemen\nAnd of course the the scariest thing about this is the Houthi militia had managed to capture the Yemeni military arsenal that belong to the former government is now all in their hand\nAnd so in a sense what the war dead is complicate an already complicated political situation\nAnd it devastated the lives of millions of enemies\nAre for example Seventy five percent of the Yemeni population is is suffering and in need of immediate aid and depend on foreign aid to kind of survive and this is a Seventy percent increase since before the war began um\nAnd I didn't want to talk more about the the population on the ground that needs help I just want to move before we were next wars and also just want to be clear there's a sectarian part of this these these who the rebels ... kind of came after the government you're Saudi Arabia involving itself but there is the Muslim sectarian aspect\nTo this also is Sunni versus Shia conflict as a proxy war right\nSo this is what's interesting and this is what a lot of that\nTo this also is Sunni versus Shia conflict as a proxy war right\nSo this is what's interesting and this is what a lot of the people don't realize first of all the Shiite and Yemen are don't practice the same sect of ... that Iran practices or\nThe Shiites in Lebanon are at all to practice they practice a sect called the DSM and the DSM is known as five or ... and it's really different from twelve or shall which is a the ... he formed that's practice in Iran\nWhat's interesting is that it's the closest form of ... that resembles so many of them are and in Yemen we the Sunnis there are ... and the divide isn't you know the the ... are not a minority like in other places or forty five percent of the population\nAnd so what's interesting about this you know Sunni Shia conflict is that it's entirely manufactured in a sense that of course there are differences between these those two sacks of course there are situations where they don't agree but they managed to co exist for many years\nNow the CDs or the who the sect of of you know what's happening in Yemen they're no longer practicing as atheism as it is it seems like they're trying to politicize say DSM into kind of a\nAssociate themselves more with the Iranian sect of she has ... and the Sunnis in Yemen ...\nHas struggled to maintain it sucked as it is with the influence of well how does them and set up as him coming into the country and so in a sense what you're seeing is that the most radical elements of those two\nAre fighting each other and so in a sense you have the presence of a new ... conflict but one thing that I have to point out to the listeners here is that that's not the only thing going on\nI'm a huge portion of the country in the liberated territory from the control is actually demanding secession and that is something that you don't hear about in the news as much you know in the south and ever since\nFrom the control is actually demanding secession and that is something that you don't hear about in the news as much you know in the south so ever since Nineteen Ninety four the people there felt that they were under occupation and the cost is a session are rising day after day as this conflict continues\nI'd want to make sure we get to a voice on the ground in Yemen but I hear what you're saying someone in terms of all of these very complex fault lines of kind of come together to fuel the civil war today now before we came on the air today\nWe were able to get through to Sana'a in Yemen all communication into and out of Yemen is really tough but we did make contact with at least ... she's the UN's resident and humanitarian coordinator for Yemen least laid out what the conditions are like right now for those who are living\nAnd working beer here as part of our conversation that we take just a few minutes ago we've gone to welcome to want to thank you very much can you give me a sense just in a in a larger context how many people the un fears are at risk of famine right now\nIn game and we are worried that steps are not taken right now in order to stop the spread of hunger that we could see as many as four ... who are facing fan and by the end of the year this is why the United nations is Randy alarm bells\nAnd telling everyone that we are facing possibly the biggest famine in living memory if we don't do something to stop it right now\nWhat are some of the other health risks that you're looking at their other than just starvation I'm sure with deprivation of a reasonable secure supply of food all kinds of other health problems also come into play right\nThat's exactly right last year the largest cholera outbreak in modern history hit and then there were more than a million people\nThat's exactly right last year the largest cholera outbreak in modern history hit ... there were more than a million people who are suffering either from Colorado or from watery diarrhea there had never been an outbreak of such magnitude in living memory\nNow this year because of the heroic work that's being done by frontline partners and UN agencies and officials here in the game and we've been able to contain the spread of and how the Democrats have similar levels there's a lot of color in the country but it's not spreading at the rate of ... last year\nThat being said when people exist for months and months on supplemental rations when they are eating limited amounts of food what happens over a period of time is that they slowly start\nAnd this is absolutely what we're saying for millions of people in this country their immune systems are weakening and that makes them highly vulnerable to infections and water borne diseases including cholera\nAnd just by way of contacts leaves mentioned that there are fourteen million people at the un fears are at risk of famine the population of Illinois where we are right now doing this program from Chicago he's Thirteen million people just by way of contacts least give me a sense of what\nA mother a father a parent has to do in Yemen right now to try and feed their child

U. dot org before we continue some al Hamdani let me come back to you for a second I checked in with our audience here at W. B. easy in Chicago to kind of asked them if they were tracking with us\nAnd one of the things that I think confuses a lot of people it confuses me too\nIs the nature of this sectarian aspects\nLike several of us and we have a memory of of a dream just hear students and seniors and everybody in between have heard of Sunni and Shia Muslims\nBut then that like the the sects within the sects I think that's where a lot of us kind of get lost can you\nCan you bottom line that for us what difference does it make what ... these people are with like why why does the sects why does the sex involved matter to this can you just kind of simplified force\nSo when it comes to Yemen like I mentioned uh the majority of the northern part of Yemen is historically has ADD and the majority of the southern portions of Yemen as historically shaft eye and said these can be called Shia and the\n... they're called ... now the ... conflict\nA kind of began years ago and then was revived recently\nUm what we see is the political importation of religious sects so what we're seeing at play is political Islam and that's what you're hearing about the chefs in a conflict it's not really a religious matter today it's really a political matter of allegiance to what part of the middle east are you going to support\nAnd what we're seeing play out is that Iran is announcing itself as the I'm\nKind of the guardian if she has some and Saudi Arabia on the other hand is presenting itself to the world\nSing itself as the I'm kind of the guardian if she has them and Saudi Arabia on the other hand is presenting itself to the world is the guardian of finance them and so as soon as she our it's pretty much kind of people fighting for the interests of who's going to take control in the region\nAnd that's what this what's happening in the ... and you know for instance when this war started we know that the u._s. then under the administration of President Obama had struck a deal on ... on a nuclear deal with Iran\nAnd the sense they sacrificed Yemen by saying here you can fight Iran in Yemen but the U.S is going to kind of find this deal with Iran now that was a short sighted move because I think a lot of people then didn't anticipate that today President Trump would come to power and then today you have and and you clear and deal with Iran I\nAnd at the same time also had this devastating crisis in Yemen and so in a sense okay\nSo let me let me ... I think so let me let me back up and try and repeat back to you what you just said I said I've been drawn a diagram everybody here ... been watching you scribble in my piece of paper so we've got these these two sets of Islam Sunni Islam and Shia Islam it's this old centuries old fight that has been made\nPolitical you use the phrase political Islam to describe\nHow we run is kind of for political and regional power reasons trying to kind of claim itself as the the defender of the Shia Muslim face\nAnd Saudi Arabia has kind of anointed itself the defender of the Sunni Muslim faith and that politicized Islam has spread into other conflicts and Yemen these factions in Yemen\nIran and Saudi Arabia are supporting these factions is kind of a battle in this larger war for the soul of political Islam is that kind of it\nRon and Saudi Arabia are supporting these factions is kind of a battle in this larger war for the soul of political Islam is that kind of it\nSure yeah exactly and so what I'm saying is that historically and traditionally the sect of Islam that ... have practiced for years are not necessarily aligned with the Saudi an Iranian ... for political reasons they are now aligning with each other\nGotcha gotcha folks here it'd be easy does that make more sense good we got sums up all around or if you go and I appreciate you explain that I think you know part of the complication Jane Ferguson is that this is complicated I mean some words you can't just boil down to one cause but that also makes it hard\nFor us sworn in Yemen to zero in on them and and really think our teeth in but your reporting has involved some of the people on the ground\nWho are dealing with the results of this larger fight for the soul of political Islam you describe the story of an eleven year old girl that you encountered back in June that kind of stuck with you can you give us the basics of what happened to her\n[noise] sure telling her story is one of the reasons is the most important reason why journalists need access to this because we have to put a face and a name and a picture to the statistics otherwise they're just ... and I think then we we deal with with a lot\nOf that of of of difficulty trying to get the public to understand the level of this crisis so I ... I was in ... um which is a problem than sort of in northwest of of Santa and controlled by the who the rebels\nAnd uh and it's meant and us in the in the town of hijacking the capital of the province there was a hospital where like every single hospital that I've seen there that the children's ward is now a de facto malnutrition ward and we were just filming there with some\nEvery single hospital that I've seen there that the children's ward is now a de facto malnutrition wards and we were just filming there with some women and their babies' whenever a young man tall deathly than\nRushed and with the with the tiny looked like just sort of like a bundle of clothes and it was hit eleven year old sister name was ...\nAnd for a horrible few moments we really thought may mono might dying in front of us on the hospital bed she was eleven years old and way too\nI think twenty four pounds was what it was about what we had to\nWhat we had asked at the doctors at that and it was\nAbsolutely a horrifying to watch her she you know when when a child gets so weak and so among rushed\nThey also become so vulnerable to any kinds of infection and so they tend to get diarrhea anyway and so even even if you do manage to get through to them and uh they get diarrhea they get devastatingly dehydrated as a result the whole thing just spirals\nUntil the child's body just gives in um we spent some time they're filming with my own end speaking with her family\nAnd her mother eventually came the next day we were able to talk to her and we were piecing together the family story and it is a story that reflects millions of people's stories in Yemen\nAnd it is that her father was a schoolteacher and a government school\nBut whenever the uh the government salaries stopped over two years ago he his salary stop to once people lost that level of income the government was that the the biggest employer by far in the country before the war\nAnd that's not just soldiers and police that's people who work in offices that's teachers any kind of clerical work or any kind of bureaucratic work in Yemen wants those salaries stopped\nPeople would then go on to trying to live off of what the aid agencies would call coping mechanisms to you and I\nWants those salaries stopped people would then go on to trying to live off of what the aid agencies would call coping mechanisms to you and I that's simply do have any savings do I have a line of credit at the local store do have any livestock in the backyard do I have relatives who can help us out after two years\nOff of the commons find more events in your community ads can you know you dot org\nFunding for ... comes from you have a pi college offering dozens of degree answer ticket programs instruction in business life sciences and cybersecurity\nCourse schedules advising on financial aid information and why you see ...

A. M. U. dot org before we bring in our next two guests Steve I didn't want to ask you one thing about the way the documentary was made I Wonder how you said about\nTelling the students' stories I mean there is a moment in one episode where either you or a cameraman and tries to talk about one student about her cutting class I mean all the kids that you follow goes through various struggles with\nIts class was grades with life what kinds of boundaries do you have to sense when you're telling a story\nStruggles with the class was grades with life what kinds of boundaries do you have to set when you're telling a story about high schoolers\nWell that's a great question um I've always tried in the films I've done over the years has to a\n... had the subject feel like they have real agency in the making of what we're doing\nA you know the idea we aim for is is that we're really making the film with them not on them\nAnd yes ultimately we have editorial control but we take very seriously that kind of relationship and on this series it was vitally important that they're also be other filmmakers involved we had a diverse team of filmmakers Kevin shower Rebecca parish being Lou\n... you know Charles the story was followed by Kevin ... I mean I felt a little bit with Charles but that's really a cabin who\nI mean being I'm Sorry ... that that followed a Charles a story and they had to establish these kinds of relationships\nUm that are important now the moment you're talking about is with tiara that's actually a story I happened to be falling and you know if you have to navigate those those times where you have to be able to ask difficult questions\nBut you also have to be able to step back when when it's clear that that you know they don't really want to go there and that happens frequently with her because she was struggling with a lot of things\nAt that time I thought was relevant to include that in the film\nA few more for your comments before we bring in our next two guests Mitch writes we can't move forward if we failed to address the past and continue to ignore the inequalities of today people of color are treated differently in America period end of sentence\nAgility for fun tweeted I've watched every episode of America to me I absolutely love it I'm shocked at how clueless the white teachers are especially that physics teacher the school board is a disaster spoken word is amazing by the way by way by the news ...\nPhysics teacher the school board is a disaster spoken word is amazing by the way by way by the news of full disclosure we should note we did reach out to the superintendent of the district Steve associate for his thoughts on the series we did not get a response but the invitation remains open\nWe also reached out to the principle of Oak Park in the river forest high school next and rouse\nWe were unable to speak with him for the program we're told\nHe is traveling for work from Philadelphia where he attended an event called the national summit for courageous conversations about race so both those invitations remain open worth noting that neither the principal nor the superintendent participated in the documentary either is that right see that's all right\nLet's see more voices to the conversation to talk more about racial equity in schools nationwide amen to Louis is the director of the Institute for research on race and public policy at\nThe University of Illinois at Chicago her latest book is called despite the best intentions how racial equity thrives in good schools professor Lewis welcome to want to say thanks I had any also with us here at W. B. easy is David Stovall a professor of African American studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago\nHis focus is on the influence of race in urban education community development and housing and he is a Chicago native professor still Volkow thanks so much that have professors have you watched the series any part of it some of it all of that yes\nFestival what do you think of it so far what is there any anything in particular that struck you the hardest\nThing that struck me the hardest is an episode to win one of the parents of a student actually goes on the fourth floor and I think this is the\nEnd the conversation that we do not have about schools that have the illusion of integration and I said the illusion of integration because it just means that students of color are in the same place with white students but when this mom talked about what happened to her in the early nineties in on that fourth floor and he's\nThe same place with white students when this mom talked about what happened to her in the early nineties in on that fourth floor and he still happening today that to me is the story of us ... professor Lewis what about you [noise]\nYou know one of the things that really struck me there are a lot of powerful moments in the series but I think one of the things that also struck me as the silences some of the some of that kill missions and I know a lot of this had to do I'm sure with who was willing to participate and who wasn't\nOne of the things you notice in that district is that the people aren't in the documentary so all the white powerful wealthy families a key leaders and the district a lot of the people who had the most power and the most influence over what that school ends up looking like\nA opt out and I think that's a kind of powerful and symbolic I'm a example of what's actually going on in the district\nPay by the way for those of you listening and I forgot to mention we may be discussing some things in the documentary that if you were eager to watch America to me might turn out to be spoilers so do that in mind in the conversation if you would like to listen to this lady because I don't want to get them tweets do not\nTweeting me [laughter] 'cause I ruin this film for you I don't want to hear it but if you want to listen to this later on your own after you've had time to watch the documentary you'll find our

equity look like is it making sure that black kids in white kids get the same test scores is it about disciplinary procedures is it about truancy is it about people\nFeel being nice to one another

are unwilling to talk about [noise]\nI mean I think the Susan thank you for that question but I think the thing around equity and I think the ... to him and his point what people are unwilling to talk about equity is really talking about we distribution\nSo when you talk about redistribution so now the question becomes who has had the least and now what are those things that they talk about that they meet the other thing around equity is getting people what they need when they meet it and that the ... is the issue one concern\nGive me an example of getting people what they need when they need\nA young person says we have a particular problem with this teacher who is constantly\nGiving us disciplinary referrals\nConstantly grading us in ways that we feel to be dubious now there needs to be so that racial equity team at the schoolhouse whoever that is\nThat person needs to be in the conversation that racial equity team it can't be the conversation around young people which often happens in school houses that young people are blamed for this not equitable condition professor Lewis ... ... what do you find that the\nBig barriers to advancing toward racial equity is it is that

on one day\nBack now to our conversation with professors Amanda Lewis and David Stovall Steve James and Charles Donaldson we asked some of the members of our one eight ... how they believe their race affected their own educations and we got a ton of responses thank you for the mall\nOne person wrote the white adults in the neighborhood hated the fact that we were bussed in school we had to travel to and from school in groups to keep from being jumped by mobs\nAnother text club member wrote being Spanish and a woman I was told I could not be a scientist growing up took me years to wrap myself around the fact that I could be slower process than most but thankfully I made it\nA third texture wrote I watched as my African American friends whose grades weren't nearly as good as mine received scholarship after a scholarship I worked hard throughout high school to be the first in my family to go to college yet I suffered because I was white unfair\nProfessor stove all there is a perception as you mentioned with regards to things like\nAdvanced placement courses in international baccalaureate courses and\nScholarships that the way we engage with race in a larger way ten push too far that we can give people of color an additional advantage just because they're black or brown and not because of their academic performance what do you make that to me I\nI mean it's not in a thing around pushing too far I think it's a real issue will not pushing far enough\nRight when we talk about equity we have to talk about who has historically been denied opportunity and then how are those opportunities denied in real time currently and because one why student did not get one scholarship does not mean\nAnd then how are those opportunities denied in real time currently and because one white student did not get one scholarship does not mean that\nBlack and Latino students across the country do not are not chemically denied access so I think one of the conversations around race that becomes critical is to understand the individual and the structural and I think in the United states we are much more hesitant to engage the structural\nSteve what's got to be one of the challenges of a documentary like this particularly some of the reaction I Wonder what kinds of reactions it's gotten so far especially from from audience who are not people of color or have you been able to parse out three actions that that finally\nWell I've I've not on Twitter for personal reasons but um [noise] but you know I think I'm so I'm not really equipped to answer that in any kind of thorough way but um you know I think uh my anecdote experiences is that a lot of white audiences\nAre people watching it it it has been a good experience and more eye opening experience if for no other reason than there are other reasons is that we've tried to take you more deeply into the lives of black and biracial kids who are not\nLiving in a poor besieged neighborhood in Chicago and at risk of gang violence and all of the things that we see an awful lot of in documentary filmmaking including some past work\nAnd I think that you know to to be able to give people the experiences of their lives and how they look at race and their experience with the with the community and America has been eye opening for for a lot of of white parents\nCharles how do you see this this difference when you were in high school and I I Want to ask you to speak for anyone high school but yours but in terms of white students students of color achievement these comments about you know students of color getting advantages just because of the color of their skin does that reflect your\nThese comments about you know students of color getting advantages just because of the color of their skin is does that reflect your experience and off my school or do you see it differently\nUm I think in general like there's kind of like\nHow do I say there's this blanket we put over white kids it's like you're you know they always going to be warm regardless of what happens all of them are always going to be one when it comes to kids of color there's like okay well we got like\nA whole bunch of sleeping bags but we ain't got one blanket for everybody and only some people get sleep in ... you know I definitely think for people like me and gay who's also featured documentaries were like\nI wouldn't say like the ... well I I didn't want to compare saying the other students but the school has like\nI guess prominent interest in us because of what we do with our extra curricula and so it was just already saying that they're like okay well we need to make sure those kids are good you know but for someone who is in in any extra curricular is who doesn't have any type of\nUm non student teacher relationship with any adult in the building they like it's hard to get you know trapped in between the margins they don't get that sleeping bag I was talking about they're not even consider it to get one and that's like I think that's the whole thing right there is this blankets vices sleeping bags whereas like\nAll other white kids like all those kids who come from those types of homes and have stakes in the school the parents are big funders their siblings went there whatever whatever and then you got the kids who I mean like meat luckily I found spoken word but you got kids like me who\nI mean a few of my cousins went to oh the but other than that right it was not really so you kind of have to fend for yourself exactly ... that's just not the case you know I think it goes\nOh the but other than that right there was nothing really to kind of have to fend for yourself ... those is not the case you know I think it goes to show in um\nWhich episodes that Mr Dorner was like most of the kids and who's on the news um tutoring sessions are usually white to an all white is oh yeah oh I and that's that's part like you know personal accountability but that's also to school like\nYou got to have kids of color in honors classes for them to get on his tutoring but I was just the one right to you know so\nWell to that point I Wonder if we can dig deeper on that professor loose carry tweeted I'm eager to hear the reasons why African American kids don't get picked for tougher classes has anything changed in the past Thirty years [noise]\nYou know it's hard to look at the high school level and understand you can take a snapshot of high school level but when we study districts like a park like Evanston like Brookline mass like Shaker Heights I mean there's dozens and dozens of these kinds of districts\nThat tracking that kids experience starts in first second and third grade and what we do in these districts we take hits that might be you know an inch apart in terms of their skills coming in\nAnd we track them early and what we know over and over again for research is that that tracking means that kids don't hire attracts get more they get better they can better teaching and so we take his it might even be a niche apart in terms of skills and we and we make that skills gap larger and larger over time\nAnd so when we look at schools like a park as Dave said earlier\nThe structures that we have in place around around things like creating these academic tracks um are inevitably going to uh take\nRacial disparities that exist in our society and and reproduce them in our schools and that this ... the troubling thing is that race becomes not only part of how these trucks get credit and if you look at the history of the really deep racist history and try\nThe troubling thing is that race becomes not only part of how these tax get credit and if you look at the history of the really deep racist history of tracking and general race also becomes the explanation for why it's okay\nThe fact that you can walk into a school today and twenty Eighteen and see that the most advantage educational spaces in school or Ninety percent white and the least advantage educational expect you know places in the same exact school apparently black should have us all up in arms that the fact that we think that that's okay it's all about our racial mythology\nI I think we also have to ask questions about what defines being educated and what a good education is and you know I've heard a PE teachers including Ty Williams the black or a future in the series\nLament the fact that as a piece students often just want to be given the information they need to score well on the test that's what they want they're not really that interested in learning
