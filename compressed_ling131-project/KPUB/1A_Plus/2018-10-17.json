Johnson in Washington wonder Native American voters thinking about for the midterms much more than what's happening with Senator Elizabeth Warren and President Trump their ongoing feud over Warren claiming to have tribal ancestry\nThe senator has addressed her heritage in the past including at this year's National Congress of American Indians\nI get why some people think there's hate to be made here you won't find my family members on any roles and I'm not enrolled in a tried and I want to make something clear\nI respect that distinction\nI understand that tribal membership is determined by tribes and only by tribes my mother's family was part Native American and my daddy's parents were bitterly opposed to their relations\nHeritage in the past including at this year's National Congress

respect that distinction\nI understand that tribal membership is determined by tribes and only by tribes but my mother's family was part Native American and my daddy's parents were bitterly opposed to their relationship\nNow in the scheme of things doesn't matter if Senator Warren really is a verifiable tribal heritage\nClearly it does to her especially after the president referred to her as Pocahontas and said he would give a million dollars to the charity of her choice if she could prove or ancestry that apparently led the senator to take a DNA test who's results she says prove that she is Cherokee\nThat drew criticism from tribal leaders like the Cherokee Nation secretary of state Chuck Hoskins junior who spoke on MORNING edition\nUm and then we're now at the point where she's taken a DNA test and this I think muddy the waters for a lot of Americans on a subject that they don't know a great deal about so that's what the concern is is that we're a sovereign nation we have a very specific\nMeans by which you are a Cherokee citizen that's true of oh Indian nations and for a senator in this context of this ongoing back and forth political a fight or to talk about DNA I really undermines tribal interest frankly\nOn top of that the test did nothing to stop the presidents insults he tweeted quote\nPocahontas the bad version sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren is getting

in our inbox\nHi Sheila this is Carol elaborately uh I found out about oh four or five years ago that we had a lot of documentation from my mother to uh that we were part of the ... tribe in Oklahoma we\nApplied to be a member of the ... tribe we were accepted and it's been a real joy to be a member 'cause we um\nWe can vote now we get all kinds of information from them what they're doing with the tried just amazing\nCarol thanks very much for getting in touch with us more ... can you give us a sense of of what the process is for becoming an acknowledged tribal citizen understanding that every tribe has the right to set its own process and they can be be quite different but broadly speaking what what does it take you\nA tribe has an enrollment committee of some kind that actually goes through and sets out the process required proving family connections to Simon said are looking for a basic\nWhat they're doing with the tried just amazing\nCarol thanks very much for getting in touch with us mark ... can you give us a sense of of what the process is for becoming an acknowledged tribal citizen understanding that every tribe has the right to set its own process and they can be be quite different but broadly speaking what what does it take you\nUsually a tribe has an enrollment committee of some kind that actually goes through and sets out the process required proving family connections to Simon said are looking for I'm basically I'm a history of involvement with the tribe that goes back um ah through time\nI mean one of the I think really important ideas and this is that I'm a tribal community is one that's been around\nIn many cases for tens of thousands of years and so this idea of a long arc and being part of that is I think really important ... one of the things I Love to think about as a shoney's once hunted vested on\nHunted mastodon\nHunted best it I think about that long arc\nYeah yeah I it's I Can't imagine Simon the benefit of just kind of knowing\nThat you're part of a community that goes back millennia you talked about appropriation by whites of tribal culture are there other kinds of benefits that you find whether they're intrinsically extra benefits of being an acknowledged member of a tribe that are worth\nProtecting that are worth keeping their proper places I mean Carol talked about being able to vote in the tribe and also just knowing what the tribe is doing what are the kind of benefits are there to being an acknowledge citizen of a truck\nWell I think what you kind of hit it right there with that that word protection I think that's for us it is we are it isn't coming upon us to protect our ... our our children are native languages are traditions are land the water\nTry that are worth protecting that are worth keeping in their proper places I mean Carol talked about being able to vote in the tribe and also just knowing what the tribe is doing what are the kind of benefits are there to being an acknowledge citizen of a truck\nWell I think what you kind of hit it right there with that that word protection I think that's for us it is we are it isn't coming upon us to protect our our our children are native languages are traditions are land\nThe water and the problem I see what these people that are doing these DNA tests is booming biotechnology business where people want to know if they're native you know they they the problem is some of them take our culture and they can modify it\nThey take our language and they can modify it\nThey take our spirituality and modify it and they make money\nThey make money off of something that they just either learn they are or it's been a part of their family lore or they speak with some smog and title meant\nLike they've lived the life of a native like somebody's ever called them an engine or a our word the name of the Washington football team and that's where it becomes problematic and we have to check these allies out the door\nEven if it's Elizabeth Warren\nShould know by the way it was almost exactly a year ago today that we did a discussion about these DNA testing kids the ones that say fine not your ancestry and learn what your family's from we did a program today's October seventh things we did it on October Eighteenth of last year called ... where do we come from we spoke to a geneticist\nAre named Adam Rutherford who's gone into some of the latest research about what DNA can and cannot tell us about ourselves and what you actually need to know if you are going to do one of these home DNA tests\nYou'll find that

frustrated with people claiming native as a race and doing nothing to help native issues or thinking that they're uninformed opinion on native issues is helpful\nUA progressive tweeted what we're not talking about now is North Dakota voter disenfranchisement please focus on this\n... progressive she must have known why we both Kerry living 'cause we were going there next because over the past few days there's been this story about Senator Warren but Kerry we wanted to invite you on specifically to talk about what you were in progress has brought up there's a lot of focus on what's happening in North Dakota what is going on there\nWell North Dakota has a voter identification law that has been stayed by the courts until now last week the Supreme Court\nAt decided to essentially and let it go into effect for the November election so what that means is new voter id requirements are going into force a month before the election\nAs you may know North Dakota is home to a very critical Senate race the race between us and our Heidi Heitkamp who's one of the most endangered Democrats and the Senate and us wrapped Kevin Cramer her Republican challenger pause have Kramer ahead in twenty twelve set in the high camp one her race\nThat has been stayed by the courts until now last week the Supreme Court decided to essentially let it go into effect\nFor the November election so what that means is new voter id requirements are going into force a month before the election\nAs you may know North Dakota is home to a very critical Senate race the race between us and our Heidi Heitkamp who's one of the most endangered Democrats and the Senate and us rep Kevin Cramer her Republican challenger\nPolls have Kramer ahead in twenty twelve center hike camp one her race by fewer than three thousand votes with a very strong support from Native American voters she had a very strong support from three counties in North Dakota that that are majority Native American\nAnd so this voter id law\nCould potentially fall heavily upon Native Americans courts had stayed it because they said that that north Native Americans in North Dakota we're less likely to have the types of ID that were required the types of supplemental documentation that was required to get the idea and the first place\nSo what kinds of ID are we talking about like what does the law requires\nThe central issue here is that the law requires an ID that carries a residential street address that's an issue because on many reservations that most people don't have that they have PO box is they have mailing address it and those addresses are no longer sufficient\nSo if you have ID but it carries a mailing address like a post office box you can no longer use it to vote in North Dakota and this election you could in the primary when this law was said by the court but that I Do you use in the primary is no longer good for the general\nElection a lot of these voter ID laws that have come up in the last few years has been justified by their supporters as an effort to root out voter fraud has been the argument among the supporters of North Dakota as well\nAnd that's essentially correct It's been um talked about as a measure to prevent voter fraud\nAnd those addresses are no longer sufficient so if you have ID but it carries a mailing address like a post office box you can no longer use it to vote in North Dakota and this election you could in the primary when this law was said by the court but that idea used in the primary is no longer good for the general election\nA lot of these voter ID laws that have come up in the last few years have been justified by their supporters as an effort to root out voter fraud has that been the argument among the supporters of North Dakota as well\nAnd that's essentially correct It's been\nUm talked about as a measure to prevent voter fraud and also\nBecause the the state has argued that a mailing address\nDoesn't necessarily locate a voter in the correct precinct if you have a local race on the ballot someone could use a mailing address and and even at ... vote in the wrong local district in the wrong local race so it's it's also a vote or die Lucian argument that that inappropriately cast valid and the wrong precinct would would\nDilute the ones that were correctly cast if you're a mailing address the somewhere different than where you actually reside\nWould love to hear from some of you if you live in areas where this kind of voter id law affects you particularly if you are part of a tribal population there reservation maybe you live in an area where folks predominantly have fuel boxes as their primary mailing address rather than a physical street residential address\nWhat are you seeing and how is this affecting you whether you are in

in Maryland police cars stopped us just like when they stopped us in Mississippi set up in your seat kept ... kept both hands on the wheel and looked straight ahead\nYou took out your University of Maryland I D and took my red black and green African medallion into my public enemy T shirt you told me to sit up keep my hands on the dashboard don't say a word\nThe officer now down and lifting your window when I saw your face so close to his gun I Want it to snatch it and watch it melt into black grits evidence police started approaching me more often and Mississippi I wanted to super power to melt every gun in the world and the black grits officer asked why we had in Mississippi license plates\nBecause we are residents of Jackson, Mississippi you say\nI have a post doctoral appointment at the University of Maryland College park\nHow 'bout done anything wrong officer when officer told you to speak up and claim your change lanes without signaling you kept your grip on the steering wheel and said I did not change lanes without signaling you spit up behind me so I signal and changed lanes officer tried to laugh in your face if he asked for your license in registration\nIs that your man he asked you he needs to show some identification to\nYour hands came up to staring well and you pointed at officers face move away from my car you said that as much as he is Fifteen Years old he does not have identification may not have your badge number please I hated how it sounded when you didn't use contractions the officer as both of us to step out of the car\nAnd said I did not change lanes without signaling you spit up behind me so I signaled and changed lanes officer tried to laugh in your face if he asked for your license and registration\nIs that your man he asked you he needs to show some identification to\nYour hands came up to staring well and you pointed at the officers face move away from my car you said that as much how he is Fifteen Years old he does not have identification I mean I have your badge number please\nI hated how it sounded when you didn't use contractions the officer as both of us to step out of the car we will not get out of his car you said louder this time we have done nothing wrong\nMy fist were bald up and I was inching toward the driver's side window you slapped me across my chest with the back of your hand and told me to be quiet and unconscious office right as another officer pulled up the first officer who is now laughing walk back to the second officers car\nYou eventually showed a second officer your license and your University of Maryland id officer looked at the id flipped it over and told us to have a good night\nNever give them a chance to take a shot you finally said after we walked in the apartment and lock the door they will take it they will take it they will take it I wondered why you said it three times and why you never told me to shoot back\nMississippi Marilyn it doesn't matter where the where you are they will shoot your black but out of the sky every chance they get if you have a heart attack dodging bullets they hide their guns and say you killed yourself\nI hear you I told you and try to make you laugh why didn't you just said don't instead of does not or doesn't\nAnd they instead of their though if I did not know correct English is more likely that officer might have shot us you said oh you wouldn't I told you that fool matter because you were speaking correct English you looked at me\nWhere the where you are they will shoot Joe Black but out of the sky every chance they get if you have a heart attack dodging bullets they hide their guns and say you killed yourself\nI hear you I told you and try to make you laugh why didn't you just said don't instead of does not or doesn't\nAnd they instead of their though\nIf I did not know correct English is more likely that officer might have shot us you said we wouldn't I told you\nThat fool got matter because you were speaking correct English\nYou looked at me like you were thinking you might actually be right key but in the long run correct English will save a black man more than it will hurt you will correct English they view though I Do not need saving you said I'm not the one who was an endangered species I'm not either I told you\nI Am an endangered species would a lot of gas in my stomach I'll be right back that cop gave me the bubble goods you laughed and laughed and laughed until you didn't\nWhile I was in my room change and you told me to write about what I learned from the experience with the police I wasn't sure what the right because I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky\nIt seemed like just driving or walking into a house or doing your job or cutting a grapefruit was all it took to get shot out of the sky\nAnd the biggest problem was police weren't the only people doing the shooting they were just the only people allowed to walk around and threaten us with guns in prison if they didn't like our style of flying I loved our style of fly\nOther eggs are heavy bike here say leave and there is a lot\nGoing on to the eggs are but I think one of the census from the last paragraph struck me where you write I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky right is that kind of the crux of it yeah I mean that's\nWas police weren't the only people doing the shooting\nThey were just the only people allowed to walk around and threaten us with guns in prison if they didn't like our style\nOf flying I loved our style of fly\nOut of their eggs are heavy bike here say leave and there is a lot going on to the eggs are but I think one of the census from the last paragraph struck me where you write I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky right is that kind of the crux of it\nYeah I mean that's the crust of a lot of ah the relationship our talk about in his book with my mother um I'm also talking about a situation where we went to had to go to a new school and eighth grade was the first time I've gone to school with white kids\nAnd a few my best friends from a previous school were there and one of my best best friends um took out a butter knife before school started and started trying to cut his grapefruit the same way you did every morning when we were at a school in Jackson and long story short you know the teacher uh eventually told and put a knife away treated the knife as if it was a gun\nOr we both got kicked out of school that day and we got what to buy our mothers and grandmothers and in that situation I learned that sometimes in off in a mock communities um it was black mothers primarily who had to discipline their children for the failures of their teachers\nAnd so ah my mother would always say you know you have to fly right you know don't give them a chance but I'm saying as a Fifteen year old I said I'm not sure what not giving them a chance to look like\nEat in a grapefruit got us in trouble just now you didn't do anything we got in trouble later I Would take a library book out to the library without checking it out and that got in trouble so I just wasn't sure\nAbout this this a theory my mom ahead you know you conduct them you can dodge them if you just anticipate every move and again anticipation is crucial but what happens to home\nAnd for the failures of their teachers\nAnd so uh my mother would always say you know you have to fly right you know don't give them a chance but I'm saying as a Fifteen year old I said I'm not sure what not giving them a chance to look like\nEating a grapefruit got us in trouble just now you didn't do anything we got in trouble later I Would take a library book out to the library without checking it out and that got in trouble so I just wasn't sure\nAbout this this a theory my mom ahead you know you conduct them you can dodge them if you just anticipate every move and again anticipation is crucial but what happens to home life when you spend your entire life outside of the home anticipating white supremacy and white power doing un that's the question I'm trying to asking this section and also in the entire book\nWhat did happen with your home life particularly with with you and your mom as you were trying to grapple with these things that she was telling you or the way of the world and you were trying to understand and how did that affect your relationship with her one way I think\nA lot of just traditionally American things happen I started to be resentful that my mother was telling me things some things that were right some things that were wrong um she started to be a a a lot more active in trying to police me as my body group um and I started to have lots and lots of run ins with cops are starting to get kicked out of school more\nUm but and we could talk about those things sorted we could talk about police we could talk about white people but we we couldn't talk about with things like sexual violence so we couldn't talk about was like domestic abuse she was in an abusive relationship I saw that relationship I reacted to that relationship I tried to fight and protect different relationship", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Flagstaff", "day":
