A. M. U. dot for their medical I Wonder if we could pick up with that last question I asked\nCasey Kendra tweeted what I Would like to see is all of the Democrats and Republicans voted out of Congress they are so polarized we need to start over\nHow much do you get a sense that the pure polarization of today's politics is just changing the way voters approached this year's midterms I mean you know Nancy Pelosi's named still comes up quite a bit on the campaign trail she's a of an obvious kind of a hot button for many Republican voters but\nIt is that working in terms of making people show up or is it just turning people\nOff you know a lot of people might be an are frustrated with politics and the country but we're seeing the opposite effect of it not keeping people home or or voting for some third party coalition in fact it's people strapping on the T shirts and going as hard as they can\nI ... in their political corners I mean the fact is midterms are usually about activist they're usually about the hardest core a people within the party but in fact\nWe're seeing the potential for a surge this year in turnout I spoke to Michael McDonald who's a professor at the University of Florida who's really one of the preeminent turnout experts in the ...\nThis year in turnout I spoke to Michael McDonald who's a professor at the University of Florida who's really\nOne of the preeminent turnout experts in the country maintains that turnout database he expects there to be a turnout of about forty five fifty percent of eligible voters this year that doesn't sound like a lot but it would be the highest level for mid term since the mid Nineteen sixties\nAnd that is really spurred on by\nAll of this high interest we're seeing high turnout in primaries and in special elections and you know frankly you've seen Democrats really fired up to vote against this president and we've seen that according to a Pew sixty percent of people say the president is a factor in their vote and that's higher than it's ever been\nA wonder wanna summers what your take is on that in terms of the the potential playbook for Democrats first of all let's\nJust said a little context is focused on the house for example how many seats with the Democrats need to flip\nThe house sure said Democrats would need twenty three seats in order to take control of the house of representatives and right now most public pull in when we look across the landscape suggests that\nThey're doing they're making good efforts and things are looking good for them right now one thing that I've noticed as I've been talking to folks who work on the Democratic side of the aisle who are professional political folks is they're spending a lot of money to make sure that their voter turnout and are particularly looking at the types of voters infrequent voters who say\nMay show up in a presidential election year but are more likely to stay home\nAnd I'm an off year or mid term here and there's a reason for that\nTypically when we look at the electorate that shows up for mid term elections it's typically older whiter and more Republicans ... Democrats spending a lot of money and a lot of time on the ground trying to turn out younger voters those millennials voters of color or Latino African Americans and Asians who are more likely to vote for Democrats are also more likely to stay home and ...\nIs there are certain benchmark wanna for what Democrats\nWho are more likely to vote for Democrats are also more likely to stay home and ...\nIs there are certain benchmark wanna for what Democrats would consider for lack of a better word of blowouts like you use the goal just to get a fifty percent plus one or is there a larger like a stretch goal but the Democratic party is aiming for\nWhat I'm hearing from most people including Ben ray Lujan congressmen who chairs the Democratic democratic congressional campaign committee is\nThey don't think this is going to be a blowout year they feel confident and their chances of taking back the house of turning the house ... but I don't think most people most members of Congress were involved in this would say that there's going to be a huge blue wave crashing over a pick up some ten seats or something like that\nThey're focused on delivering that twenty three at turning the house bill and the message I keep hearing from them as they want to do that is it a balance of power right now Republicans\nControl every branch of government and they want to restore balance of power to this administration\nYou know this idea of a blue way was the focus of an email from Marty who wrote I'm all about the blue wave but I'm afraid that between voter disenfranchisement lingering gerrymandering and possible foreign interference we're about to be punk again\nDominican let me ask you about some of the polling what are some of the main trends in national polls right now in terms of how the Democrats and Republicans might do\nWell when we look at our NPR PBS NewsHour Marist polling Democrats have had an advantage on what's known as the congressional ballot who would you prefer to be a two run Congress ... the Democrat in your district or the Republican in your district\nYou know we've had an advantage for Democrats anywhere from seven to twelve points over from the summer until now\nOr other polling other public falling shown it to be double digits that's about the range that Democrats feel like they would be able to take the at least those twenty three seats in the house and I look at some other factors to just look at the landscape and the playing field and when it\nAble to take the at least those twenty three seats in the house uh and I look at some other factors to just look at the landscape and the playing field and when I gained out or how many seats would be up for grabs this year I found that there are ... seats that were a competitive to potentially competitive\nDespite all the talk of cabinet or you know that confirmation battle in ... Republicans and it certainly did\nOnly six of those seats are democratic held seats Seventy four seats are of the potentially competitive to competitive landscape are held by Republicans no matter what you look at that and you know if the Democrats win half of those that's the house\n[noise] glad to hear from some of you with regards to your concerns about the midterms including about the nature of polling in general are doing the God love you to respond to this comment from a listener who left a note in our inbox\nI'm Alan from Ashville North Carolina and I'm frustrated with the elections with not having enough\nHoles in down ballot races even even U.S House but state house and stuff because if it's a close election I Want to vote Democrat\nAt least at the federal and state level but if it's a Jew and that I Want to vote a third party greener libertarian\nOr write my own name so I Need to know if the race is close or not if it's a it's an issue where if my vote might be the deciding vote and I need a poll I Need some polls to uh to divide and it it actually changes my vote the poll change my vote\nEllen thanks for your comment Domingo that cracks me up or if he wants to run for office he should run for office if he wants to a vote third party because that's his conscience than he should do so\nI get a pragmatic approach though and I think a lot of you know establishment Democrats would argue that they wish there were a lot more voters like him\nA pragmatic approach though and I think a lot of you know establishment Democrats would argue that they wish there were a lot more voters like him who voted in Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania for the Democrat instead of voting for the third party candidate now when it comes to polls look\nThere is a huge problem in this country when it comes to a polling generally and then when you go and drill down into the state level or district level or state house level my goodness\nThe response rate that people are getting from polling is lower and lower and lower every year in other words you make a phone call does somebody wish to participate in that that just continues to decrease\nIt takes a lot of money to conduct a good pole and to get a sizable enough sample that the results are representative and it's really tough and I would just say go based on the issues and vote your conscience\nYeah quite a lot of you express real concern with the very nature of polling Peter wrote on our Facebook page please discuss the obsession the media NPR included has with the horse race method of election coverage is an irresponsible journalism to report on polls one such reporting could affect turnout or elections are not sporting events\nAnd Michael wrote on our Facebook page unit which still trust polls remember how that turned out in twenty sixteen\nYeah I mean I you know look I mean this is a this is a tried and true a criticism\nUm you know we can get into the science of polling and whatnot and I would disagree that were obsessed quote unquote with polling we do use it to pepper our coverage and to give us a sense of what the snap shots are within districts in fact\nLow clouds it's odd cross eastern Arizona will burn off around midday temperatures for cats after about ten degrees below average for this time of year low mid fifties Flagstaff Williams Grand Canyon never hunted patchy county mid fifties low sixties around Prescott mid sixties today with the ... valley and the low seventies a little bit warmer and sunny\nOn friday rain showers in mile temperatures over the coming weekend\nSupport for gay and ... comes from northern Arizona University of ... community celebrates homecoming at a pep rally friday October twenty six that five thirty at heritage square the homecoming parade is the next morning at eleven on campus more at any you dot edu slash homecoming\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the financial services firm of Raymond James offering personalized wealth management advice and banking and capital markets expertise along with a legacy\nThis from of Raymond James offering personalized wealth management advice and banking and capital markets expertise along with the legacy of putting clients financial wellbeing first learned more at Raymond James dot com\nAnd from the science Sims foundation since Nineteen eighty five supporting advances in science education and the arts towards a better more just society more information is available at size Sims foundation dot org\nBack now to our conversation with Juana Summers of the Associated Press Katie Sanders of politifact and NPR's political months and are all still time to get in some of your questions and thoughts about the mid term elections email us one a ass W.

I feel more comfortable saying the Democrats who say they stand for ... or the Democrats who have done\n... to me journalistically that's more reliable but I Do take John's\nPoint that it just feels a little bit too broad\nBrush yeah I mean we have to always be aware of trying to get into some of the issues and where are the party stand on these things and what they've been pushing I think that that's been part of\nThe pushback and why you've seen so much interest from Democrats obviously in this election because they've seen so much of what President Obama did or regulations that were put in place that have been rolled back for example or by the environmental protection agency a and a whole host of other things including an immigration policy\nThat Democrats are firmly against\nAnd it's also what you saw a as a rise of the Tea Party and twenty ten where they didn't trust a lot of their government officials including a lot of Republicans and how they essentially took over the Republican Party with that message of uh taxed enough already and being really in opposition to\nA President Obama's health care act so the parties stand for a very very different things and we're seeing that play out and going to come to a head and in this in this mid term\nKatie I Wonder if you can respond to a listener who left a note on our website the one eight dot org the listener writes with the upcoming midterm elections and Michelle Obama's advice to go high when opponents go low what is the effectiveness of negative campaigns are the negative campaign ads coming from a particular party or group ...\nI think everyone's guilty and I don't think any party as a as an Israeli going going high all the time right and I think that's because it's\nEveryone's guilty and I don't think any party as a\nAs an Israeli going going high all the time right and I think that's because it's effective and it really sticks with people as much as people like to say that they dislike negative advertising and I think actually do\nA memorable and it's certainly a bill that impression that people are going to remember and that's why we see so much of it and that's why we have jobs here ... years [laughter] it's funny to do\nYou you will never be unemployed not ever\nTheir medical research on some of the diversity of the candidates this time around quite a few record numbers of women running a record numbers of el ... out L G beach acute Kennedy's running some of whom spoke to Ari Shapiro on all things considered earlier\nGive us a sense of what that means for the midterms and whether or many of these candidates are considered to stay on a strong chance of winning\nWell look you're correct that there are a lot of people um who are\nA ... of diverse backgrounds I mean women are the biggest bloc of this that are really driving the midterms you think of a lot of Native American candidates or you know just a New Hampshire there Chris Pappas who is\nA an openly gay man or he would be the first gay representative from the state of New Hampshire if he wins in a new in the first congressional district there in New Hampshire as a Democrat now\nBut when again we look at the power of the midterms women they has been fired up since the day President Trump\nWas elected and when we talk about when the when I Am a democratic women there have been two hundred and thirty five women\nWho have been nominated for ah for Congress for their party's nomination a hundred and eighty three of those a hundred and eighty three has been democratic women just if you were to take the number of democratic women who are running\n... that would be bigger than the record previously of all women combined who're nominees and that was a hundred and sixty seven\nI'm Sorry you just just to clarify the numbers you're basically saying three out of four women\nOf all women combined who're nominees and that was a hundred and sixty seven\nSo I'm Sorry you just just to clarify the numbers are basically saying that three out of four women in this in this go round a democratic women who've been nominated\nAbsolutely that's absolutely right and the the wave of democratic women the year of the woman quote unquote round to ah after Nineteen Ninety two after the Clarence Thomas Anita Hill areas have been driven by democratic women and we've seen them be very fired up in poll after poll\nAnd you know they're going to lead the march to the polls for Democrats and if they win the house it's going to be largely because of women\nWanted there are some races where you know women are making a very historic a historic showing I mean the Arizona Senate races going on right now between here and send them at the Democrat and more with Sally the Republican you know Arizona is going to have a female senator in that seat\nBut I Wonder how much you see this as a bipartisan trend we heard the numbers from Dominican oh but do we get the sense\nThat both parties both major parties are trying to be part of this trend trying to embrace this trend\nSo I think that the energy and when we talk about female candidates is certainly more on the side of Democrats than Republicans I think that's frustrated\nAnd number of Republican women I spoke to two women who founded the group Republican women for progress recently and they told me that they were really concerned that their party doesn't have an apparatus to cultivate young promising Republican conservative women\nFrom the local those local level seats all the labs so nothing that really reflects say what you see on the left on the Democratic side from emily's list a group that cultivate and backs\nA pro abortion rights when female candidates so there there is some concern certainly among Republicans and my colleagues at age ...

Bo of applied economic research here in New Hampshire we'd love to hear from you to share what you know about finding a job in today's economy\nComments on our Facebook page where you can watch video stream courtesy of New Hampshire public radio tweet us at one a or email one at a at W. A. M. U. dot org before we keep going and introduce our next guests I just want to\nTweet us at one a or email one at a at W. A. M. U. dot org before we keep going and introduce our next guests I just want to kind of add a yes any men to what then deal you just said there is no shame and getting a career that doesn't require a college degree\nNot and we did a show last year called how to earn six figures without a four year degree about how to get into some of these skilled trades\nThat requires some training or an apprenticeship but that don't require a four year bachelor's degree one of our guests are Nicholas when Louis Wyman who was the c._e._o. of the Institute\nFor workplace skills and innovation wrote a book called the job you\nAnd he put a question to answer on our website about what an apprenticeship is how does an apprenticeship work\nWhen should you consider taking one where do you go to find one you'll find all this information on our site a program called how to earn six figures without a four year degree on line at the one at a dot for that's the word ... the number one the letter a dot org\nBefore we bring in our next two guests Russ one more thing about the job market here you mentioned\nThat New Hampshire has an aging population affordable housing is a challenge New Hampshire is one of many states has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic how does all of this show up in in the job market is it just an aging job market or or does it manifest in other ways than that well I think the main thing that\nIt that we see right now is sort of the lagging wage growth in the state than it is kind of a deterrent to bringing more people into the labor force attracting more people to the state our wage growth has been around two two and a half percent a year\nIt's sort of lagging this prosperous economy that we hear so much about I think one of the quips that I recall a woman said yeah we have a great job market in New Hampshire I should know I have three jobs and I need three jobs go yet by so I think that that's a that's\nA woman said yeah we have a great job market in New Hampshire I should know I have three jobs and I need three jobs go yet by so I think that that's a that's sort of the main a stumbling block right now we're beginning to see a little bit of labor force growth as I said we've added sixty five thousand jobs in this state since the down turn\nKind of reverse course and started becoming an improvement but we've only added Seventeen thousand workers\nSo that they're in lies to crunch\nGlad to get to some more of your comments about what you're experiencing where you live with work especially in skilled trades\nSean emailed I work in the steel mill and union and management has been complaining about the lack of quality candidates were even taking mc Donald's employees if they will come in a big issue is drug testing half our potential ... potential candidates don't come in for an interview after hearing that we randomly drug test\nJulian tweeted like his billion jobs are no consequences if they don't pay a living wage all the jobs I see what ... my education and pay a third of what is manageable\nBut try to zoom out a little bit more and talk about what's happening not only here in New Hampshire but also nationwide joining us from our home base in Washington is Ryan none policy director of the Hamilton Project and a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution Ryan welcome to want to thank you for having me on\nAlso here with this is Christine car the executive director for the New Hampshire career and technical educators association Christine welcome thank Brian can you give us the big national snapshot of what's happening across the country right now in terms of the labor market we know what the national picture is\nWe've talked about New Hampshire are most states doing OK really struggling what does it look like on a more granular level\nSure what I think that it's important to start from a long term perspective to understand where we are now ah and I think it can be summarized with the idea that the labor market is not always linking workers with economic opportunity\nPerspective to understand where we are now ah and I think it can be summarized with the idea that the labor market is not always linking workers with economic opportunity I start by saying that productivity growth overall has been unusually low since the mid to thousands wage growth has also been quite weak\nOr and then there's also tremendous variation in wage levels across the country it's not always easy for workers to access jobs in those high wage places\nAre at the Hamilton Project we've released a paper recently that describes how over the last forty years geographic mobility has plummeted in those geographic imbalances those wage differences I just mentioned have tended to persist over time and the struggling areas in this country are not generally catching up with the prosperous places\nWe asked members of our one a text club for their input one person wrote it wrote us at age Seventy one I was shocked to be hired I\nAm a retired attorney working as a state employee Ryan do we officially qualify now is being in a a labor shortage capital L capital as labor shortage\nI actually have a different perspective on this or that and there's an example I like the kind of illustrates my thinking about labor shortages or if you go into a store and you offer to pay less than the posted price for something and the store refuses to do that or we don't say there's a shortage\nAnd I think the same logic applies to the labor market fit in recent years we just aren't seeing broad signs of extreme labor scarcity in the national data or that scarcity should produce rapidly rising wages as employers compete for workers\nAnd we just haven't observe that you know overall real wage growth after we adjust for inflation remains very weak\nAnd there's little evidence of earnings and brought industry groups outpacing other industries by big margins are for example ... wage growth in construction and manufacturing has not so different than for the overall economy and I'd also say that wages are growing at roughly ... ...\nWage growth in construction and manufacturing is not so different than for the overall economy\nAnd I'd also say that wages are growing at roughly similar rates across regions throwing a bit faster in New England in the Pacific states but\nAh but not tremendous gaps and and then I'll just end by saying that that's all to say that they were not seeing this at the broad national level but there could certainly be particular occupations in particular places that are characterized by labor scarcity and that have seen some pretty rapid wage growth I just don't think that's probably true of us labor market\nWe heard from quite a lot of you about just the nature of wages as an impediment to feeling these jobs Ronald posted on our Facebook page as someone who worked for many years in construction mostly trim carpentry I can see wages in the field aren't enough to attract and keep people willing to do the work\nWhich show emailed it's wages not supply\nAnd Christine car I Wonder if you might respond to this tweet from a friend who wrote New Hampshire eliminated the state minimum wage a few years ago so even though all surrounding states have raised there's we're at the national minimum wage thousands traveled to Massachusetts daily were the pay is much better\nChristine in terms of what you were dealing with trying to get jobs matched up with workers how much does the state's minimum wage factor into structurally\nOr [noise] well I don't have any empirical data why so many uh employees are working in national traveling there that I Know when I Lived there that it played over half a million or caters everyday into the city and out and many of those that coming from New Hampshire\nSo you know wages is one aspect of it but there for sure is an actual shortage of people and my feeling is we've got to really just focus on how they can get the people that we as into the jobs that are out there\nDo you see is the Roosevelt shortage Christine was there a point at which you begin to notice\nCan get the people that we have and to the jobs that are out there\nWhen he sees the Roosevelt shortage Christine was there a point at which you begin to notice more viscerally that the job market and the labor pool were significantly mismatched\nThat\nYou know I I feel like you know my point of view is I'm going to sort of a wider industry perspective in in a sense that I work in technology for the last ten years and coming to New Hampshire and looking at each of these high end um occupation such as automotive construction\nManufacturing there just seems to be shortages across every single single sector whether it's in India factoring or in high tech\nLet's get to a few more of your comments particularly about the nature of what we've described as an aging workforce Christian in Wisconsin emailed\nTo all the companies out there whining that they can't hire enough people stop discriminating against older workers and older is in quotes we're not old and we have so much experience plus we don't always want a huge salary\nAndme us and ... dot org [noise]\nI'm rather young two time Oscar winning out just how we feel dining knew that family memoir\nBut he said as a child she was repeatedly sexually abused\nAs I started my early career I was able to do our part to me that we're over well\nNext time here now [noise]\nHumor now begins in about twenty minutes on Arizona Public radio can you know you your source

conversation with Russ T. Bo and Ryan ... let me get to a few more of your comments before we bring in our next guest particularly with regards to training skilled workers\nChris writes as a current plant manager of a manufacturing facility and for manufacturing HR director slash production manager for over Fifteen Years in both metal and plastics I Am calling BS\nManufacturing in the U. S. has completely abdicated any responsibility for training new employees since the eighties they want experienced people at relatively low wages right off the street\nIf you want lower wages to remain competitive you must develop an inhouse training program that brings lower wage entry level employees up to speed over time\nWe also heard from some of you in some pockets where employers are increasing wages here's one listener who left the voice mail in our inbox\nThis is bill I live in North Carolina and I work in the logistics in or out and supply chain industry and we've had a a pretty good expansion of our business over the last six months and we are really struggling with two items one is employed turnover where there are chasing higher wages and a new facility is a new employers and secondly\nTrying to hire the right people are as a result of that we've had to probably increase our incoming salaries the hourly salary is probably anywhere between ten and Fifteen or twenty percent\nFrom what we did last year so we're struggling with both turnover and securing the right employees so having unemployment down as low as two to two and a half percent has definitely impacting logistics and warehousing\nIt's easy to see how Bill thanks very much for sharing your story with us another one of our listeners tweeted I hold a four year degree strangely enough in journalism but transitioned into a trade job shortly following college because the pay was three times\nHold a four year degree strangely enough in journalism but transitioned into a trade jobs shortly following college because the pay was three times what a starting job in my field would be I Know makes six figures yearly and work in the rural community I grew up in\nI Will withhold my thoughts on your abandoning your journalism degree good for you glad you found something that works for you but\nThis listener has an interesting point because to stem their brain drain some cities and counties and states are offering to pay workers to move there there's a city in Nebraska that'll match signing bonuses for newcomers to the tune of five thousand dollars Vermont passed a law to pay people ten thousand dollars to move to Vermont and work remotely\nAnd accounting northeast of Detroit is offering to take a chunk out of your student debt that plan was the idea of Randy ... the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair county and he joins us now to discuss it Randy welcome to want to say\nThanks Joshua so this is called the come home award tell us what to come home award is how does that work\n[noise] yeah they come home award program that we lost in ... and early twenties sixteen is really turning traditional scholarship and smiles on their head um there are too many flaws and traditional scholarships of talk about and going up but at its core what we're doing is changing the scholarship business model\nAnd instead of investing heavily in a Seventeen or Eighteen year old who may or may not complete college or maybe not be right for college we flip it around and we said we will pay you significantly upon the completion of some kind of degree but only if you return to our region to live and work and it's really a home home reward paying off of that\nSo this is for people who are who are from saint Clair counting to come back home to St Clair county\nWe have a very strong preference for those with family ties I mean to to help protect our investments we\nBack home to St Clair county yeah we have a very strong preference for those with family ties I mean to to help protect our investments we want people to know what it's like to live in a small town America or we\nWant to keep them here and so we feel that if they have some family connection here there's probably a better bet they'll stay\nTell me about St Clair county pay me a picture of what's it like\nSo small town America or its waterfront community along the shores of Lake Huron in the St Clair river\nUm our largest town of port Huron has a population of about thirty thousand people we do not have a four year University in our region we did not have a fortune five hundred company in our region a thirty percent of our workforce leaves our county and heads down in metro Detroit to to be employed\nBut they love the small town life or the family friendly environment amenities are were small town America Josh\nI was just going to ask you about Detroit you're about an hour outside of Detroit is that right\nYeah and you were talking about something earlier Josh I Want to mention you know Detroit has become a talent magnet which is great for Detroit um but the health of America and the health of Michigan I think is better judged\nOn the economic health of regions like port Huron are Marquette or Muskegon, Michigan right it gives you a better barometer of what is our our true how\nHow did the recession do to do in St Clair county where people they're pretty hard\nYeah I Would say it hit here earlier than than hit the country and much more severely um the ironic part that we tell people and that's really one of the things that led to this come home program was once we really hit rock bottom our stakeholders whether it was the Lancet be government business\nAny other sector we realize that we all had to get together and play a piece in economic growth and prosperity we all had something to bring to the table but more importantly we we reached a point where we stopped waiting for someone from Washington or someone from Lansing to come in and\nSomething to bring to the table but more importantly we we reached a point where we stopped waiting for someone from Washington or someone from Lansing to come in and save us with a plan it had to be an organic planned that drove our prosperity\nWe're speaking to Randy Myers the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair accounting in St Clair accounting Michigan also still speaking to us T. Bo the president of applied economic research\nAnd Ryan non policy director of the Hamilton Project and a fellow in economic studies\nAt the Brookings Institution still time to get in some more of your questions and thoughts\nAbout the labor shortage won a a W AMU dot org tweet us ... when a or comments on our Facebook page where you can watch our video streams so Randy told me how the come home award work suppose I'm from saint Clair townie and I moved to Chicago\nFor work and now I'm considering coming back and how does that work\nYeah Chicago's a great example Chicago Austin's south um as long as you do not have primary residence here so let let's say your parents still live in this region maybe completed college six years ago\nAnd you're still living in Chicago but you met someone you met a party the medicine they've got other you're you're weighing the option of staying in Chicago which is a great place to live or you want to come back home settled down start a family spend more time doing what you want to do as long as you don't already live back in our region\nOr you're eligible for a Fifteen thousand dollar award if you're selected we give the recipients a hundred and twenty days to establish a permanent residency or they have to find a job that they don't already have won several already have jobs lined up\nAnd then we stretch those payments out over two or three years as a carrot to keep you here\nAnd it's really a simple back on scholarship would pay the loans holder directly which in every case for us has been the federal government\nSo I Do so\nWell back in scholarship would pay the loans holder directly which in every case for us has been the federal government\nSo I Do so you you pay it out a little bit overtime so by over time by the time to two years or up\nSinclair county voted this program to come home award will have put in Fifteen thousand dollars towards one's dead I'm guessing it's like would that be three thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars like every six months or so and it adds up to Fifteen thousand over time\nThat's exactly Joshua and the goal you know I'm is to really give young people I think it'd be in their twenties or thirties or forties I'm the chance to go two or three years without making that\nNationally I Know you see data says the average college student has thirty thousand dollars in debt I don't know where they're getting that data Josh because out of the fifty plus applications we received our average at an eighty thousand dollars\n[laughter] that that's a crippling amount of debt preventing people from living the American dream\nI can relate to that I'd finally paid off my private student loans I had to settle them it was [noise]\nOh God it was it was the most awful form of financial slavery I can possibly imagine and definitely like that's a whole other our where I Will I Will rebel you with my tearful story of dealing with Sally Mae before I I Know rusty but wants to jump in but before he does Randy I just want to\nAsk you about some of the perception issues that we discussed with regards to New Hampshire\nThere's this ... there is evidence that young people are moving to a bigger cities in in large numbers ... you've talked a lot about this feels kind of small town America New Hampshire specifically conquered for sure definitely feels like small town America", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "18"}
