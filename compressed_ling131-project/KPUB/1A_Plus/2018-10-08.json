them seriously\nAnd um they have some things in their in their quiver they can point to the Roy Moore episode end to end to the president himself and so forth so that's their view on the the

they also point to the fact\nThat this accusation the blazing Ford one was\nShes charges of sexual assault doesn't take them seriously and um they have some things in their in their quiver they can

was held until the very last moment and they're they're very angry about the the process as um I Know this was saying\nBut they also point to the fact\nThat this accusation the blazing forward one was taken seriously was listening to but then it was roped in\nBy many Democrats on the committee with two other allegations that were so absurd that they should not have even pass the\nLaugh test I'm the one by Julie sweat neck which she immediately walked back you know that that there was some sort of raped gang going on in a in in but says the Maryland in the Nineteen eighties and to\nThe students and that she is a college student was attending a lot of high school parties and saw Kavanaugh spiking the drinks have girls with ... and then attacking them well of course she she walked all of that back but\nUh and of course the Ramirez story too was quite thin so thin that the New York times looked into it and we refuse to publish it [noise] so um [noise]\nSo so the the problem was that when Michael ... sort of collard sweat Nick and dragged her forward and included her absurd allegations in with Boise for it's more um believable accusation it had the paradoxical effect of of um\nMaking sleazy Ford's case all the um weaker because it was seen to be part of this political hit\nAnd um and I think of an Audi a may have a lot to answer for from his a democratic colleagues well the

a lot to answer for from his Democratic colleagues\nWill the president did also make some political hay with Christine Blasey Ford's case or her story as well let me here's part of what you said at a rally on Wednesday in Mississippi in an act of what he said was to help defend Brett Kavanaugh and his unfair treatment here's a bit of the president\nKind of characterizing washing cars are generous word what professor Ford said two Senate\nHow did he get home I don't remember how you get there I don't remember where is the point I don't remember how many I don't want I don't\nKnow [noise] what\nWas it and I don't know [noise] I wouldn't want I don't know what I that's the only thing [noise]\n\nI don't live chat or a man who lives just shattered\nPart of what the president said at his rally last Wednesday in Mississippi it's worth noting that the president is incorrect in his assertion that all the professor for to remember was having one beer indeed she said that seared into her hippocampus clearly a psychology professor\nWas the fact that she was laughed at during the assault\nYes she also remembered that it was upstairs I mean she remembered many things the president did not cover himself with glory in that moment where he was mocking current diminishing her\nVisiting Saturn a man's life is shattered\nPart of what the president said his rally last Wednesday in Mississippi it's worth noting that the president is incorrect in his assertion that all the professor Ford remembered was having one beer indeed she said that seared into her hippocampus clearly a psychology professor\nWas the fact that she was laughed at during the assault\nYes she also remember that it was upstairs I mean she remembered many things that President did not cover himself the glory in that moment where he was mocking current diminishing her of course a that was that was disgusting on the other hand\nUm there has been a tremendous amount of behavior on the left during this process that was also I'm really ... um stopping people in restaurants and and driving a people\nAre from the public square um uh you know accusing someone of um absurd\nCharges and not taking into account his whole life you know if judge Kavanaugh where the monster that ah that some of the Democrats had been portraying you would think that somebody would have picked up on it at some point in his adult life\nWell and that's kind of what I'm Wondering in a way I hear you on that Mona El Yon also kind of noticed that\nOne aspect of the debate around Brett Kavanaugh that seemed to not get a whole lot of mentioned in the final analysis didn't get a lot of mentioned from Susan Collins of Maine when she gave that like fifty minutes exploitation on the floor of the Senate which was actually rather fascinating I toward hearing if you haven't heard it\nIs just how Brett Kavanaugh handled the accusation I mean if someone accused me of something that awful but I Know I did not do I think I Would hope that I'd be able to say listen this is an awful thing that happened it sounds like a tragedy I Wish I could give you the closure you're looking for but I'm not the person who did it like\nAnd all that seemed to not get a whole lot of mentioned in the final analysis didn't get a lot of the nation from Susan Collins of Maine when she gave that what fifty minutes explanation on the floor of the Senate which was actually rather fast moving toward hearing if you've ever heard it\nIs just how Brett Kavanaugh handled the accusation I mean if someone accused me of something awful but I knew I did not do\nI think I Would hope that I'd be able to say listen this is an awful thing that happened it sounds like a tragedy I Wish I could give you the closure you're looking for but I'm not the person who did it like something about temperament in this whole discussion kind of fell by the wayside\nYeah I Do think that once the additional allegations came out in ... in his testimony had to answer not just for a lousy Ford's allegation but also for the other two allegations and and he was upset\nAngry in tears enraged are outraged on Democrats sort of their their arguments\nBecame one not about necessarily guilt or innocence but one about\nTemperament and did he have the appropriate temperament sit on the bench and it\nAh their argument necessarily uh it it became one not about do we believe her but then he doesn't have a judicial temperament and Republicans answered in turn that a Democrat said he was to ... and the Fox interview and to detach and then when he got angry they thought that wasn't good enough\nFairly uh it it became one not about do we believe her but that he doesn't have a judicial temperament and Republicans answered in turn that a Democrat that said

quite a lot of few including gene\nGene emailed urging contacted us in road we're more concerned with the men who were falsely accused two to five percent of the time\nThan the women who are raped Ninety five Ninety eight percent of the time\nWhen one in four women in America deal with rape and tens of thousands of rape kits remain untested there are bigger issues than your panel was talking about or justice system is broken the women on your panel or making my blood boils ... are we losing sight of something larger here [noise]\nAh well the um the problem of rape has always been with us as long as there's been human civilization\nAnd I'm the only one I I hate to interrupt you but I just want to clarify something from the comment\nThe comics who wrote that one and for women in America deal with rape Senator Dianne Feinstein and the shearing said that according to federal statistics it's one in three and one in three women will deal with sexual violence so a lot\nNot race that's that's way overstated sexual violence of sexual so and that's a very very broad description drunk lose even just being funneled over your clothes against their will ... should be careful with the number yeah go ahead go okay so yeah the number is is is a is not not right but look at the problem of of male\nSexual aggression or has been a problem throughout human civilization\nAll civilized society seek to cope with it uh\nSenator Dianne Feinstein and the shearing said that according to federal statistics it's one in ...\nThe one in three women will deal with sexual violence so uh yeah well not rape that that's way overstated sexual violence of sexual so and that's a very very broad description drunk lose even just being funneled over your clothes against their will ... should be careful with a number yeah go ahead and go okay so yeah the number is\nIs is a is not not right but look at the problem of of male sexual aggression or has been a problem throughout human civilization all civilized society seek to cope with it\nUh and it's also one of the most difficult crimes to prosecute because in most cases there are only two people it happens in privacy there are no witnesses um it's very hard to show proof if there was no actual if there were no wounds on the woman's body et cetera et cetera\nSo it is you know when people say well we're not being believed it's because the it's it's very hard to prove and also we have to recognize that the consequences\nOf finding a guilt at finding someone guilty of rape mean\nYears and years and years in prison and so of course we do need to be careful about how we evaluate rape accusations it's it's it's an awful thing it's it but I don't see any way around you know keeping in mind our standards of justice and fair play and see any way around\nThe difficulties inherent in these kinds of accusations\nFeel like this is one of those moments early on as there were a lot of women including several who commented on this program not that I think that the show was a perfectly representative sample of the country but a preponderance of the woman who commented on this program have essentially said I don't want to hear it\nWe've been waiting for all of human history for our society to deal with the fact that men can treat women like pieces of meat and get away with it with impunity that day is over yesterday so fix this or we will shut you down until you\nThe difficulties inherent in these kinds of accusations\nOf feel like well this is one of those moments early on and there were a lot of women including several who commented on this program not that I think that the show is a perfectly representative sample of the country but a preponderance of the woman who commented on this program have essentially said I don't want to hear it\nWe've been waiting for all of human history for our society to deal with the fact that men can treat women like pieces of meat and get away with it with impunity that day is over yesterday so fix this or we will shut you down until you do\nI hear your Mona but it's that emotional visceral part of politics so we are not I I don't think that the political will is there especially among women who have been assaulted to say okay I'll take a breath and wait another term for this to get better\nWell I think there are two challenges the first is that we have a justice system based on a presumption of innocence and the cabin are confirmation presented another challenge which is that he was not being tried in a court of law and the question raised and it was should he a\nBenefit from the presumption of innocence and we had a lot of senators saying no he should uh have the presumption of guilt and he should have to clear his name and that seems not to go over a well there was a political backlash on the right to that\nAnd so I think that there certainly is energy on the left but it is met with equal force from energy on the right with people who feel that that's\nGreatly unfair but the cabinet confirmation and saying that uh men should face a presumption of guilt when an accusation is leveled\nWas sort of met with an equal and opposite energy from the right and emailers and callers can say that that makes their blood boil but covering this as a reporter that is simply a sort of what\nThere was a political backlash on the right to that\nAnd so I

A. M. U. dot org\nKatie you're on the ground in Michigan working on redistricting reform I Want to hear what you're up to in just a moment but first I Want to get a little more explanation of this larger issue and ... and let me start with you\nIf you would just explain what we mean when we talk about redistricting and and what point redistricting becomes gerrymandering right so this is a process that the United states goes through every ten years after the descending you'll senses\nThe census really starts the whole process of the U.S Census Bureau eventually gives the states the official number of\nUh their population and then the number of seats in the U.S house of representatives they'll get\nThere's a really complicated math formula called the Huntington he'll method which I still haven't quite figured out even though I've been staring at it for a couple of years but that that's how so every state all fifty states get one member of the house of representatives at least you know there are four hundred and thirty five\nSo that eliminate those those first fifty seats that everybody gets and then the fifty first seat is awarded to the largest state using the Huntington hill method so California gets the fifty first date\nAnd if I'm not mistaken I think they get the fifty seconds a seat as well but then that does the seats are allocated by population all the way down to the four hundred and thirty fifth\nAnd that's how we figure out that ah say you know Washington state has ten districts this time or California has fifty three and whether or not they're going to gain or lose a seat on the margins depending on\nHouse of representatives at least you know there are four hundred and thirty five\nSo that eliminate those those first fifty seats that everybody gets and then the fifty first seat is awarded to the largest state using the Huntington he'll method so California gets the fifty first date\nAnd if I'm not mistaken I think they get the fifty seconds a seat as well uh but then that does the seats are allocated by population all the way down to the four hundred and thirty fifth\nAnd that's how we figure out that um say you know Washington state has ten districts this time or California has fifty three and whether or not they're going to gain or lose a seat on the margins depending on uh the population shift and the relative populations of each state\nSo this happens every ten years and then every ... the U.S constitution gives the state legislatures the power to a draw those district lines now that clause has been interpreted in different ways uh some legislatures have challenged\nUh the the various independent commissions around the country so that they can maintain that power ... other states other legislators have more willingly given up that power to an independent commission but basically every state does it in its own way in some with with some you know various quirks here and there\nAre and uh the legislatures will then draw those maps and the district lines are meant to go in place by the twenty twenty two congressional elections so the U.S census happens in twenty twenty or the the official numbers are given to the states about a year later and then the states have about a year to draw district lines everybody knows\nPretty much where the districts are going to be right there in minor tweaks that happened here and there\nAnd when we get to gerrymander young that's when a that that sort of the pejorative term for when a party draws district lines that are meant to favor their candidate a in crazy ways in ways that where the communities are divided or to diminish one side's political power or bolster another sides political power\nUm and and you know throughout the years or every state has gone through it\nLater and then the states have about a year to draw district lines everybody knows pretty much where the districts are going to be right there in minor tweaks that happened here and there and when we get to gerrymander young that's when a that that sort of the pejorative term for when a party draws district lines that are meant to favor their candidate\nA in a crazy ways in ways that where the the communities are divided or to diminish one side's political power or bolster another sides political power um and and you know throughout the years or every state has gone through its own\nHiccups with political gerrymandering a it's become a dirty word now and it's something that we're gonna see thrown around a lot of in this next redistricting\nYeah North Carolina is one of those states has got quite a few stories to tell about redistricting and gerrymandering and David your in Charlotte following the national democratic redistricting committee which Eric Holder is leaving we had him on this program to talk about it a while back give us a sense David of what's at stake\nPolitically with redrawing these district lines particularly with North Carolina being this kind of interesting example of redistricting and and the efforts to reform it\nI think there's an awful lot at stake um if you think about it this way if you look at the five competitive swing states of Pennsylvania North Carolina Michigan Ohio Wisconsin you might imagine that those five competitive swing states Sunday similar number of members of Congress both parties\nTo Washington except the reality is dramatically different those five states than forty eight Republicans and Twenty one Democrat's who Washington\nA Democrats have only been successful and flipping one seat red to blue in any of those competitive states in this entire decade and that's the Conor Lamb state and the special election in two thousand Seventeen so when the two thousand twelve two thousand fourteen and two thousand sixteen elections there was no\nIt's a Sunday similar number of members of Congress of both parties\nTo Washington except the reality is dramatically different those five states than forty eight Republicans and Twenty one Democrats to Washington a Democrats have only been successful in flipping one seat\nRed to blue in any of those competitive states in this entire decade and that's the Conor Lamb seat in the special election in two thousand Seventeen so when the two thousand twelve two thousand fourteen and two thousand sixteen elections there was no swing in any district in any of these competitive swing states\nYou also see this as as well at the state legislative level so you have all of these states that are closely divided like say North Carolina I'm you know states in which that Democrats may often when\nMore votes state wide for it chamber and yet here for example Republicans have a super majority\nIn in both the state assembly and also in the state Senate so they're able to completely override\nThe actions of a democratic governor here at mix politics more extreme it insulate members\nFrom voters it allows them to do things like the transgender bathroom build it wildly unpopular and yet the politicians um you know feel completely empowered to go ahead and\nEnact that kind of legislation um and it also discourages competition in a lot of the seats in North Carolina in two thousand sixteen forty nine percent of all statewide seats went without a major party\nCompetitor so voters had no choice and almost half of their districts here because folks\nTook a look at those races and said I Can't win\nPopular and yet the that the politicians um you know feel completely empowered to go ahead and\nEnact that kind of legislation um and it also discourages competition in a lot of the seats in North Carolina in two thousand sixteen forty nine percent of all statewide seats went without a major party\nCompetitor so voters had no choice animal half of their districts here because folks\nTook a look at those races and said I Can't win or raise enough money to actually make it worth the investment of time\nTo get to some of your comments as well clearly gerrymandering is is as some of your fans of the show no one of our audience is hottest hottest topics including with Michael who wrote on our Facebook page any party that requires gerrymandering to stay in power doesn't deserve power there shouldn't be partisan\nMichael writes Ohio is heavily gerrymandered however in an election earlier this year voters heavily approved with support from both parties and the issue on the ballots are fairly redrawn districts after twenty twenty\nAnd Laura writes Pennsylvania was gerrymandered they rewrote the map but I Do not believe they were making an

election to stem their losses\nIs that fair I don't think that the Republicans have cornered the market on gerrymandering neither party wants to be disadvantaged but what what what do we know\nThe Virginia example he's talking about the house of delegates and how they were Democrats came within one seat of winning back the house of delegates back in twenty Seventeen\nThe way of Virginia elections work the delegates are elected in a odd numbered years so it has and that doesn't actually have anything to do with the twenty teen election uh there are some there have been some federal challenges to the congressional district lines in Virginia\nA but but that there's a difference between the state legislative districts which is sort of part of a larger story of how Republicans locked in a lot of their gains in the U.S house of representatives\nUh but that's those are two different things you're you're exactly right there the the no party is blameless in this uh gerrymandering started we get the word\nFrom a guy named Eldridge Gary who was the governor of Massachusetts uh back in Eighteen twelve he drew a district line that effectively packed all of the federal at members of the federalist party into one district and that allowed his party the Democratic Republicans imagine if those do exist today\nA isn't to win all the districts around it uh the a newspaper down in in Boston took a look at the map they said it looked like a salamander was Jerry's salamander he was a gerrymander ... that's how we actually get the word and so yeah this has been happening\nDuring started we get the word from a guy named Eldridge Gary who was the governor of Massachusetts uh back in Eighteen twelve he drew a district line that effectively packed all of the federal at members of the federalist party into one district and that allowed his party the Democratic Republicans imagine if those still existed today\nA isn't to win all the districts around it\nUh the a newspaper down in in Boston took a look at the map they said it looked like a salamander was Jerry's salamander was a gerrymander ... that's how we actually get the word and so yeah this has been happening since like the beginning of the republic\nHum you could argue that some of this happened back in in a female and democracy back in you know\nFive hundred BC uh but when we talked about today yeah both parties do this look Democrats controlled the house of representatives from Nineteen fifty four to Nineteen Ninety four and they did it in a large part by a drawing favorable districts in the south\nThat were meant to lock in their members and in in large degree to discriminate against African American voters\nAre and now even today we see some challenges to district lines drawn by Democrats especially in the state of Maryland\nUh there's one district or out in western Maryland they used to be held by Republican until Democrats redrew the lines and now it's a safe democratic seats so yes both parties do this Republicans have done it a more publicly lately and so therefore they are getting the heat but yeah when we started hearing about\nA fair district lines that generally comes from the people who think that the winds aren't fair and therefore are probably the ones who are losing elections that's not to diminish the fact that that these lines may not be fair right but the people who who cry fairness tend to be the ones who are not ... not holding the pencils if you will\nDo get comments from folks on both sides of the aisle complaining about how both

was a majority appointed by Republican governors and approved by the Republican legislators\nNothing will change as long as the gerrymandered legislative branch is controlled by one party\nSeveral bills have been put forward with lip service for leadership than killed by Republican chairman who do not believe that Indiana is gerrymandered and say so publicly\nKatie faith he I Wonder if this
