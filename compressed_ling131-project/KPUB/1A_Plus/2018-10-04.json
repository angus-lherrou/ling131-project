good to talk to you and power ... is director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center he's also with us here in Studio Paolo thanks to you for being here pleasure to be a well Brian you're the one in Sao paolo so let me give you honor is here to start\nA let's start with the nitty gritty who is ... and our most Americans might not be familiar with him and it's a ...\nA retired army captain who has been in Congress for nearly three decades\nNow I'm ... despite having sat in Congress ... first so much time he\nHe shows open loading for ah for the legislative body I mean he said over the years numerous times that the Congress is dysfunctional and it should be closed um he's also advocated torture of his political or of leftists and\nAnd other political opponents\nAnd it's a ... a retired army captain who has been in Congress for nearly three decades\nNow um but despite having sat in Congress first so much time and\nHe he shows open loading for\nAh for the legislative body I mean he has said over the years numerous times that the Congress has the dysfunctional and it should be closed um he's also advocated torture of his political or of leftists and\nAnd other political opponents 'em and you know that message for a long time was was regarded as marginalized here I mean he was not a popular figure but\nIn the last couple of years because of this historic economic crisis that you mentioned Todd those messages um are resonating a lot more with\nPeople when they did in the past and now here we are with this presidential election coming up on Sunday and he has a ten point lead an old over his nearest rival it looks like there will be a runoff vote which would be on October twenty eighth\nAnd that one is that one's a close call right now between him and and the guy who's likely to face leftist Fernando had died\nBut it's it's just so strange for me to be here because I Lived in Brazil for five years and if it was not that long ago I was here from twenty ten to twenty Fifteen and this seemed like\nJust such a strong democracy it seemed like a place that had come so far since the period of last military rule from Nineteen sixty four in Nineteen eighty five\nBut being here this week and talking to people I mean I there's a lot of people who are ready to vote for both in our all even if it does mean a return to you know the more authoritarian ways of the past year\nSome people [laughter] both world uh Brian we're going to work on your sky blind a little bit uh we'll we'll get that cleaned up and will definitely come back to a Monica what about\nSend the twenty fifth here and this seemed like just such a strong democracy it seemed like a place that had come so far since the period of West\nMilitary rule from Nineteen sixty four in Nineteen eighty five but being here this week and talking to people I mean I there's a lot of people who are ready to vote for both in our even if it does mean a return to you know the more authoritarian ways of the past year\nSome people [laughter] both wrote a brine we're going to work on your sky blind a little bit of will will get that cleaned up and will definitely come back to a Monica what about Fernando had died in in contrast he's not as\nFiery as ... of course ... has been described by some as Trump being or maybe more akin to ... in the Philippines likes to waive guns around say that drug dealers should be shot or threatens to summer summarily execute them what about his opponent for for of Fernando ... what do we know about him\nSo what we know about him um is that he's not a an organic member of the Workers Party the P. T. um he's someone who sort of an outsider when you look at the composition of the ... the far left so\nHe's not he's a moderate um but the leadership of the Workers Party of the PTA currently is very radicalized so it's very different\nFrom the time when former president Lula was in government for example from twenty three I'm twenty ten when the party really did take this sort of center left stance so the party itself now is very much hard left um the candidate though is that\nUm that being said the the real big problem in Brazil at the moment is that there is a lot a lot of anti P. T. anti worker party sentiment so a lot of the vote that has been migrating too far right extremists\nThe time when former president Lula was in government for example from twenty three I'm twenty ten when the party really did take this sort of center left stamped so the party at south now is very much hard left um the candidate though isn't\nThat being said that the real big problem in Brazil at the moment is that\nThere is a lot a lot of anti P. T. anti worker party sentiment so a lot of the vote that has been migrating too far right extremist both so narrow\nUm is this anti PT vote so these elections are very strange because they had become elections about not who necessarily voters actually went to see as president but about who voters do not see as friends and\nWe're going to talk about corruption we're going to talk about graft we are going to talk about a failing economy because all of those things play and I think to\nThe idea that voters know who they don't want they don't want the people who were taking billions of dollars in bribes which has been a major problem we're gonna talk all about that Apollo let me turn to you what about turnout in this election Brazil has compulsory voting I don't know if that means that they get to a hundred percent but people do\nCome out to the polls of what's the mood like among Brazilians are they excited to to sweep out the corrupt dirty politicians and get both in our in there or are they beaten down in in weary\nI think there are more weary than a decisive in terms of going there and changing things or the electorate is very divided normally the eighty percent of the voters show up\nOr we may have less of a proportion this time a one important feature here is how many voters will spoil their their vote will leave it blank\nTo sweep out the corrupt dirty politicians and get both in our in there or are they beaten down in in weary\nI think there are more weary than a decisive in terms of going there and changing things or the electorate is very divided normally the eighty percent of the vote or show up\nOr we may have less of a proportion this time or one important feature here is how many voters will spoil their their vote will leave it blank were cancelled oval because that is important\nWhoever gets a fifty percent of the salad votes is elected president there is an outside chance that that could happen this Sunday\nOr we both saw not a winning more like the according to the late ... is that we go to a runoff\nBut the mood ... and with people are frustrated people feel betrayed by the political class in Brazil or regardless if they are to laugh from the left from the writer from the center people feel absolutely fed up with politics with politicians\nAnd that there is no alternative because there is not going to be admitted there equal in Brazil and we're going to find our way through politics\nNow Brian I think we have your sky blind nice and clean now I'm both an R. O. has a history of violent rhetoric he's been photographed waving machine guns around as I mentioned he he likes to fantasize about his opponents or or drug dealers are thieves\nPolitics now Brian I

... people are so fed up after the carwash scandal\nThey will go for anything that isn't part of the Workers Party\nNow Monica before the break you were telling us about car wash the actual car wash in the broad offensive corruption scandal or is it over ... have have all of the [noise] I don't want to mix metaphors but have all the will have all the cars been overturned it opened up and cleaned out in a car wash\nWell it is winding down um so the bulk of it has already has already occurred well let me go back in time just a little bit because it is important to put into context to things\nThe most important um findings have love I had to or of car wash worrying twenty Fifteen and twenty sixteen\nAnd at that time I'm president Dilma Rousseff of the Workers Party was Brazil's leader she had been reelected in twenty fourteen into was president at the time\nUm she was impeached in twenty six team\nAnd part of the reason for her impeachment there are many moving parts here but one of the moving parts was the fact that a she had lost control of hook of her coalition and her her coalition had\nUm a number of other political parties that war implicated in the car wash\nFindings in the car wash probing the plea bargains I'm an ...\nWas Brazil's leader she had been reelected in twenty fourteen and two was president at the time [noise]\nUm she was impeached in twenty sixteen and part of the reason for her impeachment there are many moving parts here but one of the moving parts was the fact that a she had lost control of her of her coalition\nAnd her her coalition had um a number of other political parties that war implicated in the car wash\nFindings in the car wash probing the plea bargains 'em and everything else that started to come out publicly in terms of this particular investigation\nShe was ... she ... she never did anything to actually stop the investigation which was really a positive thing um but that was one of the things that actually lead to her downfall because\nThe the impeachment that she suffered\nWas really very much politically motivated by the need that some of these political parties in her coalition had to try to at least slow love our jobs if not stop it all together and this is a very important element when we look at the degree of polarization that currently exists in Brazil\nBecause the people who still defend the workers' party and still defend the P. T. they go back to the impeachment of Rousseff as one major argument for why you know things that the Workers Party has been let's say unfairly treated and the way that the that that things have gone down\nMet writes to us or on email I had a Brazilian friend years back who called his home country the greatest country that never was meaning that Brazil\nHas had such riches in terms of natural resources but it is not had the government or the leadership to make it a competitor with the United states uh Paolo ... makes a good point Brazil\nHe sat as one major argument for why you know things that the Workers Party has been let's say unfairly treated in the way that the ... that things have gone down\n[noise] Matt writes to us or on email I had a Brazilian friend years back who called his home country the greatest country that never was meaning that Brazil\nHas had such riches in terms of natural resources but it is not had the government or the leadership to make it a competitor with the United states up Paolo Matt makes a good point Brazil was celebrated\nAs the rising star not only of Latin America of emerging economies around the world compared to India and China we mentioned it at the top are now horrible recession horrible corruption what happened in Brazil where was the Brazil that debt hosted the Olympics in was and was on the way up\nWell I think Brazil believe too much in its magic that it's a country predestined can be great and forgot to do the necessary things you do in order to build that country or one of the major betrayal is precisely the workers bar to bar too that was led\nBy a man born in poverty or that or a bill this very successful party on initially ethics in politics there\nIs this sense after Brazil\nA ... a basic ... riding a wonderful wave in international economics big producer of commodities had a wonderful moment Barbara too was reduced and that is what led to this impression that Brazil was unstoppable well\nA than reality hit\nA ruler made a very bad choice in his successor a and a a lot of a shot too\nTicks there is this sense after Brazil\nA ... a basic ... riding a wonderful wave in international economics meat producer of commodities had a wonderful moment Barbara too was reduced and that is what led to this impression that Brazil was unstoppable well\nA than reality hit\nA ruler made a very bad choice and his successor\nA and a a lot of a shot to came and the magic would disappear\nOr what we have today is a consequence and this is what I think what that should be positive and all of this we cannot blame others for our problems this crisis was produced in Brazil by Brazilians are and another thing that is potentially positive\nIs the fact that the states in Brazil was basically broke\nAnd we have run off the money ah all that dream now has to be has ended and the nightmare has to be confronted from a ... reality ... basis where the government has run all the money we have to adjust the economy\nThe measures necessary to do that are very off an\nUnpopular and none of the candidates have explain exactly why how they plan to come from the ...\nBryan winter you're with us from Brazil or I read an article Bryan that you recently wrote\nWhere you were asked by a friend I think to sum up Brazil in two sentences and I'm going to paraphrase a little bit your answer ultimately your conclusion was too many BS privileges for the elite not enough good leaders what exactly did you mean by that terse conclusion\nWell if you look around right now the field of candidates there's there's\nAnd none of the candidates have explain exactly why how they plan to go from the\n... now Bryan winter you're with us from Brazil or I read an article Brian ... you recently wrote\nWhere you were asked by a friend I think to sum up Brazil in two sentences and I'm going to paraphrase a little bit your answer ultimately your conclusion was too many BS privileges for the elite not enough good leaders what exactly did you mean by that terse conclusion\nWell if you look around right now at the field of candidates there's there's one thing that all Brazilians agree on which is that they find the candidates running for president to be on inspiring um the vast majority of people here as we've said during the program I feel like they're voting against\nSomebody rather than voting for somebody and the consequences of that\nIs is just I mean it's it's stunning for somebody who lived here during that era when things were going really well which you've mentioned taught the degree of cynicism the degree of disbelief that people have in their system of government is just amazing and you know it's part of a global trend I mean we've seen\nThis happen in places like turkey in Hungary and elsewhere around the world\nBut this democratic recession as some people have called it really is especially strong here and that makes sense because Brazil is taking a bigger beating um in terms of its economy and in terms of the reputation of its politicians because of this\nCorruption scandal than virtually any other western democracy in recent years there was a poll by the\nPew Research center and twenty Seventeen that found that just eight percent of Brazilians say representative democracy is a very good form of government that was the lowest of thirty eight countries that that that you surveyed\nAnd it just shows you the climate here\nStrong here and that makes sense because Brazil is taking a bigger beating um in terms of its economy and in terms of the reputation of its\nPoliticians because of this corruption scandal\nThan virtually any other western democracy in recent years there was a poll by the Pew\nResearch Center and twenty Seventeen that found that just eight percent of Brazilians say representative democracy is a very good form of government that was the lowest I'm thirty eight countries that ... that you surveyed\n... and that just shows you the climate here right now and the reason why many people fear that both denaro if elected would basically have carte blanche to take a you know hard right turn that could involve the curtail moment of civil civil liberties and and and other things\nI I in my time I'm this week um I've had meetings with people from civil society and the press and others who you know these are serious people not prone to panic or anything like that who are talking openly about the possibility of exile and that's just blew me away I mean it's a Brazil that I've read about in history books you know going back

Kavanaugh hearings he angrily defended cabin on he said the other day in the hearings I think everybody saw it I'm a single white male people want me to shut up and I won't shut up and he was red faced and he was furious on behalf of\nBrett Kavanaugh and presumably white men everywhere but contrast that with the Lindsey Graham of twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen and even twenty twelve\nHears Lindsey Graham at a roast dinner in twenty Seventeen poking fun at Paul Ryan speaker of the house but making a point\nYou're forty six years\nYou've been the vice presidential nominee of the Republican Party here the speaker of the house the Republican controlled house you're smart you know the budget that we're in for you have a good temperament and disposition and the judgment of Solomon you are dead men walking as far as [noise]\nNow back in twenty twelve Lindsey Graham the same Lindsey Graham used to warn about the future of the Republican Party he would quipped to me at any reporter who would listen we can't make angry white guys fast enough to survive as a Republican Party in the future meeting Republicans had to broaden their appeal to women to minorities to Hispanics\nFlash forward to the Lindsey Graham of this week I'm a white male and I'm not gonna take it anymore stunning what does this transformation Lindsey Graham hulk vacation in the Trump here it said to you about where we were in in in where we are yeah I mean it it tells me that\nThe divide is deepening and you know it did tells me that the the lines that were kind of drawn to you that you saw in the two thousand election they say that we've lived with since\nThey're only going deeper in the moment you talked about there in twenty twelve after twenty twelve election there was as you remember the certainly the the Republican sort of um establishment nationally looked at the Mitt Romney's last a Brock Obama\nIt any more stunning what does this transformation Lindsey Graham hulk vacation\nIn the Trump beer it said EU about where we were in in in where we are yeah I mean I think it tells me that the divide is deepening and you know did tells me that the the lines that were kind of drawn to that you saw in the two thousand election and I say that we've lived with a sense\nThey're only going deeper in the moment you talked about there in twenty twelve after the twenty twelve election\nThere was as you remember the certainly the the Republican sort of um establishment nationally look to the Mitt Romney's last a brac Obama included what you know what Lindsey Graham did it demographically the way the country had been divided up for the last Fifteen or Twenty years was not going to work for them long term\nThey came up with that autopsy report they were going to change on immigration all this stuff\nDonald Trump comes along and violates every tenet of this of this autopsy and wins\nAnd I think it it's not just that he won the general election unless a huge part of it but the fact that he was able\nTo sweep through the Republican Party is like the primaries like he didn't twenty sixteen\nTold Republicans like Lindsey Graham and of course easy to forget but Lindsey Graham did run for president in twenty sixteen one of the sixteen or Seventeen Republicans who did and failed miserably and I think that's it I think that lesson there of going head to head against Trump of dismissing him completely at the beginning of that race Graham called him a kooky called him a bunch of things\nUm in twenty sixteen and then watching how\nWithin the Republican world how Trump resonated with voters\nIt told them boy there's something about our own voters our own party our own tribe that we didn't quite understand maybe we didn't want to understand granted more than ... more than just name calling in a primary he told Republicans we are finished if we nominate Donald Trump that he is the death knell of this party\nSo what is Lindsey Graham thinking now is he thinking I have to win a Republican primary in twenty twenty in South Carolina where Donald Trump is popular so I'd better get on the Trump train and that's all there is to it the last\nWithin the Republican world how Trump resonated with voters it told them boy there's something about our own voters our own party our own tribe\nThat we didn't quite understand maybe we didn't want to understand granted more than ... more than just name calling in a primary he told Republicans we are finished if we nominate Donald Trump that he is the death knell of this party\nSo what is Lindsey Graham thinking now is he thinking I have to win a Republican primary in twenty twenty in South Carolina where Donald Trump is popular so I'd better get on the Trump train and that's all there is to it the last\nThe last gasp of the Republican Party and I'm going to be a senator for one more term or is he is he converted what's he think yeah I mean look there's then there's all sorts of theories about this and I don't know but I'll give you a couple of them that that that that jump out at me one is what you're saying yeah he's got to worry about a Republican primary every Republican one of the lessons\nOf Donald Trump's rise in his in during popularity with Republican voters one of the lessons\nTo Republican officeholders as you are taking a major major risk\nIf you are seen as separating yourself from this president your neck primary especially if you're a Lindsey Graham and you already have a history of sort of being\nA being antagonistic towards the right here and they're so grim has to worry about that there's also the theory that hey part of this is Lindsey Graham trying to play the influence game if you're if you're you know friendly to Trump in public if you sing his praises uh if you change your tone on Trump the way he as if you're a golf with him\nMaybe if you're Lindsey Graham and you have some issues particularly on foreign policy and national security this is a way to influence them but I think one of the other lessons is to is it is again\nLindsey Graham looking at Trump than twenty sixteen and saying this is absolute political suicide for the Republican Party to go down this road\nAnd then seeing down from when the election I Know it was narrow but seeing the one I think tells Lindsey Graham and just ... more broadly tells Republicans that this tribalism is so much deeper than we realized it was and it changes what you're able to do and what you can do politically Kennett last is the quest\nHe as if you're a golf with him maybe\nIf you're Lindsey Graham and you have some issues particularly on foreign policy and national security this is a way to influence them but I think one of the other lessons is to is it is again Lindsey Graham looking at Trump than twenty sixteen and saying this is absolute political suicide for the Republican Party to go down this road\nAnd then seeing down from when the election I Know it was narrow but seeing the one I think ... Lindsey Graham and just ... more broadly tells Republicans that this tribalism is so much deeper than we realized it was and it changes what you're able to do and what you can do politically\nKennett last is the question given the demographics of this country Lindsey Graham I'll remind you one last time said himself over and over we can't make angry white guys fast enough we can't manufacture them fast enough\nTo be a party the future I Wonder if\nWhen he closed his eyes at night whether he's\nChanged his mind about that or not James sent us an email I frequently have yard signs for political candidates in my front yard\nAnd because there are good candidates on both sides of the aisle I usually have candidates from both major parties and I am surprised at how often several of my neighbors express their genuine irritation with me that I can endorse candidates from both parties very tribal instead of an evaluation on the merits and and Steve you're nodding because that does not sound surprising to you\nYeah well what he's describing his ticket splitting the main political science they voters who go and they a Democrat for president Republican for Congress they split up the ballot\nJust election two election that the number of people out there who do that who split their ticket\nHas been shrinking shrinking and you're looking at single digits right now and in that that is just the rise of polarization his rival is All right let's get back in our way way back machine are red and blue way way back machine go back in history with you Steve ... so much of what your book is about\nUh we talked about the speaker of the house Newt Gingrich who are I'm led to believe did not talk to you for this book although although he certainly could have\nRepublican for Congress they split up the ballot just election two election that the number of people out there who do that who split their ticket has been shrinking shrinking and you're looking at single digits right now and then that that is just the rise of polarization the tribal isn't All right let's get\nBack in our way way back machine are red and blue way way back machine go back in history with you Steve corner you so much of what your book is about uh we talked about the speaker of the house Newt Gingrich who are I'm led to believe did not talk to you for this book although although he certainly could have a when he was a young rabble rousing congressmen\nA crazy night with some fast and furious strong storm system some lingering showers crossbar in northern Arizona throughout the morning hours otherwise gradually decreasing clouds and it cool afternoon in stores similar on friday another storm system do Saturday Night Sunday\nTwo days ... days sponsor is the eleventh manual Prescott area artist studio tour\nTomorrow through Sunday tender for self Guided Tour of resenting eighty jury artists in fifty one private studios with additional artist set three arts centers maps and details at Prescott studio tour dot com [noise]\nI'm Jeremy ... adult film actress Stormy Daniels told CNN about her first meeting with Donald Trump before he was president\nThat's talking about yourself and I only learned and I was like somebody should take that magazine in Spain\nAnd I'll never forget the look on his face [laughter] I don't think I might have spoken to him like that now she's got a new book out\nTomorrow through Sunday tens of for self Guided Tour of resenting eighty jury artists in fifty one private studios with additional artist said three arts centers maps and details at Prescott studio tour dot com [noise]\nI'm Jeremy ... adult film actress Stormy Daniels told CNN about her first meeting with Donald Trump before he was president\nOf talking about yourself and I only work and I was like somebody should take that magazine in spanking\nAnd I'll never forget the look on his face [laughter] I don't think he might have stuck into something like that now she's got a new book out and talk to us at ... here in\nHere we are now begins in about twenty minutes on Arizona Public radio can you know you your source for NPR News and talk one eight continues its ten forty\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Rhodes Scholar and not for profit offerings learning adventurous for adults and natural settings across the country learn more at R.

define their ideologies for the American people it's not just Washington it's polarized we've been asking listeners\nFor memorable moments from politics in the nineties and and here's one\nAnd the president is right\nIn many ways we are a shining city on it\nBut the hard truth is but not everyone is sharing in this city's splendor and glory\nThere is this fair Mr President\nAnd the faces that you don't see\nIn the places that you don't visit\nAnd you're a shining city\nAnd believe you're hearing from Mario Cuomo their former governor of New York maybe at the peak of his political career the shining city on the hill well here's what I was going for another moment or the moment that listeners sent us from ... the early nineties I take you back towards any overhaul\nAnd the places that you don't visit\nAnd your shining city\nAnd I believe you're hearing from Mario Cuomo their former governor of New York maybe at the peak of his political career the shining city on the hill well here's what I was going for another moment or the moment that listeners sent us from ... to the early nineties I take you back towards any whole [noise]\nSoon to be president President Bill Clinton June Nineteen Ninety to ... or send you a whole show remember him will will with us any overhaul before that year presidential\nCandidates didn't really appear on nighttime talk shows at all so that was something new talk about how politicians grappled with media coverage during those years a Steve that was a moment not just because the president appeared on Arsenio Hall but he seemed to offer an alternative\nTo gosh even Pat Buchanan speech there is a religious war in this country very stark\nVery serious and in a lot of Americans agreed with him here was Bill Clinton in sunglasses just having a whole lot of fun the guy you want at the party\nWas also the moment that was June Nineteen Ninety two when Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show Bill Clinton was actually running\nNot in first or second but in third place in the presidential race at that point Berkeley sort of Ross Perot taken place was Bush the incoming president in third place buried\nI was about twenty five percent was Bill Clinton and so they were his team he remembered the bill Clinton who emerged from the Democratic primaries in Ninety two had was thought to be an electable he'd gone through the scandal about Jennifer Flowers he'd gone through the scandal about avoiding the Vietnam drafted going through the I didn't inhale moment that sort of hard in this image of\nSlick willy the guy who's going to you know lawyer Li ... scheme is way out of a out of everything and so\nFirst or second but in third place in the presidential race it that for the first place was Ross Perot place was Bush the incoming president in third place buried\nI was about twenty five percent was Bill Clinton and so they were his team he remembered the bill Clinton who emerged from the Democratic primaries in Ninety two had was thought to be an electable he'd gone through the scandal about Gennifer Flowers he'd gone through the scandal about avoiding the Vietnam draft he'd gone through the I didn't inhale moment that sort of hard in this image of\nSlick willy the guy who's going to you know Roy early try this scheme is way out of\nA out of everything and so they were trying his campaign was to change his image and he had this you know obviously winning personality and they wanted to showcase it and they wanted to get around\nInterviews with you know traditional news interviews where every question was going to be about gender flowers and the draft and all that so here was a way you go on a syndicated nighttime talk show like Arsenio Hall which was very hard at that moment you're showcase a different side of your personality\nAnd and it was Ninety two it wasn't just are sending in Ninety two was the year\n... media had been expanding in so many ways in that meeting expansion really met up with politics presidential politics I mentioned Perot who was running in first place at that point the entire Perot phenomenon began\nIn February Ninety two on the CNN show Larry King Larry King and and Larry King would sometimes have politicians on and sometimes aging celebrities and they'd spend an hour and they take calls\nAnd Ross Perot was on and February Ninety two and he said you know if the if there are
