respond to Caitlyn particularly because I think sometimes if I may just add or comment the terminology often gets in trouble I mean some people use the phrase climate change some people say extreme weather as some people say global warming and\nJust beginning to get on the same page can be one of the core problems of talking about all this\nIt's a great point we need to recognize that the good news is we have the solutions to address this problem the technical solutions the energy\nSolutions the policy solutions what we lack our political will and consensus around action we know that we have to pay the global emissions by twenty twenty and go to zero net carbon by twenty fifty turns out we have the technologies renewable carbon capture\nA electric vehicles and many others to make that happen if we make a real push but it is going to take a huge push likely made during the Cold War I Wish the country would come together over this expression of American leadership\nLeading the world again to safety I think that's possible\nAnd consensus around action\nWe know that we have to peak global emissions by twenty twenty and go to zero net carbon by twenty fifty turns out we have

the country would come together over this expression of American leadership\nLeading the world again to safety I think that's possible but when one party in the United states it's a nice factual information over twenty year period than elect a president who almost campaigned on it it becomes very difficult to engage with that and I think voters\nMay reflect that in this midterm election\nGeorge tweeted as an environmental health scientist I focus on telling people about the immediate and local clean air health benefits that will go to people in locations taking action to

many friends and loved ones from Panama City who have lost everything meaning in hurricane Michael\nMy father is it this believer of climate change and it's been very upset about losing a place we love so much he will consider that just maybe there is a greater thing at play here what is it going to take for this to change how do we those who are convinced that is happening change the way we talk about it and rather than shutting down the conversation\nNurture it Sarah how would you respond to Katie\nGosh that's a really really great question and I can feel that the pain that she's in and the laws that her family is struggling with to describe\nIs it this believer of climate change and it's been very upset about losing a place we love so much he won't consider that just maybe there is

conversation\nNurture it Sarah how would you respond to Katie\nGosh that's a really really great question and I can feel that the pain that she's in the last that her family is\nStruggling with to describe and\nYou know this is this is the peace around recognizing how difficult this information as like I got exposed to the science of climate change when I started graduate school and it took me like six years to integrate the scale of difficulty of that information and it it\nPeople can get exposed to the science of climate change and it ... they can be in such a vulnerable place that it's actually potentially dangerous for for students and people who are struggling with mental health issues\nSo the the way that we unpack this I think\nIs through um through relationship and trust and empathy um because as we interact as individuals and we come to terms with the scale of the change and the crisis you can have a lot of really based on emotion and fear anger\nUm [noise] I anxiety\nAll of these pieces that are we all ... away from those very challenging emotions and often when we feel those emotions ... into our part is in corners\nWhere we think we know the way the world is and we we become ever more entrenched in our existing world view and that's why being honest that yeah this is a really difficult conversation and that's exactly why we're having this conversation is one of the ways to start\nIf I could just doing it\nYou can have a lot of really based on emotion and fear anger\nUm [noise] I anxiety all of these pieces that are we all ... away from those very challenging emotions and often when we feel those emotions we shouldn't into our part in corners\nWhere we think we know the way the world is and we we become ever more entrenched in our existing world view and that's why being honest that yeah this is a really difficult conversation and that's exactly why we're having this conversation is one of the ways to start\nSarah if I could just doing it a little deeper on that I Wonder if this idea of being empathetic and being a little compassionate might also speak\nTo the conversations with folks who feel very fatalistic I mean it's hard not to read the latest report from the UN's climate change which we discuss last week on this program\nAnd not feel like well we're all going to die anyway why bother run up your credit because they're not going to be around a collect you know what I'm saying like it just feels like an intractable problem and I wonder if maybe a little empathy for folks who feel that way would go a long\nWay well I Want to I so yeah I get it and I I Want to remind remind us that as we sit\nWith the privilege of western lifestyles and we look at the science that we've invested public money into you know remembering that we're living a science fiction fantasy right now and we can look to human history and see that there are many other cultures around us\nAnd specifically in the U.

clients to think of anxiety kind of like sugar a little gives you energy to get going and too much shut you down and drains you need to keep it at that middle area I guess\nLet's get back to Arlene's question on our website and and Paul I wonder if you could respond to her a lean rights\nSo if you change people's minds what then I see a lot of people who believe in climate change the do nothing to try to mitigate it in their own personal lives there still driving around in gas guzzling SUVs owning their ... mentioned houses with a thermostat turned up not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something\nFlorida um but there are many more who deny it on the Democratic side there are some who are not strong enough and do not advocate serious policies\nWe have to recognize this is an imminent threat to people's public safety national security and economic well being as all the recent hurricanes wildfires have shown we need to vote\nI think one of the kind of saving grace is there at this point in the conversation is that we we do need to deal with those policy issues but\nJust being able to have the conversation and useful successful way I think that's a form of progress as well you just get people kind of pointed in the direction of being willing to do something so by the by way of kind of wrapping up I Want to go through a few comment objections to the basic argument around climate change and sort of role play how one might respond to those\nFor example be tweeted I often run into these excuses if warming is happening why do we still have winter and we've been told for decades that bad things would have happened ... years ago but they haven't Sarah how would you respond to that\nWell I mean that things are happening right now so [laughter] there's evidence that um that that those projections are coming through I mean all of the pieces of projections that we have seen around temperature and carbon\nConcentration I mean we are able to do a very good job at projecting a the impacts of climate change on the ground and and that's the state of the science right now it's it's phenomenal\nI guess the issues not just that we're having winter but we're having like day after tomorrow winter like we're having super winner\nRight and and so like [noise]\nYes and there's so there's complexity and how the regional climate and the season out of different places are influenced by the day that the on the Arctic weather system basically a collapsing and how and how that changes north\nProjecting a the impacts of climate change on the ground and and that's the state of the science right now it's it's phenomenal\nFelt like I guess the issues not just that we're having winter but we're having like day after tomorrow winter like we're having super winner\nRight and and so like [noise]\nYes and there's so there's complexity and how the regional climate and the season out of different places are influenced\nBy the day that the on the Arctic weather system basically a collapsing and how and how that changes North American climate and so we do see these complexities and why\nOn people get confused right because they're like well wait a second this is a massive storm but this is the fundamental distinction between weather and climate\nClimate ... we can measure climate for the last you know ... million years right and the the the climate for earth planet has been ... oscillation between glacial an inter glacial state abrupt warming into ... followed by slow cooling into glacial states\nSo that pacing of glacial enter glacial warming that cold too warm structure that was fundamentally paste by the changing geometric relationship between the earth and the sun\nSarah back up along the changing geometric relationship between glacial and enter glacial state last me it's so cool it's amazing like oh what is confusing like like bring it down to earth from it\nOkay so in the last million years the the planet's climate has been moving between glacial states where there's an ice on top of North American and you're Asian continent sea level is lower\nUm it's a colder climate um and then in inter glacial state so we are in an inter glacial right now okay and that changed that cold too warm shift this on this piecing this um oscillation is ... it's like a heartbeat of earth's climate\nAnd the heartbeat from cold to warm cold too warm that heartbeat was paste by the ...\nUsing like like bring it down to earth from me okay so in the last million years that the planet's climate has been moving between glacial states where there's an ice on top of North American and you're Asian continent sea level is lower\nOn it's a colder climate on and then in injure glacial state so we are in an inter glacial right now okay and that changed that cold too warm shift\nThis on this piecing this um oscillation its ... it's like a heartbeat of earth's climate and the heartbeat from cold to warm cold too warm that heartbeat was paste by the ... and ... of the geometric in earth orbit and earth tilt as it moves around the sun\nSo I only make sure following you this yeah heartbeat this earth heartbeat but we hold too warm cold too warm it's almost like the earth is having cardiac arrest the heartbeat is off and the pattern is not what it's been for a million years and we can trace it to us is that what you're saying\nThat's exactly right I like perfect then okay that makes a youthful pattern that's been ... that's been happening for the last million years we uh we have fundamentally disturbed that pattern\nI was saying earlier on a super high cholesterol sugar fossil fuel diet has gotten or a blood pressure through the roof\nAnd um the climate system can't take that forever that will go out of control that's a perfect that's a perfect them as that makes perfect sense one more thing I wanted to get to pull out and then we got to let you go shortly but for\nFolks who questioned the provenance of the science who the scientists are that came up during the sixty minutes interview who say I just don't trust the people where this data's coming from how do I know that they don't have a political agenda what would you say to someone with that concern to try to work through that\nI I I understand that you can distress individual scientists but there's not a conspiracy of ten\nTake that forever that will go out of control\nThat's a perfect that's a perfect image that makes perfect sense one more thing I wanted to get to pull out and then we got to let you go shortly but\nFor folks who questioned the provenance of the science who the scientists are that came up during the sixty minutes interview who say I just don't trust the people where

individual scientists but there's not a conspiracy of\nTens and hundreds of thousands of scientists around the world to create a problem actually I find it quite the opposite in many cases their understanding the nature of the problem because they don't want to seem alarmist the truth is that the problem is here now in imminent\nAnd that that's just the factual information on the ground we have already warmed up a a green and a half Fahrenheit we're on our way to well past three or even four Fahrenheit\nAnd it could spin out of control and that's just the factual information I I I think

also recognize there's maybe some stuff we just shouldn't be doing using a protocol that's fundamentally not secure\nI Do think that we are having a slightly more sophisticated conversation these days I mean even that meeting the county west had with President Trump in the oval office there was a shot of him sitting at the resolute desk opening his phone and his password was zero zero zero zero zero which for those replaying the home game and\nHe's a really bad password to we pick apart what you're referring to as the code war you see that it bears some resemblance to the\nWar in what

was telling stories that we didn't used to tell that we kept secret inside government but now we're trying to make public\nI think importantly so that consumers so that companies can ... or ... that

empire roads radiate it out from the capital city spending more than fifty two thousand miles\nThe Romans built these roads to access the vast areas they had conquered but in the end the same roads lead to Rome's downfall for they allowed the invaders to march right up to the city's gates he goes on to say quote\nThe Internet has opened up thousands of new roads for each of us new ideas and

another Roman moment do we kind of becoming a victim of our openness\n... I think it could be if we don't realize the moments or the moment the that we're in I remember vividly when a when director Mahler gave that speech where out in uh in in the Pennsylvania area\nIt was the first major speech on cyber as a national security threat I think about that it's now considered\nBy the director of national intelligence all the major officials to be the top threat it was only around ten years ago that we even talked about it seriously from the director the FBI for the first\nTime I know you have like a a guest on later a number of former Justice Department person Monica Becker from Facebook\nAnd it reminds me of the terrorist threat that we're facing you know our openness began to be exploited by terrorists the same way that terrorists al ... used aviation which has done so much good and connected us around the world\nAnd they turned it into a weapon that caused thousands of deaths we started to watch terrorist groups my last two years ... division exploit social media in order to get their adherence to kill and it was working inside the United states there's one chilling\nNumber of former Justice Department person Monica vicar from Facebook\nAnd it reminds me of the terrorist threat that we're facing you know our openness began to be exploited by terrorists the same way that terrorists al ... used aviation which has done so much good and connected us around the world\nAnd they turned it into a weapon that caused thousands of deaths we started to watch terrorist groups my last two years ... treaty division exploit social media\nIn order to get their adherence to kill and it was working inside the United states there's one chilling case um that I talk about that still I think people haven't heard about ... of the case that looks from the perspective of a company\nLike someone's stealing customer information names addresses the type a day in day out thing that you were talking about earlier\nHowever in this case he wasn't doing it to make five hundred bucks although he did ask for five hundred bucks he also through bitcoin on the also on the back end had become friends with one of the most notorious terrorist in the world a British born citizen named ...

Everytime\nIt gave them whoever they are access to nearly everything your user name which devices you access Facebook with\nThe last ten places you checked into or were tagged at and personal details that you posted like your religion your home town your birth date where you work yeah a good reason to go check your Facebook account now the company and the FBI or trying to catch these hackers\nAnd this year Facebook's chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified to Congress but his company needs to race it's game\nFacebook is an idealistic an optimistic company for most of our existence we focused on all the good that connecting people can do and if Facebook is grown people everywhere have gotten a powerful new tool for staying connected to the people they love\nFor making their voices heard and for building communities in businesses\nBut it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools are being used for harm as well and that goes for fake news foreign interference in elections and hate speech as well as developers and data privacy\nFacebook talks endlessly about its community and that the fringes there are some in that community who regard the platform as one of the best ways to spread terrorist propaganda over the summer we spoke to Monica ... she's Facebook's head of global policy management about how the company is taking on\nTo prevent these tools are being used for harm as well and that goes for fake news foreign interference in elections and hate speech as well as developers and data privacy\nFacebook talks endlessly about its community and at the fringes there are some in that community who regard the platform as one of the best ways to spread terrorist propaganda over the summer we spoke to Monica bigger she's Facebook's head of global policy management about how the company is taking on terrorists\nThere are two ways that we become aware of content that might violate our policies and keep in mind we have billions of new post every day or so the first thing we become aware is if somebody reports content to as you can report any piece of content through the site if you do it comes through and it's reviewed by Facebook\nOr the second thing is we actually have technology tools that are out looking for content that might violate our policies so for instance terror propaganda\nNow we remove the terror propaganda that we remove from face but more than Ninety nine percent of that our technical tools find before anybody in our community flags it for us\nNow once content has been flagged as potentially violating our policies it comes into one of our content reviewers and there's more than Seventy five hundred people sitting on those content review teams around the world reviewing content in dozens of languages\nA and making a decision if it violates the policy than ... if it doesn't violate the policy to leave it up that's\nGot to be a hard job being a content reviewer at Facebook what kind of person does it take to do that kind of work\nIt really depends on the a specific area the person is working in all content reviewers who come to Facebook are hired with a certain degree of language expertise\nWe have a really global population using this service in fact more than eighty five percent of people using Facebook on a regular basis are from outside the United states\nIf it violates the policy than ... if it doesn't violate the policy to leave it up that's\nGot to be a hard job being a content reviewer at Facebook what kind of person does it take to do that kind of work\nIt really depends on the a specific area of the person is working in all content reviewers who come to Facebook are hired with a certain degree of language expertise\nWe have a really global population using this service in fact more than eighty five percent of people using Facebook on a regular basis are from outside the United states\nSo if you think about the different languages that we see we have to hire content reviewers who speak all different kinds of languages and it's important to us that we have native language speakers because they really understand the way that language is used so that's a big focus in our hiring once you're hired as a content reviewer you're trained in all of our policies\nBut then you were assigned to become a specialist in one so for instance you'll learn all about um our terrorism and harassment and bullying policies but you might ultimately be assigned to work on um identifying self harm threats of self harm\nWhen you catch content that doesn't belong on Facebook that violates its terms what's the difference between say reactive flagging and proactive flying how much of it\nIs the kind of thing that say a reviewer or bought would find as opposed to something that I as a user would flag and then Facebook deals with we\nStill rely heavily on people to tell us when something is going wrong on a site that said we've been investing heavily in tools that can proactively flag violating content and I'll tell you there's a couple of areas where this is working really well in a couple of areas where it harder areas where it's working really well with terror propaganda\nI'm with child sexual exploitation with spam with fake accounts we now have technical tools that can slide the vast majority of that content before anybody in\nAnd as opposed to something that I as a user would flag and then Facebook deals with\nWe still rely heavily on people to tell us when something is going wrong on a site that said we've been investing heavily in tools that can proactively flag violating content and I'll tell you there's a couple of areas where this is working really well in a couple of areas where it harder areas where it's working really well with terror propaganda\nI'm with child sexual exploitation with spam with fake accounts we now have technical tools that can slide the vast majority of that content before anybody in the community\nSend it to us or sees it at all um in fact when it comes to child sexual abuse imagery or terror propaganda were able to stop the majority of that at the time of upload meaning nobody ends up seeing it\nNow when you think about a policy like bullying or hate speech or harassment a lot of that is very contextual\nFor instance um you know there could be if I if I wanted to bully you on social media and you and I are our friends at work or at our university and and now we've fallen out then there's a backstory there and the words they might use to believe on Facebook would not necessarily be the things that we could train our technology to catch\nSo it's really important for us to give tools to people so that if I ... on Facebook you can report it and our reviewer will actually look at what's happening and make that decision what about topics as opposed to content patterns how's that pattern recognition work\nWell we do some most of our policies are about content that people are posting but we do
