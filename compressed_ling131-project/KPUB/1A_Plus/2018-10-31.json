A. M. U. dot org and they get to a few more of your comments Laura is in Goshen, Indiana\nLaura emailed Trump as a vanguard of our worst angels is effectively sounding the horn to release previously restrained prejudices latent in some Americans\nHate is now fair game and high volume what they call the end the political correctness is the end of civility and democracy missing McCain and Obama now you don't know what you've got till it's gone and it's gone\nHeidi by Rick I Wonder if you could respond to that comment I Wonder if what Laura is saying in a way takes a little of the pressure off of President Trump in so far as he didn't create these views he happened to have tapped into them but you can tap into something that wasn't already there\nI think that's a completely fair position I mean you know the United states has had a long problem with white supremacy and racism and legally oppressed you know parts of its own population for centuries\nSo that that it's legitimate to say that this kind of have has been there I Will say that the work we do at the Southern Poverty Law Center found a great s\nSo that that it's legitimate to say that this kind of hate has been there\nI Will say that the work we do at the Southern Poverty Law Center found a great escalation and the number of hate groups for example on line hate rhetoric particular lean during the years that Obama was in office as an African American he very much a\nSet off white supremacist you were unhappy with him being elected to the highest office\nAnd the Internet it self has allowed this kind of material to proliferate radicalized people you know it's allowed to be shared in a way that wasn't the case in prior air as so we have a lot more of it around and that's certainly something Trump has tapped into\nNick how do you see it ah there's no question that there is a hyper polarization in American politics and I think it's important to also recognize that something is going on internationally when you look at Europe ah there is a larger\nKind of breakdown of post World war two consensus um you know in general throughout the developed world and certainly in Western Europe and North America\nA Trump did not create that he isn't happening it and he's exploiting it to his political ah aims\nWe need a a tremendous reset I think in American political discourse in this is not um I'm not even talking about the\nRhetoric of hate per se um of polarization of opposition at this point according to Gallup about twenty six percent of people in America identify as Republican about twenty seven or twenty percent identified as Democrats these are historic lows\nAs those noted before there is a historically low level of trust and confidence in the government and other major institutions\nWe need to come up with a a political rhetoric of public rhetoric actually that is I'm not a you know that is not based on demonization polarization and again you to Trump Trump bears a certain core responsibility as president of the United states because he is not simply appalling\nDon demonization polarization and again you know Trump Trump bears a certain core responsibility as president of the United states because he is not simply a politician he is also on some level I he should be leading the discussion in a way that is more productive than he is\nBut he's also not the only one are you doing this um [noise]\nAnd um the other thing to think about though is\nWhat is the distinction between rhetoric and action um and you know when we we live in a ... a society that is filled with a lot of a fantasy violence whether we're talking about games whether we're talking about rhetoric et cetera but in general crimes are going down and violence is going down so again\nRecognizing that rhetoric is one thing in reality is another I think is you know it was the starting point of any conversation about this but I Do think we need to reset and that it needs to be a it needs to move away from polarization but this is much much bigger than Donald Trump I Wonder though Nick how much\nPower we give the words that are set especially in the political sphere I mean anyone who thinks that and I I Know you're not saying that words have zero power but I think people who who minimize the power of words needs to go back and read the declaration of independence those or weapons for sure and they let you all wore\nA you know yeah I I you know I I agree completely with that and and I realized that I you know or maybe it's a slippery position where I'm saying you know simultaneously that words matter in rhetoric matters but also that we need you know what what are we going to do about this I guess as it is another way of coming to this question of\nTrump's rhetoric is ridiculous it as hate filled is garbage I mean it is and it you know it's been now uh we we can go on and on\nThat doesn't get us any closer to figuring out how to how do we have a better conversation about politics about places where we need to reach a consensus and and then it knocked policies that actually work for the benefit of of people I Do want to talk a little\nSix of places where we need to reach a consensus and and then in that policies that actually work for the benefit of of people I Do want to talk a little bit more going forward a little later in the conversation about what next steps my looked like next so we'll we'll circle back to that Jennifer mochi a number of people\nHave commented on the role of the press of various media outlets and I will try hard not to use the term ... media\nBecause there are so many different kinds of media out there will try to be a specific as we can and and thanks to those of you who've commented who have been specific who've mentioned specific networks or specific people that is extremely helpful so keep that up\nLet me get to a few of your comments about various media outlets in various press outlets\nCheryl tweeted the largest responsibility belongs to the twenty four seven media and those who absorb commentary an opinion as if it were factual news the president much like Andrew Jackson stands up to the press should he just let the Ninety percent negative coverage go we all need to be personally responsible\nMod asks why does he get so much airtime\nAnd Jim Wright's why hasn't anyone addressed the years of conditioning the public has received from talking heads such as Rush Limbaugh Glenn Beck Alex Jones et cetera\nThey have permeated our society and uh finally elected their leader which only embolden stem Jennifer before you react to that sweet of comments I should note that Glenn Beck in recent years\nHas tried to walk back some of his rhetoric and has as publicly apologized in his words for for taking some of the rhetoric too far but I Do wonder Jennifer what your senses of how much of a of a role various media outlets playing this\n... great question and I think that and there's a little bit of a historical big picture that and maybe would inform my answer here and in part of that is a reciprocal role that used to exist between the\nPicture that um maybe would inform my answer here I'm In part of that is a reciprocal ruled that used to exist between the president and the press\nUm it used to be the case that uh there was a mutually beneficial relationship between the presidency and the press a largely because they needed each other the press needed the president for information and the president needed depressed because the president needed to disseminate that information and get their message out\nUm that relationship has fractured a and that's largely due to um cable news and social media and the fact that we all now have this platform to disseminate and circulate information including the president\nUm and so information circulates in a very different way than it did twenty thirty fifty years ago which is really fractured this relationship between the press and the president and Trump has been able to take advantage of that\nAre in a way that that previous presidents had tried to do but Trump has really done much better for worse job depending on your perspective um and so a Trump is completely mastered the news cycle and the way that\nIs especially cable news has been complicit I think in\nIn amplifying his message or you know on Twitter he has followers many of them are bought a but most of Americans aren't on Twitter but we see his tweets everywhere right\nBecause those messages are amplified and that is Trump using the bully pulpit the good pope it of the presidency and also taking advantage of all of these other social media opportunities um and and so in this case a lot of times the press is been guilty of amplifying those messages when they should enough\nFrom Arizona Public radio in Flagstaff meteorologist Lee born windy and chili on this Halloween Wednesday in the wake of than exiting\nCold front they normally window

the media is trying to find a scapegoat and it is truly unfair but then again he is blamed for everything\nDone writes the shooter is responsible dumb question drew tweeted Trump may not be responsible for the violence but the people who are feeling Bolden and encouraged\nAnd drew tweeted Trump may not be responsible for the violence but the people who are feeling Bolden and encouraged by what he says as long as he remains inconsistent and denouncing violence and hatred they'll continue seeing him as an ally\n... could you respond to that last week from drew it is true that the president has the notes to violence I mean the first statement you made after the carnage in Charlottesville was to denounce white supremacy bigotry hatred melts forms\nThen in that press conference that impromptu press conference in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York on the Tuesday I think\nHe said there were good people on both sides I Wonder how you view this in terms of the the way that the president denounces violence at least at a statement and then makes comments that are vitriolic thereafter how do you see is\nYeah it's a great question and and I'd also like to address the question of responsibility and if we have a moment Jim that after answer\nAnd so Trump will say the thing that somebody has written for him to say he will read from the teleprompter when he is forced to do that\nUm but that isn't his natural inclination and so I have tracked in fact the way that Trump uses denial I'm In these situations when people do try to hold him accountable and suggest that he has some responsibility for something\nSo for example during the campaign I'm a group of white nationalist at the Daily Stormer decided that they would avenge and what they thought was a bad a article that was written by Julie ... kill 'em and so they sent her um hate messages and death threats and you know did all kinds of terrible things to her\nAnd and when they asked Trump about it he said he didn't know anything about it so his first strategy was to deny any knowledge and then they said well and you know the sun CNN they said well but you know do you have a message about\nFirst strategy was to deny any knowledge and then they said well and you know the sun CNN they said well but you know do you have a message about this now you you clearly know about it I'm telling you about it\nAnd then he denies association with the people write a he says I don't know I don't know those people and he says what fans of mine you know are these are these fans who've done this\nUm and then he does a third thing which is to wonder what um the journalist Julie ... had done to deserve this hatred you know did she write this terrible article that is full of you know lives about me\nUm and then to accuse ... other people doing the same kinds of things right to an appeal to hypocrisy\nUm and if you look at when Trump is responding to these situations where people are trying to hold him accountable for his violent rhetoric\nUm he follows that same pattern he denies knowledge of it he denies association of it and maybe praises the people who've done it he wonders what the person did to deserve it and then he finally uses to quote ... which is an appeal to ... to say oh everybody else does this it's not just me\nUm and that is classic for Trump he cannot be held accountable [noise]\nThis is why I call him a demagogue a demagogue is an an accountable leader and that's a historic definition deriving from ancient Athens\nUm and and we're talking about whether Trump is responsible and we can say that he's responsible but I'm telling you Trump does not accept responsibility he won't take that responsibility I'm an admitted that he in fact has been wrong\nI Wonder how effective the Jennifer ... in a situation like this to refer blaming you for this kind of wondering what your take on it to refer to President Trump\nAs a demagogue I mean she is the duly elected president of the United states of America she won the electoral college and when you call him a demagogue you call all the people\nThe duly elected president of the United states of America she won the electoral college and when you call him a demagogue\nYou call all the people who are elected him supporters enablers of a demagogue at a time when something like this happens but it's got to make it harder to have the kind of debate we need to have about ... about reforming the civil discourse\nSure it's an accurate term so um if you look it up and the Oxford English dictionary and the ... you'll see that the first step finishing of a demagogue is positive for neutral it says that it's a leader of the people which is a the etymology of the word\nWho defends the rights of the people against the other parts of the state the second definition of demagogue is a leader who uses polarizing propaganda for their own personal gain\nDonald Trump is a demagogue in both senses of the word\nFor his fans for his followers and has voters the ones who won't leave him who will defend him at all costs they defend him because they see him as a heroic demagogue they see him as defending their rights against the other parts of the state that they believe are corrupt\nEveryone else who sees him as a demagogue into bad sense of the word sees him as using polarizing propaganda for his own game\nWith them to use the word to use a word accurate though it may be is it helpful\nThink so [laughter] it's an analytic point we can't understand what Donald Trump is doing if we can't understand what he's doing an unaccountable leader is a danger in any political community but his specially in a democracy\nPolitical scientists and historians who are concerned about the health of the American democracy people who are charting democratic erosion and how democracies die they point to the kind of language that he uses they point to the authoritarian tendencies\nCharting democratic erosion and how democracies die they point to the kind of language that he uses they point to the authoritarian tendencies of I'm wanting to uh\nYou know Jill people or change the constitution to all of these things all of these authoritarian tendencies um which are are grounded in his language frankly I'm as as evidence of democratic erosion\nHardy I Wonder if you could respond to one of the concerns that I think are a number of people on the political right have raised which is this idea that the rhetoric is too hot all the way around that the political discourse\nHas heated up in both directions many on the right has pointed to the left saying that they use similar rhetoric to the rhetoric that President Trump has been using but they don't get cold out for quite as much here is a sample of some of what they're referring to\nGet his time for us as Democrats dubious covers they are to be dedicated to the armed committed to say on the show always do you know when they go low we go low we\nThat you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that is why I Believe if we are fortunate

Jessica Lange as Fiona good from the third season\nShare I took down here and had company with about as much as it takes me to mix a Roth Roy and Marie emotional\nWay which reminds me a drink\nJessica Lange us feel good in American horror story coven now Crist infielder good if not very good in the series she sucks people's life forces to remain eternal young but she's always gotta quip she's one step ahead of our enemies she dresses\nFabulously and it seems like even when which is our evil in pop culture they still kind of are portrayed as enviable [noise]\nYeah I think it goes back to the ... type is often a one of the stations that the ... that we see\nAnd um yeah we were afraid of her um but we love her you know were drawn to these things that we fear and I think that's that's what makes which is so appealing particularly someone like the on and we want to see her be wicked and then we want to see her be punished for it unfortunately that's what most people want to say and so that's kind of what plays out within that\nAt least someone like the on and we want to see her be wicked and then we want to see her be punished for it unfortunately that's what most people want to say and so that's kind of what plays out within that serious it up to any spoilers allow it was many years ago so I think probably seen it [laughter]\nI Wonder how you see that the crust than I mean you know when when we look at the the way that different struggles for equality or for social ascendancy are depicted\nYou know sometimes it's the it's a very ... it it feels like a similar cycle you know you have these these characters that are very noble and then eventually we get to these characters that are renegades you know we have\nThis Sidney ... is the first wave and then you've got blacks ... she got shaft it's the second wave you have these characters who are are very admirable and noble and then you have cattle characters who are like you know screw it I'm kicking butts and

excuse me a busy black woman tweeted so thankful for your guests alternative perspective on be which that's the one which I never liked because of her husband's demands that she not use her powers\nUh oh yeah ... when I Wonder if you could could help me with this ah the use of the word which I don't know if you've encountered this but I've encountered a lot of men who have used the W. word\nBecause they knew they weren't allowed to use the B word this word is very charged for a lot of men I mean even that song by Frank Sinatra witchcraft where he says there's just no nicer which then you I think that's kind of a sideways reference to that B word is that something we have to grapple with\nAnd we feed into politics all that\nI think that's kind of a sideways reference to the B word you said something we have to grapple with\nAbsolutely and we see it in politics all the time you can Google pretty much any female politician and no matter what side of the aisle they're on you will find them photoshopped as a which\nI'm so this really is still a negative epithet that a lot of people use to put women in their place to shame them on to shut them up\nEspecially women who are in the public eye who have opinions and who dare to speak their mind\nYeah I I I Wonder kind of costs where we do\nWith that mixed connotation a new will wrote on our Facebook page\nI don't see the concept of which is as a positive feminist forcing mainstream American society if a woman says she identifies as a witch in any sense of the word she's only embrace without identification and picking culture the word which still has negative connotations like witch hunt\nSo I don't see it as a way for feminists to assert themselves and be hurt a strong powerful voices in society\n[noise] I'm Jeremy ... next week

Carpenter directed and scored the original back in Nineteen Seventy eight\nAnd he is the composer on the twenty Eighteen sequel which is in theaters now John Carpenter welcome to want to thank you for having me you've been away from a Halloween movie franchise for some time now what made you decide to come back\nWhen his producer Hollywood producer Jason Blum a convinced me to come back I knew that one was a sequel was going to be made as I Know a Malika cod he's the the son of the man who put up the money for the original Halloween so I knew there was a sequel coming\nBut Jason's bomb a talk to me and they said you know where it's going to be made with or without us so why don't we meaning he he and I\nI'm getting bored and try to help it be good so nobody had put it to me that way before so I thought that's a great great thing\nJason Blum spend doing some pretty interesting things with horror movies lately what what do you make of where the genre stance today\nThat's in good shape but it's always in good shape horror has been was cinema since the very beginning and I have a feeling\nA will be with us until doomsday just because everybody's scared if something were all born afraid we all understand fear and so it's really fun to go to a horror movie with your girlfriend or your significant other and cuddle and scream and so forth\nWhat was it like for you not being in the directors chair for that\nSignificant other and cuddle and scream and so forth\nWhat was it like for you not being in the directors chair for the twenty eighth team version of Halloween you were involved in the film but what about watching someone else direct this movie it was a relief\nBecause I don't have to suffer the stress and anxiety\nThat directors suffer and that's a worst profession in the world other than being a coal miner\nThe worst other than a cold I'll come on now well it could it could be worse I guess you could be a slaughterhouse type measures that\nYou're right ah it's not the worst now\nUh when when things were a it's great to be a director when they don't work it's it's really garbage\nWhat do you think movie fans least understand about what it takes to direct a movie especially a horror movie\nWell ... what are they at least understand let me think a a\nDirectors are responsible for all the central elements of a movie if it's supposed to be funny they're responsible for the humor of it if it's an adventure and so forth and so on so director\nOf a horror movie think of it this way horror and comedy or a lot like 'cause it's timing it's all about timing and it's all about when things happen and how they unfold\nAnd it's more complex than than people assume but uh people just think that ... a lot of war and obvious violence and it's not\nYeah see I I I hear you on that it's an interesting analogy between horror and comedy I'm not big on ... or I Do not personally do well around blood and Gore and all but a good suspenseful movie like I can I can hang with that 'cause that's that's a satisfying experience what what do you think\nIt takes to make that kind of timing in a horror movie\nWhat is it what does it take to make a horror movie work these are secrets that only the Brotherhood knows I Can't oh come on you can tell me something\nWork what is it what does it take to make a horror movie work these are secrets that only the Brotherhood knows I Can't oh come on you can tell me something well look to make it really simple\nUh there are no rules for any horror film\nThe horror horror movies come out of the story and horror is every\nAction think of it that way not a genre necessarily what's your reaction to things\nAnd that if the story is is unfolding then you use the story telling\nTo a a a set up your scares and set up things they're\nFrightening for the audience he said the word earlier suspense that's what you if you get the audience in suspense and you can scare them\nSo maybe the key is having a story\nIt's got enough of the right elements to make me feel that suspense so that they're there can be that pay off so that there can be the scare is that it that is correct you got it what about the music you contributed music to this film and and the music to the original\nIn Nineteen Seventy eight what does it take to make that kind of music work for a scary movie\nWhat does it take it takes a certain amount of talent and the ability to play musical instruments and a feeling for him\nThat's what it takes now were you always musically inclined when you put the original movie Halloween together Nineteen Nineteen Seventy eight or wasn't something that kind of came together unexpectedly\nNo I I grew up in a musical household my father was a music professor he was a [noise] a virtuoso violin player and he had taught a college\nLevel music courses at a university where I grew up I grew up with music in the house all the time classical music listening to it\nHe decided when I was about eight years old and I should learn to play the violin there was only one problem with that and I had no talent\nHe decided when I was about eight years old and I should learn to play the violin there was only one problem with that and I had no talent other than that it was a great idea but I moved on from the violin to the piano and guitar and other things I picked a lot of stuff up\nWere there any particular influences that you draw on when you made the music for the original Halloween or that you've drawn on over the years\nYes I'm all classical a\nMovie composers and classical ... ah musicians and rock and roll I'd get influenced everywhere\nWhat about the timing I did the theme to the original Halloween is not in a plain old for for your time it's in five four time it's an odd kind of time's signature was what drew you to that\nMy father taught me five four time uh when I was Thirteen he'd try it on the I had a pair of bongos I got for Christmas I taught me five four on that and I thought it was unusual just straightforwardly unusual timing so\nAdapted that time's signature to the piano piece and we'll\nWe're speaking to John ... the director of dozens of heart
