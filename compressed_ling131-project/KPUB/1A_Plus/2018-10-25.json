but kind of has gotten lost in the news cycle lately president Donald Trump is a rich man but is he truly a self made man\nThat's been up for debate for some time where he got his money and how much of it came from his father the legendary New York real estate magnate Fred Trump now Donald Trump story has been pretty consistent over the years\nIt has not been easy for me and you know I I started off in Brooklyn my father gave me a small amount of a million dollars I came into Manhattan and I had to pay them back and I had to pay him back with interest\nAccording to a recent investigation by the New York times Mr Trump was a millionaire by the age of eight thanks to his father's money over the years Donald Trump received the equivalent of what would be more than four hundred million dollars today\nWhat do we now know about how the president got his wealth how does this report from the times affect his image as being a self made billionaire and for that matter\nWhat difference

turned up around the country in the past few days\nA series of pipe bombs were mailed or delivered by careers to top democratic figures from LA to New York to Washington the bombs were wrapped in bubble wrap and manila envelopes\nThey're attain tended recipients according to the mailings included Hillary and Bill Clinton Iraq Obama Joe Biden former attorney general Eric Holder democratic donor George Soros democratic California congresswoman Maxine Waters former CIA director John Brennan\nActor Robert De Niro all of them have been vocal critics of President Trump\nAt least one package had a district office of Florida Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz lifted as its return address shields as the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee it bounced back to that district office when it failed to reach its intended recipient Eric Holder\nThe bomb that was sent to John Brennan was sent in care of CNN studios on Columbus Circle in New York when it was discovered the entire CNN building the time Warner center was evacuated\nAnd the FBI says additional packages may have been mailed elsewhere an initial examination shows that at least five of the bombs are rudimentary but functional none of the bombs detonated on site and no one has been hurt as far as we know\nNow President Trump urged unity during the White House press conference yesterday\nThe full

clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United states of America [noise]\nLater during a rally in Wisconsin and in a tweet the president once again urged unity but he also blame the press for supposedly stoking political divisions this morning the president tweeted quote\nA very big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false an inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I refer to as fake news and it's gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act\nFast unquote this story is moving very fast and again there's still a lot that we do not know including who is behind\nThe suspicious devices and what message they exactly we're trying to send will keep that keep you up to speed as quickly as we can you'll get more details of course on your NPR member station and online at NPR dot\nOrg let's get\nBack to our discussion about the Trump family empire and the true nature of President Trump's wealth with Susan Craig and must be ... of the New York times we walk more of your questions about this investigation comments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nBack to that comment with regards to avoidance versus evasion of taxes Suzanne I Wonder how your reporting turned out in terms of how much money it appears that Trump's\nShould have paid in taxes but didn't do we have a sense of what the difference was between those two I mean it it it\nInto the hundreds of millions of dollars range I mean they did pay some tax on um the schemes that that we found 'em in the IRS push push back\nRange I mean they did pay some tax on um the schemes that that we found 'em in the IRS push push back\nOn some of the um some of the things that they submitted that didn't add up to them but ultimately we we felt that there was hundreds of millions of dollars that should have been paid to various tax authorities that weren't\nSusanna one of the aspects that comes up in the investigation has to do with valuations I mean when French Trump's children took over his empire the value that at all over forty one million dollars all the buildings and all the businesses that they had and the various kind of larger Trump family organization\nWhen they sold the business ... business is off over the next decade they sold for sixteen times more than devaluation can you give us the scent Suzanne of how valuations kind of what you say something is worth factors into all of this\nValuations became a a a theme quit quickly in the in our reporting once we got into the documents\nAnd we saw um sort of ... writ large when it when it benefited the trumps to put a low valuation on buildings when they didn't want to pay taxes on it they would do that and go to great lengths to to put values that just seemed\nRidiculous to us I'm low buildings worth you know a hundred million plus we get a\nValuations of you know five ten million\nBut on the same hand when they had a charitable donation um where they were a high valuation um would benefit them they went high so when it benefited them to go high they went high when it benefited them to go low we saw them go very low\nOf course if you inaccurately state the value of something to the IRS then that compromise is the amount of taxes the IRS may or may not be able to assess on that but Russ I Wonder if you could respond to a tweet from Matthew who asks how common are the various tax Dodgers committed\nTo assess on that but Russ I Wonder if you could respond to a tweet from Matthew who asks how common are the various tax Dodgers committed by the Trump family that also goes with another comment from Bryce several if you've been asking\nWhether this is kind of unique to the trumps Bryce run on our Facebook page I Would like to know how common to sort of tax dodging inheritance scheme is among the very rich after the Panama and paradise papers I just assume everyone riches engaged in a lifelong struggle to subvert the law in order to get richer [laughter]\nThose are those are very good questions I there are some of these\nSome of the things that we're talking about here that we uncovered are um trust arrangements that the IRS has endorsed sometimes after being pushed by a trust in a state attorneys\nI'm a ... and that that that are widely used one of them this grand jury attained annuity trust which is the formal name for the mechanisms through which Donald Trump in his siblings took\nOwnership of their fathers empire in the nineties there's actually a commercial BDO the consulting firm runs a commercial where my daughter is trying to persuade her father to pass on to family winery through one of these trust 'em so there there are quite common\nThen there are other aspects of of things that we uncovered that are not common at all and are not endorsed they set up a corporation that serves no purpose of an pad invoices so Donald Trump and his siblings could start\nTaking some of their fathers profits that's not that's not anything that's endorsed by the IRS that's patently fraudulent on on its face um and so those kinda things aren't a gray area and they're not widely used so it's a it's a mix of things that we're talking about here and even in the cases where\nThey used a mechanisms like the trust that are well established and widely used by wealthy people the trumps really push the limits the boundaries of those things in ways that\nThat are well established and widely used by wealthy people to Trump's really push the limits the boundaries of those things in ways that a trust in the state attorneys that we consulted with an exam and these things said we're beyond the pale of of anything they'd seen in their careers\nBefore we get into more of the details I like to get to one more comment that was sent in a through voice mail from one of our listeners who is struggling with the idea that the trumps actually did anything wrong here's what Jeff left in our inbox\nIs Jeff St Clair falls Wisconsin many many successful people have received benefits and their father I see this is a story the second part is taxes avoided\nThat is illegal method of reducing your tax bill through existing a statute taxes evaded now that would be interesting but so far as I hear is that he use certain mechanisms to avoid paying

U. dot org before we get some more questions from our listeners Suzanne what about the IRS his role in all of this\nIs their job to catch the Fred trumps of the world doing what Fred Trump did how do they reflect on this it it is\nTheir job and it's an interesting um you know a theme throughout\nThe story when we started to look at the different um schemes and I think one thing to remember about the IRS is um you know ... large um they're understaffed and and often a lot of stuff does get through 'em and I I think that that sort of became apparent to us as we were sort of looking at the totality\nOf the uh the ...\nThat we saw we do see I'm In some of the things that we found that the IRS did push back\nAnd you know from talking to the tax experts that we did um you understand when when the IRS does see something um there's back and forth I'm with you know and it would have been in this case the trumps but with the people were where were problems are found and eventually they come to a settlement\nAnd we we saw that additional toxins certain things was paid when they saw valuations\nThat they too agreed were low um and then the cases settled and and and things move on in the case of all county um we found no evidence that the IRS um my county as the company where they had they were ... voices in order to drain\nI'm Fred Trump's empire and in in cases like that we saw no evidence um that they were aware of what the trumps we're doing there so it's sort of a ... a mix of they caught some stuff and and they push back an extra tax was paid here and there and then other cases where\nWe're not convinced they even knew what was going on now that you're\nThey push back an extra tax was paid here and there and then other cases where we're not convinced they even knew what was going on\nNow that you report has come out Ross have we heard anything more from the IRS they plan to look into any of these allegations or is it is it too late or are there statute of limitations that are involved there are statute of limitations on any potential criminal\nCharges those have since told there is if there's fraud involved there's not a statute of limitations on civil penalties and and collection of back taxes we haven't heard anything from the IRS we wouldn't necessarily expect to they generally run\nVery silent and most people who work at the IRS are forbidden by law from talking about any individual taxpayer we have heard from New York City in New York state taxation authorities\nWho say based on ah the reporting that we did they have opened investigations and and are looking for ways or if there's a reason to collect a back taxes with penalties\nBenjamin has a clarifying question about all county building supply and maintenance Benjamin tweeted did all county building have to pay taxes on the income it made how much of a difference is the percentage from the estate tax Suzanne which said ...\nUm ... it's a good question the estate tax that they were looking at what have been\nFifty five percent and all county the partners in our county Donald Trump and his siblings\nI'm would've had to pay some tax would have been a business tax um and it would have been substantially less and it's\nInteresting at least in the case of the president we know because of the law says that he had incurred throughout his um his life that he may be potentially would have been able to shelter the income and not paid taxes on it because in America when you have\nYou know law says you're allowed to use those losses to offset future income so we just don't know exactly what each of them paid but it would have been substantially less than fifty five percent state tax that they were facing\nIncome so we just don't know exactly what each of them pay but it would have been substantially less than fifty five percent state tax if they were facing\nPart of the story also one of the other aspects of this the kinds of stands out is is how Fred Trump went to some pretty great lengths to bail out Donald Trump repeatedly if he ran into financial trouble rush there was one story that involves millions of dollars of poker chips and one of Donald Trump's failed casinos ... can you explain that\nTo us so that was uh in in Nineteen Ninety Donald Trump was really in his darkest moment he was facing a a payment on a bond basically a money he own oath to lenders and he couldn't make it from the revenue to the casinos\nHis father's a lawyer showed up with checks totaling three and a half million dollars\nBought some gambling chips took the chips back out to the limousine and went back to queens with them and and never cash them so that was a venture determined to be an illegal loan Fred Trump or had given his son to help them make a payment get over that hump\nI Wonder if we all should be clear here I mean even if\nEven if officials in New York or the IRS had known all of these things about the Trump family Suzanne and had decided you know what let's go after them let's ran down to a full force of the law on the trumps and make an example of them\nHow much could they have really done I mean what what's the worst case scenario that Fred Trump and the trumps might have faced at the time if they had been caught and fully prosecuted\nOr a big one is they would have had to pay taxes on all the uh on all the money but there could have been civil civil fines I'm there potentially could have been criminality I mean we talked about one area without county where you know they use these padded receipts that they are that they came up with to drain the empire they didn't pass those costs\nArea with all county where you know they use these padded receipts that they are that they came up with to drain the empire they didn't pass those costs\nOnto the tenants and I'm In doing so you know they inflated they ... they did it on and you know they did it with inflated receipts and they shouldn't have done it\nThat potentially could go into areas of wire fraud among other areas and not so there's a range of things um and now you could be looking at not only having to um they're they're facing potential not only back taxes but penalties in interest on the money the toad so there's there's a lot of things that that I think various taxing authorities\nUm another authorities could be looking at um\nWhere the food they have ended up in in federal prison for this\n...\nFederal or state prison it depends on who would choose to prosecute the clearest a legal violation that could go into a crime was what she was describing all county they were filing false documents or with the state agency um and there would be slower level charges that would flow to that\nAnd yes those could be we've talked to several former prosecutors who said that looks like\nSomething that could have clearly been prosecuted as a state crime\nClearly some of our listeners so if you feel that this is not as big a story as some of our other listeners feel it is Charlie wrote on our Facebook page sounds like President Trump is more brilliant than we ever thought and freedom and Jay tweeted so you're prove that Donald Trump success did start with a loan from his father\nAs he stated where exactly is the discrepancy none\nSuzanne ...\nComments I had one one thing that when when we started out Donald Trump has\nHas stated that he started with a million dollar loan and he built it into a billion dollar empire he's now in the White House and he ran a campaign based on being sort of a self made billionaire um there is no evidence

Ukrainian forces and basically behaving as soldiers on the battlefield\nAnd it can be a guy in a ... tell policy in Madrid\nIn Nineteen Ninety six I eat a ... who was serving that Under Cover of being a scientific and technical for sex tree at the embassy\nAnd it can also embrace things like cyber warfare and spy satellites so it's an organization that has many thousands of people working for it it also has special operations forces or I I\nAnd a very broad capabilities\nSergei Skripal joined the G argue\nWell joining the GI you particularly ah back in the Soviet period when he got involved or he was involved today and in Nineteen Seventy nine\nIt was a pretty mysterious thing you weren't supposed to really know about it you couldn't supply it was them who approach you and he'd been involved he was in the ... and he was a in a reconnaissance unit that did some pretty daring things\nAnd he'd been involved he was in the ... and he was a in a reconnaissance unit that did some pretty daring things like they went into China or on the cover and\nYou know and there are other missions as well but it described in my book\nAnd I think this protein to the attention of the geo you as being the kind of steely guy who who had the right stuff and they invite you to pay me ... an exam and he goes through that later that year he started at the ... what's cool limit it to be diplomatic academy which is effectively that spy school to Moscow\nWet you spent four years uh doing everything from you know the real a spy novel tried cross stuff of agent meats and counter surveillance\nA ... means of communications firm microscopes to secret writing to\nYou know encrypted email all that stuff\nOr through to intelligence analysis and the rest of it so it's a very sorry grounding that they get ... and having done all that\nHe got ... uh in not sneaky full to move to\nA on his first job working on the diplomatic cover and that's what a generally speaking a lot of these gee all you people who have deployed strategic intelligence gathering that's what they do they assume of civilian personnel let's say\nOr maybe ... maybe in the embassy maybe in a trade mission and they carry on with that tree intelligence and ... says all of these people you mentioned in your introduction expelled from the U.S\nA following the soles free incidents ...

A. M. U. dot org tweet us at one at a or comments on our Facebook page regarding the poisoning Martin asks there were five people substantially exposed to the nerve agent in Salzburg one of whom died what's the condition of the others\nMark [noise] um well ah\nSo those people on Nick Bailey who was a police officer who went to this ... house on the day of the poisoning he is a much better but still not ready to return to work\nUh of course a Charlie ... who was one of those\nWho are then found the buffalo or in the summer in June and uh he's ... is the person who died Charlie Rose the lightning Bailey is to have had a very small very small dies so he was a very on well\nPerson who died Charlie Rose the lightning Bailey is to have had a very small very small dies so he was a very on well for a week or two but he also has made a recovery of salts and then of course you get to UT a script pile and ... and uh\nShe was discharged from hospital a several weeks before he was once again I think one can ... from that but to how to a lesser dosage and so I suppose you could say the most serious they affected person who survived will ... himself\nUm when I interviewed the medical stuff there at a hospital you are you how to ... to Stephen jokes\nThey was saying well ah we think that will be long term side effects but it's very hard for us to predict what may also I think one would still say that ... in the prices have come with essence that's my understanding or they're all some long term effects but of course\nYou know if people are not a keen to discuss the specifics that are both because it's an issue of ... medical confidentiality and ah because I think there is still quite a lot of unknowns\nRegard to Yulia ... daughter Anna emailed\nIt's often assumed in the media that his daughter was an accidental casualty however her fiance was a gi argue employee whose mother was also a high level G R U operative\nWhen she tried to reach her fiance from the hospital he and his mother disappear also interesting and it goes on to write also interesting that the two alleged hit men flew on the same flight as the daughter to London considering that scruples wife and son died earlier somewhat suddenly it seems that the poisoning when the daughter was visiting was not an accident\nThe big question in my mind is this an operation ordered by some unhappy G R U operatives or a higher level order mark\nThe big question in my mind is this an operation ordered by some unhappy G R U operatives or a higher level order Mark I'm\nWell I I'll just pick holes in one little bit to them as a description that the the two people are two suspects or did not flying on the same plane as you describe Powell they arrived the previous day at a different London that pool got wake\nOr she arrived then on the science data sowed amounts at Heathrow\nA on a plane for mostly but anyway um\nLet's just talk that ah that's just a detail um look there is definitely something of interest about a half\nArrival in the u._k. and the timing of the attack\n'em and right from the outset people I was speaking to who were involved in trying to work out what has happened investigation or believed that the timing was critical\nNow we know even more so that the suspects are named as ... had been in the u._k. on exactly the same period the last few days of February\n... and the first couple of days in March during the previous year twenty six team I think it probably twenty Seventeen and then another man who's been isolated or identified by Russian newspapers probably a pseudonym so gay few ...\nHad been in the u._k. at the same time as ... or in twenty Seventeen and at the same time late February early March twenty sixteen\nNow this raises questions about or would they ... pounds for some time whether they using the fact that she lived in Russia and therefore they could hack a email account and that's been alleged by the u._k. government that they were hacking it from twenty ... woods and\nIn Russia and therefore they could hack a email account and that's been alleged by the u._k. government that they were hacking it from twenty ... and indeed him ... fun [noise] um she seems to have come back to be with her daddy Shia around that time because his brother Sasha how to use the stay on the first of march [noise]\nSo that's the ... uh by a late twenties Seventeen I'm fortunate they tragically a Sasha by the way had died but it's still supposed that she had come in twenty Eighteen to be with that at that time because it would be a difficult time because it was a time they were normally together as a family\nSo that the that it's always been um a a a line of inquiry for the investigator is that the\nTiming of the attack was critically linked to use his arrival that are hacking her data bugs emails and stuff which said show outcome that you are from the ... would help them to locate so make sure he was not a business trip or in some other way absent\nAnd uh that this would be a good time to do it now and I also mentioned a boyfriend that I'm Yulia had bought a is a bit of a cab yet he is sold by some to have had connections with a one of the Russian intelligence agency thought\nHe was not on the scene for example back in twenty six dating when it's believed that this um figure I'm using the names of traveled to the guy\nHe was not on the scene back in twenty Thirteen when we know according to the u._k. government\nThat her email account was hacked or he hadn't been on the scene so much more than a year so\nYou know we don't know and no fan of he's not here to defend himself against any allegations that he had played some policy in these um but we know\nAre here to defend himself against any allegations that he had played some policy in this um but ... we know that after the attack um [noise]\nUh well nearly a month off to there was a ... hearing to do with medical procedures that to happen and it was ... that he had not been in touch with the hospital for example to find out how she was\nSo the idea that he kind of a vanished from the scene seems to have some substance\nOr you'd have had access to the Internet since a fairly early on in a recovery we don't know whether she's reached out to him or whether indeed they often ... by a social media or messaging or or email or whatever uh but we have to assume that they no longer income tied\nTo a few more of your comments and questions from our urban another mark tweeted you got that out quick if it's half as good as your previous books it will be a pleasure and an education to read [noise]\nFeel asked listening to this broadcast I was wondering if we knew why it was that he decided to defect to and my six mark you kind of suggested that he had kind of had
