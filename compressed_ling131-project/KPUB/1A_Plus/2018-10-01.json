mind\nHey Joshua how are you\nGood what did you think could be a hearing last week\nThe impact on the nation are you just said the impact on the nation that's a ... exactly what I Would comment on I feel that uh\nI'm actually glad that the um that the hearings were made a public because it allows us as a nation to weigh in on what exactly is going on in Washington with our politicians and how they're making decisions\nFor us or with regard to these things so uh I think it was very important that we all uh chime in on what's going on your guard less of a political aspirations uh I myself have a they also at the alcoholism\nIn my past ah I found recovery in Nineteen eighty five I I understand the struggles of alcoholism but I also understood stand up uh in my youth when I struggled with alcohol as I grew into adulthood\nI uh was able to me I was able to hide or my drinking and to justify my drinking and this is a characteristic of LA\nOur political aspirations uh I myself\nHave a they also with the alcoholism in my past ah I found recovery in Nineteen eighty five I I understand the struggles of alcoholism but I also understood stand up uh in my youth when I struggled with alcohol as I grew into adulthood\nI uh was able to me I was able to hide or my drinking and to justify my drinking and this is a characteristic of alcoholics they\nAre very adamant about defending their drinking and also at the same time admitting that uh they do not have a problem so\nUm I think it's very interesting for us to see um individuals or come to terms with their past and how it affects their future and how that affects the future\nOf all of us David ... how do you think how do you think this will affect the confirmation battle though I mean I hear you about these other conversations that need to be had in terms of whether or not Brett Kavanaugh makes it to the Supreme Court or not what impact do you think the last few days might have\nA ... one particular clip I saw on CNN was when I'm One of the senators and was questioning him about er an FBI investigation\nAnd he refused to answer he falls silent as he he he explained that he was hoping to what the committee or would a welcome however hit he personally would not comment\nOn whether or not he would accept an FBI investigation and it was very interesting to watch his wife or her response to him because when he was\nNot answering that question and she was staring at him very sternly and I always also wonder what exactly was she thinking when he refused to answer this question\n[noise] and he refused to answer he falls silent as he ... he explained that he was hoping to what the committee or would a welcome however hit she personally would not comment\nOn whether or not he would accept an FBI investigation and it was very interesting to watch his wife or her response to him because when he was\nNot answering that question should be staring at in very sternly and I always also wonder what exactly was she thinking when he refused to answer the senators question regarding and FBI investigations\nYeah you're you're actually you know that your friends watch enough that Senator Durbin of Illinois rights have enough and\nThere's nothing to hide we should be open to any possibilities\nYou know David I appreciate your calling in thanks very much and that was the question that Dick Durbin of Illinois put to Brett Kavanaugh and he paused for a long time and then Chuck Grassley who's the chairman of the committee a Republican chairman of the committee jump back in and then after that Rachel Mitchell the question or for the G O P basically lost her job and then the GOP senator started jumping back and\nLet me get to some more of your comments David thanks very much for talking to us Catherine emailed\nAs a woman listening to Kavanaugh defend himself last Thursday I didn't find his presentation appropriate\nIt smacks of bullying and intimidation aside from that conspiracy theories like revenge from the Clintons aired and Senate testimony is a major disqualify or in my eyes before we bring in our next guest professor fitzpatrick if I could ask you to respond\nTo Catherine particularly whether or not someone who began by making a partisan broadside can be trusted to sit on the Supreme Court and administer equal justice under law\nWell I'm you know I think we have to be realistic about all of this our Supreme Court justice has come from the political world they work for ...\nAnd Senate testimony is a major disqualify or in my eyes before we bring in our next guest professor fitzpatrick if I could ask you to respond\nTo Catherine particularly whether or not someone who began by making a partisan broadside can be trusted to sit on the Supreme Court at administer equal justice under law\nWell I'm you know I think we have to be realistic about all of this our Supreme Court justices come from the political world they work for president of one party and often times or they have other experience in politics they are\nTo some extent partisan or in their outlook but they try to put that to the side as best they can when they get on the court\nAnd focus on the statutes the constitution the administrative regulations and I think they do a pretty good job obviously people's world view influences their decisions to some extent but I think we'll find that if judge Kavanaugh is confirmed\nHe is a successful justice well liked by his colleagues just like Clarence Thomas frankly a is today if you ask\nThe justices if they like Clarence Thomas they they they will tell you I don't just like him I Love him so Sonia Sotomayor came to Vanderbilt last year and talk to her students and she said that I Love Clarence Thomas and so I think we'll get beyond this um but they're certainly going to be some awkward moments for a year or two\nLet's get another voice to our conversation joining us now in Studio is Elizabeth why drop the president of the constitutional accountability center of public interest law firm as think tank based here in D.C Elizabeth walk right David you let me start with the question that I began with\nFor professors Rosen and fitzpatrick just your general sense of the hearing both the structure of it and the testimony\n... came to Vanderbilt last year and talk to her students and she said that I Love Clarence Thomas and so I think we'll\nGet beyond this um but they're certainly going to be some awkward moments for a year or two\nWithout another voice to our conversation joining us now in Studio is Elizabeth why drove the president of the constitutional accountability center of public interest law for as think tank based here in D.C Elizabeth walk great to be with you let me start with a question that I Begin with for\nProfessors Rosen and fitzpatrick just your general sense of the hearing both the structure of it and the testimonies we heard from professor Ford and judge Kavanaugh but how that might affect the ultimate big decision about whether Brett Kavanaugh should become an associate justice of the United states\nWell I think you know harkening back to what the caller uh just uh your your um listener just mentioned about the\nPresentation that judge Kavanaugh made and talking about revenge of the Clintons you know there's definitely been a divide between those who are centering Dr Ford and the other survivors of sexual assault and as we saw on judge Kavanaugh's opening censoring the political\nTalking about the Democrats talking about uh whether or not they should have leaked her letter and disregarded her request for anonymity you know I think that uh whether or not you think Senator Feinstein should have\nTried to raise this another way earlier she was trying to respect that clear request for anonymity from this\nTraumatized survivor and maybe it's telling that Republicans would have just leaked it anyway and disregarded her request but Senator Feinstein was trying to give her the respect that she and her experience deserved and I think that trying to make this part of a political gain game like she came up with it\nHer request for anonymity you know I think that ah whether or not you think Senator Feinstein should have tried to raise this another way earlier she was trying to respect that clear request for anonymity from this\nTraumatized survivor and maybe it's telling that Republicans would have just leaked it anyway and disregarded her request but Senator Feinstein was trying to give her the respect that she and her experience deserved and I think that trying to\nMake this part of a political gain gain like she came up with this decades long ... on to try to stop judge Kavanaugh from getting to the Supreme Court is frankly offensive it's offensive to\nHer and her experience and to the many many many many others who have experienced sexual assault and\nHave not come forward because of fear because of shame because they worried frankly that what we might see in this case would be true for them that they would finally find their voice and the courage to come forward and it would not matter\nI Wonder Elizabeth if there was any way around the politicking of this if it was just bound to happen no matter what I mean we got a lot of comments very critical of the Democrats alluding to what you just kind of reference there\nHave emailed the Democrats are showing the ugly side and the people see right through their deception they should be ashamed but that would require morals which they lack\nSide and the people see right through their deception they should be ashamed but that would require morals which they lack\nI Know that we can have a couple of really good days and wiped out and get back on track\nBut without your contribution it's sort of a\nA discussion point rather than reality we have until friday to raise the remaining thirty thousand dollars that we need before we call it quits\nOr we'll have to return to

Democrats are promising that if Kavanaugh is confirmed and they take the house they will hold impeachment hearings on the ledge misstatements in the confirmation hearings and they range not only from\nA his testimony involving Dr Ford and his college classmates insistence that he was a heavy drinker even though he says he wasn't and so forth but also about alleged misstatements and the first part of the hearings where he said he didn't know about a emails involving lower court confirmations or surveillance programs and the evidence suggested he did\nSo regardless of whether the Senate chooses to decide that a small misstatement as evidence of a larger one the Democrats are determined to press these and they're not going to go way\nWho is your mom but tweeted sometimes the partisan lens is overrated I Am a moderate Republican women and so many women that I have known experience to solve like Dr for describes a friend from my church a high school friend a cousin a neighbor we believe her because we have been her\nPamela tweeted this is an impossible situation\nFeel deeply sorry for Ford is she was obviously sexually assaulted by someone and they spent her life trying to get over it I also feel deeply for Kavanaugh as I have a father and brothers there was no way to prove his guilt or innocence I should also note that we've been getting a number of voice\nPublic in women and so many women that I have known experience to solve like Dr for describes a friend from my church a high school friend a cousin a neighbor we believe her because we have been her\nPamela tweeted this is an impossible situation I feel deeply sorry for Ford is she was obviously sexually assaulted by someone and they spent her life trying to get over it I also feel deeply for Kavanaugh as I have a father and brothers there was no way to prove his guilt or innocence\nI should also note that we've been getting a number of voice mail messages about this from across the country\nAnd even from around the world already in Hamburg, Germany left this note in our inbox\nThe Kavanaugh hearings have caught the attention of the German press beat to sue ... what do you decide\nThe opinion though is uniform it's an absolute shock at the lack of respect being shown by the Republican Senate toward the Supreme Court\nAnd its own history as the world's greatest deliberative body the shock is not at the partisan tones of the hearing the right left battles are left right battles happening here too\nBut what's shocking is the tenor with which the Republicans have been speaking to the Democratic colleagues and the tenor with which the nominee himself used to address the Democratic senators Thursday\nAlready thanks very much for commenting to us in just by way of context to ... is a major paper in Germany if you remember\nOur conversations about the Panama Papers the big international investigative report about money hidden in offshore bank accounts to ...

Illinois and Florida passed new laws that would raise the minimum age from Eighteen to Twenty one uh Florida State representative who ... who was a Republican\nSponsored new legislation on new gun control after the shooting in Parkland, Florida he had an eighth grade from the n._r._a.\nSerious speaking on WFL our TV in Miami about why he agreed to raise the legal age this is an edited version of his interview\nA determining what age someone can do something is a judgment call and we do it in in many areas of our of our law making and so I think it was for that on was the fact that he had an Eighteen year old a who did purchased this weapon I think I think without that particular fact he probably wouldn't have seen that\n[noise] what about law abiding Floridians who are Eighteen Nineteen Twenty years old some of whom have gone and served our country and fought for our country overseas\nW F for TV in Miami about why he agreed to raise the legal age this is an edited version of

certainly withstand judicial scrutiny from our interview 'em and be upheld and I think it's a natural reaction to the a mass shooting involving you know that are often\nUm with schools individuals who are within that timeframe of Eighteen to Twenty one uh and I will note that Florida passed a package of laws or the minimum age being one all of which were\nA really designed to address the the type of issues that we saw\nA from Parkland at the age of the shooter obviously the fact that this weapon was actually kept in the home where he stayed on secured\nAnd that's why the extreme risk laws so important so we're seeing these kinds of package bills a reviewed and introduced that the most notable point for me is it passed in the state of Florida\nRat has long been one of the strongest a sort of ...\nOf the enterprise legislative agenda and I think is very telling on obviously the reactions of Parkland and the the activism that took place immediately following a the Parkland shooting\nI
