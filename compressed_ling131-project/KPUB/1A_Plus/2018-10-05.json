weeks going on on Tuesday the president held a rally in Minnesota and took the opportunity to mock Kavanaugh's accuser professor Christine Blasey Ford and question her account of events\nThirty six

are really evil people\nPart of what President Trump said to supporters at a rally in Minnesota on Tuesday Steve Clemons we should note first of all what the president said is on true professor Ford did not say that the only thing she remembered was having one beer ironically she said the things she most remembered was being laughed at\nBy Brett Kavanaugh and his friend mark judge she was allegedly in the room when this happened so there's a little bit of irony with the crowd laughing her over the president's account so we should clear that up but I Wonder more to the point whether or not the White House has addressed those remarks\n[noise] look um [noise]\nWas on stage just on the other day with Kellyanne Conway are asking her about these are the president's temperament and uh

happened in her life and why she chose a to share that and and she uh acknowledged that she didn't choose to share that it just came out\nThe president's behavior is something that makes many people around the president United States today extremely uncomfortable\nThey have at the beginning of this process we're trying to be respectful to say that a doctor Ford needed to be heard and listen to or that there were important issues there and the president broke out of those constraints and we're sitting as I'm sure Susan Glasser and a Eugene a\nWill will comment as well in a very extraordinary moment where many Americans and their experiences that have gone through with many other sexual assault victims in the past have kept quiet and said this way even Susan Collins who's now probably uh in in a position to vote 'em in in favor of of judge Kavanaugh\nHas has said you know people do not talk about this these are the the most under reported incidents that I Would like to add just to Eugene ths comment about Kavanaugh's\nWall Street journal op ed that was written for one person that was written for not Donald Trump was written for Senator Flake Senator Flake at the Atlantic idea at the Atlantic festival this this week said that we could not have the kind of temperament that Kavanaugh showed on the Supreme Court he says we cannot have that on the court we just cannot\nUh in in

Atlantic festival this this week\nSaid that we could not have the kind of temperament that Kavanaugh showed on the Supreme Court he says we cannot have that on the court we just cannot and he was referring specifically to Kavanaugh going after senator after senator after senator after his very emotional opening statement\nAnd that was a message to give flake cover to also vote for cabinet so we're sitting here where people are walking away\nFrom the allegations and uh the tunnel that many women and their partners and others supporting them feel about this being a shoved under the rug right while others are getting a a essentially\nFig leafs and passes to be able to vote for cabinet\nYeah he did have a lot of very sharp exchanges with senator Amy ... Patrick Leahy and and Dick Durbin and many of the Democrats who questioned him last Thursday fewer quick questions and then we'll we'll keep going let me get to some of your comments as well Virginia and in Washington DC writes democratic obstructionism\nMerrick Garland\nAnd Susan in Gainesville, Florida asks what on earth is the rationale for only one copy of the report a forty five pages being provided for review by one hundred senators\nSusan clearly a lot of things for voters to carry in they're not at all distant memories when they go to the polls in November go to the polls next month

affect the mid term elections I mean a lot of what voters vote on in the midterms doesn't have to do with what happens in Washington so live it does a lot of it has to do with what happens at home we have a sense of what the balance is looking like right now\nWell look first of all it does depend in fact on how this ends and uh there is an interesting argument to be made that if Kavanaugh is confirmed a it's much more likely in a way to somewhat fade as an issue for Republican voters while\nA becoming an enormous rallying cry for Democrats and and conversely were he to go down a especially in such a spectacular fashion so close to the election there's already a sense and President Trump clearly feels is which is why he's been ... up his his voters over the last week on that he you know that we're having to go down\nThat this would outrage uh and and enrage\nRepublican base voters in a way that could prove beneficial especially in some of these key Senate races are in ...

investigation regarding President Trump's finances are ... Eugene I think\nOne of the things that is worth knowing for sure was what Susan Glasser said regarding the uh the provenance of the information related to the investigation are there other big questions that are still out there when it comes to the president's tax history we still don't have his tax returns provided by him for example\nI was gonna say that's the biggest question I mean the reality is this what's done over a I Believe Eighteen months what has happened since uh you know that piece was published or perhaps the research and we still do not know are there more questions than answers because many of the answers could be providing if we actually had\nA the tax forms which\nSarah Huckabee Sanders pretty much gave us a reason to believe earlier this week we we perhaps should not expect uh the reality is that this is not an area that Trump I desire to be transparent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n... are out of what the vote total was again this is one of two votes that's involved in either getting Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court or not today's vote is a procedural vote to end the debate it's technically called cloture\nThe next vote would be the vote on whether or not senators would actually choose to put Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S Supreme Court\nWe heard just a few minutes ago but Senator Susan Collins Republican of Maine who might be a potential swing vote on this announced\nThat she will side with her fellow Republicans on a critical past voted this cloture vote\nTo end the debate we're just double checking our numbers right now want to make sure we have the exact right so total and as soon as we have that we will bring that to you for the moment we should get to one of Susan ... a ... she is literally leaping out for sure go ahead Susan ...\nWell it looks like we have the votes now from all four of the undecided senators going into at least on this cloture motion and interesting they Lisa Murkowski is the only one who was voted no show Joe mansion that Democrat from West Virginia has voted yes\nJeff Flake has voted yes Susan Collins has voted yes now Susan Collins however previously announced she was voting yes on the cloture vote but not\nTo necessarily take that as an indication of her final stance on Kavanaugh because she this afternoon at three PM she will announce her final decision so we don't know necessarily what this procedural votes me but I think it's quite significant\nUh to see the Joe mansion yes vote in particular and the Lisa Murkowski no vote if those positions were holed up in the final vote on Kavanaugh he would be approved\nLooks like there's still some voting going on maybe from senators who were struggling in and out of the room Steve Clemons once this cloture vote is done with eventually it will be done with what happens then what do we expect between this vote in the next one will you'll have debate on\nAnnounce her final decision so we don't know necessarily what this procedural votes me but I think it's quite significant ah to feed the Joe mansion yes vote in particular and Lisa Murkowski no vote if those conditions were holed up in the final vote on Kavanaugh he would be approved\nLooks like there's still some voting going on maybe from senators who were struggling in and out of the room Steve Clemons once this cloture vote is done with eventually it will be done with what happens then what do we expect between this vote in the next one will you'll have debate on the floor\nOf it goes on and they'll bring that debate too close and they will set a time most likely tomorrow I'm In which they will a vote to confirm or not judge Kavanaugh\nAnd that time it it could be any time during the day or is there like a particular window hardly any time of\nDay I mean one of the things about this at it as it runs anytime I think one of the interesting things is you have\nA a senator from Montana or a Steve Gaines whose daughter is being married tomorrow getting married tomorrow and he wants to walk her down the aisles so assured his vote be absolutely necessary they have to wait for him to get back from Montana so it's one of those life\nUh intrusions into the way the system runs but my sense is that Mitch McConnell is obsessed with getting this done moving on and getting people out uh campaigning and\nHe'd noting this as a success that they've achieved that's why this is so unusual that feels raced pushed whether it's the FBI investigation which many people have been saying has not been an exhaustive did not go into many corners is because the clock is ticking for Mitch McConnell and I think he wants to shelve this and get this done as soon as possible yeah not\nOne of these votes that you do one of these what you have to do in person there was no app for that so certainly his [laughter] his uh his other life commitments could have a big impact\nAll is obsessed with getting this done moving on and getting people out uh campaigning and\nNoting this as a success that they've achieved that's why this is so unusual that feels raced pushed\nWhether it's the FBI investigation which many people have been saying has not

votes that you do one of these what you have to do in person there was no app for that so certainly his [laughter]\nHis uh his other life commitments could have a big impact the final vote total fifty one yes forty nine no and indeed as Susan said senators Collins flake and mentioned voted yes to suspend the debate and move on\nLisa Murkowski voted no but it seems like for the most part this was pretty much a party line vote Eugene Scott I don't think that we really expected it to go any other way than being essentially a squeaker right on party lines\nAbsolutely I think everything just leading up to this moment suggested that even before the allegations against Kavanaugh became a public and I think ah there's a a ... a larger idea on that David Brooks tapped them\nOr to today and in his New York times piece about just how part is in the judicial branch has become\nUm we talk often about activists judges um and concern that people on the bench are not making decisions and partially but we haven't seen that be the case for a while now and they simply appears to be a continuation of that\nI mean if I if I may Joshua one other element on this is that it was interesting to note that Heidi Heitkamp brother\nTweeted that she has to look at herself every day in the mirror and us chose to vote no even though he thinks it significantly increases the chances that she will lose her seat Joe Manchin the last time there was a a a reasonable poll in West Virginia is looking at Seventy percent\nUm and concern that people on the bench we're not making decisions in partially

in terms of the tectonics and the parties as they look at trying to take the Senate where the Democrats taking the Senate is\nIs also hedging on this that if Manchin were to be a no vote on Kavanaugh I think it it it very seriously could raise the stakes have him losing that state so there are different they're different issues here one is what what is the future prospects of\nWon a always

A. M. U. dot org with regards to cyber hacking Michael asks with the loss and result in widespread dissemination of the CIA tool kit which allows one to spoof hacking from another country how can cyber bread crumbs lead to certainty that another country is actually guilty\nDavid what do you think well cyber attribution is something that people are getting a lot better at I'm certainly there are lots of ways to make it appear that a cyber attack came from other places when the New York times was attacked by the Chinese and its computer systems\nAh years ago it looked like the attack was coming from a University in the southern part of the U.S\nBut the fact of the matter is a combination of forensic evidence a motive\nPast use so similar tools can get you most of the way most of the time so there are some pretty good ways to go do it\nThe bigger question facing many governments is once they've found this out and perhaps decide one ounce it as happened in these most recent cases then the political pressures on them so what do you do about it\nThat's why the president signed a new set of executive orders in um in August we haven't seen them they're all classified that pushes down into the system or the ability for commanders in the U.S to do cyber attacks back without having presidential sign off till now that's been\nAnd so there are some pretty good ways to go do it\nThe bigger question facing many governments is once they've found this out and perhaps decide one ounce it as happened in these most recent cases then the political pressures on them so what do you do about it\nThat's why the president signed a new set of executive orders in um\nIn August we haven't seen them they're all classified that pushes down into the system or the ability for commanders in the U.S to do cyberattacks back without having presidential sign off\nTill now that's been something that the only only the president to authorize the use of nuclear weapons and cyber weapons now it's not entirely clear that only he can authorize the use of cyber weapons in retaliation but you want to make sure you're attribution is pretty good before you strike back you know who to attack\nYeah great married before we move on from there first of all that is no small thing that that the U.S military might have the latitude unilaterally to shut down a power grid or turn off a hydroelectric dam through the Internet\nBut beyond that do we have a sense that certain countries certain organizations are getting a better handle on dealing with cyberattacks to world clearly hasn't figured this out is anyone making progress I think about the EU because I hear so much about Internet regulations from there on the consumer level but\nOn a military level is anyone making progress\nOr not that I'm aware of the U.S I think it's still a world leader in in in terms of a man's Internet abilities and and the threats are pretty clear or Russia or China and North Korea Iran\nBut a ... figuring out or response in how you want to calibrate that response so it doesn't become this open ended escalation and you don't know the capabilities of your rivals if you respond a you you're\nAbout Internet regulations from there on a consumer level but on a military level is anyone making progress\nOr not that I'm aware of the U.S I think it's still the world leader and in in terms of uh you know advanced Internet abilities and and the threats are pretty clear or Russia or China and North Korea or Iran\nBut a ... figuring out or response and how you want to calibrate that response so it doesn't become this open ended escalation and you don't know the capabilities of your rivals if you respond a ... really uncharted territory\nVivian do we get a sense of countries beginning to kind of work together to figure this out to to figure out some kind of international response to cyber attacks or his Russia really got the whole world kind of running with here on\nThe what we've seen in the last couple of days of coordination of um indictments and you know raising concerns about um sighing and otherwise obviously there's a lot of discussions that are taking place where countries a western allies trying to coordinate some kind of effort to counter\nThe threat that that the Russians posed but at the same time again you have so many ah\nRestrictions and so many um uncertainty as to how to approach the cyber world in general in cyber threats\nAs David said the U.S trying to really formulate some sort of attack plan or something to counter to protect our infrastructure so that we don't have um we're not as vulnerable as we've seen ourselves\nIn the past but obviously you know the U.
