L. M. thing Morgan's referring to Patrice floors ... and Alicia Garza who helps propagate the black lives matter ... after the Trayvon Martin shooting direct\nYeah so when we think about the movement the movement is an expansive space and I write about this in the book is that you know for those of us who were industry in Ferguson we're mindful that there was nobody who founded the space there was nobody who started the protests there was no one to three ten people who caught us all to the street who organize every body\nSee done to ensure that people do the names of the three black women who actually started ... I think Morgan's referring to Patrice ... ... and Alicia Garza who helps propagate the black lives matter ... after the Trayvon Martin shooting direct\nSo when we think about the movement the movement is an expansive space and I write about this in the book is that\nYou know for those of us who were industry in Ferguson we are mindful that there was nobody who founded the space there was nobody who started the protests there was no one to three ten people who caught us all to the street who organized everybody was so beautiful about the protests that\nUh it was organic there were a set of people who came out every night thousands who made the protests last and you have to remember\nThat we were the street for four hundred days and most people remember as a long weekend which is unfortunate that there's this narrative that if that has come up that is a race so many people that suggested there was like a small group of people who started everything who came in St Louis organized every body the organizations did that work\nAnd that's just simply not true so when I think about like how I use my platform of how I think about my work\nIs it I'm awful that I was one of many people in the book a highly so many people who were industry in St Louis who did incredible work for whom without you wouldn't there would be no protests\nAre so that is important to me and then the second part is that I Know that the platform doesn't only exist for me that one of the important things about having the platform and access is that\nNot only do I try to make sure that the truth is president everyone but I also know that I'm not the only person that can bring the truth so you don't know the people who said all the protesters every night or the\nThe people who got people out of jail or the people who helped organize some of the biggest actions that people helps his sprayed across the country like you've never heard those names are in in the book I Try and write about those people too that I Know them because I was there we were in the middle of the street together\nBut this narrative that there's I guess most of the people who like started every thing in the movement or that there's a small set of organization\nIt's about having the platform and access is that not only do I try to make sure that the truth is president everyone but I also know that I'm not the only person that can bring the truth so you don't know the people who said all the protesters every night or the\nThe people who got people out of jail or the people who helped organize some of the biggest actions that people have just sprayed across the country like you've never heard those names are in in the book I Try and write about those people too that I Know them because I was there we were in the middle of the street together\nBut this narrative that there's like a small set of people who like started every thing in the movement or that there's a small set of organizations who like\nWith a catalyst for the protest is just not a true narrative\nThere's always this tension with movements that have certain people certain leaders to become more prominent\nWith the concerned about but who profits off the cause I mean there are some who would critique the book and the podcast is a way to profit off of black lives matter how do you respond to that and I also wonder if there is any plan to use any of the proceeds from the book to help the cause\nYes it's interesting I think I'm always shut you know I feel like I live a pretty public life and I'm always shocked um by some of the\nThe way the question gets asked to like it's public that or a portion of all the proceeds went to the end emily's sleep in a portion of all the pre order sales went to the N. double ACP legal defense and that was\nPublic I did it 'cause it was important and it was my way of saying that like I Want you to buy the book but the book also like I Want the process of buying the book to also do more work than just buying the book right so like that's what the book specifically\nBut in general in the face like I'm mindful of ... when we started camping zero which is like our our biggest project starting twenty Fifteen a we actually didn't participate in the nonprofit funding like the nonprofit sort of race for funding specifically because of the question that you asked so over the past three years we raised about it\nWent to the end up ... legal defense and that was\nPublic I did it 'cause it was important and it was my way of saying that like I Want you to buy the book but the book also like I Want the process of buying the book to also do more work than just buying the book right so like that's I think about the book specifically\nBut in general this basic I'm mindful of this and when we started camping zero which is like our our biggest project starting twenty Fifteen a we actually didn't participate in the nonprofit funding like the nonprofit sort of race for funding specifically because of the question that you asked\nSo over the past three years we raised a about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars per year which is not a lot of money and the grand scheme of non profit and we did it so that\nWe could just raise enough money to do the work that we thought was important right so we created the first I was a database of police union contracts at first a public database of use of force policies continue to do a lot of data work that hasn't been done before continue to support organizes around the country and really disagree projects\nNo I I Know paid staff I'm not pay you know I don't know salary from the stuff so we try to do it as like\nWith just the bare necessities so that it's not just a question of like profit\nUh in with the cash you know like I could have the packets could have just been my voice but I don't think that makes sense so I invited Brittany Sam and Clinton being part of it\nThey get paid as a part of the broadcast because I think that that makes sense um and it's not like some you know huge moneymaker but it does allow us to like be able to be in a place where we don't have to rely on a nonprofit a complex to like fund our work to do this really well ah\nAnd you know it's like I ... at the way that I exist in the world right now is like not necessarily a sustainable way I'm not by state allows me to like\nOh no no I mean like I don't have you know it's like a [laughter] not only that not and that's what I have a salary but um you know when I quit it was really rough it was like you know I didn't have health insurance\nUm and it's not like some you know huge moneymaker but it does allow us to like be able to be in a place where we don't have to rely on a nonprofit a complex to like fund our work to do this really well\nAnd you know it's a guy at the way that I exist in the world right now is like not necessarily a sustainable way I'm not by state allows me to like\nOh no no I mean like I don't have you know it's like a ... and that's what I have a salary but um you know when I quit it was really rough it was like you know I didn't have health insurance like you know I'd defaulted on my student loans like it was a really rough um it was rough\nAnd only this only a couple of months ago was the first time them actually lived alone since the protests have essentially been staying in the basement of a like my second parents for the past three years right so\nYou know so that's not us as you know wants to get married in the in the basement of their right second parents that's not sustainable so so but it's like it's the right way that I Want to be in the work right now right that like\nThere are these narratives of like oh I made it gets ill in dollars and it's like well no you like the me on the news you human a pie cast you like see me out of an event that means a lot to you and like that automatically means of wealth to some people and that's just not\nThe case that I've had high incomes before and you know that there was any income and wealth is pretty significant though I'm so people have been like really confused by that\nLet's talk a little more about

asked her why she left\nA leader in the chapter you write code I'm mindful that we remember pain and trauma differently than we remember joy and triumphs\nWhen we remember pain we're trying to protect ourselves and cope with trying to order the memories in ways that will allow us to make it to tomorrow and the day after tomorrow unquote talk about how\nPage and a half where you talk frankly about your mom leaving the family when you were a toddler and the fact that you never have asked her why she left\nA leader in the chapter you write quote I'm mindful that we remember pain and trauma differently than we remembered joy and triumphs\nWhen we remember pain we are trying to protect ourselves and cope with trying to order the memories in ways that will allow us to make it to tomorrow and the day after tomorrow unquote talk about how those kinds of traumatic or difficult experiences as a kid\nKind of helped to shape you as an adult particularly an adult who would gravitate toward activists\nYou know it's interesting ah this is the first time saying this because it just happened is that my mother read the book um and she texted me recently and it was I hate to re read the book we should talk\nAnd I just haven't had like having them with the right back at so hopefully I write back soon\nIs one of the reasons why I wrote this happened in the ... I can remember and now with that and it's one of the reasons that I wrote the chapter was that I Know that we walk into every room bringing much more than we name and one of the things that I bring into every room is what does it mean to be worthy that if she could leave than it feels like anybody could leave\nAnd I like that is something I've had to sort of work within and grow with as an adult to make sure that that doesn't hurt me or other people and like that's important as we think about what it means to organize is that like we're all walking into rooms and meeting people where they are part of meeting people where they are that we know where we are and like I think that that has to be like a\nA core part of it that the part that you read about like how we remember pain and I remember joy is that for so many people you think about like the constraints would a million people who grow up in marginalized communities where there's poverty race\nOr or any other aspect of their identity they they learn the constraints really well I Know I knew how much money we had as a family and I knew would pass home and not to ask why new\nThat doesn't hurt me or other people and like that's important as we think about what it means to organize has had like we're all walking into rooms and meeting people where they are part of meeting people where they are that we know where we are and like I think that that has to be like a\nA core part of it that the part that you read about like how we remember pain and I remember joy is that for so many people you think about like the constraints would a million people who grow up in marginalized communities where there's poverty race\nOr or any other aspect of their identity they they learn the constraints really well I Know I knew how much money we had as a family and I knew would pass home and not to ask why new\nLike when we didn't have toys how to make fun outside and you know a lot of people talk about growing up poor but I said one of the hard part is like when we grow up and sometimes we still only see a world of constraints semi the constraints becomes so great and the way that we've learned how to survive\nThat we can't start imagine things beyond it and if we're ever going to win like it'll be like a deep imagination that gets us to the other side\nAnd like you didn't know that they were seeing the writing the left is it the right has always re packaging old narratives for new time the left we're always engaged in the most intense make believe that like we're always trying to tell a story about a world that nobody's ever seen before but we know it's possible you've never seen health care for all but like you believe that you've never seen a world where every woman has the right to choose but like we believe that that's real\nAnd like telling those stories actually really hard and there's no way to to be really good story to tell her about a future that you've never seen if you aren't able to tell stories about the world that you live and how you entered the world\nYou also share fairly late in the book the fact that you are a survivor of sexual assault something that you write happen to you numerous times that are rather young age\nAnd you connect that with what you call the quiet quiet about the assault but also quiet about your own identity and your sexuality you've been out for some time in the book you write in part quote I think about the quiet instead of the closet because I've never hidden any part of myself from myself or others\nAbout a future that you've never seen if you aren't able to tell stories about the world that you live and how you into the world\n[noise] you also share fairly late in the book the fact that you are a survivor of sexual assault something that you write happen to you numerous times at a rather young age\nAnd you connect that with what you call the quiet quiet about the assault but also quiet about your own identity and your sexuality you've been out for some time in the book you write in part quote\nI think about the quiet instead of the closet because I've never hidden any part of myself from myself or others you go on to write quote but I grew up quieter about the parts of myself that I didn't think anyone would love\nThe parts that I had never seen loved in others unquote how does that interact with the person you became\nYeah you know one of the reasons why I was important for me to be out and very very um [noise] I mean about for a long time but to be publicly out in a in a very\n... way when the protests began with like I didn't want any kid growing up who was also gate to think that the only way\nTo do this work publicly with to to be in the closet and ah you know that chapter started from this tweet that I wrote a long time ago that was like just because you didn't know doesn't mean it wasn't real like I was in the quiet and not the closet\nAnd ah you know I I Walk into every room as a gay black man and like that is real to me it's important so there was no way for me to write a book about the work that we've done and they weren't to all of us have collected within social justice or the work that we need to do\nWithout talking about a mile an identity that I wrote about the the sexual assault because it was re oh it's one of the things that I haven't really talked much about I mean it's in the book now so it's not just you know it's not something that only I Know\nUm [noise] but it was like sort of\nIt was free in some ways to finally just stay and like not have to tiptoe around and not be ashamed to say that this happened in and it was real and it was awful and\nAnd I'm like that is real to me it's important so there was no way for me to write a book about the work that we've done the work that all of us have collective within social justice or the work that we need to do\nWithout talking about a mile an identity that I wrote about the the sexual assault because it was real it's one of the things that I haven't really talked much about I mean it's in the book now so it's not just you know it's not something that only I Know\nUm but it was like sort of\nIt with ... in some ways to finally just stay and like not have to tiptoe around and not be ashamed to say that this happened in and it was real and it was awful and\nYou know when I told when I when I finally taught a couple of years later and they realize that he'd actually been sexually abusing like a whole set of kids who are even younger than me um\nTo like you know speaking up actually made a difference in other people's lives and like that was important\nUm but I've had to like you know I write about in the book is it like my own relationship to my body I had to learn that had to learn what it meant to be in relation with other people and like it'd be one where we were ... years and we both have the same amount of power because that wasn't the first experience with my body right as I wanted to just give language to that\nHow far do you think that that out is actually goes I mean I I'm Out I've been out from most of my all their career if not all of my career\nBut I Know that there's you know there's this aspect of what I Believe is referred to as an implied attribute where it's kind of known but not experience so there's a difference between me saying Oh yes I'm active with the national lesbian and gay journalist association\nAs opposed to me showing up you know a picture of me at a bar with my shirt off making out with a guy in the corner like it's a whole different kind of being out because people are OK knowing it in the abstract but they don't want to know that you're actually like a gay person who does good things and that changes the conception\nDo you find that there's a line in terms of identity versus full identification like okay you know let's not say anything more about this let's not make them think ...\nTribute where it's kind of known but not experience so there's a difference between me saying Oh yes I'm active with the national lesbian and gay journalist association\nAs opposed to me showing up you know a picture of me at a bar with my shirt off

who does good things and that changes the conception\nDo you find that there's a line in terms of identity versus full identification like okay you know let's not say anything more about this let's not make them think any more about my ... and they have to be\nYeah you know like\nWe have to complicate this idea of like what it means to show up and gave the bike and there's not one way right that there's not two ways to be gay they're like\nThe white pride parade is really really all that like yeah so like sometimes it is me wearing rainbow shoes right and sometimes it is me just like going on a date and like that it and like those are both valid ways to jump in and the identity that I Am right uh so\nSo yeah there definitely people who are frustrated me feel like I'm not gay enough in like\nThat I don't talk about gay issues publicly as possible and like he was one of those things too that it's like well how much of my life too I live so that like other people can feel like it's real re so like I Know that you know we're working with the research right now I'm trying to think about HIV testing that like one of the things that some new research suggests that\nIt's not that people and people don't get tested it's not they don't care about their health or that they're necessarily afraid of their results but that\nAre that they actually nervous about showing up at a facility and in cities that are that function as small towns and they're nervous about seeing somebody they went to high school with seeing like somebody's cause and a friend like that they actually are nervous about like well privacy really be private right and like how do you actually or how do you set up a testing mechanism that gets around that that to me it's fascinating\nAnd like so rhythm quiet work around that but like I've I don't feel like I Need to talk about\nHIV testing that like one of the things that some new research suggests that\nIt's not that people when people don't get tested it's not they don't care about their health or that they're necessarily afraid of their results but that\nOr did they actually nervous about showing up at a facility and in cities that are that function as small towns in a nervous about seeing somebody they went to high school with seeing like somebody's cousin friend re like that they actually are nervous about like what privacy really be private right and like how do you actually or how do you set up a testing mechanism that gets around that that to me it's fascinating\nAnd like so we don't quite work around that but like I have I don't feel like I Need to talk about every two seconds for people to be like they're actually cares about being gay right um\nSo the other thing I think that there's some people who I can really homophobic but like me and that's now for that I don't want to be like a safe spot for your heat\nYou also talk very frankly in the book about your bid for mayor of Baltimore your willingness to meet

five\nRight let's get into it [laughter] getting dirty a big amount of season five is spent poking fun at the idea of the arch Moore show runner himself it there's a light on actually something along the lines of television it's a collaborative medium where one person gets all the credit\nAnd yeah I have to say a when that line came up at the table read it got a much bigger laugh when I was expecting from the crowd of people over there\nI mean is it a little surreal to be a show runner on a press to her about a season of your show where one of the characters his show runner who are I'm sure would kill to be on a press tour talking about a ... a little bit\nIt's it's strange and you know one of the things we wanted to talk about when it putting the season together is this weird moment we're in now of of the tourist show runner which is really like a new development in the last ten years or so um\nIt it strikes me as very odd because I I don't think that I'm a a a brilliant genius who you know touches a show and turned it into gold and it all just\nYou know flows out of the pencil which is connected to my brain um ... it's a very collaborative process and we have people making a better every step of the way I have an amazing\nOne of the things we wanted to talk about when it putting the season together is this weird moment we're in now of of the tourist show runner which is really like a new development in the last ten years or so um\nAnd it it strikes me as very odd because I I don't think that I'm a a a brilliant genius who you know a touches a show and turned it into gold and it all just\nYou know flows out of the pencil which is connected to my brain um ... it's a very collaborative process and we have people making a better every step of the way I have an amazing writing room\nThe cast brings so much the designs by at least they had all the uh directors brings so much to the episodes of the story board animators the editors um it it it really it takes a village um\nSo it's odd that yes I Am doing all these interviews now and talking about the show and talking about how I made the show because it's not have a TV show gets made at all and I think anyone who presents that as how a TV show gets made is trying to sell something\nBut then what exactly does the white board in the writers' room look like when you've got the word play the slapstick puns and the Pratt falls a overlaid on some of the deep dark themes that runs throughout the season and the show also has a memory yeah on memory his his mistakes\nHim it's a very I mean in a lot of ways I think we write the show like a drama but we're a room full of comedy writers so we can't help but make it funny\nUm but we really are mostly interested in you know what is the character arc of the season what are the themes we're looking to explore what are the consequences of these actions we take it very seriously um\nYou know but then in the middle of that we we remember like All right and this guy's talking octopus\nOr [laughter] you know we're we're exploring familial trauma here uh but also this woman is dating a Amanda\nMemory his his mistakes for him it's a very I mean in a lot of ways I think we write the show like a drama but we're a room full of comedy writers so we can't help but make it funny\nUm but we really are mostly interested in you know what is the character arc of the season what are the themes we're looking to explore what are the consequences of these actions we take it very seriously um\nYou know but then in the middle of that we we remember like All right and this guy's a talking octopus\nOr you know we're we're exploring familial trauma here uh but also this woman is dating or a man that is clearly just a three small boys stacked on top of each other under trench coat like little rascals I'm so [laughter] this is quite serious ah but the stories themselves can be quite silly you know one way I think of it\nIs is we're retelling stories about real grounded characters in a crazy cartoon universe\nLots of animated shows have gotten made over the last Twenty years thanks to the success of The Simpsons largely but not shows as deep and as adult as Beau jak or who to whom do you think you owe your origins in television who do you see is your former [laughter]\nUm oh you mean by influencing yeah or do you mean literally the people who helped me have a television show\nAnd [laughter] no I mean the shows that you watch or or even if you weren't that into them to shows that made it possible for a show like Bo jak to be such a hit with American ... well I\nI think you know obviously the the giants as The Simpsons and I would be disingenuous for me to claim that that show had had no influence on me\nOr my show or the success of my show you know one at one of the best comments I got on the the first season a bow jak if someone said it felt like a season long version of a sad episode of The Simpsons and um but also when I was pitching the show I I really wanted it to exist outside of\nThe bubble um\nThat made it possible for a show like Bo jak to be such a hit with American ... well I I think\nYou know obviously the the giants as The Simpsons and I would be disingenuous for me to claim that that show had had no influence on me\nOr my show or the success of my show you know one at one of the best comments I got on the the first season a bow jak if someone said it felt like a season long version of a sad episode of The Simpsons and um but also when I was pitching the show I I really wanted it to exist\nOutside of the the bubble um\nOr the perceived bubble of animated TV you know I I said ah we're going to ... when we start season one you're going to watch it and the first is going to feel like a typical animated show like a a Simpsons or South Park\nBut then over the course of the season as you realize what's happening is going to feel more like a girls or even a Mad Men um and and so I I wanted this to feel more like a drama the um and to really\nTake things seriously a in a way that people don't expect the animation too even though I think a lot of animated shows actually do take things very seriously\nUm but but but those shows were certainly influences as well\nAt one of the main attractions of your show for me are the amazing voice performances that you have oh yeah well our net as Beau jak and he said they are credible princess Carolyn the sort of aging Hollywood manager producer cat\nUh Internet a lot of others to even have a Keith Olbermann in there at some yeah I'm see them as one of the first people we cast [laughter]\nAnd he was cast her whale\nA newscaster well uh we we had in the script to um you know a guy or a Keith Olbermann whale type and are casting director Lynda Lamont and said I think we can get Keith Olbermann to play this role really and we call them like yeah sounds like fun um and he's fantastic we keep bringing it back season after season and\nA credible artist Carolyn the sort of aging Hollywood manager producer cat ah and and then a lot of others to even have a Keith Olbermann in there at some yeah I'm ... and it's one

first memories of making a show and realizing how fun it was going to be was we had Keith on the phone from New York and we had him do all his lines um and then at the end we said we also get you making some we'll noises\nAnd you know this is Keith Olbermann who I thought of is a very serious man uh goofing around going\nYou know making whale noises and I thought this would be a fun show I think well one of your other\nMain characters is Diane a Vietnamese American voiced by actress Allison Aubrey who is phenomenal now you gave us late interview recently and also a Twitter thread which is which is the way you have to do with these days and you mentioned\nOne ramification of that choice casting Alison breeze Diane that you tend to avoid referencing her Asian American is in the show now deceased and that's changed Diane does take a trip\nTo the Vietnam of her heritage and and talks a lot about how that affects her um how did her casting come about and how did you begin to have second thoughts about it well um we cast\nAh in in the first season and we were about I'm a third of the way into the season when we cast and we've been working a with a different actress um who had to drop out of the show all of a sudden because another show she was on got picked up and there was a contractual issue so she couldn't believe it on our show anymore\nIn the show now this season that's changed Diane does take a trip to the Vietnam of her heritage and and talks a lot about how that affects her um how did her casting come about and how did you begin to have second thoughts about it well um we cast\nAh in in the first season and we were about I'm a third of the way into the season when we cast her we've been working a with a different actress um who had to drop out of the show all of a sudden because another show she was on got picked up and there was a contractual issue so she couldn't be lead on our show any more\nUm and so we really scrambled and Alison came in and we thought she was amazing uh and she's going to a a great job ever since\nUm but more and more uh as I was looking around at at the cast and and thinking about you know how how the show was put together and and and the makeup of the cast it started to dawn on me that\nEveryone in our house was white and our main cast and a lot of\nThe recurring people were we were hiring were white as well and this wasn't an intentional thing uh that I was doing as\nA racist man um it was just I was not paying attention and we were passing these characters one at a time\nUh and I realized that oh this is my I Need to start paying better attention to 'em and so you know since then we've tried due to cast a wider net and look particularly for for diverse voices or try to have more people of color on the show but\nWhen it comes to Dianne specifically um you know I think there is a a real problem in this industry of casting white people in Asian roles and I was not a as aware of that when we first started the show as I Am now and so that's the thing that I Would do differently as casting a white person to play a prominent Asian character\nAnd you know as I said in these other interviews\nCast a

Joshua thanks for it's great to be here how did you get into the cue cards business a while you know I went to uh Syracuse and I wanted to be a writer I majored in writing and moved to New York in a you know my brother was working at CERN eleven times receptionist\nAnd ah they knew that you can't guy so he recommended me even though my printing was terrible and ah ah I got the job and I did I did it just kept my foot in the door and to make writing connections\nAnd uh you know I did I did make some writing connections that I wrote for some cable shows but it was never enough to support myself so I kept under the cue cards and I got really good at doing cue cards very quickly\nAnd ah you know cut to twenty eight twenty nine years later I'm On my own company I've been doing it for that long and running a lot of shows\nSo clearly this was not the kind of writing that you had in mind but what was it about doing the cue cards that you liked\nKnow I I don't know I think one specially on Saturday Night live the live aspect of it and being out there you know as close to the cameras as you can be without being on camera a and helping the act\nYou know I did I did make some writing

about doing the cue cards that you liked\nYou know I I don't know I think one of the specially on Saturday Night live the live aspect of it and being out there you know as close to the cameras as you can be without being on camera\nA and helping the actors and helping the guest stars or through the shows and through this hard show that that you know they'd probably a lot of them have never done live de before there was something very rewarding about that and\nUm I didn't crack under pressure and with the changes and all the stress that was involved with that and that was something that they the show noticed and uh you know everyone was a pretty quickly in the ranks\nTell us a bit about your company what shows does your company do cue cards for\nUh the are four main shows that are that are that tape all year our Saturday Night live\nUm the Tonight Show Jimmy Fallon late night with Seth Meyers and then we do Conan on the west coast as well those are four main shows um and then we

kinds of people do well at this line of work the first thing we look for is neat printing now my penmanship is fairly often um I think that was why when I was on a med school ... years ago people were like yep we've seen your handwriting [laughter] so I Wonder exactly what you're looking for in terms of\nPrinting the cue cards I've seen her all written in all\nYes correct It's you know it's it's a this is it's a it's block lettering it's all caps um it's it's really about\nWork on that as well what kinds of people do well at this line of work the first thing we look for is neat printing\nNow my penmanship is fairly often um I think that was why when I was on a med school ... years ago people were like yep we've seen your handwriting [laughter] so I Wonder exactly what you're looking for in terms of\nPrinting the cue cards I've seen her all written in all\nCaps yes correct It's you know it's it's a this is it's a it's block lettering it's all caps um it's it's really about the spacing between the between the letters and the word in a space in between the words and the space in between the sentences\nIt's not something like I Can't just bring somebody off the street and say okay start doing the guards it's almost like you know you need I Need to train it for like two or three weeks\nI'm just to get them there's so many different little things you have to learn\nUm two or three weeks of training yeah it it 'cause you 'cause it's it's not it's you can't just say you can't just tell them all the rules right you know what I mean I Can't just interviews ... these are all the rules you need to learn memorized these new things come up every time there's new like\nEye is capitalized only in certain words it's not capitalized than during whereas where how to end the card of courage to stand on a period or ... or ... or a comma in if not that you know how to end it so that it flows the next car just so many different rules where you can only learn it by by doing it and practicing it\nWe're speaking to Wally ... and the founder of NYC cue cards the exclusive cue card provider in New York\nOkay so let's say you're working for me for you know the late night with Joshua Johnson right and I come out to do my opening monologue I've just hired your company and I said Wylie I'm really excited to be working for you guys let's start building this relationship\nTell me the kinds of things that you are going to want to know for me to figure out how to be a good cue card vendor for me All right first thing I\nWhere you can only learn it by by doing it in practicing it\nWe're speaking to Wally fairest and the founder of NYC cue cards the exclusive cue card provider in New York\nOkay so let's say you're working for me for you know the late night with Joshua Johnson right and I come out to do my opening monologue I've just hired your company and I said Wylie I'm really excited to be working for you guys let's start building this relationship\nTell me the kinds of things that you are going to want to know for me to figure out\nHow to be a good cue card vendor for me\nAll right first thing I ask you how's your eyesight like near sighted or glasses okay so you were a glasses were your glasses on the show where you are contacts or you're not were either\nI don't really like contacts hourglasses\nOkay so you're wearing glasses so you can see fine I won't have to if you didn't wear glasses and you didn't want to wear contacts I could put your letters bigger so that you can see but that would also make less words and the card and it would make it harder for you to ... to flow to the ... like if you're taught especially if you're telling jokes\nSo I Would recommend glasses or contacts for you if you know if you want to so you're gonna wear glasses you'll be fine reading cards and then I Would just you know we would we would have hearses ride would practice with you if you've never read two cards before that something you'd want to practice\nWhat's the main thing that I Need to think about if I'm reading cue cards from you\nOr look directly at the cue cards don't look away because that'll that'll look like you're reading the cue cards\nHow do you mean it looked as rapidly as well if you were doing a sketch they say you were doing a sketch with your band leader\nAnd I had cue cards near the bad leader and positioned in a way that you would want to play to those cue cards now if you were looking at the cue cards and then at the bandleader going back and forth between the card in the bed later the audience would be like oh he's obviously reading something\nBut if you just played those cue cards it would look on camera like you were talking directly to that person I'm ... directly above the camera above the camera above the cameras\nBecause it'll that look like you're reading the cue cards\nHow do you mean it looked as regularly as well if you were doing a sketch they say you were doing a sketch with your band leader\nAnd I had cue cards near the bad leader and positioned in a way that you would want to play to those cue cards now if you were looking at the cue cards and then at the bandleader going back and forth between the car to the bed later the audience would be like oh he's obviously reading something\nBut if you just played those cue cards it would look on camera like you were talking directly to that person I'm ... directly above the camera above the camera above the camera so yeah so I'll I Will open depending on where you are in position to the camera\nI'll make the cards the right the lettering the right side so that you look directly at that card it looks like you're looking right into the camera\nShow your cue card holders are kind of part of the technical direction the blocking of a scene in terms of figuring out where the performers need to look to look proper\nThat's exactly right especially with Saturday Night live that's what I that's my main job but I'm there on Thursdays from Fridays that's all we do all day is block sketches and I'll be out there with one set of cards working with the actor's working with the host figuring out where I'm going to put\nThe cards and I work with the director of the stage managers wild well kind of can for and I think I think I Need the cards here and then I'll ask the actors if they need an extra set somewhere else where I maybe didn't think of just want to make sure that they're covered where they're from comfortable\nSince you mentioned Saturday Night live what does a typical work week at SNL looked like for someone who's doing cue cards for that show do you just come in Saturday afternoon and scribble furiously unfilled eleven thirty five PM\nWish it were that a simple [laughter] now we we start on Thursday we start rehearsals on Thursday and Thursdays a light day\nSo the music the musical group ... for the first half of the day and then we'll ... we'll be in there about noon and will print well rehearsed maybe like three or four sketches and will only put one one set of each sketch\nFrom comfortable since you mentioned Saturday Night live what does a typical work week at SNL looked like for someone

maybe like three or four sketches and will only put one one set of each sketch because I have to figure out how many sets we need so there's no reason to print more\nAnd it it will change from Thursday the sketches we do on Thursday we'll go through a rewrite session on Thursday night and most most of the time will be completely rewritten from Thursday and friday\nAnd then friday is the same process except we do about eight or nine sketches same process reprint put that on friday we have to do we have to make copies we call it ... the cards so it makes sense and then we I mean that we do that we don't have the without the luxury of waiting until Saturday to dupe the friday sketches because senators show day\nSo everything's print that I have about eight people there on friday just yeah basically writing all day I have the fun job I'm Out on the set blocking working with the actors having fun they're sitting underneath the bleachers from eleven o'clock to uh sometimes you know twelve or one o'clock in the morning just printing cards so long it's a long day for them\nWhat kind of person would want to take that kind of a job it doesn't sound like a very glamorous way to
