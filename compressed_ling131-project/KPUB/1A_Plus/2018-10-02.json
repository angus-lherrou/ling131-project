to to stay silent\nOn my own experience can you share with us to whatever extent you feel comfortable what happened to you\nSure so um it was over a decade ago I was in college and um you know I I was at a party with a boy at who I'd had a crush on I guess for a long time I think um we both had um an interesting one another and\nWhen you drink a lot I was you know Twenty years old at the time um and he drink more than I did ah one thing led to another and we uh ended up back in his place and and we were having sex and that sex was consensual although I Would say that um it was\nA rougher frankly then I Would have expected it kind of took me by surprise\nAnd um you know suddenly all of a sudden we were actually having anal sex which I had not consented to\n'em and it was very painful and I I'm often to stop and eventually did I mean it felt like a lot longer for me at the time but frankly I'm you know I think ... frankly it was probably too drunk to got to know what was going on is what what\nThat um it was a rougher frankly than I Would have expected it kind of took me by surprise\nAnd um you know suddenly all of a sudden we were actually having anal sex which I had not consented to 'em and it was very painful and I\nI'm often to stop and and he eventually did I mean it felt like a lot longer for me at the time but frankly I'm you know I think ... frankly was probably too drunk to got to know what was going on is what what I thought the time and you know afterwards I dated him and I think\nNow I Know that that's a very common experience but\nYou know at the time there was no nationwide conversation about these things so you really didn't realize how common that is and so I think I felt so much shame um in what had happened that I I just you know stayed silent about it until a couple of years later when I started talking to some friends\nAnd you know kind of realizing owning that experience for what it was um which which is really what helped me move on\nLast week professor Conan the Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont asked professor Ford what her strongest memory was of what she accuses judge Brett Kavanaugh of having done to her

he's going to kill her\nAnd the human brain has specific parts that are involved too in code fear and if you just think about it I'm\nI'm that's because fear especially in prehistoric times kept us alive um you don't want to see a lion and have to think oh is that dangerous or not should I run away you when people who can encode that ... that fear about lying and immediately react well escape and survive so I'm\nSimilarly and fear memories I'm like the memory of an assault on\nThe brain becomes hyper focused on specific details so it's really common to remember perhaps the color of the person's eyes or sound or the music or like Dr Ford says the laughter because that I'm even just hearing her talk about it really makes my heart clutch you know it's really emotional\nUm but forget other details like uh the house you were in or the neighborhood or the street um those aren't those are irrelevant in the moment the assault is happening um so I Hope that sort of helps explain it but

years in therapy and not necessarily certainly not just because of of my assault or it was one of the things of many that that I dealt with but\nI have been so struck by by the number of friends and colleagues and acquaintances who have reached out to me after I shared my story\nAnd you know sharing things they haven't told anyone before\nI was molested I was raped I you know it goes on and on and on and I really am also a huge fan of brain brown due to social researcher yeah shame and vulnerability right and I I and I have become a huge believer that shame needs secrecy to survive\nI'm and huge part of the reason I decided to share my story is selfish it's because I\nYou know I don't believe anymore or that the shame that I'd been carrying around should have ever been my own shame and so in telling my story you know I I was I feel huge sense of relief I was able to to this\nA huge fan of brain brown due to social research or you know that he shame and vulnerability right and I I

that the shame that I've been carrying around should have ever been my own shame\nAnd so in telling my story you know I I was I feel huge sense of relief I was able to to discharge that I'm into the public arena where I Believe that belongs 'em and no longer hold onto that I feel\nFreer I feel lighter and hearing from others who haven't been able to kind of go there yet they don't have to write a piece of how they can share it with a friend\nOr family member but hearing from them I I Believe that I I did the right thing at least for me because I'm the thing that I'm most emotional about now is not my own experience it's knowing how many of the people I Love and care about\nAnd know are in you know the kind of pain they're carrying around and that uh I guess for me that's where\nWho I Am as a journalist meets who I Am and my experiences as a human because I just it makes me very angry um and it it really watching you know watching Brett Kavanaugh for me and for a lot of us was kind of\nThe embodiment of that injustice and that's that's where I think you know the real power in and sharing our stories and power numbers comes from\nLawrence I just wanted to um\nThat speak to what this what lives shared about her experience there are very honorable\nI just it makes me very angry um and it it really watching you know watching Brett Kavanaugh for me and for a lot of us was kind

U. dot org let me start\nWith the book this alliance between astrophysics and the military and give us a sense of what that is\nIn a nutshell and why it is as the title of your book suggests so unspoken\nYeah so so we already are familiar with the role that other scientists have played in warfare especially engineering you know somebody had to invent the catapult when that was first showed up on the battlefield what an asymmetric weapon that would have been a symmetric in the military sense where\nYour opponent has something that you don't have and you were in deep trouble because of that difference\nAnd so that they call it an asymmetric advantage so engineers definitely and if you look at the new book of of Leonardo da Vinci where yeah he did art but he also was a mastermind that sort of military machines that could lay waste to your army\nSo and we know him as one of the greatest combinations of its scientist engineer and an artist but moving forward you think of the physicist as a person who builds the bomb right that was well known in the during the Cold War especially\nWe also know the ... you know would make chemicals like napalm and things like that going back to the first World War where they were you know flood the field with mustard gas\nAt the biologist might weaponize anthrax for example the astrophysicist ... ... you may know such association\nBecause we just humbly sit at mountaintops and wait for photons to arrive from across the galaxy and then we carefully takes a detector into the coffee lounges and debate what we saw so that connection is not obvious\nRight that was well known in the during the Cold War especially\nWe also know that can is that you know wouldn't make chemicals like napalm and things like that going back to the first World War where they were you know flood the field with mustard gas and the biologist might weaponize anthrax for example the astrophysicist ... ... you may know such association\nBecause we just humbly sit at mountaintops and wait for photons to arrive from across the galaxy\nAnd then we carefully takes a detector into the coffee lounges and debate what we saw\nSo that connection is not obvious and so when I say the unspoken alliance between astrophysics in the military it just never shows up but in fact astrophysicist and then the earlier days are strong numbers have been fundamental to the growth of empires and the Gemini of nations\nIn particular the the need to navigate with precision around the world ... my my professional ancestors no new the night sky\nAnd to to know the night sky and on any level is to give you better advantage for navigating earth's surface\nBecause the sky what's different depending on where you are on earth and things rise at different times and sat in different places\nAnd so if you knew this you can know where you're headed where you're coming from where we're the trade winds are where the hospitals are where the Friendly's are and all of this can be established and there's no end of examples where this kind of information was exploited for the game of the nation who had control over it\nI should know we

transportation on our commerce\nYou order something from Amazon it's on your steps the next morning some airplane delivered it they're right or at least to the nearest airport [laughter]\n... doorstep delivery by a airborne craft is still to come but\nWe would call them drones I guess [laughter] but so so you you ... when you look at this problem you say All right a war what are you going to do about it and I said well might we separate the concerns of the air with the concerns or space because these are the same companies\nAerospace companies that that became a word right and if you separated out in the military you would then sort of\nTidy the budgeting for what the needs are and you wouldn't have to compete within under one umbrella for very different needs\nUm at the time on this commission there was a four star air force general\nAnd the air force then and now controls space activities of the military it's called the U.S air force base command and they said we think we got this we don't really need a space where it's separate from what's already happening so I wasn't going to second guess the general but I was intrigued by that confidence that he had\nFast forward to today on the Trump announcement as well as the pants follow on announcement\nA bit if you just listened to it it sounded very very sort of macho look how big my biceps is as I speak\nForce general

ad thing though I mean if the U.S has supremacy had Gemini over space our aims you know as a western power might be a little more benevolent than seeing the aims of China or Russia or North Korea\nYeah sure I'm just saying one could have ... said exactly the same thing using slightly different words and it would have been less spooky to people who fear the future of what could happen if you quote militarized space as I was really represent rhetoric not reality reality is\nA space for us what would that mean you would just take all the space activities that are already happening under the air force\nAnd slide them out under one umbrella one sort of coherent umbrella\nAnd if you're going to do that uh I I Would throw in you know asteroid defense right why don't you you know put that

you convey that uh I don't know if it's a slam dunk but at least it's a um\nIt's a shot from inside the paint [laughter] want to stay in basketball analogy\nJay tweeted which do you think will happen first transplanting a human brain into a machine chassis I eat a robot body transplanting a human consciousness into a computer\nAh so first of the human mind is really messed up we have a lot of evolutionary baggage that prevents us from making rational decisions as also we do some very beautiful things are art and music and the sort of thing\nTo put a human brain into a robotic chassis um when you could program the robotic chassis to have almost anything you really care about I don't see that as as as a thing that people will do and the other option was what to put put to to put our consciousness I live I think that'll happen either\nYeah well we don't really know what consciousness is\nA evidence of that is how many books are still written on it that evidence that usually you don't know what it is for example if you look on the shelf of books on gravity there's like three books we got grabbed me [laughter]\nWe're not still writing books on its alone at the law yeah obey gravity so um but it is sort of uploading all of your electro chemical impulses into some machine to ... minutes\nThat will do and the other option was what to put put to to put our consciousness I tell you I think that'll happen either\nYeah well we don't really know what consciousness is\nAn evidence of that is how many books are still written on it that evidence that usually you don't know what it is for example if you look on the shelf of of books on gravity there's like three books we got gravity [laughter]\nWe're not still writing books on its alone at the law you obey gravity so um but it is sort of uploading all of your electro chemical impulses into some machine to mimic that\nTo mirror that maybe that comes along with consciousness we don't know but I see that happening long before we would take a brain and stick it in a in a machine by the way speaking of transplanting brain what I really want is if we can't if we can't cure Alzheimer's and we can't cure a oh last\nAt least find a way to transplant the brain of an Alzheimer's patient into the body of I'm\nI'm not sorry the brain of an a or less patient into the body\nOf an Alzheimer's patient and they get a full person out of that because one you you lose the body other you lose your your mind that this sounds very altered carbon even wants to allow to Netflix them it's very Frankenstein too is really what I just said if you had goals if you can't otherwise I I bet we'll find tears for both of those before we learn how to transplant a brain\nBut I think about that all the time certainly helps him certainly helps though\nIs on wants to know do you believe in aliens\nThat's not a matter of belief is that there's no evidence for life off the earth yet but we haven't looked very far or very much I'm Jill Tarter is one of my favorite quotes from hers is if you go to the ocean and you stick a class in and your scoop out some water and they analyze of water really carefully and say\nThey're no whales in the ocean looking [laughter]\nNo you haven't looked so we've only taken a tiny scoop out of the galaxy and our search for life are intelligent\nThe time certainly helps them certainly hope so and wants to know do you believe in aliens\nThat's not a matter of belief is this there's no evidence for life off the earth yet but we haven't looked very far or very much I'm Jill Tarter is one of my favorite quotes from hers is if you you go to the ocean and you stick a class in and scoop out some water and they analyzed the water really carefully inside\nThere no whales in the ocean [laughter] looking [laughter]\nNo you haven't looked the ... so we've only taken a tiny scoop out of the galaxy in our search for life\nAre intelligent life uh for example uh um what we think of as intelligent life or any life at all in our backyard or or Mars and perhaps other places but anyone who studied the problem is\nIn no way doubts the strong likelihood that there's life elsewhere in the galaxy and the universe is possibly teeming with it\nAmy asked on our Facebook page will the human race cease to exist in the next thousand years based on the current environmental trends now considering a possible impact from an asteroid or other cosmic influence [noise]\nWe're pretty sure that nothing extinction level is headed our way that would take us out in the next thousand years and we know that because the more dangerous and asteroid is the bigger it is typically and the bigger it is the easier it is to detect\nSo so ah I I think we're good about that it's possible that a
