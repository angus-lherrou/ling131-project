A. M. U. dot org we've been hearing from so many of you Elizabeth tweets why is the minimum wage a specific amount instead of a percentage tied to cost of living or some other figure measured\nAnd adjusted annually and we'll emails us from Cape Cod I have a small landscaping in gardening business with depending on the time of year six to ten employees all skilled gardeners\nI pay at least Eighteen dollars an hour and I support a higher minimum wage we're going to be talking about minimum wage and a living wage let's have Paul San I set the table for it's a little bit Paul the federal minimum wage\nIs just seven twenty five less than half of what Amazon is paying and what you can make in California starting in twenty twenty two hasn't been raised by Congress since two thousand and nine and its last ten percent of its purchasing power or even since two thousand nine how many states hew to the seven twenty five federal minimum\n... there are about Twenty one states where the uh minimum wage is just seven twenty five um and then there's another group of about eight states where it's the wages is a little higher but still owe a nine dollars are lower\nUm but but uh the other ... you know there's other Twenty one states have um a you know stopped waiting for Congress to act and have have raised the minimum wage including a whole cluster of them that are raising it significantly to the twelve to Fifteen dollar an hour range\nOne of the the key things on the minimum wage to understand is you know it's a it's been because of of the role of money in politics and you know the congressional Republican leadership through\nOne of the the key things on the minimum wage to understand is you know it's a it's been because of of the role of money in politics and you know the congressional Republican leaderships refusal to um to to to allow any action on it um it's really become irrelevant at the federal level it's so low it's not doing its job to re of raising pay\nAnd this is a real issue right now you know to get receiving increasing attention um you know we're in a booming economy jobs are growing but there's almost no wage growth jobs are barely keeping up with rice the rising cost of living the one place where we're seeing wage growth workers at the bottom are in those states that are raising the minimum wage and that\nThat actually speaks to the point the important point that Mr Saltsman in the caller raised about hey you know if some companies are raising pay may do we need a minimum wage\nBut the the data shows that while there are some leaders to really raise the floor insert improve improve improve pay and our economy we need we need fair standards and the minimum wage has to be a lot higher and\nThe um you know things have gotten so out of whack that today close to one in three Americans\nAre earns less than Fifteen dollars an hour that some you know forty million workers the median age is thirty is thirty five\nYou know these are overwhelmingly adults who spend their careers in these jobs and it's you know it's it's not it's fast food but not just fast food jobs you know the jobs to make our economy run about you know one wanted for health care workers one in five educators you know\nHuge swaths of our economy of of our workforce are stuck in these jobs paying less than Fifteen dollars an hour\n... I I think it says a lot when you say that the minimum wages is laid down by Congress is almost irrelevant to the real economy because seven dollars and twenty five cents [noise]\nJust doesn't go anywhere or in most states in most localities and yet to have Congress advocating laws that are essentially irrelevant to how people really live a is a remarkable and and notable\nAnd yet to have Congress advocating laws that are essentially irrelevant to how people really live\nA is a remarkable and ... and notable state of affairs in us or Europe proponent of a living wage and I and I read that tweet from one of our listeners who said why have a minimum wage why not indexing essential each or real life now what is the difference between a minimum wage and and what's become known as a living wage\nRight well MIT has a living wage calculator where you can go on there and type in where you live and it'll be a lotta number that's based on looking at the\nCost of local transportation food housing and other basic needs I looked up on the city I live in the district of Columbia they said uh the living wage there I was Seventeen dollars an hour but that's for a full time work\nAnd I want to point out that a huge ... additional problem in addition to the low wages in this country is the increase in security of work how many people are working part time at Walmart it's half\nOf their employees are part time workers and then there's the temporary workers and the subcontracted workers you know Amazon Fifteen dollars an hour is not going to apply to their\nA contractor says the increase ... precarious nest of work that that's also a big problem eat despite are low unemployment we still have so many people working every day for poverty wages\nI'm Paul even though Fifteen dollars an hour is twice the current federal minimum as you mentioned we heard from a lot of listeners who say in this economic climate or even Fifteen doesn't go very far from some of them\nWhen all is higher than the minimum wage to try to listen for workers but when they were to catch up on a ... a minimum wage that's never know\nAnd as a college graduate with a bachelor's degree and student loans I already\nA minimum wage and I never know\nAnd as a college graduate with a bachelor's degree and student loans I already make Fifteen dollars an hour at a fulltime job and have to supplement with at least one part time job at all times\nI think there needs to be some consideration on regional differences because I can assure you that Fifteen dollars an hour in South Carolina goes much further than Fifteen dollars an hour in California\nI work another job my full time job and uh so I Am kind of like ... by unfortunately I have lots of credit card debt and the result and uh actually like Eighteen dollars going out at twenty four a fulltime job what probably closer to say Bye bye\nPaul we hear from a lot of listeners there who are living on minimum wage and for many many more this has been a big issue in Congress a workers who work for big companies can't afford healthcare don't have insurance wind up relying on state or federal public assistance\nTo make up the difference and that suggests that all of us in some way are subsidizing low wages\nKnow you're you're exactly right and and as or your callers I mean\nActually if you look at cost of living data you see that in all fifty states\nI'm a single worker will need at least Fifteen dollars an hour to cover the basics and just a couple of years\nAnd in the high cost states the your your your listeners were flogging or workers with children will need even more than Fifteen dollars an hour we have a report on our website by my uh pinto PIN Tio on this with the with the numbers for all fifty states and uh\nIt really highlights how Fifteen is really a basic national floor and we need to even go up from there like a you know you know in New York and New Jersey did this week we're airport workers are getting a raise to Nineteen dollars an hour in hotel workers are are striking around the ...\nYou know in New York New Jersey did this week we're airport workers are getting a raise to Nineteen dollars an hour\nIn hotel workers are are striking around the country in the higher costs that he's demanding twenty five dollars an hour or so you know your workers or your your listeners are right about about about what you know as a practical matter if you do the math what would it individuals need to to to get by especially in the higher cost regions\nAnd as a result you know a lot of ... of of companies big and small are relying on our taxpayer funded safety net for support you know more than a hundred and fifty billion dollars a year of safety net programs go to a workers in low paying jobs and you know these are good programs and we should have them but we need\nYou know major employers to do their part to pay a decent wage of at least Fifteen dollars an hour and then to supplement that with a with work supports in order to help bring\nBring workers up to a a a basic level now let's hear some of the other side of the Seth writes to us on Facebook when I worked for Walmart we were all excited when they raised our wages to ten dollars and fifty cents\nBut then they cut ours to barely twenty hours a week then told us if we even had to have an open schedule we would get even less I'm skeptical of individual companies\nThat are raising wages and we received also a lot of calls from people who were concerned that raising the federal minimum wage to say Fifteen dollars an hour could wind up backfiring on workers\nI'm all for making you know Fifteen dollars an hour at the job on that now I work at it or you can get in the mall but I find that a lot of people\nFrom Arizona Public

Washington DC where we happen to be in a one eight studios at WAMC you enter the world [laughter] unfortunately increasingly so but there has been a very important wage fight going on on the local level not in Washington is a world knows it but D.C as locals know\nThere was a ballot initiative where voters in DC voted to raise the minimum wage\nFor tipped workers a bar backs bartenders waiters and waitresses people who work in restaurants primarily\nAnd there was a big fight a lot of pushback it looks like grassroots resistance and then we found out that a lot of the money for the pushback was indeed coming from organizing interests for restaurant owners of the American restaurant association local chapters and others\nUm voters voted to say yes you have to raise your minimum wage restaurants bars\nAnd now the city council here in the district of Columbia has decided that voters were wrong and they are in the process of voting\nThis very day to overturn the will of local D.C voters on this issue or what does this fight here in D.C say about the state of wages especially for ticked workers people who might get paid by their employer I don't know five bucks an hour because they make up the rest in in ones and hopefully five\nMhm no way I see it this week the living wage movement to three or four steps forward with the Amazon announcement on Fifteen and they ...\n[noise] the way I see it this week the living wage movement took three or four steps forward with the Amazon announcement on Fifteen\nAnd they took one big step back with the DC Council voting to repeal um the the will of the voters to eliminate and in a gradual way this sub minimum wage for tipped workers\nUm federally than minimum wage protects workers is two dollars and Thirteen cents it's been stuck there for a couple of decades here in DC it's three dollars and eighty nine cents technically if you don't make enough tips to bring that a wage up to the the um the local minimum\nYour employer is supposed to make up the difference\nThat pretty much never happens I used to work in the restaurant industry and I've talked to a lot of restaurant workers that pretty much never happens and so we have a workforce of restaurant servers primarily women many women of color\nOr at a job where people face ramping sexual harassment they're vulnerable because they're having to do whatever customers say to get those tips because without the tips they're back down to really a A N E L a wage that doesn't amount to anything so\nPeople in the district um voted to get rid of this two tier system um the industry launched an incredible campaign against it they put posters up everywhere in the city saying save our tips to try to make people think that the said something to do with banning tips\nIt did not it was clearly be beyond a local issue this was a national showdown between the restaurant industry and people who are trying to get a fair wage for this vulnerable sector of the workforce\nOr Michael Saltsman what did you see at play here I think we're familiar with workers versus management in a fight like this are the DC Council voting to overturn what were the voters who is remarkable but what about the economics of it will actually\nLike this uh the DC Council voting to overturn the will of the voters is is remarkable but what about the economics of it well actually so I I think\nIn this case you had a situation where the interests of workers and management were actually very clearly aligned I mean there was a sixteen hour hearing\nBefore the council voted on this this bill to repeal the initiative initiative Seventy seven I'm I was at the hearing I testified at two thirty in the morning it went until three twenty in the morning um and the number of employees who showed up to say this is going to be harmful to us you need to repeal this far outnumber those who are there to support it\nAnd I just want to take a step back to I mean it was mentioned earlier that a living wage in in DC is is is Seventeen dollars an hour I mean tipped employees in D.C\nAccording to the bureau of Labor Statistics are in with their tips about Eighteen Nineteen dollars an hour or so you have people who are already doing quite well in what happened a few years ago as a business and labor in DC came together and said okay we're we want to go to a Fifteen dollar minimum wage and regardless of what you think on the merits of that\nWe're also going to raise the tips may win among wage in that case up to about five dollars an hour and and they did that because they heard from tipped employees who said we want to keep the tip credit we want our tips to count as income\nThere was one group of New York based group called rock that didn't like that and so they they came in and they had a lot of money that come in to try and put this issue\nOn the ballot and what happened was yes the restaurant industry um was opposed to this ballot measure but you had a massive grassroots outpouring from employees hundreds of who showed up for instance to an event with council chairman Phil Mendelson to say\nWe don't want this and I think it's part of a bigger movement of employees that you say you say grass roots and I'm I'm sure that\nYou're right but grass roots are astro turf we see so much grass roots in the area of wages in minimum wage is only to find out that the grassroots workers who are fighting against increases in wages are are backed by business interests so actually I I think it's I think that that talking point I think that's been used by proposing\nWorkers who are fighting against increases in wages are are backed by business center\nWell so actually I I think it's I think that that talking point I think that's been used by proponents is is is a little bit um demeaning to the workers who who came forward um because of the the testimony they gave it you know one forty five in the morning or the people who got up or at Franklin hall and said you know what this is going to be harmful to me this is going to be harmful to my industry\nDon't try and save me I'm not asking for it I mean I think that the the the the notion I think that these people are just doing that um because they're sort of put up to it somehow that they're not real employees\nUm I I think it's kind of insulting to what they're trying to do and still Mendelson chairman Phil Mendelson the chair of the DC Council made an interesting point um when he got to talk about this which is that he said\nI have heard from countless employees who tell me this is not good for them I have heard from almost nobody who wants who wants to keep it and he said people can come to me privately they can email me this is not an issue of their owners being intimidated\nHe said that the grassroots on this in support of it was silent he called them the silent grassroots and I think that's that's indicative of where the passion was on this issue let's pull\nFrom the district the district of Columbia the local D.C back out to the nation at large and so many of you won a listeners\nHad been reaching out to us Nina posts on Facebook I'm In a precarious position if my wages go up I won't be eligible for Medicaid so it's a wash or worst for me we talked about free riders and how many workers who get minimum wages wind up on public assistance\nAnd Randy in Tulsa emails advocates are correct Amazon Walmart McDonalds and the other giants can afford Fifteen dollars for a minimum wage but the local donut shop the mom and pop florist those businesses will be hurt it's just another blow against main street\nNow Sara I Want to talk to you about income inequality and wear a minimum wage fits into this we hear so much about the growing\nNo sir I Want to talk to you about income inequality and we're minimum wage fits into this we hear so much about the growing wealth gap in massive income inequality in this country we talk about the shrinking of the middle class but at the low end of the pay scale can increases in minimum wage actually provide\nAny real equity or is it just a drop in the bucket in a world where the top one percent on fifty percent of\nIts meaningful but in some ways it as a drop in the bucket you know a couple of years ago two of my colleagues calculated that three men the three wealthiest men in America including Amazon CEO Jeff Bass though it's Warren Buffett and Bill Gates have combined wealth that his graders and the combined wealth of the bottom half of the country\nAnd today that's an understatement because Japanese as well as increased so much but nevertheless to dramatize is just how extreme the wealth gap is and I think there's a lot of interest in\n'em adding to the fight for Fifteen efforts to look not just that the low end of the wage scale but also the top and what can we do to prevent these really obscene levels of income and wealth concentration at the top that are\nSo damaging to our economy our democracy not to mention just a moral outrage and in a country that that is so wealthy\nAnd so I'm really excited about a new tool we have for doing this this year for the first time in history publicly held companies have to report the gap between their CEO and their worker pay\nThe numbers coming out are staggering at Walmart it's a thousand to one at at McDonalds it's three thousand to one and we can build on that information to incentivize companies to to narrow there gaps and just one quick example Portland, Oregon\nIntroduced the world's first tax penalty on companies that pay

A. M. U. dot org and we had been hearing from so many of you want to listeners primarily women\nBut not exclusively Petra emailed to say I am so tired of people equating my anger within sanity\nFriends laugh at my posted insinuate that I've lost it and you know what I have I have lost my inability to be quiet in the face of gross injustice\nAnd Joan emailed us I'm sixty five and I was in college with the first feminist resurgence is the world the usa ready for women's anger that's like asking African Americans when will the world be ready for their anger the answer never\nPower doesn't seed without a fight don't even ask the question the question itself\nIs demanding and peg in Traverse City emailed this on a conservative woman that is angry that someone could be assumed guilty based on unproven allegations I'm angry at the assumption that all American women or antique having a pro choice liberal and progressive I'm a proud American woman who is also a conservative pro life pro Cavanaugh\nI Am an American woman to\nNow Rebecca Traister you started to paint a picture of the history of women who've gotten angry and made their mark their anger is not always shown in the same form as somebody yelling in the face of a senator like Jeff Flake on live TV but anger nonetheless and Brittany Cooper you've written a book\nAbout finding your power in rage uh tell me a little bit about that theme and how this story fits into the moment\n[noise] a shore so part of what happens is that women are told as many of your listeners say that to be angry it's to be irrational\nUm and I had a student when I was a graduate instructor brought me um\nYou're a listener say that to be angry it's to be irrational\nUm and I had a student when I was a graduate instructor confront me um and said to me that she loved to listen to me lecture because my lectures were filled with what she called the most eloquent rage ever and it was a wakeup call for me as someone who had run away from the angry black woman stereotype my whole life\nBecause I didn't want to be discredited as a black woman moving through predominantly white institutions\nAnd so my student who was a young black woman saw and be a kind\nOf authenticity and she helped me to realize that my anger wasn't keeping me from doing my job or showing up are offering\nQuality lectures are material or material but then it was actually helping me to do a better job and so in that moment I made a connection that I've been encouraging other women to make which is to acknowledge that we have the right to outrage and some reject ideas that say that when we're angry about legitimate injustices\nThat this in some way makes us irrational or makes our claims illegitimate\nAnd when we then begin to own that anger doesn't mean that we would come destructive or harmful it means that we happened to the energy and power and we start to use that energy and power to build the kind of world we want to see 'em and more women need to give themselves permission to do that\nI've given myself permission to do that I'm at in this moment I Am on the front lines of saying to women outrage have the potential if we own it and if we don't apologize for us to change this very scary our trajectory of this historical moment we have a lot to be afraid about\nA we have a lot to be angry about uh but that anger is the catalyst for us to be able to do something about the things we see\nNow let's move from the Senate committee hearing room and the hallways around the Senate um and even the books that are steamed authors have written onto the tennis court and the U.S open\nFrom the Senate committee hearing room or in the hallways around the Senate um and even the books that are esteemed authors have written onto the tennis court and the U.S open for another moment that American shared within the last couple of weeks\nSerena Williams in her match against Naomi Osaka at the U.S open here's a cut I'll bring you back there to refresher memory of anger on the court Serena Williams infamous exchange with umpire Carlos Ramos\n[noise]\nSuresh I'm Shawnee you shared this moment along with the rest of America us arena is a champion and one of the most famous black women in America somebody who got angry and somebody found who found that anger or weaponized against her\nAh yes I think that what we saw in their response was everything that Brittany in Tribeca and I have been talking about it was interesting because\nThere are so many egregious examples of men behaving in the same way but not facing the same policing or penalties mean she she was a defined that was levied against her is the highest ever for verbal abuse in the history of the u._s. open I Believe\nAnd so in that moment there were two very distinct response as if the responses of the people that really just wanted to see her in isolation acting um\nIn in this exchange with this man but then there were people who really looked at that exchange within the much broader context of the power dynamics and the moment and the history in the context and the legacy of discrimination within the sport that she has faced\nAnd so I think that one thing that has been unexplored\nThe context and the legacy of discrimination within the sport that she has faced and so I think that one thing that has been unexplored in the bigger conversation about that is the central and pivotal role of title nine in understanding women as\nLeaders or as people who have the right to defend themselves or engage in public conflict um what she was really doing was I'm asserting her right to defend herself and to have dignity in the moment\nBe accused the way that she was accused and with sports I think it's important to note that we now have not one but two generations of women so a generation of role models who have benefited from title nine and the lessons of title nine we ... we tend to think of it as\nA athletics but it is really about leadership and the ability to act together um in teams to manage conflict to make the nuance distinctions between being assertive and being aggression and be aggressive and being angry\nI think we're seeing the ... of of that now in our political live\nThere were some pushback though to Serena Williams behavior on the court and the reaction to it even from within the tennis world a Brittany Cooper I don't know if you saw Martina Navratilova as response to this arena Williams episode a couple of days later but she wrote an op ed after the U.S open and she said Martina speaking now\nSaid yes women are treated differently yes there are double standards but Serino was wrong her encore behavior was inappropriate and I'm paraphrasing just because men raging umpires and act like babies on the court doesn't make it right and a champion Serena should not emulate it\nI'm Martina Navratilova was wrong or she did this thing that women are conditioned to do which is rather than use it as a moment of solidarity\n... was wrong or she did this thing that women are conditioned to do which is rather than use it as a moment of solidarity she tried to police arenas conduct\nAs a lifelong tennis fan I'm I Am livid but Martina Navratilova reminded me but up until this moment most white women in tennis have not been allies of the Williams sisters\nUm ... when I watch tennis with my friends who are African American tennis fan we often talk about watching these matches on you because of the micro aggressions that come from white women who are often ... at the Williams sisters in having things to say but let me also add\nThat one of the things that was most infuriating about watching the way in which Ramos treated Serena\nWas that there was a broader context to her anger not only did he accused her of cheating but this also came out on the heels of reports that members of the USPA had been showing up to her house\nUnannounced and testing her over and over again on grounds that maybe she was doping even though she has come up clean on every drug tested even those statistics show that they were testing her double the amount that they were testing any other players on the women's side and so she had been subjected to repeated indignities\nI'm Out in young the delightful new novel the mermaid and this is Hancock center is on the fascination Eighteenth century England had is that they absolutely believe to be money back then\nThe great ... kind of it you could explore the ocean you kind of ... and that could be human willing to do something you know the next time hearing

Own foundation dot org\n[noise] on the odds were like sitting in for Joshua Johnson we're talking about the power of women's anger in the current moment in America\nWhere I'm Talking with Rebecca Traister for New York magazine and the ... author of good in mad Britney Cooper associate professor at Rutgers University and author of the new book eloquent rage\nAnd also ... director of the women's media center speech project and author of the new book rage becomes her now I read an email from Karen at the end of the last segment that said she was hurt disappointed and angry wounded about the treatment of Hillary Clinton and the twenty sixteen campaign\nAnd I want to go there because Hillary Clinton is one prominent famous woman well known for navigating the shoals at how women are supposed to express themselves in public now Hillary Clinton has\nA history of being very careful and very deliberate mindful of appearing angry or emotional she's been at it for thirty five years in America\nAnd in fact it was news in the two thousand and eight campaign I remember this when she shed a tear in New Hampshire one tier and it was at the top of\nCNN for like a new cycle and a half\nSo now a lot of people are saying that the twenty sixteen presidential campaign I'm Hillary Clinton in fact was was toned police listen\nI regret deeply\nHow angry tone of the campaign became [noise]\nNot\nYour fault says one audience member when when Hillary Clinton very deliberately in that in Hillary fashion says I regret how nasty the campaign became um ... just this moment has clearly struck a chord Rebecca Traister who's laughing here in Studio ...\nAs I regret how nasty the campaign became I'm ... I'm only does this moment has clearly struck a chord Rebecca Traister who's laughing here in the studio with me but how does that strike you know she was off as she she was very very careful in her choice of words there to even as she was commenting on it I mean\nI think it was um it was ridiculous that this woman was called inauthentic while being held to the standard\nOf care full control in her voice and her facial the parents and her body\nAnd her motive expression I mean the two candidates um that were her primary\nOpponents but Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders could act in unhinged ways they could show up looking unkempt they ... pound ...\nYou know they could turn red in the face and as men they could leverage this enormous tide of populist anger and that was a gender card nobody wrote about that as a gender card right there were all of these conversations about\nI'm Hillary Clinton as there often are with women because we associate gender with women and pretend men don't have a gender\nUm and and so they could do that and she couldn't leverage that political power and we saw that over and over and over again throughout the campaign\nRecord ... is so right about this and I'm In fact the thing that the irony of what we were told about Hillary Clinton both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump or congratulated by the political pressed for their particular skill and channeling the anger of their supporters this was their gift they were able to give voice to this frustration\nAnd we were repeatedly told that some of the authenticity of Hillary was that she couldn't convey anger and passion and yet every time she spoke too close to a microphone somebody said you're yelling your shrill um she really got directives at one point Joe Scarborough she was giving an ex uh a speech the nights you want to\n... somebody said you're yelling your shrill um she really got directives at one point Joe Scarborough she was giving an ex a speech the night she won a primary and Joe Scarborough said smile is if it was like some cat color on the street smile more um she was told that regularly\nAnd I think that that's again an example of of not having that tool to wield she also has done remarkable writing and talking herself\nIn instances where I've interviewed her and she's written about it in our own memory of the campaign about the process of not using that anger she writes particularly about that second debate where Donald Trump came up behind her and kind of loomed behind her\nAnd how menacing and aggressive his body language was and how during\nThe debate a presidential debate she was doing internal calculations thinking can I turn around and confront this guy she said she thought about turning around and saying get away from me but that she was thinking no no no\nThat's gonna redound negatively to me that's gonna make me look bad it's gonna hurt me strategically and the debate and so she didn't and one of the things that that little story tells us is about\nHow much energy women expend modulating considering strategizing thinking tactically about\nHow to use their voice how to suppress their voice how to channel their anger how to swallow their anger what to do in order to be rhetorically effective\nAnd and I think that that's something that that all three of us are writing about and thinking about is the amount of time and energy women spend doing this kind of maneuvering around the rules around are angry expression\nNow I Want to I Want to talk a little bit in the last ... section of the show that we have about where some of this anger goes because this is a moment in America and what's be realistic moments have a way of feeding the just\nSure that we have about where some of this anger\nGoes because this is a moment in America and let's be realistic moments have a way of fading they just do and and so I'm interested in where this goes when\nMaybe the cameras in all of the writers who aren't Rebecca Traister and Brittany Cooper are are not as interested anymore you know in in a couple of years I think that might happen and I want to know where this goes now we've been hearing from so many want listeners I Want to play another mash\nUp of some of the women's voices who've been reaching out to us about how they're feeling\nMy name's Aaron I'm calling from Lancaster, Pennsylvania Sarah from Cincinnati\nWhen I let my anger above all over and I get really angry out loud it it really doesn't do much good I find that if I express a strong opinion or even just a bit of discomfort with something I'm perceived as being angry are overreacting women yelling even in this day and age at that very acceptable men don't seem to have that same problem and I'm\nStarting to feel like maybe it's not just a personal issue I'm dealing with like to be nice and and uh and keep our mouth shut however\nI Am so angry and so angry right now maybe women all over the place you're dealing with it I'm turning my anger into action given help but feel like I'm not alone but still pretty discouraging I think that but when they have to do we have to take that anger hold onto it and that's how we're going to take back this country\nWe're hearing from listeners women who it feels like there's a theme or transferring\nSome of their personal rage I'm sure a lot of it's in in personal life not just political life or cultural life but into action taking action in the streets taking action maybe at the ballot box we got\nThis tweet from Tracy in Jacksonville I'm One of the thousands of women using their frustration to run for office I'm running for the Florida House district Fifteen I Am focused on my determination to be a voice for all and focus on issues important to Jacksonville families Tracey as one candidate who says that this moment\nTermination to be a voice for all and the focus on issues important to Jacksonville families Tracy is one candidate who says that this moment of anger is very important for her motivation a Brittany Cooper I Want to talk about where\nThis goes in terms of maybe the midterms that might be the most immediate effect hum I none of us knows exactly how that vote is going to turn out but it seems like any\nPollster or political analyst worth anything is looking down and what they call the cross tabs and noticing a that women are mad women are going to vote and women are going to form a tidal wave in twenty Eighteen one way or the other\nAbsolutely and that is as it should be um I'm particularly heartened by uh the Stacey Abrams campaign down in Georgia we have the opportunity to have the first black woman\nI'm governor of a state of a former slave state um the ... Presley campaign they're all of these progressive campaigns that are being run and here's the thing\nWe've been seeing that since twenty sixteen we had a wave of a progressive as sort of radically progressive black mayors in the deep south and so one of the things that I Want to challenge folks to do as we think in this moment is to actually look at what people of color are doing not just women\nBut particularly black women in these elections the ways that we have the channeling our anger\nOn for decades and decades and that started with the way that we voted for Hillary Clinton in this most immediate political moment\nUm but to your earlier point about whether or not our anger can be sustained on I think that I think that this can be sustained I think that we have to remember that the women's movement in this country do it goes through ebbs and flows has really been a solid political project", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "03"}
