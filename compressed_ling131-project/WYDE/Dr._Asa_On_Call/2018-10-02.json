country big businesses are well represented in Washington DC and often they're trying to work the efforts of small ones\nAnd big versus small is a big theme on this show as this up versus down and always were fighting for the little guy and for those small business owners across the country on main street trying to turn their little businesses\nInto bigger ones and today our own hours court this brings us the story of\nSomeone that you likely no my pillow founder Michael in del but you likely don't know his full and remarkable story\nPeople always say how ironic you were a cocaine addict can you invented something to sleep [noise]\nAnd to a thousand eight um my dealers they did an intervention I mean I get downtown Minneapolis and all three of them are in the wrong\nI go what do you guys doing it I'm now I'm In a worst part of Minneapolis in there and then one guy's apartment and Jonah second apartment\nSaid you guys know each other and I'm up for fourteen days or you know they said it was Nineteen is fourteen [laughter] that one guy says he goes and he goes what am I here for and he goes and goes well my comment I'm Nineteen days were shot him off and and uh and I said I've only been up fourteen and is it humid and what does the whole time\nYou know and they all they all know who I hadn't slept means and the one guy leaves he says he didn't get nothing from any of my paper man he was just discussing loud and then before he left or because you made a promise to us because all the time when I'd be doing drugs and stuff I Would always promising this platform\nThat's going to help when I quit I'm going to come back and they and and help everyone you know get out of this horrific addiction and everything there are many times I was and crack houses\nOr bars or whatever and I would talk about the revelation which I read about when I was ever in jail you know every time I was in jail I read the Bible about the only time I wasn't you know so I'm telling these guys well they would quit\nThat day and the next day in like twenty people quit all through my life and going and what did I say\nAnd they go I don't know but it sure makes sense what normally you would think it's a hypocrite no this is really bad give me another line you know God and they would they would lesser but all that time it was me\nTelling them trying to convince myself you know trying to convince myself whether it'd be Jesus or whether it'd be to get off the drugs that was me trying to convince myself so anyway these guys in the middle of this intervention thing and then one got kicks the other guy joy out of his own apartment\nAnd he sits there and the chair next to me says how much you have left and I and I don't know enough to\nProbably um last an hour or so and he sits there and that and now I I run out and I'm scraping the pipe anybody that's on crack out there you're scraping the residue out of the pipe and re smoking at and try and do it then you're looking on the ground all over the carpet trying to find\nThe next day I come in and he's working at me he says you have been suspended indefinitely and I said I don't what does that mean I I don't like it like you know I didn't realize that your diet and you know I don't know what the words mad and uh so I said yeah we'll see about this so I went to his dad\nAnd he said he looked at me he says Mike I'm not I'm not getting behind me this time he says you're destined for bigger things he says you're going to look back some day and said this was meant to me and he says you can't be a life or here even though and they both told me and one of their best employees but I just had problems and uh they're forgot them where to look\nBack and it wasn't too long looking back going ... in a while that had to happen I might still been there for ... years later [noise]\nBut it would take more than one incident really kick in my living\nMy fifth year reunion with my class everyone is now is off to college\nThey get these amazing jobs they've started families or they've kept with the same company since high school ... in my mind they were way ahead of me and it was very it was bothering me inside and then it was just\nGoing wow everybody's ahead of me and I'm doing stop to show up you know I got into you know I was a card counted then I took sick are counting class professional card but I hadn't even\nStarted it yet or whatever I just read the class so I'm I'm bragging\nI got into you know I was a card counted then I took sick are counting class professional card but I hadn't even\nStarted it yet or whatever I just read the class so I'm I'm bragging at at the reunion about skydiving with a parachute not opening and or my car accidents and my card counter things that they've never seen or the mafia coming after me you know so I'm blowing their minds\nAnd so we don't get on the topic of uh yeah how are you doing for work how you do or not you know what are you doing Mike how many kids got home you know how your family you know I'm just completely putting up just wall you know to these other things so they're all thinking I'm nuts basically but it was a very it was\nThat starting there was a very much a driver and it was like I was a lot of now starting to be a shame you know I'm going you know this is this is not who I can be\nAnd then I prayed I said you know God all I Want is to meet the right woman and have kids and and uh you know it'd be that the white picket fence so to speak and then got brought bad at all to me and handed to me on a silver platter\nUntil Mike jeopardized answered prayer and by then I was very functioning cocaine addict too I look back and remember it was perfect well no there was a lot of dysfunction even though the hard thing for the addiction to to hide it all the time kids didn't even know that that's so good I Would assume it was a lot of them\nAre hiding the cocaine and then the and the crack the kids didn't know okay even like neighbors just to give our kids are sending their kids over there because we were the fund you know this is back in the you know when they were younger and was cocaine but then when the crack came on that took us down fast when cocaine turned into crack and and the kids\nAnd my daughter at that time and we we got right when it all kind of blew up she says we're very dysfunctional family or I don't know what that means but don't ever say that again we're not dysfunctional ... what do you mean what I've decided to just horrible I didn't know what it really really meant you know [laughter] so that don't sovereign [noise]\nBut I lost it all you know Mitch really lost it off\n\nAnd in the midst of a lot of this dysfunction Mike was all ready running\nMy pillow\nI tried every pill even when I was sixteen years old I bought one of my first paychecks when to buy a pillow at that grocery store I worked at\nThis teenager spent Seventy dollars on he that would be two hundred and eighty seven dollars in today's money\nOr so I spent the most expensive pillow thinking it would be the best it was a down pillow and it was the worst because they you know\nI Know now they just sell us air I mean I I mean how can that be it feels good down and goes but I couldn't return it that I Do remember they would not let me return that pillow but then throughout my life I'm trying different pills and I always had problems with sleep and wake up in the morning I had a cake but mostly these sleep interruption or not being able to get to sleep right away\nSo and in two thousand four I had a very clear dream of the name\nMy pillow and wrote my pillow all over the house in in connecting the wind in the pie and and you know these logos and I'm going\nThat sounds really corny you know um but I go well where's my pillow you know I mean if you it's hard for you to think back now 'cause there's my everything and it was because of my pillow got big everybody took up demise but my daughter came upstairs and there was she looked at our pieces of paper written all over and\nLives he says uh she gets a glass rush out of nauseous eleven years old maybe she said what are you doing dad and\nI go home and I met this pillow and I know you really\n... says she gets the glass Russia I don't know she's eleven years old maybe she said what are you doing dad and I go I go I'm going to invent this pillow and I realized I hadn't even got the you know what what is going to be made of it was going to do is going to be the best thing ever I've seen it in and this is going to be called my pill and she looks at all these piece of paper she goes\nThat's really random dad and she went back down stairs well then the kids seven to their mother at the time Wednesday I get over this pillow thing and he says oh it's just a phase it'll be it'll be over with and I was it at that\nTime I wasn't doing anything I sold my low bar restaurant so my total focus was on this pill and well then I still had to figure out the material so we tried over Ninety four different kinds of phones and fails to put in there and my one son Darren ... who's now managing\nEleven hundred twelve hundred employees of the manufacturing that's what he does now\nBut he's like nine or ten years old and\nEveryday ring from the school and and we tried different kinds of stuff on the deck and the fall would fly all over the neighborhood and we tried little machines to get to work and finally we get it in a work once we had the pillows all made we had Margaret ... house everything and we had no money left but we had like three hundred pillows\nAnd I went into the first two I walked into a was a bed bathroom beyond I'll just say the name\nIn Bloomington, Minnesota I go in there I said I got the best pillow ever I said this pillows going to change you know change you're going to sell more than anything and helps this helps you sleep blah blah blah and where where's your buyer who is your ... where's the manager and he looks to me he goes you need to leave\nAnd I'm going like I just had all this passion you know and I'm going what do you mean I Need to\nLeave I said I Want to talk to your body and I learned right away I started calling on other stores and everybody was the same shut out my brother in law's brother ... why don't you do a kiosk and I said what's sad how do you spell kiosks\nAnd then we did this key us and I had a little sign of ... where I put on family owned and operated color in the the stencil\nAnd the other one I put chiropractor recommended and she goes\nHis then wife we can't have this she goes someone can sue us I said\nI gave one to a chiropractor our friend you know and and he loves it you know but it was way far you know here's a mall and here's this in a mall just was almost too corny almost too real but I did we did sell about eighty pillows\nAnd the one day\nWe lost uh I don't know like Fifteen thousand dollars 'cause it's very expensive to have a key us on November and December and the one guy he came up and he said hey you ever do you have a cart and they go out of business cards I I go oh I'm all out I sit here and I gave my number\nAnd in January of that year now with the house was almost you know a complete failure basically\nI borrowed money from my ex book either by Christmas presents a year by the way the reason he was my ex book he said if you quit gambling uh borrow your money I mean I I mean that's a you know he cared\nSo this guy called me in January and he says the guy that invented this pillow the one guy gave my phone number two and I go yeah and he goes this color change my life\nHe says it is a miracle and he was all about that I'm going okay and the and among excited to hear in his you know\nNot worry about where I Am at that this is I'm going I was just so happy for him and that helped him and he goes I run the Minneapolis garden show would you like a spot in there and I go and I and I'm thinking to myself right away while the kiosk in work and I'm going\nTo go well maybe there's more people are some you know and I'm sure I didn't have money in a in a sort of course had to borrow money to get into their but\nThen I'm going to that home and garden show but what I did as I got mine booth I could sell and once I got behind it was like wow you know as I'm seeing people they would literally combat\nI could sell at once I got behind it was it was like wow as I've seen people they would literally come back the next day so many people after that first day this is a miracle and same thing that guys\nNow I'm feeding off this passion and I'm just it was like amazing where that I realized I could sell and I could sell and help people and I sold out that four days sold out I was and I'm going why this is where I'm going to be I can support\nMy family in spite of everybody turned me down so I started doing shows affairs and got in the Minnesota state fair we blew it out a

I got made fun of a lot it didn't bother me because my parents said don't worry about it\nYou know for every person that made funnier there's ten people love you and I found that to to to do the nature of the American experiment and the American people there really generous they wanted to try out my food the family foods and they were deeply curious and that one no go ahead and the crowd you just have to learn to ignore them and get on with the rest of your life [laughter] and then\nI've got a Lebanese friends I was talking about their ... they are they're funny people really great\nPeople always just say let's say turn something really ugly and it's something funny yeah we life's short so let's talk back to that since the marathons and sixty days and they just said you\nYou start in St Louis in September seventeenth two thousand six with Lewis and Clark marathon you ended on November ... two thousand six with the New York city marathon talked about some highlights some low light to dean deserve got to be moments even inside you are you going what was I thinking\n[laughter] plenty of those moments\nOf but I think it was great exploration I mean it was ah for for what you know just for the listeners to explain how I did this I had a big school bus and my mom is a retired public school teacher so I brought my kids along to my daughter and my son they were young at that point\nAnd my mom would wrote school them so she'd basically home school them as\nMy daughter and my son they were young at that point and my mom would wrote school them so she'd basically home school them as we're driving around the country for fifty days at their schools were sending them the lesson plans emailing them to my mom every Sunday night and she teach a lesson throughout the week and we all of a sudden became like that of a\nKind of this traveling um road show where\nAll of my kids' friends from school were so curious you know what were the experiences they were having it and then their parents learned about it so now their parents were falling as and people started learning about what I was doing and they were coming out like we'd have fifty sixty people show up at the starting line of a race in Iowa on Tuesday Morning [laughter]\nAnd and yeah though and marathon for flying from Alaska guy came in from Japan to run with me they heard about this and it just sort of like this Brotherhood they can't sister that they came together after that was\nYou know the ... the really a poignant and and beautiful moments yeah some of the low moments where I remember running a marathon in Alaska and it was snowing and cold and the next day I was in Arizona and it was about a hundred and five degrees running through the desert and I remember finishing the race thinking\nThis is marathon Nineteen I can barely walk you know how to get out of bed to all morning and run a marathon let alone you know thirty more after that so there were some moments where I really doubt it I could do it um and just you know\nKept that American Spirit to said you know when I get out of bed in the morning I Would say I don't think about running a marathon to get to the sink you know the bathroom and spice of water and your face\nYou know okay that's great to just put on your shorts you know one leg at a time okay lace up your shoes okay get out the door [laughter] get to the starting line okay just start running just put one foot in front of the other uh so it became at point the very a a cerebral challenge as well as the physical one\nYou know I Would assume that you know I've gotten into my ... wife and use the same role young guys on the court and it's not anything else in these two simple words next play\nNot to play before not replace five please ... next game or the NCAA finals just nix play in so many of the kids in an athlete who played under his to ... talk about how that helped him focus\nOn just the next activity in front of you life didn't become as intimidating that way\nYou well and it's more approachable you're right I'm with running you know it gets very grand or why they said yeah instead of next play its next step your\nNext step next step because you tend to look at the market especially during a marathon you know you might be at mile you might see a market says mile Eighteen which means you know you basically have over eight miles to go and\nYou need you might be cramping at that point you know you might just be completely exhausted it's demoralizing at the heavy weight and your shoulders to think how am I going to run another eight miles on top of what I'd done\nDon't do that I just said next step put the blinders on about the future don't reflect on the past just being the present moment in the now next step next step so I really I can relate to the next play mentality\nYou know there's a great thing for life I think kinda stay in the moment and not get overwhelmed by the ... of life which can easily overwhelm any of us if we look too far down the road or too far back into the past it can be paralyzing let's talk about was cross country road trip\nBecause my goodness we talked to one person who's biked across the country for Dave Dave Thomas is foundation he's a Wendy's franchisee who said my goodness I Want to raise the money for kids and so he wrote that you wrote across the country in a bicycle and we followed him along what was jogging cross the country like\nDo for kids and so he wrote that you wrote across the country on a bicycle and we followed them along what was jogging across the country like and by the way what did you learn about your country when you did this and that fifty day into the state or adventure and what your family learned\nYou know I'd I learned we're we're a very diverse country I mean you you hear that set all the time and it's almost cliche\nBut the regional differences I'm not just with the food and you know the dialect but with philosophy and the way you approach life is so varied as you run across the country but the one the one you know the the one uniting thing if it were all free and we're all freedom loving people\nSo that support I got along the way was remarkable it was almost like Forrest Gump I mean some day that'd be running and they'd be forty or fifty people running with me you don't have the remote highway [laughter] out in the in the desert I remember running over the Rockies in a snowstorm and people showing up on the side of the road with hot chocolate\nSo we you know I I learned that running can transcend our differences and bring people together I mean there's so many things in this world that\nThat divide us right be it you know political beliefs to Carver scan the guide we worship whatever I when I was out there running a and people were running with me it's a commonality all of us human share and it brought us together regardless of you know the food we ate um you know the accent we had so\nI it was really beautiful ... the support people that came out everybody talking about elite runners some elite runners but some people just coming out to run a mile or two by my side\nYou know and by the way what's so interesting to me on a dear friend of mine she telling you guy who was one of my mentors and he said you know if you can do these three things a lot you can have a happy life play sports a lot 'cause you're not talking dance a lot 'cause you're not talking\nAnd and last but not least and this was this he said love a lot because then you're not talking [laughter] and I love and you're not holding up\nThe ladder yeah I think I'll go with a letter to when we come back and I think that's what's transcendental is you're running where people you're not going to get them in an argument you running together you might chat a little bit but there's something about just running together just throwing a ball with your kids you don't have to talk throw the ball it just the movements\nOf the movement back just a beautiful thing as when we come back more with ultra marathon man being torn as this this is our American stories and by the way we're all we do you're going around to network dot org such our American network dot org Morris who these\nMen [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre a lot of value of college here on our American story it's a special place were students study all the things that matter in like\nEver experiencing a loss of energy so I think that that that dietary shift as really helped and everything I Do this you know ... you must know Jacqueline yeah yeah he said that man makes it don't eat it and if it tastes good spit it out\n[laughter] and not nothing and ... and let's talk about the roads Florida because this I I assume is your most personal book dean or why did you write it and talk about the book is you know\nYeah well the ... is you're right it's it's a very personal journey and it's about the original marathon and the ... the Greek runner feeding PT surfer deputies that ran the marathon\nAnd uh it's uh it's basically a history book as well so you know ironically right now the book is it's number one\nOn Amazon and the category of Greek history and I'm not a historian but I dealt very deeply into the history of of ancient Greece and the evolution of running a marathon and I also learned a lot about my identity\nBut I doubt very deeply into the history of of ancient Greece and the evolution of running a marathon and\nI also learned a lot about my identity I think this gets back to what you talked about um you know being a Lebanese and wanting to know more where you came from so I actually went back to Greece to the very village my grandfather came from and his grandfather and his grandfather before him\nAnd discovered a lot about\nYou know why I'm all about and how it became who I Am and where my people came from\nAnd that to me it was fascinating I think that's something that that you know we look at the the popularity of things like ancestry dot com or twenty three and me you know the genetic tests that can tell you where your ancestors came from not only did I learn where my ancestors came from I visited these places and ... how they lived you know\nGenerations ago and that was really fast and they had to write about all this in the book\nYou know there's one point in time where you say at the START I was surrounded by three hundred and fifty warriors huddled in the pre dawn missed at the foot in the crumbling of Athens for me the question was deeply personal I'd been waiting a lifetime to be standing in this place I Would finally run alongside my ancient brother\nClose out with us those words who was an ancient brother you just mentioned them and that feeling running and starting to run by the crop all is\nIt so that ain't your brother was his name was ... and he was part of a class of people called he drove me they were professional day long runners they were foot Harold foot messengers and his mission was ... when the Persians invaded Greece at the bad marathon\nThe Athenians said we need to recruit the Spartans to help us we need reinforcements were badly out numbered they dispatched to this man ... he used to run a hundred and fifty three miles nonstop to spark to to recruit the Spartans\nTo battle and it was because of his ... undertaking and his mission that\nDemocracy is what it is today I mean he basically saved democracy Greece was the first democratic state and the Persians won to crush him had he not succeeded in running a hundred and fifty three\nMiles to recruit the Spartans our life we very much different and to me that it's it was incredible to retrace those footsteps and they do it um myself\nTwenty five hundred years later\nAnd
