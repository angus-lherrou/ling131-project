I could uh if okay if they got rid of him I go to state college though when I go to state college I Do whatever I could ...\nI mean I'd go to college and said I'm going to happen we take some make him say no but it's not going to have well Ellen ... but you try to you when you when nine games back to back at Vanderbilt to me that's what that's worth a national champs right there yeah but you're not going to Penn State you know I don't think so but you know what the\nPenn State the from Penn State is\nIt's been state it's not been state of Twenty years ago ... and keep in mind it's been a long time since they've been that good and when that stamps you hey ... and they should have lost and eight and I wish that there is a\nStigma to that university now they're football program that is true that is not going to go away so don't worry so sure that all we can get Frank I agree with you only get okay I didn't know the ... I think ... a fantastic football coach look what sense and they did when he was there\nAnd Notre Dame is once again in a spot to play into the play off he's already played for one next championship\nI knew it was a jerk but the ... the coach\nOf doubt I mean each day at you know he knows what he lives even worms realistically I Would nominate him yet though but would you leave Notre Dame I mean exactly so it will be more really well what I'm saying they don't mind that you get your you know\nIt's kind of there's a snob innocent comes out to be sometimes when you start talking [laughter] because that's what you're hearing you month nerd name very tough job breach of jobs that gives you\nClint notary there are two different\nYou know well yeah but but yet but when's the last time during the ... yeah but one of them as college football royalty and the other ones but Yale has yell has Seventeen national championships so I ask you again when's the last time ... I don't even remember [laughter]\nI can tell you somewhere and it was thought it was ... it was in the last time they put Alabama what happened to him they got destroyed and okay with again the so there you go so when I tell you that Notre Dame is\nNot in her name I think you you were looking at it like a ... fan or a kid a store in college football okay\nNor names they better better history than Auburn and when you're a college football player right now and you're getting recruited which was a political rally or their name\nNotre Dame [laughter] but why though\nBecause it's Notre Dame ... but one of the brand name but I'm actually I think we've hit on something here there's a problem with our fans and they think they're in that realm I Want to\nGet out and how you got to go there but you know over the top Fifteen program of all time\nSo you what you're saying is just because you were a good time because you're a good the forties who've been better last who's married last Thirty years old and her name\nOh I'm sure I ... well that was one of the why does it matter what you get Seventy five years ago\nBecause history matters kids don't the kids don't care kid these young and I don't know that's true that's true I mean you know for you to say that Brian Kelly just wouldn't look at all but I think that's I think that's I think that's asinine simply base of knowing you know it's based off your base it off history\nThat nobody cares about anymore now\nAre then if you're one of these coaches you care about but it would be the coach at Notre Dame and the coach at All right well we we\nNobody cares about anymore\nNow they are then if you're one of these coaches you care about what would you know coach at Notre Dame and the coach at All right well we were you're asking the wrong current here and I'm like ... who would say to you know you have a better chance of winning a national ...\nNow that the other one Notre Dame\n'cause you don't they don't have to fight in the late don't ever know you haven't been close they haven't done it so want America close no they didn't they got destroyed then they should have been there they weren't as I got there okay but they haven't wanted to do and they might get there this year you get that but that would okay but once they will do\nIn Thirty years they have ... been undefeated nine three two dozen for one and asked him to tell you play for one or two Thirteen what is the national championship sovereign God but what I'm saying though is I mean they ... they would they be launch it again when did they went on that [noise]\nWell okay when was the last time I ever wanted to ask ... well she does a table I'm feeling eight years ago but\nYeah but they've been more successful go in in the past twenty five years and ... and I understand that but still I don't understand why you think Notre Dame it's not just me I think that anybody would say that Notre Dame is that one where a lot of it but I think it's apples and oranges your I'm not\nDenying that nerd Dame is a better college football tradition than ... I think you think that I'm saying that what I'm saying is that Notre Dame tired and played out\nThey are it's a tough school to win at their academics and yet they're probably going to make the final four does she they might in may but they but they but they might make fun of all but realistically are they going to win that seems you know already gotten a playoff last year they would have got even realistic could operate if they're healthy when an extreme you know you don't think so no who would have been them\nBecause they were about your job but if they get out but here's the deal is but nobody if they would but if they were out there though but if they Oklahoma we got there they would have eating disorders twice and beat your beloved elder comes not oh I see what you're saying theoretically if they got there they would have beaten George a\nWriter so if they get their last year they could have more than I Am sure well I mean you get there you're twenty five percent well you know what I'm saying is that you have the upper they're good enough talent to do it since then the problem with Albany's the inconsistency of their ... again I'm three years\nI'm Maria for example in Auburn I'm not selling ... to go to a place where you're kind of a roller coaster\nNo it is but you have everything that you possibly neat again again\nBut do you I mean they're they're going to struggle to come up with that seven millions to back us out no are you kidding me there's boosters that get by that by themselves they're gonna sell drugs that are my God you know a lot of money you know a ...\nBig time college programs not gonna struggle for thirty two million dollars or eating I mean Jimmy rank strip the check by himself I mean are you kidding me I mean like you got too much faith and how much money is done in a cow town I'm just saying I'm selling you right now I'm telling you right now that you know you see you're talking about coaches will do\nPeople put too much stock in what was good Nineteen twenty five I think I mean they do and I ultimately\nYeah but we're not on their side of the table you know you're looking at it from all over now as we're looking at from now I'm looking at from this I'm looking at from neutralize I'm looking at it from I don't I Can't look at things from Alabama new truly I mean I'm just by us well he is pretty good at that to be on your mind\nI Know I mean I Am I mean I'm I'm just saying though I I ... I don't think Notre Dame is the job that people think it is I don't think you think it I think you think it is basically based off what happened with the rotten either for\nHorse alright alright alright I'm into I mean I'm just saying I don't think that I mean Rudy you can't do that conversation that I made about ... football probably know it it is good but it's not it's not what it used\nTo because again you can make all the movies you want but no they might want to ... have been relevant that much in the past Thirty years and it's just that's just the matter since ... but I don't think\nAgain you can make all the movies you want but no they might want to mess champs you've been relevant that much\nIn the past Thirty years and ... them out since Lou ... I'm ... I'm and I don't think that is true that they've\nBeen relatively relevant this year they were relevant ... are headed down there a year but they haven't done anything I mean they had bad years to America we've gone off on a big rabbit trail here where we need to get back to our ... well there are some people that would rather go to ... there are a lot of people that would well ready to go out and it listed I'm going to quit they are going to go my third coach must champ\nMust hear about your Morales ... ... what I say a realistic though there's a lot of jobs there's a lot of coaches that would come ... you know what the coaches ever come to Georgia LSU it's there in the same boat as\nThey can get that kind of catch the Notre Dame so I mean that's just my opinion that's not\nThe way I think you need to start thinking about ... to ... yeah Neal Brown\nSeattle you know but that bill Clark you'll see more realistic\nChoice is already like well I'll tell you what we're going to be getting frustrated whereas I I I think you're totally wrong about that I think you're totally completely another would be a good students will be a good choice I think you'd have a lot of I think we could get a lot of coaches I Hope you'll keep miles on for six more years [laughter] it's not going to happen let me get an over the top fifth in job one would you not want to come there\nAnd they just proved they would pay seven million a year\nI mean come on and no such thing there are you in the back with it well I mean I mean you you got to perform it Scott football oh you got to ... our effort will be real quickly fix okay over an old man and what we're ... we're a quick question for the picks\nThe should Alabama start a jail in her house on Saturday I Know I think it does matter you know you got to go to doesn't matter that he can't go to\nHe needs to see that defense that tendency Haskins very similar in speed or not quite as is as good as LSU but he needs\nTo we're now here's the nothing's going to get them ready for the back in ... that the coverage\nIs that tendency did is very similar to that it looked like she and I think he needs to\nSee I see and he's the play for that way I think that I don't have to START I think that needs to start do you think so yeah we just can't risk I mean when he when he went down in that stadium in the air just came out of that place and it was maybe ... terrified right so I say starts I think to a store\n... well it probably does but I don't think he should but anyway I don't get to our picks for real quick go through them real quick we'll go with Michigan Michigan State who you like\nGender or Michigan I mean our balls got something going in Michigan State has a proven they can play well but just inconsistent so I'm going to ... who's hot right now\nMichigan okay we've got Michigan and uh it's every ... he got\nYou know ... one in five in this game he always figures out a way to lose it right or not this year yeah but Michigan's defense is just too good a Michigan State to little banged up so you know it's coming\nIn Michigan okay uh so Michigan and moved to Michigan as well you know I think the difference I pick them to be a playoff team this year and when I got beat by their name I was kind of scary but I think they might ... who", "show_name": "Dr. Asa On Call", "month": "10", "state": "AL", "day": "20", "station": "WYDE", "city": "Birmingham"}
