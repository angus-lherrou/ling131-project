visiting the old north church in Boston and climbing tower in April Fifteen sixty you began writing the home the very next day it was published in the January Eighteen sixty one issue of the Atlantic

we are dealt just how we played a hand or if I don't seem as depressed or a morose as I should be I'm Sorry to disappoint you [noise]\nAh and I assure you I Am not in denial it's not like I'm not aware of what's going on in my family\nMy three kids my wife we just camped we bought a lovely house in Chesapeake, Virginia near Norfolk and we're doing that because that's a better place for the family to be down the road\nOr any other thing is I Am in phenomenally good health right now I mean is the greatest thing of cognitive dissonance you will ever see is the fact that I Am in really good shape in fact I'm In better shape than most of you fired so what we're not talking about today we're not talking about cancer\nBecause I spent a lot of time talking about that I'm really not interested if you have any herbal supplements or remedies please stay away from me\nAnd we're not going to talk about things that are even more important than achieving your childhood dreams were not going to talk about my wife and I told my kids because I'm good but I'm not good enough to talk about that without tearing up so we're going to take that off the table that's much more important\nAnd we're not going to talk about spirituality and religion [laughter] um [noise] so what is today to talk about that is about my childhood\nYeah well that's much more important and we're not going to talk about spirituality and religion [laughter] um so what does today's\nTalk about that it's about my childhood dreams\nAnd have achieved them I've been very fortunate that way\nHow I Believe I've been able to enable the dreams I've been able to enable the dreams of others and to some degree lessons learned I'm a professor there should be some lessons learned\nAnd how you can use the stuff you here today to achieve your dreams or enable the dreams of others and did you get older you may find that enabling the dreams of others thing is even more fun\nAnd that's something we should not lose sight of is that the inspiration and the permission to dream is huge so what were my childhood dreams\nYou may not agree with this list but [laughter] I was there a [noise]\nBeing a zero gravity playing in the national football league ... author an article in the world book encyclopedia I guess you can tell the nerds early and I wanted to be an imagine here with us\nAnd uh it turns out that NASA has\nA something called the vomit comet so they use the train the astronauts and this thing does parabolic arcs and at the top of each argued about twenty five seconds where you ballistic and you get about rough equivalent weightlessness for about twenty five seconds and there is a program where college students\nCan submitted proposals and if they win the competition they get to fly\nAnd I thought that was really cool and we had a team to team together and they want and they got to fly and I was all excited 'cause I was going to go with them\nAnd then I spent the first brick wall because they made it very clear that under no circumstances were faculty members allowed to fly with the teams\nI Know I was heartbroken right it was like\nBut I work so hard [laughter] and so\nI read the literature very carefully and turns out that NASA it's part of the outrage in publicity program and it turns out that the students were allowed to bring the local media journalists from their home town [noise]\nAnd uh [noise]\nRandy polish Web journalist it's really easy to get a press pass so out of the guys on Nassau and I said I Need to know where to fact some documents and they said what documents are you gonna facts as I said my resignation as the faculty advisor and my application as the journalist [noise]\nAnd he said that's a little transparent don't you think [noise]\nAnd I said yeah but our project this virtual reality and we're going to bring down a whole bunch of the our headsets and all the students from all the teams are going to experience at an all those other real journalists are going to get to film it showed that dream number one check\nAll right let's talk about football my dream was to play in the national football league and what do we do know that I actually put no [noise]\nNo I did not make it to the national football league but I probably got more from bats dream and not accomplishing it\nThen I got from any of the ones that I did accomplish [noise] um I I had a coach\nI signed up when I was nine years old I was the the smallest kid in the league by far\nAnd I had a coach Jim Graham was six foot four he'd played linebacker at Penn State he was just this hope of a guy and he was old school okay I mean really old school like he thought the forward pass was a trick play [laughter]\nAnd he showed up for practice the first day and you know the big hulking I we were all scared to death of him and he hadn't brought me football's\nHow how are we going to have\nWithout any\nAnd one of the other kids said excuse me coach\nThat's at him and he hadn't Ronnie football's how how are we going to have\nWithout any football and one of the other kids said excuse me coach but there's no football and coach Graham said right how many men are on a football field of time it was eleven on a team twenty two and ... said\nAll right and how many people are touching the football at any given time or one of them and he said right so we're going to work all of those other Twenty one guys are doing [laughter] and\nThat's a really good story because it's all about fundamentals fundamentals fundamentals fundamental you've got to get the fundamentals down because otherwise the fancy stuff isn't going to work\nAnd the other Jim Graham story I have is there was one practice where he just wrote me all practice just you're doing this wrong you're doing this wrong go back and do it again you owe me you're doing pushups after practice and when it was all over one of the other assistant coaches came up and said\nYeah coach Graham roads are pretty hard and he said yeah he said that's a good thing you said when you're screwing up and nobody's saying anything to you anymore that means they gave up and that's the lesson that stuck with me my whole life is that when\nYou see when you see yourself doing something badly and nobody is bothering to tell you any more that's a very bad place to be your critics are your ones telling you they still love you wouldn't care\nUm and the other thing about football is we send our kids out to play football or soccer or swimming or whatever it is\nAnd its first example but I'm going to call a head fake or indirect learning we actually don't want our kids to learn football I mean yeah it's really nice that I have a wonderful three points dance and that I had to do a ... I was kind of stuff but we send our kids out to learn much more important things teamwork sportsmanship perseverance et cetera et cetera\nAnd these kinds of head fake learning are absolutely important and you should keep your eye out for them because they're everywhere\nBy a simple one being an author in the world book encyclopedia when I was a kid we had the world book encyclopedia on the shelf and after I had become somewhat of an authority\nOn virtual reality but not like a really important one so I was at the level of people the world book wood\nBadge or are they called me up and I read an article and this is Caitlin kill her and the\nThere was an article if you go to your local library where they still have copies of the world book look under vie for virtual reality and\nThere it is and I'll have to say is that I'm having\nBeen selected to be an author and in the world book encyclopedia I now believe that ... is a perfectly fine source for your information because I Know what the following control lose for real and I say let me in\nA bar and my next door and being an imagine here this was a hard one\nI Believe me getting to zero gravity is easier than becoming an imaginary uh when I was a kid I was eight years old and our family took a trip across country to see Disneyland and if you've ever seen the movie national lampoon vacation\n[laughter] she was a lot like a quest and these are real vintage photographs\nOr and there I Am in front of castle and there I Am and for those of you who are into foreshadowing this is the Alice ride [noise]\nAnd and I just thought this was just the coolest\nCoolest environment I'd ever been in and instead of saying gee I Want to experience this I said I Want to make stuff like this\nOr I loved imaginary and it was just a spectacular place\nJust spectacular everything that I have dreamed I Love the model shop people crawling around on things the size of this room that are just big physical models that it was just an incredible place to walk around and be inspired and then at the end of my six months they came to me they said you want to do it for real you can stay\nSince they came to me they said you want to do it for real you can stay [noise]\nAnd I said no but it worked out okay and if they had said stay here and never walk in the building again I Would have done it I Would have walked away from ten year I Would have just done it\nBut they made it easy on me they said you can have your cake and eat it too and I basically become a day a week day a week consulting firm engineering and I did that for about ten years and that's one of the reasons you should all become professors [noise]\n'cause you can have your cake and eat it\nAnd when we come back more of Randy power and his remarkable west lecture born in this day and history in Nineteen sixty his story continues here on our American story [noise]\n\n\nOr [noise]\nWhite campfires how about a campfire atmosphere with friends and brought to your ears wherever you are\nAnd a good kid the chance of a sense of excitement of putting on a show for people who were then excited about it I think that that's one of the best things you can give somebody the chance to show them what it feels like to make other people get excited and happy I mean that's a tremendous gift All right so now the third part of the talk lessons learned\nAnd we talked about my dreams we've talked about helping other people in their dreams somewhere along the way there's got to be some aspect of what let you get to achieve your dreams\nFirst one is the role of parents mentors and students I was blessed\nTo have been born to two incredible people uh my dad was so full of life or anything with him was an adventure I don't know what's in that bag but I Know it's cool [noise]\nAh

get to go to school who wouldn't have otherwise and some of my wife and I have also been involved in heavily and these are the kind of things that I think\nEverybody ought to be doing helping others\nAre but the best story about my dad is unfortunate my dad passed away over a year ago and when we were going through his things he had fought in World War two in the battle the balls and when we were going through things we found out he had been awarded the bronze star for valor\nMy mom didn't know it\nIn fifty years of marriage and it just never come up\n\nUh my mom a mothers are people who love you even when you pull their hair [noise]\nAnd ah I have two great mom stories when I was here studying my PHD and I was taking something called the theory qualifier uh which I didn't really say is the second worst thing in my life after chemotherapy [noise]\nAnd I was complaining and my mother about how hard this test was and how awful it was\nAnd she just leaned over and she patted me on the arm and she said we know how you feel honey and remember when your father was your age he was fighting the Germans [noise]\nAfter I got my PHD and my mother took great relishing introducing me

got really bad at the last two weeks and I was wondering what I can do about that\nAll right that one what is your age do thirty eight right you've been to the doctor recently\nActually I went to the emergency room over\nWhat are they saying ah they couldn't find they they check or prostate they they ah they took a urine sample and say I had a ... a kidney infection\nAnd I just had a kidney stone in the week before and I thought maybe that has something to do was he born out it took a CAT scan and the X ray and they couldn't find often\nSo they checked everything per se that checked you brought your prostate all of that\nYes yeah All right then\nHave you been under a lot of stress in the last couple of months\nUh and I did on a stretch for the last couple of years\nSo it was all coming to a head right now yeah and you drink much to drink much alcohol\nI don't drink alcohol at all\nYou don't drink okay good and then they checked your kidneys and they said everything's okay with that yeah but\nThen typically here's here's really the other option knowing that all of a test came back negative and that they've done everything looked at everything whenever you're under a lot of stress\nThe bodies ... there's a set a glance sit on top of the kidneys and they're called the adrenal glands ad renal renal means kidney and add ... above so that's why they call them the adrenal glands with their little bitty small lands triangle bland and they set up there and they control the fluid in the body\nMeaning they're kind of like a flu like almost like a faucet like the little thing that turns\nAnd they can control of the fluid pressuring the body so if the body gets real stressed out and you're going through a lot of chronic stress\nThen it can cause the body to do some weird things now one thing you can do is they can retain water\nAnother thing can do is get rid of water\nAnd obviously you get rid of water a couple of ways you can sweat water out through your sweat lands or you can see it out as a couple of ways of doing that a lot of times people get access if you're a nation if the adrenal glands are not working as well as they need to do you find yourself tired all the time kind of ...\nYeah yeah yeah yeah drink coffee no I drink a lot of the a\nOf Pepsi I first thing I can I mean that's not Santa rocket science that that's got to go you know that

[noise]\nSanta the doctors at this point and did they guide you nutritionally in on any level\nThere was no offer of any kind of diet um basically I mean I don't blame the doctors because they need to be paid to know every body than a holding pattern waiting on to see if their social program through the county right right right will pay for anything\nSo uh the main thing where you are right right right\nThe biggest thing you can do I mean I Know you're just in a holding pattern in in you know it's tough because you do need medical care in in the midst of all this obviously in a in a I

as any type casting a\nAny kind of treatment plan basically their funds are so limited right now I mean they will\nTest you and say yes you do have this but as far as general typing as far as a lymph node a biopsy or any a PET scan anything like that\nNobody can do right now they don't have their farms and they're trying to spread 'em out over so many people that they can't go into this specialized treatment which you probably know I Need yeah yeah because their funds are limited so it you know within your litigation happy society\nAnd still trying to do what you can do for people that's why I was saying earlier you know when you when you could fall through that crack\nYou often tend to be ... yeah and if it wasn't for somebody like you out there that I can flip on it and listen and gains knowledge useful knowledge\nThen yeah you know almost all the time hopes lost them so\nThat means a lot that's what we're here for and oh yeah the one thing I don't want you to loses
