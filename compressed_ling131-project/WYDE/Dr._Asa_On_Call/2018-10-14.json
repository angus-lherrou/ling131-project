coming years and so I couldn't help but think that the court or that were on highway two eighty here\nAnd um and just think of the congestion that we have now you remember back a few years ago when they were trying to think of that maybe having overpasses and an elevated highway that uh we're just going to get more and more congested but as I think that there's a possibility that our kids or our grandkids may never drive a car is odd for me to think about\nYou have a coworker of course what my children are much older and they're driving now but he is younger children and he is he actually said I Hope\nMy kids never dropped why they never have to draw yeah and I'm like what like I really hope they never have to bridge that gap between the sixteen to Nineteen year old learning to drive making the mistakes I really hope that technology arrives and they'll never have to to go through that\nI think about that because it's already hard enough now as an adult someone who has years and years of driving experience to navigate\nThe road with texting and people on their phones and the distracted driving but yeah you think about being a new driver with this congestion and thankfully cars are safer but yeah my kids Charlie and Sarah ... turned twelve so the next four years they're going to be learning how to drive and then driving so they were worried this past weekend like that\nI don't think I'm ever going to get to drive a car like you know we're not going to be changing that rapidly but it is possible that their kids may never ... you know my grandkids may never drive a car may never know what that's like there'll be droning to work for that is true it's kind of like the Jetsons right from years ago\nUm I like that idea drone eroding\nThere'll be droning to

Fifteen Years old this is my first official job my brother was Seventeen and we were like the two cooks who worked there we had a junior burger special three for a dollar that would like every so often\nIs these small little hamburgers are usually about a buck a piece but every now and again maybe three or four dollars ... like the crew after church would come and loaded for their family so we had to make a lot of burgers ahead of time so people could come back\nProblem was they only lasted in the window about six minutes before you had to get rid of them and by get rid of them I mean you could throw them away\nOr you could eat them so\nThe highest integrity thing in my life my brother and I purposefully make about a dozen or two dozen extra burgers and then watch the clock I grew up often hey we think it's about to get busy for my different outlets make thirty seven thousand burgers and\nThen we sell like four of them are sort of off and we need to throw those away so I was staying in the corner of the mighty Casey in my work Vicki\nSeven thousand burgers and then it's not like four of them signed off and we need to throw those away so I stand in the corner of the mighty Casey in my work sticky it's like this tight tight pants and\nI just blew through those work pants and about three months at work in a mighty Casey is because the product the product not selling the

it's a place that you visited you know we seem storm coverage all the time and it\nIt it it's a different part of the world like we can imagine those wins but when they're showing on television places where you and your family vacation it's like watch in the world is going on and then when they say that the storm was\nThe strongest of any storm made landfall in the last fifty years when I was two

good good [laughter] well let's see the good thing here about what Saudi wants is a is a fellow who runs this particular location has been in this industry for a long a long amount of time\nAnd he knows the finest ingredients he knows what it takes to make really delicious sushi and other places\nThere's just the expectation that sushi has to cost a premium it has to come at a premium but he wanted to in his terms demystify\nThe sushi experience and so they've got a you know options here in the ten dollar range it's a lot of food is just as good as anywhere else you'll find it's in a creative presentation delicious flavors some\nSome flavors you wouldn't have expected to put together but it's really really good but it's affordable it's ah it's it's not like that five dollar junior burger nonsense and we got stuck with yesterday\nWell you know and I've I've never has who's ... who's going to use it for sure I mean I Love you know other stuff but\nThe way you're talking about it\nI think is right now\nWe got a track because here's the thing with sushi people hear it and they assume that everything's going to be wrong that you're going to be getting some sketchy stuff\nIt doesn't have to be that got a whole selection of sushi ... everything in there is cooked and it made me think of well I'm not a seafood person you can get one that doesn't even have any seafood if you like rice you like cheese the particular one I had to\nRead those and that had steak is well it's got a sweet sauce it's got some heat to it they have my man we're going to just opens new avenues for

these uh\nThese delicious things that we have a that is good news right let's get back to the news here for camp or just a little bit I Want to talk more about this a Donald Trump and Kanye West meeting that they had in the in the oval office and I even as a Google that right now I see that other entertainers are worried\nAbout Kanye West you got one rapper by the name of TI he says his patients for Kanye West is dead and gone\nAfter the Trump meeting as watching coverage on MSNBC and they were talking about his mental illness and he's bipolar and there needs to be an intervention apparently it's you're not allowed to be\nAn entertainer I guess a black entertainer from the perceived to be from the left trying to make nice with the president on the rights you got another ... ...\nIt'd be an entertainer I guess a black entertainer from the perceived to be from the left trying to make nice with the president on the rights or you've got another entertain attain are saying he's ashamed to be associated\nWith John yeah west after his bizarre White House the parents and it was bizarre I don't want to I don't want to act like it's not a I uh but I I have to admit they have I was amused do you have any\nThoughts on that and counter\nArguments on ... [laughter]\nYou know hey does not do it for you\nKnow and I was ... earlier today but who knows rod ... [laughter]\nThat's pretty good comparison that is a pretty good but the best\nOf my knowledge I'm not seeing Kanye West dress up and an evening down the way that uh that didn't Rodman dress up like in a wedding dress sometime years back I Would\nBut I have no ... well I've never liked him but he really didn't like him when he went up on stage it's nice to mark ... room with\nLittle cute Taylor Swift don't become after Taylor Swift you you know I mean but\nDon't I don't go to him from a political so\nYeah I'm not necessarily looking for him to a signal which direction I should go but I Do applaud anybody who's willing to speak their mind I don't have to agree\nWith what they say but I at least appreciate that they're willing to go on record and you better believe that he was going on record because they had a whole Oval Office\nStill with journalists who were documenting everything he says or video showing their camera they're writing about their blogging about I mean what's that must be like to just imagine big day something you say something I say becomes national or international news is just hard to imagine what that must be like to live that sort of life\nNumber one who should not because in the oval office\nYeah use some foul language huh yeah I mean you know respect all\nRight I'll be going phone Scott peace and just drop and those kinds of ...
