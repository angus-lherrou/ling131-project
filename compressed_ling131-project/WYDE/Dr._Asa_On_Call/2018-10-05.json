Crawford Broadcasting station and the\n\n\nWay we are\n\nThis is our American story and those are two sounds that we love to hear\nThe sound of great gospel music and if you remember where and when this song was used best and the movie ... secretary secretary came to us as a shining example of aristocracy big and some\nFull of charge he walked with styles stood tall and display the best manners on paper you wasn't perfect losing five but it's Twenty one races as if to say I'm only human\nBut to the guy he was perfection itself and when he performed you took our breath away\nYet some may I ask how could he have been voted thirty fifth among the twentieth century fifty greatest athlete\nFurther more how could a horse place a close second behind wilt Chamberlain unimaginable hundred point deem on ESPN who's number one list of greatest sports performances by an individual athlete\nAnd the answer because he was secretary\nAnd he was more than just a horse and on this day in Nineteen eighty nine secretary died\nLet's take a listen to his story [noise]\nYou had to kind of a princeling quality about physically mentally getting temperament given physique he has a heart he hadn't really seen great stamina [noise]\nThe\nCurrents which are made by Sadler wouldn't fit in that special ones made under that big rally [noise] he just said by experts that he wasn't the perfect Torrance in measurement man\n[noise] you\nCould look at secretary you knew that he was something special edition to be an extraordinarily good running\nA there was a very imperious or look to um had a big slashing complex hold on I'm On when the sun's rays to them it was a beautiful safe to say the way God intended to make a harsh [noise]\n\nYou can't anticipate great [noise] you can't really defy it I suppose it's something that the big guy every once in awhile sticks in somebody and down [noise] and because it comes from God [noise] um [noise]\nMust pick up the story that more key quality sparked investor interest throughout the racing world\nIn early Nineteen Seventy three shares for secretary were sold for a record total of six million dollars then after winning his first two starts of the year the unexpected happened in his Kentucky Derby tuna and aqueduct racetrack in Queens New York\nHere's Jim Daphne secretary it's exercise writer\nOf the day before the wedding memorial I worked in an eight to go straight to the mile and I had to kick him to make him work and I never had to do that but I told the formula or something the matter with this horse I said you better having checked out and this word never got back to Lucian lawn\nRun these has a horse was acting funny in the gate and Everytime he pulled on them arranged to have to pay back that he had never done that and he couldn't understand it\nThank God\nThat came out\nAnd as you can imagine the investors warned thrilled I mean they're just popped down six million and then the tune up to the derby just a terrible run and they thought what have we done with the derby just two weeks away serious questions arose about the jockeys ability to guide secretary to victory in the first leg\nWhat would the derby just two weeks away serious questions arose about the jockeys ability to guide secretary to victory in the first leg of the triple crown secretary trainer Lucian Lauren didn't know what to think but others were losing confidence in the horse\nSecretary came to Kentucky where they [noise] huge number of detractors\nAll of a sudden ... brings you in the lawyers on there's just all this controversy about the rumors that he might have hurt himself or in the wouldn't Morial end and Jim is agreed to bed\nTime will go around telling people the week of the derby the horse was lame discourse was such a great two year old in the course of the year as a two year old and now he's coming in here with a chance to be maybe the greatest thing since man of war\nBut you can't block out all these rumors that and you wonder what's going to happen here today\nBut with all those negative rumors secretary which still like three to two favorite to win the biggest rate of his young life and by the way the biggest race in racing record a hundred and thirty four thousand homes with expectation\nThat says Churchill Downs Louisville, Kentucky on this first Saturday in may Nineteen Seventy nine jak would occur and this is a Ninety nine fronting the Kentucky Derby oh\nWell that's done us style second grade and then I gave my down that is going in there and they had a bit there at the pub [noise] I Know\n[noise] ... [noise] on the inside that signed a life or do you\nKeep broke dead last and he was dead last after a quarter of\nA bias them for the on the outside not secretary\nIn the spring history earlier ... really started making his own mind he seemed to understand basic and seemed to want to dictate to film strategy for ...\nFor the building up on the outside and now that we've got plenty to\nMake up for the animal fats there aren't that just Santa Clarita elite LAX\nAnd then he made this tremendous moving we knew that we have seen some things in storage and maybe perhaps we're going to have a great triple crown winner\nSecretary secretary at on the outside the damn thing in Second Life and I read\nBegging him a couple of time in just took on I just put my sting down any you win by two and a half varies\nTown [noise]\nPro sucking therapy Iraq [noise]\nPeople were looking at the top ... he ran the last quarter mile a twenty three seconds which is unprecedented in the derby secretary did something that ... or did he went each other five quarters faster it just defies logic another quarter money might have taken to the air and flown which is obviously what was in his blood\nIs the first tour to run the mile and a quarter derby and under two minutes secretary turned would have been uneasiness and Louisville into confidence in Baltimore\nYou went off as a three to tend to favor in the Preakness Stakes it typical race course where I live just six miles away and it's been my favorite Saturdays in my life for ... years this is the tightly turned second leg of the triple crown\nIt's almost ready to horses just about to move into that starting gate the weather is perfect and we're just waiting for a fine horse race\nAgain still running in the style and flush with cash\nOf into that starting gate the weather is perfect and we're just waiting for a fine horse race\nStill running the closest style and for us we carry him live on the turned on him to college considered that ... that was the one that was where I\nAm I on the on any of that that may drain on the outside it totally size and it's also touching on the outside\nIn the Preakness he broke last again [noise] now he's going to turn you think it's going to be the same thing as the derby\nSecretary laugh again if they\nGot a hold of them made it for almost ... percent poll gesture with his hands like a man of just being his car bombs took the words the outside anyone who went from last a first and about a hundred and eighty are\nUnder any deal right now but yeah kind of secretary at sea moving fast it's going to be outside he's going to lead us right now he's looking more and\nHe just accelerated into circles the city or in absolute good lord wanted us to recap thinking about I mean this horses cook because you just didn't see a horse ever make a movie like that especially\nIn the first time it was far too early for him to have been strategically manning let me ask you that in in the race has\nHeld by chance I get on the outside now we can get a second\nOnce I get to the lead there and I just drop him off the rails [noise] I just turned his Hitler wish I knew when back now from his own style she normally just rolls in alone you know I kept thinking ...\nBy a second\n[noise]\nBeen into another level of consciousness in the public eye there were actually kids standing on the radio as he came by the source has now capturing the public not just the racing Crowder\nSecretary or did it again today the one the Preakness to fill that go and he's now two thirds of the way toward the triple crown\nExpectations were very high for any worse not just secretary to win the triple crown after twenty five years since citation and one in Nineteen forty eight there'd been a lot of very good horses that have tried to win failed winning the triple crown seemed almost impossible\nTo was tantamount to them more hundred hitter in baseball or than DiMaggio fifty six game hitting streak this was something\nThat the most Americans and finally concluded will never happen again no one will ever win the triple crown again\nWhat great story telling about one of the world's greatest race horses and an American favorite\nAgain the number two sports performance of all time by an animal or not just any animal secretary that remarkable performance at Belmont racetrack which will be hearing later and by the way as I said earlier I'm a huge horse racing fan my little girl competes\nIn hunters and jumping and she does all kinds of crazy stuff on horses\nAnd the thing about winning uh Kentucky Derby the Preakness and the Belmont is that it's just so hard\nIn modern life because of specialized breathing and the derby well considered like a middling race the bin will do the Preakness well that's a sprint that's in Baltimore only two weeks later and then four weeks later off to New York for the Belmont and that is a mile and a half which is well it's like uh\nIt's in Baltimore only two weeks later and then four weeks later off to New York for the Belmont and that is a mile and a half which is well it's like a marathon for a horse\nIt's a whole different kind of breathing that allows you to win the sprint the mid and then of course that long haul race in New York and so few horses have done it and so if you did it and the way that well the way that secretary at that it was just remarkable by the way\nWe did a story about one triple crown winner American pharaoh me my dad and American feral written by Gary Ginsburg you can go to our American network and listen to that it's a sons lament about a father and son passion with a great sport of horse racing and of course justify\nJustified did it too and want a triple crown not too long ago and still great to see America get fired up\nAbout these triple crown winners and that is still relevant sport today well it means a lot to me and it's why we're doing this story in the end rarely do I editorialize but again the love of horses and horse racing comes about when we come back\nMore of this remarkable life story the story of secretary it here on our American story\n\nLike campfires how about a campfire atmosphere with friends and brought to your ears wherever you are\nPlay these coed mining rare [noise] this sounds hard for me but I Swear half of them were weeping she went [noise] Jack\nNicklaus one's called me over and said you were at the bell knock you saw that race and I said yes and he said\nI was on alone in my living room watching and as he came down the stretch pulling away I applaud and [noise] and I try\nAnd have said to him in a in a brilliant moment of epiphany and inside he said jak don't you understand he said\nAll of your life in your game you've been striving for perfection\nAnd he said at the end of the Belmont use on when you beat a track record you normally be the by the second he not to second maybe two of them off the track record and won by thirty one likes it was there there's no horse in the history of horse racing could ever be secretary on that day [noise]\nYou're not supposed to win majors by a dozen strokes you're not supposed to score a hundred and points and you're not supposed to win the Belmont by thirty one way is\nThe desperate way in which the losers were she'll be in so battered by these shores and waste the Confederate Army staggering home after ... I mean these are well flowery ridiculous things you could say hey it's having better voice race [noise] I'm Sorry\nThis yours was an athlete\nBut this is more than a story about a great American horses the story of a great American team the team leader and he generally in Nineteen Seventy one with her father a victim of all farmers the family's horse farm again losing money generate siblings originally planned to sell the operation when their father can no longer run it\nGenerally how ever wanted to try to fill her father's dream when the Kentucky Derby a housewife and mother of four fired longtime trainer Casey Hayes and hired Roger learn to train and managed the metal stable horses\nOr and help to cut costs to return the operation of profitability before leaving May of Nineteen Seventy one generally hired his father Lucian learn in Nineteen Seventy two they guided the metal farms cold Riva Ridge to victory in the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes\nAgain it was a great movie script [noise] to have Riva Ridge engage her farm\nManager [noise] and all of us are gentry said to me after a Nineteen Seventy two ... I'm Sorry hey road from us tweeting next year she was she had all the excitement was Riva next year she got nothing\nAnd of course and nothing was secretary\nWere it not for penny ... I think secretary it would have been as famous as popular racehorse but I don't think we would have remembered him in quite as completely satisfying way\nWas the perfect owner for secretary at a she was this uh uh attractive intelligent a gracious woman and I think\nFor the owners for secretary of uh she was this uh uh attractive or intelligence a gracious woman and I think because of her probably a lot of the women in America really became interested in secretary maybe more than they would have been had there been a man or\nI Hope in a role model for women but it just was never in ... in my game plan I just happened to be a woman\nAnd that was kind of you are listening to when we come back a few more thoughts on secretary it and then we'll we'll play you that me my dad an American Ferraro segment we talked about earlier a glass triple crown winner of course American pharaoh and we're talking right now but the greatest triple crown winner of all time secretary [noise]\nYou hear a lot about Hillsdale College here in our American stories is a special place where students study all the things that matter in life all the things that are beautiful in life\nHistory philosophy literature of the constitution and much more if you can't get to Hillsdale\nHillsdale contempt you with their terrific online courses go to hill sale dot edu to learn more the courses are free the lessons are priceless and the perfect summer education good Hillsdale dot edu and sign up now\nWhy campfires how about a campfire atmosphere with friends and brought to your ears wherever you are\nThat's where we do in our American story showed a ... great American stories of love final fall for dying funny stories about first job to stay in history\nAmerican Dreams of marriage so much more and then here's your stories on these big topic why every weeknight\nWere listed on line at our American network dot org hope you joined the campfire and call in with your [noise]\nDrag races every Saturday morning six to eight five a local drug section it will be a little different and there were six to eight every Saturday morning right here on superstation what a wonderful one\nMessage from the American migraine phone it's an absolute nightmare there's pain that does not stop I feel trapped by migraine migraine disabling disease I feel\nLike I'm dying you feel like the world's closing in on you there's nothing you can do you think you're trapped in your head\nThere's no escaping you can't leave your body\nDon't suffer alone make your move against Mike Ring visit American migraine foundation dot org to find help more and more\nAnd get connected Hi I'm Lana Clawson a farmer ...

or Shiloh is dead\nThe world with parting challenge for that is going to listen and hear those words\n... dead you cannot change the brevity of life we have to old deal with that at one time or another and we either get in touch with that we don't there's a way to deal with this it's called preparation\nWhat do you do to prepare for the day when you're told there's going to be a period\nAfter your sentence you're going to be gone I think\nWhat happens is Christians we look at time and say\nAs long as I haven't settled with Jesus I'm OK\nIf anything happens it's not if anything happened\nIt will happen [noise]\nSo what are you going to do to cultivate your preparation for the transition to the next life [noise]\nSilos dad continued [noise]\nSix years ago I lost two friends of mine in their forties [noise]\nIt was just over [noise]\nBoth times\nI couldn't believe that I talk to them one day and they were gone to next [noise] often times we think as long as I'm saved whatever happens happens [noise] but it affects the way you conduct your affairs you start to ask how am I going to spend my time there is some aspect of this\nThat we've got to think constructively about [noise]\nNow I'm not saying to get used to it all because death is part of life death is not part of life\nIs definitely part of life\nWe wouldn't have tears we wouldn't have separations to cause depression for\nPeople and all the heartache that goes with it [noise] no [noise] death is a natural because\nWe no longer live in the perfect world that God made [noise]\nIt's fallen because of sin Jesus Christ the redeem or the one who died on the cross and rose from the dead sourcing could be forgiven\nGives us that opportunity of eternal life again [noise]\nSo you can prepare for death and you need to think about how you look at God [noise] I learned that in spades is God being tough is he being hard\nIs he doing this to be mean\nOr has got really at something special\n[noise] first Corinthians chapter two verse nine says this now why as seen no ears heard\nNo mine can conceive what God is prepared for those who loved him [noise] you know what the apostle apostle Paul\nIs saying [noise] he's saying you can't see it you can't hear it [noise]\nYou can't imagine it [noise]\nBut God as something even better where he is [noise] but some of us are\nAlienated from the idea that God is not going to short change [noise] my experience was the guy took away the fear when I needed him to do that [noise] a left Grand Rapids going to the University of Michigan\nHoping that I Would have a good outcome from the surgery [noise] but I also knew it was possible that I might not be coming back [noise]\nHaving your account settled is a really good thing [noise] I'm not talking about\nWheels in the states [noise]\nI Know I could talk about that but that's not what I'm here for I'm here to tell you that God gave me a little bit more time my question for you is\nDo you have any idea how long you have\nAre you going to get another five years ten six months\nYou have any idea how long you have are you going to get another five years in six months maybe you won't be here tomorrow night what are you doing to make sure that you are ready\nEven in death or dead was teaching administering the soles let's return back to Shiloh\nMy father loves people all his life and wanted them to know Christ personally he provided my brother and me with a tangible example of living resilience face he taught us to face life with the courage and coughing and the guy who carries through any storm we face\nEven if it's the storm the ends our life\nHe taught us to live each day intentionally to be ready to hold nothing back because we never know if we'll have tomorrow\nI said daughter I can say that he held nothing back in raising my brother and me when he returned home from his first surgery he opened up about his own feelings he told me he was satisfied with the way he spent his life as a Christian and knowing what he's done I could see why\nHe'd pastor to church he taught at a Christian university he'd spread the gospel to the radio and written publication\nBut when he sat across from me that day he didn't mention any of those things\nHe looked me in the eye and said you and your brother or my best investments when I remember those words I'm reminded of the years she spent home schooling us\nThe evenings he went fishing in the lake the time she took a camping even though he never cared for life in a tent\nThe advice he was always so willing to dispense when they needed it\nThe late night conversations when we were to engrossed select o'clock\nAll the nights he and my mom took to send to bed looking ahead we don't know how much time my father has left perhaps only a matter of months\nNow he will probably not walk me down the aisle no he will not see his grandchildren\nBut compared to what he's done for us and the time he had toasting become pretty small\nHe gave us his party message as a reminder to use the time we have so I Want to take this opportunity to remind him as the meaning he poured into my life thanks dad\nAnd beautifully done shallow and Ken\nHer father my goodness what a thing all of us want our daughters to say he said as his daughter I can say that he held nothing back in raising my brother and me he also said he looked me in the eye and said\nYou and your brother or my best investments beautiful life is short and it seems to short when you share it with people you are with Ken ... his wife serves a testament to the power of God's Grace and the importance of being ready\nOh [noise]\nHear a lot about Hillsdale College here on our American story it's a special place were

like you can't breathe what what happens with that\nNo I'm just a guess from last very long in the last hour of goes away I just don't have very much I notice\nWhen I Do have a body okay\nVery much I

so just to get into that here the foods that you should avoid if you want to keep your gab levels and equal playing field right which can help\nWhen you're struggling with the potential of having you know ... like we are talking about here they are peanuts walnuts hazel nuts almonds cheese oatmeal barley wheat\nRice salmon spinach and beans so a lot of those those here's a major thing a lot of

health and it's very easy to follow it's kind of how to do things from a to Z and I think you can be a real good resource for you\nAnd matter of fact it's just one of those challenges when you're dealing with depression anxiety eerie it's as you're walking through this you want to be proactive and I know you are I mean that's why you're reaching out to me right now is one of those things you want to just make sure you're you're changing your lifestyle and\nExercise plays a big role to you know when you don't feel like getting out of bed you just feel kinda bummed out and\nYou don't feel like doing anything it can make a big difference just to go and get on the treadmill for thirty minutes or go to the gym and you know do your best to work out for twenty minutes or\nGo walk around the block just getting that emotion there's a law studies out there that have shown us that it increases the endorphins in the body and increases the functionality of the brain can make you feel better\nSo those are very beneficial things for more of a lifestyle perspective that can help in dealing with anxiety and depression but you get to the root man I mean really as you're talking to the counselor and all that\nTo the root of why\nYou feel the tendency to put\nAnother person where they can make you a break you\nAnd that's probably what she's struggling with you know women it it it they want to be the door and they want to be loved\nNo doubt about it but they\nThey want the guy a lotta times to Iraq and to be a place where they can lean on\nAnd that's what you have to be and I'm I'm not telling you what to do and just\nAs you're walking through that process I mean we've all got stuff we're going to walk for you know and it's one of those times where you've already been through several marriages and this could be the one to to stick you know this could be the one if maybe she's having her doubts that's okay\nBut you just get to a place where\nCan be the guy you are designed to be that your call divvy and as you go through that process you know good nutrition good lifestyle habits they can help it really can and your doctor can recommend certain medications that can help even though it's like some might not right now\nYou know there are other medications there's tons of them actually and many times people have to play around with different ones\nEven though his election night not right now\nYou know there are other medications there's tons of them actually and many times people have to play around with different ones to figure out what's works but you know you may find like radically changing your lifestyle that you may not even need the Mets\nAnd by working through counseling and kind of getting Gary back you might not need it either so just a good battle playing the game plan for you but I just want to know we're here for you you can call anytime you can email anytime and will do everything we can to walk into the process and if anything

that's good now here's another kicker and you sweat a lot you sweat a lot you have anything like diabetes or any other health challenge at your you've been diagnosed with\nNo nothing now don't take any medicine I and you don't take any medicine\nThe here I Do ... ... and mining I'm OK\nAn animal that hey I cake or am I kept ... at night and\nWell then I just would those medicine that shouldn't be a big a big issue I Would go to your physician had them do a couple of blood test like the vitamin D that can play a role and also your sodium and potassium Patricia can play a role as well as the extra sweating so it could be an issue with the adrenal glands it could be an issue with\nYour sodium potassium being off you could have a little bit too much on the potassium side and they checked it out through the blood work so when you go in to get that vitamin D to maybe have them check the other areas as well and you know exercise will play a big role eating\nThe proper diet is going to play a big role and of course you know I'm a fan of the anti inflammatory diet so maybe that's something you want to consider looking into but forty five pounds is nothing you can lose that really you can and I'm not just saying that if you get active really watch your diet\nPlay a big role that and get focused and start making some of these changes I think you're going to do great so keep me posted on how it's going to get the blood work done and they'll probably find lying in their\nSome of the issues of what's causing this wedding and also looked into celery juice right celery juice has been known for people that do a lot of excess sweating or just\nPour out sweat seemingly more than they used to a lot of times it can be a little bit of sodium levels being office the best natural\nForm of sodium not like table salt is a little bit different that we have to check into that keep me posted okay thanks for the call Arlen AAA to eight three\nSeventy two Seventy two there's triple eight to

of daycare experts are saying that the fight against childhood obesity\nShould have a new focus ... daycare eighty two percent of American children under age six are in daycare outside the home or their parents work\nAnd that means that many meals are no longer around the family table but at day care where parents may have little or no control over what they're eating let me just stop right there that is the case for a lot of people\nA parent's you have to jump in\nWhether you prepare the lunch you prepare them meals and you are in control do not lead a daycare center dictate the kind of food that your kids are going to eat just crazy\n[noise] but they've done a study that kids in fulltime daycare get two thirds of the daily calories there so it's really the older adults are driving the nutritional value of what children consume they did a study at Duke University in Durham North Carolina and they said [noise]\nWhich is Benjamin kneeling in Cali do this study and they found that most states have mental farmers for healthy eating and physical activity and child daycare so there is some state regulation but it depends on\nHow much they're really enforcing it may differ\nFrom
