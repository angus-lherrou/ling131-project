either one of them because they take a blood test for cancer and I understand that never supposed to be twenty five mine is twenty six and I'm not exactly certain what action do\n... well here's the deal first of all you got to focus on one of the big keys which is cutting down information in the body that's very important so cutting down information in and making that happen is always a big key and you want to focus on that first always so remember\nThat when you're when you're cutting out information it starts with your died your eating habits now one of the big things you've got to look at here is to be really supportive to the liver and kidneys\nYou got to focus on and that's a huge piece of it so doing equal amounts of lean protein sources like chicken fish be for eggs is your proteins and white protein and I'm a big big fan of the proteins or the protein powder their organic\nAnd then also you're glow glycemic carbohydrates in the form of fruits and vegetables and then you're good healthy badge almonds are walnut your cash draw because\nAll those things make a big difference and when you're eating those types of foods one of the keys you have to focus on which I think is really important\nIs also your your liquids so the ... getting enough fluids in everyday half your body weight in ounces of water no cutting out the juices the so does the sugary drinks can play a big role to now if you're not exercising along with this thing you're doing yourself a big disservice as well and and just based on what your physician we'll let you do I mean you always want to ask kind of get cleared\nMake sure everything's good but especially if you have age about forty five fifty you definitely want to find out probably fifty but that's a that's a big deal so

recover see if you don't get good solid sleep throughout the night steady sleep deep sleep then your body has a real tough time getting into that stage where the body repairs hormones repair body tissues repair lands organs and systems repair your body needs the stage of sleep just to get to that level\nAnd that's one of the area's really you really want to focus on is getting that by getting your body to level it just takes time\nSo and encourage you to focus on getting kind of an overall lifestyle plan together and lifestyle specialist is always good to help you but you want to have

to critical races across the country one of them as Pennsylvania seventh congressional district where Marty no Stein is running to replace the retiring never Trump or a Charlie Dent\nA thank God he's being replaced and Marty is in a tight race against Democrat left the Susan Wild\nAnd this has been redistricted but I'm telling you something Marty is the person you all have to get out and vote for in Pennsylvania seven he joins us now and also that avid cyclist was in the two thousand\nUh Olympics as attract cyclists does a lot of ah incredible stuff for his community and it's going to support the president's agenda on the economy immigration trade all the rest of Marty it's great to have you on tell us what you're finding out there what issues to the people care about most as you're approaching this all important midterm fight\nLaura first of all thanks for having me yeah you know covering every corner this district which is now a new district Pennsylvania seventh district has everything from the urban core of Allentown Beth I'm an eastern to the to the farming communities in the northern tier worked district what we call this late bill\nA region now what what we're seeing and what I'm hearing is that people are happy people are happy with this economy they're happy with what our president's been able to accomplish we're seeing there's a lot of jobs out there people are making more money and we have a you know other rather nice bugs in the economy\nAnd she called me they were happy with what our president's been able to accomplish we're seeing there's a lot of jobs out there people are making more money and we have a you know other rather nice buzzing economy right here in this district and people want to see that continue they don't want to see this come to to a screeching halt so I think right now\nA lot of voters are getting very very much engaged and they realize what is at stake if they flip the house on a ... in in Congress\nWhat what uh when when you see the redistricting that but obviously a it is is being done in many cases to add a urban voters to what it's traditionally a blue collar or a more conservative district\nIt makes the Republicans jobs in in in a way more difficult to try to run for Congress for the first time or run for reelection\nBut on the issue of for instance immigration where we see a thousands of people now are being funded clearly to rush up to the border or even in rural districts where you know they do need some agricultural workers and so forth\nPeople don't like the chaos and lawlessness are you finding that as well given the news on this new crush at the border\nYeah I think that's really on a lot of people's minds is just that the radical a resistance we're seeing from the left a\nRash of people to the border again we we we we read this chapter before we've seen it happen um most people I'm Talking to I Would say the majority of the people I'm Talking to understand that securing our borders a first step towards a workable immigration platform\nOr we need to secure our southern border a and there's no question about that and everyone I've been talking to was supportive that\nI'm so immigration up here in Lehigh Valley in seventh district although we're not a border state uh it is something that ... it's a on people's minds\nA and Marty's Susan Wild is they they ... they hope that she's part of the what they are going to call the year the woman or because the me too movement the woman's march and so forth are so ... would\nThey try to pass or off as a moderate a Democrat in in your district\nWell that's what they're trying to do but that's not who she is a she ran in her primary uh somebody on the ... are left now she's trying to move to the center but um her results speak for themselves or\nYou know she she's she's for radicalism she's from a welfare she's for no borders and sanctuary cities she's for bankruptcy and bureaucracy\nNo for an pitching the president in teaching Kavanaugh but she won't say that in any of her commercials she won't say that any public forums but at the end of the day that's where she ran on in the primary and I'm sure that's what she's going to govern as if she's elected which we cannot let happen\nMarty when I see the uh the amazing economic growth that has been made possible by this president's focus uniquely\nOn the American worker the American people it's hard to imagine that people would want to halt that or go backward I've been watching some of your a campaign or commercials in advance on line and the people in your district they're smart people they want to go forward they don't want to go back they don't they want they want happiness\nAnd calm they don't want chaos in the streets and people were in black masks and smashing car windows and in a in raising the flags of other countries in America they want an American to be a a safe prosperous nation where security\nIs paramount in our our virtue is freedom a is always you know upheld and raised\nHigh and I think it's job not mobs we want jobs we don't want mobs I think it's as simple as that\nI think it's as simple as that and you're right a lot of voters in my district agree with you a hundred percent now the other side's got a small little motivated base of folks we've seen that the results\nAnd you're right a lot of voters in my district agree with you a hundred percent now the other side's got a small little motivated base of folks we've seen that the results we've seen in the primaries they're very vocal uh you're right they show up in ... uh we we announced a campaign uh our our\nBrand opening of arcane campaign headquarters the night before they threw rocks to our windows uh you know so this is the type of stuff we're seeing even locally here in the seventh district which\nIn my opinion I was born and raised here my family's been here five generations I've always called how I never saw it like this before in my life and the relatively young man I'm forty seven years old but what you're seeing right now the resistance from the other side is it is it's it's really quite alarming\nAnd funded funded Marty by socialist billionaires who don't like the fact that America standing strong for national national economic growth and so forth Marty now staying at my Marty Nothstein I Can't wait to see you in Congress\nThe following is not an actor that are real life story from trinity debt management\nMy story began with that a lot of credit card debt and I heard a commercial for trinity I gave them a call\nFederal services to illegal immigrants soaring across the United states because of corrupt judges court cases creating writes in the constitution and creating rights to this er rights that birthright citizenship\nAll of it it's a it has fundamentally already transformed entire states in the country\nOr the commonwealth of Virginia\nThis was a conservative blue collar\nA lot of veterans\nAnd now if if I were Comstock loses in Fairfax County Virginia and she's behind them is a congressional race reelection\nIf she loses I saw some on TV say I guess it was Charlie hurt yesterday on the Fox special report panel it'll be the last time we ever have a Republican Congress person in this Fairfax County district which is right\nNear DC so this is now been transformed because of immigration illegal and otherwise and liberal policies\nFollow always liberal policies always follow wear\nA mask crush of illegal immigration has moved into a community that's why the ah African Americans and Latinos in poll after poll will tell us that\nImmigration is adversely affected their communities\nBecause it has I'll give you that a stat and just a moment a\nDoctor mark Christian is with us or he is the director of the global faith Institute former Muslim Sunni\nWho converted from Islam to Christianity\nAnd he's been following the media and their use the manipulation of this story from turkey wearing a Saturday counsel at the Saudi journalist or who wrote for the Washington Post\nOr is or was murdered and apparently it's all Donald Trump's falls Dr Christian good to have you with us or what how do we need to look at this story mid term voters I don't think they're focused on this this is not something that they're you know it just affects their daily lives but the media are using this story to do what\nCigarettes for having me editor for the ship the local community and and you're right when you have a party that is run by by them and ah ah you know those old uh guards it's it looks like they are often from inside when I I I think actually this um\nYou know story about a reporter and everything else is going to have an impact on\nThe election if we are not going to get the truth out and and the reason of that is that when you know many people actually don't understand you know the situation between the states and Saudi Arabia\nAnd try to point out that the Trump is a you know he's a cozy to um you know the Saudis and the ... and and also to dictators and so forth which is far from through if you listen to Trump and his last quarter on his before this incident broke out\nEmbarrassed at the Saudi Government publicly at least four times and\nThat was that big a media thing going on in the whole Middle East\nSo uh when we look at this and that I think people need to understand that Trump is not I'm backing up the south is because he loves loves the dictates of his old for personal gain because this is nonsense [noise] he's doing this because of the Saudi Government the government the government is doing a good work\nThe dictates of his all for personal gain because this is nonsense he's doing this because the Saudi Government the government does the government is doing a good work that helps them not states and he's in America first\nUn American interest a president which is different from Biden and Obama and all of those previous presidents that states and why I'm saying that because you and you look at what the current um gum prince and the Saudi Government is doing\nTheir head thinking many fronts the number one is\nThe author hunting by defending the Islamic movement by looking in house arrest more than five hundred moms in Saudi Arabia and all\nThey are fighting the Muslim Brotherhood in the country and even in other countries they are helping the states um when they are fighting Iran and its aggression in the middle east there hunting big time they get on the Iranian sanctions are and how the Trump is up with English taught\nBy individuals oil prices and and on all the stuff also the current administration or kind of leadership in um a Saudi Arabia is hurting usher in a peace treaty\nThat never ever be imagined before and Donald Trump is about announced that are very very soon what is going to be involved in Saudi Arabia and and but it's an Egypt and Israel which is going to be eliminating the danger of this conflict has been going on for seven years so Donald Trump is supporting um you know the government\nA leadership in Saudi Arabia because of those reasons and those reasons alone and all of those\nHeaded are not states not that dictatorship and ... plus ... all of this we believe in this country that everybody is innocent until until proven otherwise so when we are dealing with this issue as when we have to\nFollow the due process to go to the investigation and find out what's going on and you know I I tend to believe that I Am American inside out since I'm a great in the United states but still ... over there and my ... in my home brew which\nYou know nothing happens by coincidence when uh the president of turkey is very much over the place about this you have to understand that this happened at the same time after the Trump Administration embarrassed in public and the whole Muslim world by arresting a the the\nThe faster and the release of the pasture happened right here at the same time all of this incident going taking place\nExcellent point well I think again mark ... America\nIn ... in the American voters\nIf they're given the proper information and not the talking points to the left the ...\nWhich again it's it's the it's so sad and it's so predictable they always go to racism they always go to a phobia they this is all they have it's it's women are oppressed in the United states or every minority group is a pressing the United states the president loves autocrats the president ... I mean it's so\nPredictable that it's almost boring to talk about but meanwhile the Democrats are giving the big thumbs up to thousands of people\nWho are about to cross into America unless we do something about this thousands and thousands of people many of them this is an adult men for young military age men who are have joined this caravan and are being supported by someone or some organization\nTo storm into this country to try to change this country electorally that is the goal here the goal is to replace the American voters who elected Donald Trump with a new class of voters\nWho have no background or understanding of the American story that's what's happening and it's outrageous and Americans have to stand against it total lawlessness\nOh background or understanding of the American story that's what's happening and it's outrageous and Americans have to stand against that total lawlessness a die hard and what are your what are your thoughts on the immigration issue I think the Democrats have made a big mistake thinking this is going to help them in the midterms\nWhen the Democrats and the left and the media that supports the left is a crazy and they have gotten ideas is why they always go to this is men and all the kinds of ideas that they talk about that means absolutely nothing\nBut when I pay attention to the media and what's going on number one is in the last two days they start talking about how the Hispanic votes are not going for the Democrats but goes for Donald Trump\nAn historic away and then right after that they start talking about the current events marching to the order of the United states and what they are trying to do is to try to divide and to try to uh make the Hispanic\nVotes jump into the vote a boost and try to vote for them so this is a very well organized by the media and I have no idea how they do it\nBut I have no doubt that everything is it the night you pay attention to the states they talk about it for three days how the Hispanic voting for Trump in a historical way and then all of a sudden\nWe have an ... you know a problem on the on the all that and then we have to figure this out and Donald Trump's days we're not going to let that happen and I think Hispanic votes water in Americans\nCan see through this because I trust that when you come to this nation and you believe in that and we understand that they'll put it that you have you're not going to be deceived by the uh the bidding filthy or works of the left and what they are trying to do every day or two American the American fabric\nA mark Christian um you're such a treasure we really appreciate your voice speaking up for truth and freedom and religious liberty and a common sense pragmatic foreign policy\nOr where we have to make alliances with people in in in country is that now we don't agree with on a lot but for the better betterment of the American people sometimes we have to do that and don't keep your eye on the ball people because what mark said is exactly right this is calculated\nAnd and it's actually so transparent it's pathetic\nA doctor my Christian here on the lower income show will take a break get your calls do you agree that this was a calculated strategy get Donald Trump out there on the immigration issue and think that because he talks about it Hispanic voters will start\nTurning out on ... against him and the Republican Party eight five five forty Laura Laura Ingraham show [noise]\nAttention you could be paying too much for your health insurance new two thousand Eighteen health insurance laws have lowered costs dramatically you may be significantly overpaying open enrollment is now and it's the best time to maximize your savings you may be able to save as much as forty percent", "city": "Birmingham"}
