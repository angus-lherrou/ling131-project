man's Eric keyboard player it's just amazing\nThere are songs that sound like they've been around forever\nSongs that were not written as much as transcribed\nTranscribed for the ages the song we're about to talk about well it's one of those songs it's my country legend Vince skill and it's go rest high on that mountain\nFor the longest time I just thought it was part of the American song book one of those songs that was always just they're like house or the rising sun one of the songs that when you go to find who wrote it well it had no author\nWhen I play a clip because we were telling the story this song we like to hear from the writer himself and the source of the inspiration of this song it felt like it's been around forever here's been skill talking about it\nI've had bigger hits and sounds and has sold more and and all of those are all those things but that will be the one song\nHands down that that will that will identify me and I couldn't be prouder now if that were to wind up in the handle some day where I just made the sweetest thing in the world you know that something I did later in life was correlate with the very first thing that I ever heard was something out of a him [noise]\nAnd I I Know that song is\nAs powerful um I did had no intention of being any of that you know all it was intended for which for me to grieve my brother's death\nAnd honor handling and and celebrate what I thought was in store for him and\nAnd what it really didn't even plan to record it\nAnd Tony brown\nSays you have to record this awesome okay if you want to and and then they told me they were going to put it as a single and I said well you guys have lost her mind [laughter] I couldn't have been more wrong but [noise] um I I\nI really could not be prouder that I was lucky enough to to to strike a chord with people that\nThat they want to go to that song\nIn their grave us times and in their most painful and hurtful and and sad times they go to that song five comfort Maya Angelou um [noise] got in touch with me and told me that that song um was\nAn amazing a healing process for her when she lost her products or I feel pretty blessed and lucky and all those things to have gotten to write that one\nThat came from six children who are now all married and we had six kids and nine years\nAnd Mary Catherine our oldest daughter her husband town\nSo Mary Catherine moved in with us\nAnd they had two daughters weekly\nNews for at the time and Mariah who's about one so they lived with us while they were looking for a house then they found a house but it was a fixer upper so they were going through fixing it up so they ended up living with us for nine months\nAnd during that time of course we got to see Mariah legally every day in Iraq I went\nFor them to court and flour to a toddler she was a real joy when there was a party or some kind of she would laps or ... or ... whatever food was in front of sick we've ever had the best goodies that's whose lap she wanted to be a\nObviously you're always attached to your grandkids but this was more like [noise]\n\nMariah had some fever inducing seizures which means to get a low grade fever and didn't have a seizure\nSo we got six kids five of the mayor and all this\nThat means to get a low grade fever and didn't have a seizure [noise]\nSo we got six kids in five of the mayor and the oil business with us\nBut David Was be to his own drum\nHe's almost just like me which means we but it has all the growing up so um I remember one is a junior and he was like you you know you're controlling me you don't give me any freedom and I said here's what freedom is you pay the rent you pay the\nCar payment you pay your own insurance and you will be free and Eighteen months and I can't wait and I saw his eyes get as big as saucers we never had any more problems [laughter]\nSo David went and he got an engineering degree and so his brother's really leaning on him to come back to us we needed help really bad but he decided he's going to be a musician\nAnd he said I just don't want to look back and wonder what I could have done\nSo he gave himself two years and that was about ten years ago now one of his songs just won an award for a song of the year and Christian music called I Want to go back [noise]\nI Wish I could run across the shoe\nWas me I had to say no no [noise]\nAnd then I got I got\nDavid is in Nashville and he's he's the only one that's not with us and he had really not into middling for about nine months\nBut he had a an event that he was booked for so he was in town\nAnd he had a song on the radio at that time was first song to play on the radio\nToday is beautiful and it's a song about perspective and here's where the song came from\nIt came from our family all being at Disneyland our family likes to take the trips together we discovered that if we'll pay everybody come so [laughter] we were at Disneyland or Disney World and leaves kids at the time for about foreign to think Brady an addict\nSo Addy was pushing the empty stroller and bright he wanted to push that she wrote an eddy wouldn't let him and so bright he just had a complete meltdown there was a lot of laughing about that here we are at Disneyland happiest place on earth all these rides around you and here's this kid melting down\nBecause I Can't push a stroke or something you can do anywhere on earth\nAnd David in particular I thought\nYou know we can't do that and she ... we're we're in a Disneyland really amazing opportunities we have in life and were melting down because of the bumper sticker on the car in front of us but we kinda do this to ourselves\nSo if we can lift your eyes and see it in a different light you'll realize everything's beautiful that's the core of the song so he came to town and Mariah and particularly really loved the song\nAnd she couldn't speak well enough to sing the whole thing but\nThe course goes something like that [noise]\nThat's how it goes so she would say a lie sky she would just do that one tag word on and and she called him uncle days because she couldn't they Dave so today\nLie sky she would just do that one tag word on and and she called him unplugged days because she couldn't they Dave so today's so every time the song came on the radio she wouldn't uncle days and she would sing along\nTo uncle day was big favorite then of course he's the only out of town uncle so he's a big five so he came to town so we went over to Becky ... macadam was at her sister's house with ...\nAnd may Catherine was holding arrive and David said hey Mariah Mariah was just not feeling a lot of the day she was had a really like right fevers and so she just didn't feel too good so we said oh okay well you know she will go let her take a nap\nAnd see\nSuch a day and we had a new office building at the time and I took him to do on a tour of the office and I got a call from Terry\n[noise] that was a you know you gotta come home right now [noise]\nRise not responsive so we flipped\nAround and went home on our lives that the ambulance we asked was more I go on to the hospital\nAnd Terry had been outside going for a walk and America was kind of keep an eye on Iraq has these fever and do seizures so she went and looked in ... so she screamed\nTerry just gotten back she went in immediately did CPR they called up the empties there were there in five minutes\nTo really that caught it and plenty of time they got a color back\nWe learned later that about Ninety percent of the time with the little kids that can't start their hearts and that was that they just couldn't restarted heart\nSo she's in an app she was perfectly fine [noise]\nShe just died\nSo here we all are and you know you have this image tragedy I knew that\nWhen couples lose kids that the divorce rate's pretty high so I immediately called our pastor and said hey we need help or 'cause I don't want to say our family breakup or see people you know families within our family breakup and he said well\nWe're just bringing in this program called grief share which I recommend it helped our family mentally\nBut here's the bottom line [noise]\nIf you grieve together and you understand the way other people want to grave and you agree with them the way they want a grave you hurt more faster but the event will bring you together [noise]\nBut the human tendency is to not want to have pain so when the pain comes and it's your day degrees but not the other person's day what tends to happen as the other person will withdraw because they don't want to feel that I see\nSo you get a little further apart and then tomorrow it's their degrees and you're okay that day so you withdraw\nAnd people just drift apart because they wouldn't grief together\n[noise] and this is the way I personalized I'm an oil and gas investor understand investment if you invest in other people's pain and grief with them the way they want a grave\nYou're investing and what's left which is the Russian ship you still have\nWhat that looked like for me is every time for me for much after I every time I saw somebody they wanted to talk about ... and and they wanted to grieve with me you know ... it's a great for them to now from my standpoint\nNobody they wanted to talk about ... ... and they wanted to grieve with me you know it's a great for them to\nNow from my standpoint I didn't really want to grieve anymore you know I grieved enough but you know what because of that perspective that my past I was able to say I want a great first\nBecause I'm investing in this relationship this is what remains [noise]\nAnd when we continue more of the story of Tim done Mariah and so much more about life\nAnd living from this terrific [noise]\nTim done
