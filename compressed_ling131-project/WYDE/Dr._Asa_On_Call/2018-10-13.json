was always tell everybody you're there for the kids number one because if you can if you can keep the kids excited and there's a way to do it and a solo to both of the teams and and energize the parents and the fans that that's really what you therefore\nUm do they see what's going on during the game and uh as I learned a long time ago\nYou know your objective is to not uh not to be there are people who you are soon enough especially if their sponsors and you do a real good job getting their name out there but a ... year there and\nOh what are the things that are unique does I we like to do a lot like called mama music because if the moms are happy and they're kind of\nGrew and understand a little bit you know 'cause they don't care and it's\nOutside mama wants to hear something that's got to got her kind of shaken a little bit and you know once you're not watching her baby out on the field and we have a great time with it and we were in integral part where we're all part of the family or or part of the program and that's where I live about ... charcoal is up you know they they even dress\nIntegral part we're we're all part of the family or or part of the program and that's where I live about ... is a you know they they even dress nice\n[laughter] so [laughter] ... do you want to the coaches are no are you sure looked like one of them I said that the object of you know and and the land right in\nWell you don't want to base your your green would you agree with the wind right now I think what you're saying you're ...\n... absolutely right and the a and I we get a break catering in both from wing of fast they take care of me ever worked for a home game\nSo we're ... and ... and the officials in the ... you know at half time you know they go on their way to their potty break they stop by and say hey what are you got this week\n[laughter] so that's part of the\nFun part of it you know is that what they're visiting teams and it's just a great report and you know I Want to say congratulations to co Jagger I've gotten the mayhem awesome awesome guy I'm a I'll get to talk to him during the camps\nAnd and that's the other thing you know you get to meet the other coaches and the other people that go to the teams and you really are part of the high school football family and ... and that's something you can't buy and and I know in Texas and Oklahoma it's it's big but I think they're it's so big that you almost become a kind of a a remote\nKind of person you know you come in there and they pay their people to do their job if you will to an extent depending on how big the school is we're here you know you just no matter if it's one way or hey I essay or Saturday you ... you just go in there and and you have on a minute you keep the people go in and you keep the energy up no matter what the score is\nAnd speaking of that credit to the guy Hill City or he did a great job I mean it was you know it was sixty one nothing okay now that tells you how the game was going for them but those kids were scrappy or they fought hard\nYou know and sometimes it it just isn't your night they look we all know click talk of got a good program\nSo I'm ... you know that no that that goes without saying so you know you know it's going to be a tough row to hoe or you know ... ... talk will not to pump them up any more than they need to be but you know over the years I mean it it is what it is ... or so\nYou know credit to a pill city and the coach of the great job because of the kids are they had a few injuries as well uh where we Miller uh he uh\nThrough one scored one on Iran or our backs did a great job um you know our ... our second team squad thirteenth squad got in there and got in some good work as well and you know next week is not

[laughter]\nThere was a country song or an area where you go just I got to go home and I don't\nKnow why ... what do you think that Arkansas's approving a but they've got one of the worst pass the fences in the country that's not going to work against them and again so minutes and I'll miss is rested and ready so give me a ...\nA Jay Brown lodge I mean they're good this team's got talent me outside I'd say the biggest improvement this year with over ... oh yeah they can run the football\nIn their good this team's got talent me outside I'd say the biggest improvement\nThis year with ... oh yeah they can run the football maybe they don't that helps just a little\nBit on nothing has great teams but it gets teams like Arkansas look for him to have a big deal more trust me I played against him and fantasy this year we've lost because of his credibility\nBut old miss I think they when the end you can get all the pocket hurt your legs although I think I think more is going to turn Arkansas around how good can you be you can only be so good in Fayetteville but I think he can win there and he's ... he's running off with nothing\n... run off in your eyes so I like more than doing a good job but openness when it's All right let's keep going quickly uh Wisconsin and me should get out of the biggest game of the day\nSo horrible I don't like him who does what but nobody rarely the situation is a guy can coach but he had done a very ... jobs so far to me at Michigan average but this seems on the cusp\nThey wouldn't this game and you know we're really both teams are back in on if they win the game you know they are they are I don't think Wisconsin's good they were last year I think Michigan racket when the when they're back in the hot what do you think\nI think this is uh to me a coin toss because whoever's playing at home I think if it was in cheese land I think it was constant takes it but I think they're playing in the big house and that's a magical place I I just think Michigan I think it's going to be a close game Michigan oh\nClose game ... generally we're going to go Michigan in the big house just a home field advantage huge there get\nWhat do you think all in Wisconsin last about three touchdowns at ... you know meanwhile Michigan has got the uh second rate defense in the country are you gotta go Michigan almost one I Can't see it any other way [noise]\nI agree I'm going to go with Michigan as well I think it comes down to I think one is Michigan team is better than the past couple years or any any team\nIn the ... air I think shaped Patterson he gives them a quarterback you're you're ... you're only as good I don't care how good a defense you are ...\nIf you don't have that sugar man sugar man can be a facilitator ... can be a runner he can be a password to ... but you need to have that trigger man to run the off chance you want to run if he's not what you need you will not be successful so we all go me ...\nOr so we're all we're all green except for the out of balance soon as he pick me pick I'm like you\nThey're going to get used to tell you back up um yes by the way we never did mention that I Am now I don't think I you know we we didn't make a point of this very heated to here's event now admittedly I may have just blown that [laughter] you're saying you know we do these pictures ... it doesn't matter\n[laughter] matter it only matters when you're winning they matter and it was", "show_name": "Dr. Asa On Call", "month": "10", "state": "AL", "day": "13", "station": "WYDE", "city": "Birmingham"}
