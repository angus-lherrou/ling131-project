which group contribution some group chemistry was more important than individual performance so basketball's really small sport that I study\nAnd another set of questions which was how do you define great and you know for me one of the problems is when people talk about great teams there's no real set period of time that we applied to it a lot of people talk about teams that were great one fees or had incredible undefeated season\nWe'll set period of time that we applied to it a lot of people talk about teams that were great in one fees or had incredible undefeated season but what I really want to study what I realized was important his teams that had sustained air dominance for a long time because\nI think any team can get lucky that can win a championship and uh one season or two seasons but really to rule out ... completely and to talk about culture and chemistry than you really had to set the bar for years\nAnd let's talk about some competing theories that are out there because the name of your book is the captain class some people think it's the coaches some people think it's the management some people think it's that super star player or the team of players what led you to this categorization and your choice to study the captain's\nI was completely shocked\nI I had all of the same assumptions that I think everyone does [noise] when I finally identified the team's not two years and years of work I mean I I went through twenty five thousand teen entire history of sports in the Eighteen eighties all over the world and I got down to Seventeen of them\nAnd you know the first thing I looked at was talent right I thought town would be the thing you know but I quickly realized and suddenly it seems you know they all were talented but some of them had talented was clearly average or even mediocre in some cases so it wasn't that\nSelflessness and self sacrifice aren't generally words people use for most CEO's in America we can we can say that safely Sam talking about the Coleman way but it's one of the things about bill Russell and we're going to learn more about some of these other captain is this word cold desire\nAnd my goodness anybody who played around bill Russell understood what that word meant\nBecause this is one of my favorite stories because I think it it shows one of the characteristics that we all kind of know is important but that we don't really understand why it's important and not as relentless and\nBill Russell was relentless and I mean to an extreme he would get sick before every\nGame they play in Maine was she would throw up in the locker room and in fact if you didn't drop as he made a rough to go throw up for what's wrong with you or because he he cares so much but the Coldplay was a perfect example of why this matters now\nHappened in the in his rookie season and they made the NBA Finals and a game seven against the St Louis hawks and this is one of the first game seven and it was just a huge fan of the credible pressure and Russell was rookie now\nLately game a Boston at one point Lee is about a minute laugh and Boston got a ... down and Russell charge found the court and he tried to dump the ball just stopped the timing and mess\nAnd St Louis ... down in Saint Louis afford him jak Coleman had been sort of hanging back behind the play and they quickly inbound at the Baltimore ... at mid core\nAnd he's in mid court with the ball and a running start now Russell who I'd miss that Doug where was he he was underneath his own basket off the court on the other side he was about Ninety six days from the basket and Coleman was probably about forty five feet with their rights are\nBut when Columbus came to the brim and to make a lay up now this is late in the game they would have taken a lead it might have in the end this blur appeared behind him swat at the ball and it was Russell and he had somehow covered twice the distance that Coleman had in the same amount of time\nI mean no body on in that arena or would have thought he had a chance and certainly must not have even known himself but just that raw desire that he demonstrated over and over again in competition the thing about it and that was consistent for him and what we don't understand is that studies have shown that\nRelentless this highly contagious you know if a group of people in doing something together thinks that one person in that group is giving a hundred percent effort real maximum effort\nThat all of them will raise their own performance if you have someone in your mid like that who was relentless and committed to playing at all times at a hundred percent they're going to be serious marginal gains that you will you'll see in your team work and\nThat's just not something we can quantify so it's not something that we teach but I think it's about time we started\nWe've all been around people who have that kind of drive and focus on what it does do our deem we raise our game we raise the bar and when those people aren't present we don't even know where the bar is\nRight exactly yeah I Know it's funny because there are some emotions that are contagious either group and ...\nAnd we don't even know where the bar is\nRight exactly yeah I Know it's funny because there are some emotions that are contagious inside a group and\nRelentless is contagious always in a good way tough that is always contagious city could wave you showed toughness and\nPersevere and others will too and another one is emotional control or something all these leaders had they had the ability to overcome really difficult personal circumstances and\nNot just compete Wilbur competed at a higher level than ever and Tom Brady of the patriots is a great example of this you know a couple of seasons ago after this whole deflate gate ... served a suspension but he came back and\nPlayed one of his greatest season but even after they won the super bowl and it's a credible come back again to land a falcon\nWe find out that his mother has been undergoing chemotherapy you know and it had been diagnosed with cancer that season so he was going through that and he never said a word about no one knew about it\nAnd it gives you had the control to put that away and to play as hard as it could mean is playing a deal with separately and\nNo doubt we're going to get to breathe in a little bit because it's such a fascinating chapter in your book but let's talk about one more basketball player because I don't think he gets the credit he deserves Tim Duncan San Antonio spurs talk about Tim Duncan who is\nShe is a very unusual guy he was a great swimmer I really had a incredible talent could have maybe even been an Olympic swimmer but\nYou know the hurricane came in and destroy the local pool and I bought the same time his mother passed away and you know you had these hard knocks and then we started picking up basketball and was very lightly recruited in fact weight forces Wyoming the schools that really took seriously is very skinny kid and just hadn't grown into his body\nBut you know he he got there and really matured and became a really hot and the prospect but yeah I don't think anyone really thought that that he was going to become the star that he was or that he would develop skills the way he did but\nThe thing that's fascinating about tend to there's two things I think there's so much about him that is instructive for leaders but I think the the most important thing really is the way he played and I he had the talent to dominate the NBA in terms of score you know on any of the famous cardio statistics but\nIf you look at his total it's really amazing to me some years he was very prolific score some years it was not his blocks and rebound and other things we're we're off the charts\nHe would change his position on the court and play different position the pending on the makeup of the teen\nIt just showed that he had the same quality that rock ... which is that he ... he didn't care what numbers were what you thought of him or whether he got on the cover a magazine he only cared about the team winning and he would do whatever grunt work needed to be done and he would change his role to that\nBut the thing about Tim Duncan that really every once in a study in the way he communicates\nI was completely surprised when I looked at these cats and because the first thing I thought the first way that you know what I mean it team is is with us speech give a big speech right you motivate them with words and none of these ... speeches and they did not like to do with some purposely avoided it\nAnd I did not understand that I didn't understand how they communicate effectively with the team is how I went right to Duncan begins if you've ever watched him to give an interview you know [laughter] you're not\nA charismatic guy he sounds like he's getting a cold and asking the wings answering questions you just have no motion ... doesn't come across as a charismatic person so how do you communicate well she talks a lot but it's a different sort of communication he's always working the room talking\nCome across as a charismatic person so how do you communicate well she talks a lot but it's a different sort of communication he's always working the room\nTalking individually to one person one on one incredible intense stairs uses his eye contact and gestures and touch to communicate very intense with people and he listens as much as he talks a lecture you listen and\nHe had his interactions all the time and he has them in the moment especially when someone has done something wrong or need courage that twenty strings attached and\nWhen I realized that the spurs talk more than any team I've ever seen and they're always talk on the floor on the bench caught the communication and this creates an atmosphere everyone\nFeels like they can contribute to feel heard and they also feel like they have to account for themselves and all the problems that team had were dressed in them all nothing ever faster this talkative style that they had allowed them to address the problems in the moments in the past and\nThat's why they were so good for so long as finding made the playoffs in Nineteen consecutive seasons that a credible revolving cast of players\nAnd won five championships had the greatest launcher warning percentage an NBA history it was because that that whole climate that Duncan created you know allowed them to slide new people and got them talking and solving problems so even though it didn't always have the best talent or\nCertainly not the most money they were the most dominant team of of their era and yeah\nAnd we're talking to Sam Walker author of the captain class I Want a terrific series the stats for Tim Duncan wherever you might put them in the pantheon great Nineteen consecutive playoff five championships and the best winning percentage in National Basketball association fishery\nBy the way if

stories it's a special place were students study all the things that matter in life\nIt meant something everyone understood who she was on what she was all about and it had great power when she did it in competition made the teen better\nAnd let's talk about football now and and two teams in particular first the Nineteen seventies Pittsburgh Steeler teams who is jak limber and why did you include them in this book most folks think of Terry Bradshaw when they think of that power Steeler team why was jak Lambert the guy you focused on\nThe really the heart and soul that team was defense I mean it was an extraordinary historically great defense and that was really the uh the unit that drove that team forward and just look at the moment to jak Lambert showed up I mean this use of never won the super bowl before he got there and uh\nYou know never and now they're you know they want or I think than any other NFL team and you know they are uh they are really a creation of Lambert tenacious style and his aggressive play and his relentless\nJak glamour was a player who had an understanding of something that all these easily captain new to some extent but I think he was probably the best example of it\nThey understood the power of non verbal communication of just gestures they understood that there were moments where they needed to do something in full view their team that which\nCommunication of just gestures they understood that there were moments where they needed to do something in full view their team it that would show their level of commitment a passion in that were transferred to them and allow them to play hard and\nJak labor was famous of course for a you know he lost a couple of teeth in high school playing pickup basketball and he\nHad a static dentures that he wore in public but he would take it off on the field so they end up toothless [noise] you know mouth and he and he would scare people so that was part of it but my favorite jak laboratory that I think shows you a genius of his leadership was that\nThey were playing a game I don't believe in Nineteen Seventy six and they had won the super bowl but they started one in four people were written them off like it's over for the Steelers and they had to win this and they had to beat the Bengals and\nYou want to play uh probably the five game as career in terms of number of tackled the recovered fumbled he basically accounted for most of the teams points singlehandedly so it wasn't a credible game but on the middle of the game\nHe had a came to the game you gotta cut on his hand and he managed it up and you know he went out there and of course the band just failed in the blood starts burning out it was all over uniformity pants I mean he was a mess\nI tracked down one of the trainers I asked him why didn't you know you just reroute that band is when it came off the field or changes uniform and have time or something and you said\nYou're standing jak Lambert love having blows you know for me I understood how powerful that message was and how uh how much ... summit play and how much it to me is opponents and\nUh he he did that on purpose and jak labor did all kinds of things that might seem create your own hands but when you listen to talk about it and he always says look these were calculated acts these were things that I did a you know on purpose because I understood the power that they would have understood the effect here to have on the team and\nYou know that's one of the reasons that that was so good so consistently grade in one for Super Bowls and six years no team is done\nAnd what a great story telling and when we come back the final segment with Sam Walker more stories that come off the road the captain class this is our American story

straight between your lifestyle choices and\nYou're typically the bigger chains are not going to carry the more expensive ones they typically don't\nAnd the quality does matter that the challenge is is that there's not a big regulatory agency over supplements and the quality of them so you really have to go on brand names that you trust and for for my\nI mean just from my background in it and you know we have our own line and I have made in the end of the chemist and people that make them and I'm a real big fan of of knowing that no one that quality\nBecause\nWhen people come to me or they go to my one of my companies are online companies or whatever and they want to buy something they they're expecting the best they're expecting supplements that work that if they're feeling a certain way or they're looking for something in a certain quality they're going to get it and you pay a little bit more for that it just is what it is\nNow when I put a twelve dollar bottle of cod liver oil and may probably not\nBecause you they there's no way to guarantee that it's mercury free that it doesn't have some form of mercury in there which most fish oils do\nAnd the right kind of vitamin D like you're talking about that kinda stuff matters because you want it to absorb properly you want to digest properly and you want to use I mean when I take a tablespoon cod liver oil for example and I do it every day\nI Want to make sure that I'm going to absorb at least Ninety percent of it I mean you're always going to waste out some guy but I I Would rather pay a little bit extra knowing owners or Ninety percent of what I'm going to take in versus\nGetting a cheaper version and you'll use thirty percent of it because a lot has fillers and excess mercury and\nAll those different things\nSo that's kinda my take on it I I always would spend a little bit extra to get to a better quality and I would always stick with that in order to natural is good brand\nAnd when he named it's a really good brand so I mean yeah there's there's you want to stick with companies you trust and you want to stick with quality and the reason I mean with what we do in the clinics and whatnot\nSettings that that are prefer a local providers and all that we have we're real big on blood work and I'm not a big fan of just taking supplements except for the foundational for you know the multi cod liver oil ... robotics and the enzymes not a big fan of doing that with out using some kind of\nBlood work except for those for so for example people that want to look into different ... and they want to do different things why are you taking them because if you got certain blood tests that say you need them then you you should take them but you can see there before and after and I'll tell you that would generic vitamin brand\nThat the numbers and blood worst don't change they just don't and that that's a great indicator that pretty much what you've been taking his garbage\nBut I'll tell you that if you researched it and use the right kind of vitamins and minerals I mean blood work will radically\nRadically change and that's a good marker it's a good marker of\nWhat's going on inside the body and so\nIt's just something to think about so long story to tell you this is that the brand names count quality counts you're gonna pay a little bit more for it but it's worth it's your body\nPain our pay
