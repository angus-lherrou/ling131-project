we will have to fact check that we don't want to be fake news about the whale blubber I Do think\nHaving watched the movie fight club years ago where Brad Pitt is making soap and I do feel like they talk about using fat maybe human fat for soap which is odd to think about oh I'm not sure that that's true it's true that that was in the movie it's true that that was the claim being made but I don't know well blubber for the uh the ...\nThat is good at Jessica have you seen the video of the Canadian karate kid\nUm I don't think so yeah All right let me we're going to kind of take our time with this okay let me describe him to you in full\nYou don't have to close your eyes but You're welcome to I'm a good nice and slow here okay so we're in Canada they give a guy probably late twenties [noise] pardon me late twenties early thirties\nLips pierced oh wait both of them is bottom lips ... okay a little bit of facial hair he's got glasses kind of a dark ... glasses dude he's wearing a purple hoodie\nAnd he works with a hair salon get the heads up the no the hook\nThe dude he's wearing a purple hoodie\nAnd he works with a hair salon gay heading up the no the guy I don't think that he's ... he's got the zip up I got windbreaker purple thing with the smog sarcastic hipster smile on his face\nCanadian karate kid roundhouse kick a pro life protester\nHe says he's trying to kick the phone out of her hand he missed the phone [laughter] kicked the girl [noise]\nHere's what I don't understand by all accounts they would appear that he's there to support pro choice people right he won ... that he is here a defender of women right how's the show that he gets caught on camera basically dropped kicking in the face [laughter]\nA pro life support [laughter] [noise] so he's there I Would imagine looking for a date he cut fair he's a Canadian karate kid he has a purple hoodie on this look on his face and the woman holding the camera that gets kicked\nIs them she herself is pro life she is filming some pro choice protesters he doesn't take to that he looks at her sticks his tongue out to one side like look how cute I Am and he's so what\nYou're saying is if if a girl gets raped in at this and that and the baby should be\nKept alive and she's like yes it's a baby why would you kill the baby I'm Sorry that this rape habit you know it it was all about twenty five thirty seconds long and then instead of continuing with the debate did get this bizarre grin on his face\nSix just hung out to one side like he's Michael Jordan prepare to do a slam dunk from the for the free throw line\nMan does around the house karate\nKid kick not kicking the [laughter] the woman's hand but didn't know woman to the\nGround well okay wait in his defense is that he was trying to kick the phone out of her head and the defense he offered and she's laying on the ground\n[laughter] if if that's your ultimate goal is to get the phone out why not just like snatch it\nWhy not leave it alone is that your phone service and let's just those picturing it lets our sanity read right why why go to the roundhouse kick 'cause he's a karate kid I don't want to know impressed the women who were there I don't quite know what do you think that it worked okay well [laughter] I mean here's the\nThing I realized with men when they do something stupid it's usually because they've tried it on someone else before and it worked right so if he's in a crowd of one and he's probably thinking well this is work before I'll just do it again I think\nLet me let me adjust to that a little bit I think what happens is guys who do things to impress saw someone else do\nIt okay and it ... so he did actually have a guy who had the skills and he was like wow that was born and bred them fried I Am going to try that he's going to give it a whirl and it failed it didn't do so well\nBecause we have video like right of it he has been identified he's been\nFired from his job and he very well may face criminal charges he's trying to be a hero of women he's a a pro choice kind of Fela but he kicks basically upside the head the pro lifer is all caught on video\nThey identify him he loses his job and now face may face criminal charges so wow take that karate kid art to the phones we go David welcome\nTo the Ford faction Hi go ahead or not [laughter] I gave us a crowd of gifts or a per se values and um\nHi go ahead or not [laughter] I give us a crowd of gets oriental per se guys and I'm Out in its over\nNo good at all I'm not too oh five nine four one one on one one toll free one eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three and I mentioned that with the sec cabin are confirmation the Senate voting fifty one forty nine to advance the nomination looks like we'll get a vote\nAs early as tomorrow as the nomination clears a key hurdle and Fox News making the rounds and talking to different senators Jeff Flake voted yes Susan Collins voted yes Democrat Senator Joe Manchin voted yes as well\nLisa Murkowski voted no might be a little bit fun I'm next half hour to take some golf kind of we talked about how it feels like a game day and offer\nYour predictions ... which way is it going to go or if it comes down to a fifty fifty tie\nI guess the question in per se\nI guess the question in her for her was like who saying\nOkay well why didn't they ask like like ... on on the person to say what and I asked where's the people on the job guys came into all that we were the one they treated so wherever they said okay so like who ... you can't remember who drove you back and forth\nSo you feel like he wasn't question well enough at the hearing there on the Senate floor is that what you're saying\nYeah I it's which I'm hearing that position and why wouldn't they asked ... questions like I've been before\nOut and they didn't ask her any crowding but if you're referring to the Democrat side because they're not interested in the truth I think I Know that you know if they were interested they would have asked her hand with Republicans\nWere afraid to come across as anti woman when ever made and the prosecutor in there and meantime it's the the pro choice karate kid who's kicking the women so ah talking about violence on the left to the phones Adam welcome back to the Ford action\nI think yeah I just wanted to see if you guys not only on a\nOn the Ford faction Facebook but again when Jessica comes back at three on the line y'all puts a thought to the office number for all Josie\nAre up there so that we can bombard his office and let him know he's gone and I'll go ahead and stick it up here on the air for all of us who can't wait to get back home and check the check the page [laughter]\nNot a bad idea hey thank you they're at and we appreciate is support faction two oh five nine four one on one on one one toll free one eight six six five five one Ninety nine\nThirty three recipe also just here today Clark go right ahead\nNow so\nI I don't know if I really want to disagree with what Matt said are just taking a little further you know he said the Democrats were worried about roe versus Wade yeah they're rallying cry right now but that's not what they're worried about\nWhat are they worried about\nTheir ideas are so bad that even though they control almost all the media cases twelve schools colleges I can keep going on even though that control all that they cannot get their ideas past sue an actual legislative body\nSo the courts have them their legislative venue for at least the last fifty years right and when you have a conservative majority on the Supreme Court that goes away for them and that's the reason they are so desperate here\nYou know Rosie weight is just that that's what rallying cry that they can get their base fired up about\nBut that's not really what they're about right now\nI think that's a good point because there there's a strong potential that roe v Wade in the future should cannot be confirmed it was a possibility that they can be overturned but even if it's not even if it's not Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court\nIs still going to be um a major influence on the legality of of how we're governed for decades to come potentially\nYes or no I Do have a question here and it's right up a question I don't have a clue is Lisa Murkowski going to be primary because of this or can she maintain that see a state of Alaska if she votes no tomorrow\nYeah I Would think she could probably maintain that seat simply because it is of no surprise she was considered a swing vote to begin with and\nI think she could probably maintain that seat simply because it is of no surprise she was considered a swing vote to begin with and um you know she ended up voting no I don't think that's necessarily going to surprise the people of her state they like or to this point so I don't think she's in\nGrades political danger or I might be wrong on that but I think it's different than let's say if you had another more conservative a\nRepublican who who maybe by surprise voted no\nOkay and then one last question she lose all committee appointments and whatnot because of this and she'd be put on for a minute what train detail or something\nWell [laughter] I mean I guess it's possible I Would tell you after her no vote after the Senate vote today even though she voted no her colleagues came and shook her hand they have great respect for her they're not surprised\nBy her vote and I think they still believe they can get a confirmation even without her her yes vote so I don't think she'll be ban is just yet\nOkay well just was hope for [laughter]\nI beg your mark game you're next\nOn the Ford faction two oh five nine four one one oh one one toll free one eight six six by five one Ninety nine thirty three games go right ahead\nIt's J.\nO. Kara welcome to the show Douglas [laughter] why still her games are ... go ahead\nJames at it [laughter]\nOkay oh go ahead I'm Sorry Oh yes yes yes yes\nIt's a liberal talk that ... that that girl and the head that\nThis was in Toronto so this happened to ... yeah yeah but what a tough guy riding one tough guy with his purple honey\nOut I ... I see somebody like let's sell coming out of it what it would have fallen here\nYeah I think you're right I didn't see him trying to kick a man he kicks a woman holding a phone\nAt a choice pro life rally sort of thing there's a disagreement on the sidewalk if they want to have words fine but he had his tongue sticking out like he's Michael Jordan he had this stupid look on his face he's wearing a goofball\nPurple hoodie and yeah he kicks the woman like he's the karate kid roundhouse kick in the mid to kick the phone out of her hands city kicked through in the shoulder knocks into the ground he's been identified he's lost his job now may face criminal charges\nI Hope I Hope at home and I'll tell him I don't really know how fat or Canada but it got it could be down for that but it's out of ... thoughts on this gentleman like myself come out on it with baseball\n[laughter] bag you have James James James Bagian where the guy I Do\nYes and here's what I'd say I mean I'm not condoning violence I Am not I don't want anybody to get beaten down\nBut I agree you hears oh sorry Jim we'll get to see her second well here's what I was going to say you hear about in in prison okay now what are you in for [laughter] you don't want to be the kind of person I'm here because I kicked a woman you know they had right yeah I Do not want to be your claim to fame All right Jim go right ahead buddy\nWell first off I Want to say that when I first heard a young lady on the air that share with you I pictured are just as I saw a picture in it and attract a self confident intelligent go so I mean\nIn in my job is exactly what how I picture that only ever happens [laughter] well no and then I actually met you I don't recall when she\nIn my town is exactly what how I picture that only ever happens [laughter]\nWell no and then I actually met you I don't recall when ... [laughter] anyway yeah I and and your just basically what I pictured it my mind when I heard you on the air but anyway uh I agree with you this\nGuy should not get a beat down but he should definitely do some serious jail time salt as an assault yeah and you know this whole thing to me and\nI Am so glad to finally see I'm an outspoken person I felt like it is I Know sugar coach stuff and I'm so glad to finally see a lot of the people in power mainly the Republicans are some of the others even some of the commentators are actually telling it like it is about\nAbout how evil\nThe Democrats are and and it it's not something that happened overnight this has been this way for years and people have been sugar coating it and give it a kid gloves\nAnd you're making excuses for him and Lisa Murkowski I actually met her and her father father was governor of Alaska when I was up there\nAnd one of the reasons that I think people voted for her 'cause he was pretty conservative fell a but the one of the things that the status in Alaska how many liberals or were you would think the last frontier would be I don't like the wild wild west you know and the but half the judges up their smoke dope\nOr they turn people lose that they were not top friendly uh it's really a tiger list out name\nEnvironment in Alaska that that would take you by surprise if you're up there\nYou know it's interesting that you and I know the thrust of your call was amount about do but\nThe more we hear about people the more I think probably more people do it then will admit to it I'm sure it it really is crazy people had these strange views is bad\nAnd then you can find out that they've been ruining his oh prime are taking baggage him we appreciate the call it's a Ford faction phone number here nine four one one one one toll free one eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three no sugar coating it the economy is booming give you some headlines about that next\nThe Ford faction making radio great again\nDo you want to melt fat yet Tony didn't have the body you always want it then you need to check out higher and try fitness through high intensity interval training and nutrition education I even tried to get help and ... and gain muscle I even tried to currently looking for forty ... we want to participate\nIn a free six we challenge that is guaranteed to get you resume with that challenge you get accustomed to plan\nPersonal accountability grocery list and so much more\nAs long as you read your weight the challenge is absolutely\nFree contact your closest tried today to find out more\nGuys this is Thomas talk from ... we're talking about our service milk meals which is middle forever but you can pick up on Monday afternoon so what we do is we have meals and we have to ... pounds you could take it home and have food", "city": "Birmingham"}
