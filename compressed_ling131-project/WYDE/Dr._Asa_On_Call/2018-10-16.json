I\nWas told to stop\nIn about two thousand our co sold out to BP and BP decided they didn't want to do that will bury\nWhich led to Dennis dumps deciding to take an early retirement package this heart and he moved across the state to Texas and hope to start a consulting business [noise]\nA year into it it wasn't working out so well and so we called a friend from his old church in mid ...\nDennis Johnson who just happen to be the president you know [noise] and read petroleum Johnson decided a gift selves five hundred dollars a day to console thunder rather humdrum project\nBut a year goes by and Henry petroleum is offered the opportunity to drill on a former our co lease only two to three miles from where else had is experiments\nAnd so\nThey called the men\nAnd we got Dennis Phelps this show is\nHow he did it with our co and so\nWe did it that way and then we got better and better at it we build it too well sixty miles apart and they both turned out really good wells\nTypically when you're outlined the boundaries of an oil field it's also a\nMall [noise]\nOne mile or is it the most so we had a huge field\nAt sixteen miles wide Jim estimate that it had about three\nBillion barrels of oil in it which would have made it the largest discovery in the area in the years [noise]\nAnd we thought that maybe the whole\nMiddle base it would be good for the will vary so we started renting at really in different places and it turned out good\nAnd so they wanted more land in the area to explore\nAnd they had to do it all in secret so that their competitors warning catch on\nThey weren't even allowed to tell their closest family and friends about their new endeavor geologist and engineers were told the key maps and well ... locked in their desk drawers only to be taken out would need in gyms seven to so called land ... seven freelancers\nOne out poring over ... records in county courthouses hunting down the names of the landowners in the area\nAnd had to convince them to lease the mineral rights below their land if there was something there the landowners would get a nice piece of the action to twenty five percent of all oil and gas revenue from their land\nAnd they\nGot a lot of land [noise]\nWe acquired [noise] three hundred and thirty thousand acres\nA tremendous and that that notion that I've ever heard anybody leasing that's about twenty square miles and then we drill down here [noise]\n[noise] most in that I've ever heard anybody leasing that's about twenty square miles and then we drill down and [noise]\nAnd they'll be Monday the latest they couldn't believe that we were actually making really good wells bus we put it in very very feels [noise]\nPeople said it\nSeems just stealing spray very well they're not very good and didn't know it was a new technique a new way of\nDoing it [noise] we were making a lot of money [noise]\nSo for three years we had it all to herself [noise]\nNow what we're not drill two wells sixteen miles apart we discovered over a billion barrels of oil which is a tremendous amount of oil and I said it was going to be about three or four billion barrels of oil come out of this field and I was wrong it's about thirty or forty\nBillion barrels of oil has it's going to come out of the field\nAnd we had ten rigs running at one time and a hundred people and we said we don't like big\nOr I didn't know the names of all the people in our company so we decided to sell so we did we sold out to count Joe and we started\nA foundation where we can give back to the city that gave us so much\nThe mission of the Henry foundation is refreshing for how short simple and to the point is\nFocusing resources to change lives\nThat's it [noise] it says it all [noise]\nPutting posting resources to change lives by I Believe that you should talk in five for journalists and whenever I talk to the Lord's he's very direct and doesn't speak in very many words [noise]\nBut the idea is a stitch and time saves nine you put fences at the top of the class to prevent Boy Scouts Girl Scout camp ...\nThose people prevent\nBoys and girls from going astray\nAnd instead of paying for this because ... says are extremely expensive\nYou can say ten lives at the top of the hill and so you don't have to do all this ambulance at the bottom of the hill [noise]\nGym could have held on to his discovery for longer and potentially made more money from it but the price of oil was at the high price of one hundred and forty five dollars a barrel\nAnd you wanted to make sure that his employees would benefit from the fruits of a high sales price that this would generate board ended up being five hundred and eighty four\nMillion dollar\nThe top twenty probably got over a million dollars each\nAnd the rest of them got a three or four times their yearly salary so we made a lot of people happy when [laughter]\nPlus for gym working was never really about making money\nAt least not in the way\nWe weren't really interested in making a bunch of money\nBut uh I don't take that back I was interested in making a bunch of money because of the nation and use the money we started back over with twenty people\nAnd then got it going again did very well in two more years so that again\nThen from then it was hard to get back in after that [noise] we finally got back in and now we're going very strong and we have about fifty people right now [noise]\nWhat we're doing in the industry is it providing cheap fuel\nTo heat homes and\nProvide fuel for cars to ah [noise]\nThe industry is it providing she feel to heat homes and and I feel for

has our story of the song segment\nAnd we're not going to tell a story of this song so it's a heck of a song\nAnd we tell stories of songs\nThat story themselves by the way the opening lyrics of that song you just heard met my old lover in the grocery store\nThe snow was falling on Christmas Eve you want to hear what happens don't you and we've all been there to meeting that person that we broke up with a person we went to school with maybe wanting to avoid maybe wanting to see it ten and a\nPersonal songs leader of the band stands out is one of the info birds most treasured song which originally appeared on the singer songwriters Nineteen eighty one album the innocent age\nIs photo birds loving tribute to his musician father\nLawrence ... wrote this in two thousand three about his dad he was a musician and educator and band leader I was so gratified that I was able to give him that song before he passed on\nPogo ... that died in August of Nineteen eighty two but not before this hit song made him a celebrity with numerous media interviewers interested in him as inspiration\nHere's the info Byrd speaking about his single leader of the band in Nineteen Ninety One I think I could only\nIt would have been\nWhat that meant to my father\nAnd to me there's no way I could quantify that or even explain it um\nMy father passed away over ten years ago now and\nThe five that or even explain it\nMy father passed away over ten years ago now and\nHe he got to hear that song he got to see this enjoyed the success of that so\nPeople were calling him on the fall and interviewing him and his last days\nYou know who is this mandate of the band you\nAnd he just he loved that and I loved that 'cause I I respected him so much I mean he gave me everything I Am really my mother and he we're both musicians and\nThe idea of being a living legacy is really the truth\nI don't think I'll ever be as accomplished musician as he was\nI've had a different gift came to me in a different way I've been able to reach and touch people who saw [noise]\nAnd that what is probably touched more people more deeply than anything I've ever done\nAnd by the way don't we all want to have our sons and daughters speak that way about us again that's why we do these stories folks because you don't hear him anywhere else\n... music was powerful in its simplicity he didn't rely on the volume of his voice to convey as emotions instead they came through in the soft tender delivery and his amazing lyrics\nHere's Ryan explaining where the book's title came from\nThe late Nineteen thirties there was a British literary critic name's Sheryl Connelly and he had never really been successful himself as a writer or he desperately wanted to he knew many successful writers had actually gone to school at George Orwell\nAnd so he wrote this book is a book of literary criticism and and basically as premises how many of the books that my friends are writing that I Am trying to write that any writer is publishing ... how many of them will be around in ten years he felt like ten years was the mark of literary greatness\nIn the industry we recall any book that last for more than a year to recall them perennial write a book that's lasted for ten years would be a very big success\nBut the irony is if you pull up of the New York times best seller list and you go to the the fine print at the bottom it says among the categories not actively track this time our perennial sellers so there's this term\nWe know that these books that that last and last and yet most of our focus in the industry whether we're making books or music or movies is about new things\nIt was in two thousand Fifteen actually for the first time in the music business that catalog albums officially out sold new releases\nAnd so we know that the things that were made a long time ago if you think of many of your favorite books and movies and TV shows and restaurants many of them are not brand new it's actually the ones that have really stood the test of time that we return to over and over again\nAnd yet it it's strange where most of the energy in these industries go and so what's so fascinating about cereals connelly's serve journey as\nHe's writing about this but then can he actually do it right you know he's writing a book about creating lasting enduring work well I I was fascinated by the idea of like could could you actually do it was he sort of like a\nLiterary Babe Ruth could he hit the ball where he set out to to hit it where he pointed it and told the crowd or the picture that he was going to hit it\nAnd the book it it it never became a sort of a massive\nCultural trendy sensation but it did endure you know it it was published in Nineteen thirty seven and then in ... through a World War through political revolutions through bad divorces new fashion styles massive technological disruption and so many other things that if\nIt was given a second edition ten years later so Nineteen forty seven or Nineteen forty eight it was published\nAnd then in two thousand eight it was published and its third edition and it's still reading today and and here I Am talking to to you guys about it and so it's a book that's outlived him and almost everything else published at that time\nIt's earned the author a cult like following among fellow writers and creative\nAnd I think what's so impressive is that he set out to achieve this thing and he and he did it he has another quip you said you know I like my my work to outlive a dog\nSet out to achieve this thing and he and he did it he has another quip you said you know I like my my work to outlive a dog or a cat and it is interesting how how many books\nAnd projects that creative kill themselves to make and how ephemeral most of them are\nJames solitaire is one of my favorite novelists I was reading one of his books not long ago and on the back which wouldn't it wouldn't have been written by him but it it described as novels is having a sort of him perishable freshness and I I just love that idea I I Love the idea of making something\nPerennial some thin\nHim perishable something that stands the test of time\nAnd by my goodness when we're watching Shawshank Redemption on TV or the godfather for Ninety it's time we know we're watching perennials right and they give us more satisfaction that so much of the new stuff that we know who's going to be old stuff really fast\nHere's Ryan sharing some stories from his own background that prompted them to create books and other work the stands the test of time\nI've always had this lifelong fascination with things that were old when I was a teenager of everything I liked was all my favorite bands\nAnd release their albums decades before I was born um they were still going strong by the time I came around I I remember picking up the great Gatsby in high school and thinking how incredible it is that this book that was written to be a critique of the Jazz Age right it was a timely periodical\nCould have endured and and somehow been so so timeless and and true even to a a random high schooler in California you know sixty plus years later and\nMy first job as a writer I was a research assistant to an author named Robert Green wrote a book called\nThe forty laws of power this was a book that didn't hit the best seller lists until a decade after it had come out and and yet quietly and slowly it sold more than a million copies and been translated into dozens of languages I I Would guess that in a a hundred years from now people would still be reading it\nUm another book that I worked on you know got a Seventy five hundred dollar advance which is tiny advances what they call a kiss off advance in the industry meaning that the the lowest amount of money they can give you without hurting their feelings and they hope you'll go away and that book went on a cell over a million and a half\nCopies and and you know now ten years after its release it sells about three hundred copies a week and\nI went on as a marketer became the director of marketing that American Apparel and it was interesting that that this company which will hundreds of millions of garment\nEvery year the best selling items worthy items created at the beginning of the company's trajectory it was ... and they had this mission of making making things that would be sold in Vinton shops in the future and I I just love this idea\nOf making things that can last with with my own books you know perhaps the readers haven't haven't heard of me or they certainly wouldn't have seen me on the New York times best seller lists are for the most part and yet quietly and and like clockwork they sell about\nFive thousand copies across the various titles that every single week and the marketing for them has long since\nFinished and yet you know surprise or one of my books did appear on a best seller list last week\nA year after it had come out and so it's this idea of making things that resonate with people that really solve some problems for them you know the the best books to have written as uh\nYou can things that resonate with people that really solve some problems for them you know the the best books to have written as a creative would have been what to expect when you're expecting because every day\nIn every part of the world or a couple of gets pregnant and they don't know what to do and so I'm I'm fascinated by that kind of work the the the work that indoors and it it saddens me that so much work that is made doesn't indoor and so I was fascinated by this question of sort of what similarities\nTo these works have in common\nAnd I set out I interviewed a all sorts of of authors and editors and producers and a\nMarketers and entrepreneur is and and I tried to get to the bottom of what makes things last and I you know I found a few things I think first does that work needs to be unique if it it's very hard for it to endure if it is not\nDefinitive if it if it doesn't stand out stand alone and yet on the other hand\nIt should do a very simple job I think one of them went to my editor said to me one time she said Ryan it's not what a book is\nIt's what a book does and by that she meant it has to do something for the reader it's not necessarily about what it does for the creator it's about what it does so what to expect when you're expecting it it helps you with this difficult time in your life and and I think that's what the best\nThe best work does you know it's this this question this is a blank\nThat does blank for black if you can't fill those in as a creator you're going to have a lot of trouble I I was\nInterested in the test that max Martin one of the greatest songwriters certainly the most prolific and popular signers of all time it's written for everyone from Celine Dion to the back street boys to Bon Jovi to Taylor Swift and his subjects his\nMusic to what he calls the car test you gets in his car in Los Angeles and I put the top down he puts it on the stereo and he drives up and down the Pacific coast highway is the music\nAdding to that experience that the idea that even use it is designed to really do something for the audience is something I think that people mess and and so that that's an essential part of this sort of creative process\nAnd when we come back more from Ryan Holiday book perennial seller and my goodness what a fascinating question what makes things less not just our products maybe even a marriage\nHear a lot about Hillsdale College here on our American stories it's a special place were students study all the things that matter in life\nWhat a pain it was to market his books she said I feel like a wretched employee of my former self my former self being the happily engage novelist who now sends me a kind of salesmen out on the road to hawk this book he's out all the fun writing it and I'm the or bastard who has to sell it but\nMaking art for a living as a privilege and one of the obligations of that religion does the selling a there's a line from Peter Till the founder of pay pal he said if you don't see any sales people in your organization then you're the sales person\nWho's going to pitch your work if not you right who's going to sell this than if you're not interested in selling it and so that's what I\nEnded up telling a lot of creative there's no\nMagical from that you can hire there's no magical button and you can press there's no magical\nMedia outlet even being on this wonderful show isn't going to guarantee that my book perennial seller is going to find all the people who are interested in finding it and so if you're not going to do it who will Peter drunk or the management expert who said that each project need someone\nWho says I'm going to make this succeed and then goes to work and does it that that\nHas to be you know so I push create is to think of marketing not even as an obligation but as a essential part of the creative process can you be as creative in your\nAppearances in your marketing and you're\nThen as an obligation but as a essential part of the creative process can you be as creative\nIn your media appearances in your marketing and your ways of getting customers as you were in writing every page or you know developing the\nUh the vintage of wine that you're you're selling or the the boots that you wanted to produce right how can that be as much of a of a canvas to paint on to make something special as\nAs the than you you made itself and a lot of creative fail at this I mean the the the shelves grown with on watched movies and on read books and\nYou know our phones are filled with downloaded music and pod cast that will never get around to see him in that urgency that sense of I've got to make people care about this is really the essential task of the writer or the creative of any kind you know if you build it\nThey will not come that it's not how it works you have to make them you have to invite them one by one it until the crowd is full until the ... the seats are filled and that's why you did this work\nIn the first place right certainly no one slaves away on some creative artistic project purely for their own satisfaction or otherwise why would they've ever released it in the first place and so\nThat idea of of taking ownership of it is the difference I think between something that sells five copies and something that's almost five million copies and I think every artist would rather whether they admit it or not reach five million people than five\nAnd there you have it Ryan Holiday his new book perennial seller essentially answering the question what makes things less from products or\nFrankly to a marriage

you have any suggestions well had blood pressure\nIs a challenge for sure and\nOne thing we got to do with high blood pressure has got to look at your eating habits that's a real important thing to do\nAnd it all starts with not doing a lot of processed foods you want to do equal amounts here's the key equal amounts of lean protein sources like chicken fish to be for eggs low glycemic carbohydrates in the form of fruits and vegetables and then the healthy fats almonds walnut cash ...\nThat's always the keep putting those together\nMake the difference and then you know again you got your fat she carbohydrates and your protein and that balance is there anything else from from the blood pressure perspective it's the body's getting everything that it means you're getting plenty of potassium rich foods which there are in that sodium is cut down which it is\nThen from a heart perspective you can do very well you know the other piece\nTo look at it so important in this is your exercise and again for heart health ways of doing things it's great to just exercise I mean twenty minutes a day of walking four or five days a week is great\nBut at the end of the day you want to make sure that you're looking in some other options like rebounding which is jumping up and down the mini trampoline or\nAdding in just a different ways of training and exercise and putting those together to make a big difference to me that\nIs always a big key into being and focusing on that\nIs a key to now nitric oxide there's been studies done on that where the combined now are Janine in central in together and then they combine the two together it creates nitric oxide you know two in the body in a lot of studies have shown\nThat that can help support the blood vessels relax the blood

I\nWake up at least for the phone with her so I usually\nHave to put my pillow\nBecause why and\nThen they being part of my head and neck able to generate put out from the heat\nAnd the two varieties\nOf rice\nAnd well the hormones themselves depending on what's going on I Would have everything checked I always have testosterone check you know of course you want to have 'em your growth hormone estrogen all the estrogen Esther dial estriol as strong project drone I Would have all that looked at\nAnd it can make a quite a big difference I mean all the way around and as you do that and begin working on that and put it altogether that is what can make a difference in your overall profile because\nIn hormones again they can fluctuate that's obvious but with the testing you can get done and you can find out what's Hi and what's low if that's even the issue is ... is another big one having your thyroid checked making sure that that is functioning at its peak level in all these kinds of keys\nReally make a big difference I Would focus on that makes sure the bodies worked in a way that it needs to and then look at your diet because if you got a lot of carbohydrates in your diet\nAnd you were creating a lot of blood sugar related issues that can cause\nQuite the issue I mean quite a challenge really when you're when you're looking at it because with hormones if your blood sugar if you have not not that it's diabetes but if you have\nJust a lot of fluctuations that can mimic these clashes that you can get almost like a woman and hot flashes very similar\nSo when you start to stabilize blood sugar keep your fat levels up your in your your dietary fat and then you're putting sources keeping everything balance and everything up can make a big difference over on that's really what I Would encourage you to do\nKind of along the way here and if you do that of course get some testing done blood testing done with your doctor that can make a big difference and then you can find out where the levels are\nThen creating a game plan but yeah I mean could it be hormones it could be blood sugar because there's a lot of could be and that's why the testing\nIs too important because you can find out what the numbers me find out actually what the body means all of that is extremely important okay hope that helps triple eight to eight three Seventy seven to give
