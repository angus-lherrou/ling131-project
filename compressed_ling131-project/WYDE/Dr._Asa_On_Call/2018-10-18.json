saying now will not save you from the common cold just the latest study\nA religious research on vitamin D supplementation they're saying in a healthy adult population the vitamin D will not prevent or reduce severity of common colds said lead author David Murdoch\nOr who's head of pathology at the University of Iowa Tego in New Zealand he said if president know supplement has been shown to perfectly prevent colds who said\nWe need an additional evidence from rigorous studies like hours before making claims about any nutritional supplement potential to ward off the coals no research studies have been published recently in the journal of the American Medical Association about this the vitamin D helps keep the immune system\nFunctioning at peak level several observational studies have shown just adjusted the people with higher levels of vitamins\nOf course have fewer colds and colds are known as upper respiratory infections but to test the association Murdoch and his colleagues recruiting more than about three hundred healthy adults\nFrom New Zealand and they all had normal vitamin D levels started to study half the group was randomly assigned to receive oral vitamin D while the other course got the placebo and those that had the vitamin D\nWere significantly impacted\nSo it does make a difference and vitamin D of course\nIs that wonder nutrient let's
