I was glad we had some name tags goes ah [laughter] things have changed a little bit more changes including me out a lot of a ball weighs a been a guy for radio anyway so uh uh but it was good it was good to be catch up with those guys and I know that's what you\nIt is home India my my daughter just got married in a married young firefighter there and ... yeah beautiful place and mountain has been terrific to me and you know we'll we'll go back there eventually that that's all\nAnd the un firefighter their national while and so you had beautiful place in mountain has been terrific to me and you know we'll we'll go back there eventually that that's how I Know you've been on both sides of so you you actually groom shop out here you know I'm from at more originally I'm going to add to form a new ah you know that's been a lot of time in Iraq growing up in\nA mood immobile when I was fairly young dad worked in sporting goods and they'd all over so I've got you know I'm ... from South Alabama practice law both in Montgomery in Birmingham for I went to Marshall County so I feel like\nI've had a little bit of every bit of the state in may at some point in time and Alabama's home we're not even any I went to University of North Carolina right or the desire was always come back to Alabama because Alabama's home\nBut it is it's a beautiful voice and we appreciate you how long have you been in office\nHas only it's going on twenty months ah was appointed back in February of two thousand Seventeen which seems like forever gal in many ways in\nA been a remarkable journey I'm a career prosecutors basically kind of where I come from and so you walk into the role you know people look at the age is on the top top and so very comfortable there but what I think is the most exciting is the way that we had the opportunity eighties office\nTo impact issues outside of public safety you know summer I relate to you know to landowners and those who care about our environment in the state uh and do it in a responsible way you know we've been engaged in issues impact them as well\nSure and and more of the most pressing issues of weight as the waters of the United states rule tell us about that are more and more the current I mean what's the current status of the law\nYou know we saw clearly with ah the EPA under the Obama administration what are you know federal overreach is probably limited term but yeah it's funny a justice clear one time talked about\nUh the fourth branch of government and that's when some of our federal agencies believe they truly are right I'm a much higher authority than than they really were and then what we saw with with\nWith the EPA is expansive definition of the waters of the U. S. so that we were limiting the use of land by landowners in a proper way and\nSo we were involved in our office and being able to push back to say that he PA engaged in significant overreach in that area and we're re please that when\nYou know former a director Pruitt or was there that they rescinded that former Obama era rule in right now are trying to be more responsible but I mean it you know like I'm a product of rural Alabama\nYou know clearly have family that that has been involved in the timber and farming business for a long time those are conservationist I mean these are being I care about the land they want to be responsible with the land\nAt the same time we don't need to be burdened by regulation from from the federal government and so what I think that will see is an opportunity for a responsible\nRuled come about it protects the waters of this country which we want to be able to do but also recognizes the ride of individuals to use their property and the inappropriate way and so I think it's going to be an opportunity for those that care about this issue to be able to submit comments\nA and they will come forward with a rule that makes a lot more sense for the only people Alabama with people in this country sure\nWho will actually issue that ruin and what do you think that the timeframe might be on some\nOf a I met with a with the person ... managing budget recently that's responsible for sort of authorizing rules when they come out\nUh this is a significant issue in this country and so big deal now yeah and so I think that they will take their time and going forward with it you know the good thing is we suspended the other rule right\nWhich was irresponsible and going back to what was at least a little better version but ah but I'm expecting some time over the next year that will see progress on that front but to the extent that anybody is listening to the show that cares\nYou know you do have the ability summit written comments to to propose rules and so\nThose are available out there for inspections\nThe extent that anybody is listening to the show that cares you know you do have the ability summit written comments to to propose rules and so those are available out there for inspection if somebody needs to be able to find anything contact our office I'll be glad to sort of\nGiven that opportunity but ah we hope that folks will weigh in and that are really feel confident that the Obama administration will do some excuse me the Trump Administration would be something that's responsible because you know what we've seen from them it's in the limited time that President Trump has been in office\nThirty three regulations rescinded for everyone that's been adopted a that's a very positive thing now some of that is low hanging fruit I don't think it'll continue at that rate but yet you know when we see what a you know the federal register which compiles all of this government regulations you know basically being reduced by force\nOr that shows that they are really making a difference in that area but it but this is one of those rules that matter just like some other ones were laying critical habitat that will also say\nRight well Dave says on the show off and that he is for responsible government or you know something this that and and we really believe in individual freedoms and individual rights and\nA lot of those things that the constitution guarantees we don't we don't need government making those decisions for us all the time and that's one of the things that I've read about your record I appreciate that are pretty said that we have\nA somebody that's conservative this fighting for us for fighting for individual freedoms and laws and the I think that's a that's a big help ah for land owners and and just for people in general for citizens in general it's nice to know that you've got somebody on our side is not ... not trying to tell us everything\nThat why did they that's Caprio limited government is ... you know you would you military defense well probably guys are military I think we do law enforcement well knows that the public safety well\nSometimes on government gets involved in issues we screw it up more than we make it better it's why you know even this broader debate that we have going on right now are relating to social media and Facebook's in Google and Twitter is I think if there's a lot that are calling for federal regulation of those entities\nAgain I think we have to be very careful what we do and what the federal government and the state government is involved with right needs to be within the lane clearly needs to be authorized by the constitution and then we need to make sure that we're being able to comply with the laws in a way that allow for people\nTo operate in the year that it allows for businesses to thrive and for individuals to exercise freedoms\nYeah the exactly right if we want the government to claim of our our neighbor's backyard and won't be long before they're trying to clean up hours right on the right phrase you know\nI'm I don't I don't know if\nI've shared this with our with our listeners before but I was job I think job and you might have been at the meeting but we were to were were really involved with about ... associations to great\nGreat great group and a great trade group but also a great lobby group for landowner interest Alabama they are really strong for landowner interest not just tumbling owners but in any landowners and I'll tell you there was a real right before the election and two thousand sixth in presidential election\nI think criticize extended director was was leading a little ...\nAnd he was showing a map of the state of Alabama would probably happen if if you're ... won the election\nAnd just factually the number of new endangered species that they were trying to push through his a political thing you know they just won't in it just it was staggering because we know we have a timber sales vision in our company and what people have to work around environmentally now\nA a geo that state that AOL dot us\nYou know go to Steve Marshall Dutch GOP and uh we just

Marshall bunch minimum wage\nThanks so beyond me back Yes sir thank you have what a good guy I'm so glad attorney general Marshall was in ... it was a great visit with\nThe ... that really was and he's you know this is the land show and I know we get off on a lot of other subjects but you know all this impacts landowners and said oh sure in in our in our citizenry and uh you know he's a he's a solid guy he's the guy when it\nYeah and if and if you don't believe individual freedoms matter or you start taking away stripping away some of those freedoms on the periphery\nAll that translates into your land ownership and what you can do with your private property rights are all those sorts of things matter November six go out and vote for attorney general Steve Marshall and you'll stay with us we got a great gas coming up with Aaron ... with the Alabama Kalamazoo association will join us right after this break [noise]\n\n\nFor the magazine for the American landowner house supporter of the land\nGo away and report the magazines for the American landowners round supporter of the way in show with\nDavid Johnny our publication over the special subscription offer exclusively to land so listeners on this subscribe by\nLand before the dot com codes and show a check out and see the one you're discount America's number one lane magazine\nNine dollar value for totally forty dollar that's sixty six percent saving that way and report dot com ... check out what it was just discount and be sure to check out the window report on Facebook loving way and\nHey everybody this they melt in woodland show are you in the market for your own piece of paradise let my good friends at Alabama at credit hill they provide reliable financing for rural central and south Alabama they offer a wide variety of loans and services to meet the needs of the diverse role and agricultural operations that our territory\nAnd if you don't need a farm but you need a loan for recreational timberland or even among the ... Alabama critic can help you to\nThey want to partner with you they want to be your relationship Linder maybe even a greater incentive album that critics supports the cooperative way of doing business so their members or their stock holders as a stockholder you might be eligible to receive a cash patronage dip it in\nLast year the dividend for most folks was about one percent of their loan balances

had a great first gifts and it was good equally into six second guess immature and but usually friend of\nThe show she's executive vice president\nOf the album McAdams association Aaron ...\nGuys it's great to be back and I appreciate it\nYeah absolutely will tell us you know a ... you know there's so many things we could talk about and uh let's just go first into which on everybody's mind a special down south Alabama this storm damage was talking about the uh the government's associations getting involved\nYeah I'd love to are certainly\nA hurricane Michael Wright habit I'm across the Florida Panhandle southwest Georgia in our producers and the wire grass area and um I was actually down there yesterday and are on Tuesday of this past week and it um it is devastating and in many areas certainly the southeastern corner of eastern county\nI'm In in it it really impacted uh the entire landscape down there um it'll take a lot of people coming together to try to repair damaged um and then also just try to\nTry to face immediate needs down there and our hearts and prayers are with with those those family down there there's farmers down there and from the cattle perspective specifically um it's been interesting\nYou would think that what the storm of that impact the allied death loss and cattle but we actually haven't heard that much at our biggest concern is actually infrastructure so a lot of our producers I was talking to a producer yesterday\nAnd they're scattered out and a lot of areas across across\nThe town that they live in the area community that live in\nAnd they lost thirty miles of how tense ... oh wow yeah so you know a lot of people are scattered out and different different areas you know not one huge pastor a lot smaller pastors and whatnot and so to lose that fence to have the trees down to ... to lease hey that they've put up this summer for the for winter\nSmaller pastors and whatnot and so to lose that fence to have the trees down to lose a Barnes Phillies hey that they've put up this summer for the forever winter feeding\nGoing to be a lot of concern there over the next um next few months into the next few years and so um to try to address that we have set up a hurricane disaster relief fund through our Alabama ... foundation\nAnd you can donate to that uh online at ... dot org dot org excuse me ... dot org slash hurricane relief\nAnd or you can write a check and send it to that money absolutely a hundred percent of it will be used to purchase supplies for these producers that were the hardest hit\nDown there and those areas and um the hope is that we'll be able to take the money that we collect\nAnd match it with our foundation funds that we currently have and so we can get a pretty big chunk of money together in order to to ... certainly federal funding will come into play with a lot of these situations for disaster\nAreas that are named but we know that folks need to get ... they need to get cattle traded they need to uh be able to purchase supplies and whatnot and so anything that we can do to help those immediately we're going to try to try to\nTry to do that in and help our members and help our producers down there\nOne of the things is neat to see a or was made to see a few years ago will now the wild fires out in Texas and Oklahoma Colorado and all those or is this how the Alabama councilman responded to that and did so many things to raise funds\nI Know we went to an auction where to warn towers ... auctioned off\nGo up and then just sending out there and so we talked about it on the show several years ago but\nThese farmers are big their neighbors even though they might not ... it might not be touching Houston guilty but those count them under their neighbors are\nAbsolutely um they they made by their ... and clay county or they you know they may sell cattle here there and maybe they feed cattle in other parts of the state\nUm maybe they talked to people in other parts of the country but we're exactly right or whether it was the blizzard in South Dakota where Alabama we stepped up and tried to help those folks Hurricane Harvey when that came through Texas um we we had some similar type of\nThing so we've helped a lot of our neighbors in other states and really hope and now that it's us um you know hopefully some of that will come back and certainly we've got very very helpful folks here in the state and\nYou're right producer cat um in helping cattle man is is not anything new on the farming community typically comes together when we have tragedy and disaster like this and\nI don't think this will be any different and I'm looking forward to seeing the results of it and just being able to help our folks\nBlush Roy will listen to ... ... ... um issues ... dealing with right now I Know a ... um that we had rental Churchill recently prices or repeal study and and are getting a little bit better and you know what what are some issues that you're seeing rooms but\nWell um I think right now we're before the hurricane came we're actually in a pretty good position um as you mentioned cattle feed her calf prices have been pretty pretty good this this kind of\nRuined that we've had the last last couple of months I'm and we're we're about to get to the end of that quite honestly just season Allie of the of the market um it was a it was a good summer we we had\nYou know is a little scary at the beginning of summer a lot of people experienced a little bit of a drought but then it started raining so I feel like the hey hey production was pretty strong most most producers I think got a pretty good ... put up um you know a lot of folks are starting to to drill seat for winter grazing um and that that will be that would be helpful or going in\nSo I think got a pretty good ... put up um you know a lot of folks are starting to to drill seat for winter grazing um and that that will be that will be helpful or going into the winter months so I think\nAs far as the farm is concerned we're pretty good shape obviously we're watching a you know November sixth elections coming up so we've been actively engaged in that from the political standpoint\nI'm looking forward to seeing the results of all that and I'm with the session coming up next year and then dealing with some things in DC quite honestly uh we work out the at the federal level as well and unfortunately the farm bill to knock it pass\n'em before September thirtieth so we're working through some things with that but I'm really want to be\nHonest I Want to take a minute to to come into our congressional delegation in our in our Senate a senator certainly senator Shelby being the chair of the Appropriations Committee um we're already starting to write some of the benefits of that um although the farm bill that and pass there is a lot of our preparations budgets that did pass that\nReally haven't been done in the timeline that those got done this year I'm In the past and so he has to be commended for that his leadership is shining through and really get some things done in DC and so um I think as we get through this election kind of get through that our primary focus is going to be on the farm bill and seeing it to the finish line\nAnd I'm In Austin and also dealing with a transportation issue that we've been dealing with the in the cattle and the cattle hauling um segment of our industry and um that's something that we are going to keep working on but um it's it's just a lot of things a lot of things going on right now it's busy time of year\nOur professionals no land and land financing first itself provides fast friendly turned around to help you secure your ideal tract of land so far could be your next business venture\nYour next land or temporary investment or perhaps your new get away at first south we will help you know what the farm means to you and make your farm purchased a reality for more information go to first on land ...\nPeople's house England [noise]\nThey were back everybody listen way and show with David Johnny, Johnny B until we got an old friend of a phone one of our great monsters of the land show Mr Ryan vote with land with land think network Ron how're you doing today [noise]\nGood how are you guys\nDoing great you know there are other why listen it's good to have your own and\nFor our listeners out there if you if you've never been to land flippant land thing they were ... does a great job of advertising properties for sale around the country\nOr just a great selection and presented in a way that it's easy to uh easy to to search through and then land think provides tons of great information to people who are buying or selling or or just want to know more about land ownership and Ron Paul is the man he's he and his partner Tate a reading put this together and\nI when I have a question they run as the guy that I call it he does a fantastic job and uh and\nWe always look forward to talking to you about the polls question that comes out the ... poll send let's jump into that Ron tell us what was the question this past month\nThe question was pretty step on which we like to keep a chef or in general or should we get people to engage we don't want to watch shows that are long drawn out and require more different responses and so on but the question was pretty simple and that was the buyer if you were looking to invest a and property\nWhat would you prefer or written specifically recreational property would you prefer something that ... or something that a venture I bought a fixer upper one that you would need to customize to make your own yeah that was that was the that was that you know just washed\nWell when you ask for a simple question if Jonathan ... is right and it is going to be a simple questions that's all they care about ways around but I was really surprised that the answer how did how did the responses go\nWell we got a I broke\nDown a where picture after what Seventy and a half percent wow uh respond that said that they would prefer if the extra for\nThen twenty nine and a half percent or a or B operation\nYeah well that that is surprising to me I I Would have thought that it would have gone the other way honestly I Would have thought more people would have wanted something that they could step right into news\nYeah you know we were talking about ... it'd be interesting to ... to see the socioeconomic level of the responded because this kind of been my personal experiences the wealthier somebody is that the more you know they they are looking for a turkey operation as as a ...\n... says the wealthy or somebody is the more you know they they are looking for a turkey operation as as a whole row and you if you if you like me and John annoying to\nRemember that old cleared you can do their own right [laughter] well\nRun you are ... you have the benefit of having been a lamb broker or before you got into land flip and land thinking uh you know how I'm very rarely show or property to somebody when they don't\nImmediately start talking about what they're going to do when they purchases so that that may be a common thread that runs through some of this discussion\nYeah and I think yeah you're like they've set up they you're dealing with a lot of different dynamic sure everybody's situation is if they're owned by shy and the sale sell side of the of the nation\nI Am she ... she uh she all sides um uh she a situation where you know people like to make their own yeah uh and no two properties especially when we're talking about land or or or or lie\nAnd some people why turkey hunting and then that's that requires a certain thought process some people like a duck or you know you don't have to have some water somewhere right uh you know you you need to bring the dared aren't you got to have to watch\nA if you're going to have a ... a cab and a half hour motives that and and then there's also the chat beat the fun part\nOf a project or we can shape now that we've got a clean slate\nAnd you can sit down and say okay what do we want to do with fish and and it's maybe something to do you plan on doing over ... years or decades a right to build a legacy for your family\nOr not something that you just jump right in no I think she will shift make our society and shifting to a more um a ... bad if it's a share of the more the by the ... kind of\nUm a philosophy where people do have the time to write a spin on it created that that'd be going up from the clean slate they want to just jump right in the ... it's ready to go and\nUh and it after like they like they will shoot gassed new show a bad results for a little bit uh I'm with the job that I read that thought they would be a little bit more\nBlack I Would say more faith in the rye I suppose to to um or the extra for but I think a lot of that also is driven by ...\nYeah it is it's not far fetched they say it generally property that doesn't have improvements August yeah I only got to be cheaper than one that's full of improvements that right um you know but then again you've got to pay for those who shop wanting some people look at it as a long term kind of finding a chi improvements over several years show\nRight well I think that was really interesting question thanks for given southeastern wing group to the uh ability to sponsor that um and just real quick for our listeners um tell us about some of the neat things you just had a recent partnership with some ... who was from around the country tell us about that with land flip\nOh yeah guys were on a mission\nA way we're doing a great things right now I'm you know we'll cover in our backyard a first and foremost is where you are strong here in the southeast which\nAre age the hottest landmark we get a false question on that one to a ... inch states in the southeast spiritual we're in a good spot\nAh but yeah that show the on the edge to them they do it this way it's kind of closed the gap between the buyer that showering in in finance and property and that's another false blushing and we've done in the fashion\nA lot of Irish say that getting financing and that\nThe buyer that showering in in financing property and that's another ... Bush and we've done in the past\nA lot of our site at getting financing and that process is is the most ... of the\nLand ... land process of buying wiring brought a land real estate right show our goal was to form relationships with the farm credit association all of the region is within a starting in our backyard here in Georgia and in the south east and then expanding across the country can show\nWe of a war we've got North Carolina South Carolina\nGeorgia or Alabama Mississippi and Louisiana so we can have that covered ah we've got other states that are coming on board\nA very saying those announcements you will hear a show will just expanding from there so it's great\nThat you had to land a the buyers are an avenue to get information on financing qualification it helps all sort of a showers but brokers exit show\nThey've already started the qualification process before a day or even a before they get out there in the in the thick of things as far as the property and negotiating at a transaction\nSo well one of my favorite things and one of my favorite types of people to do business with the people that we really like and then people that make us money\n[laughter] and ... an average ... consistently makes his money people were found in ... uh our our clients properties for sale homeland flipping around we appreciate\nUh all that you and your team do there and so you can see all the southeastern lingered properties for ... ... dot com and there are some others out there and when you see those go on the southeastern there will be happy to help you go look at it but\nI'm Rob water your Web sites again where can people find a properties for sale through your network\nOr you can go to any of the sites actually I'm a great place to start is land flip dot network\nOr the ... network is a fairly new ... and she said the domain name so land with dot network\nOr no need for that W.

just small\nHowever naive as and I'm not a nice person by nature but just that I can be that way sometimes I'm like oh it's my family and I get it okay there's people that listen to the radio not that she's just the station but other ones that might not have the best you know intentions\nWell and I think the family comparison is good sure you have family members that you do not invited for Thanksgiving that's\nKind of where I was going with this you know and I guess I was just thinking I think about all the people that might be able to come if I spread the word on Facebook I don't know that I was considering that everyone has my address when\nIt comes to ah holidays or whatever you usually don't post that and you don't see much of anybody posted in hey are gathering is is here and it's that this time it address are it's usually done in private ...\nOh okay okay I mean I just see the thing is really last night night before we're making up the garage\nSale signs so we've got a bunch of science we got from ... or whatever and it says garage sale and you can put the date and the time\nAnd then obviously it's got your address on it and you're putting that out everywhere and I'm like well I mean we're broadcasting where we live it's only people who we are but ... you're putting our address out there so I guess in my mind it wasn't that big of a deal but I mean I I get it\nAnd you want random people to come by I Do well yes but at the same time\nOr the people that see your address posted on Facebook and are interested in a yard sale though combat day it's the people with bad intentions that will come after the yard\nOkay on a fan they'll come another day that we're not having a garage sale right yeah and they either possibly not home or went home yeah or when you're awake or when you're not just either way yeah I was just a lapse in judgment I guess\nI'm I was just appalled by that going out I was\nThinking I guess 'cause we're making up the signs and in my mind I'm like oh that her address on the signs you know what difference does it make but you know just one of those things\nMuch your mom's say about it and I mean she ... I mean you know she had\nMixed emotions she was like really 'cause you know I don't know and I thought well I just yeah I think\nThe reach and she's like well that lots of friends and I it's just again I think it's because we kinda have this naive view\nOf things where it's like oh everybody I've met has been so nice you know right and so that's kind of limited perception is is based on my experiences I've not had somebody sending we used to have a girl who worked here another station I won't name names are stations she had I don't know if you call it a salt\nAbortion is is based on my experiences I've not had somebody sending and we used to have a girl he worked here another station I won't name names are stations\nShe had I don't know if you call it soccer but somebody who was very interested in her and who was it well I Can't I don't remember her name know done not here anymore oh before your time\nNo way in which I don't know who it is I may know who it is you don't trust me so they received wants around Christmas Time a package that was probably bigger than I Am\nAnd it was like wrapped to like a serial killer would rapid gift so in theory of killer was inside yes no and I was at the front desk at a time so I'm One who received it and it's like\nCreepy so it's got all sorts of different kinds of wrapping paper on it and then there's yarn is like hot glued all over it and to the point where I thought there might be a bomb and here we even videotaped it because I thought this could be the last moments of my life because when you work at\nThe front desk year screening packaging ... well it could have been rising for all I knew so at some rice and so we go through and rise and so we are going through and we're opening it and ... I thought it was her I said I wasn't sure um\nAnd so we get inside of it and it was literally probably thirty different items of things this person I talked about the idea that that one point she had her car breakdowns they'd gotten her on you know like an extra car battery charger thing\nThere was like a hundred dollar gift gets cartoon toys rise a hundred dollar gift card is on women's clothing store I mean there was at least a thousand dollars worth of things in this bond that is a surprisingly that's creepy it was creepy it was nice and I'm sure she appreciated it\nA great stock or story I was a soccer for a moment you know I'm so needy that if a woman gives me any amount of attention on just hooked I mean I Know at age five Klinger so this is bad I was dating a girl for a long period of time but then we got into that stretch where it was clear we weren't going to be together forever\nBut we're still kind of dating so I'm On the hook birthday timer Valentine right\nThat's the measuring so I go to the mall and it wasn't in my particular town I don't know why I was elsewhere but I'm at some other mall way away from my house\nAnd I go to bed bath and beyond and I walk in there like this cue clerk and I'm like hey can you help me I'm trying to get a friend for I'm getting a gift for a friend and I oh God yes and so she helps me get a candle or something or lotion who even knows but then when she said she doesn't say come back and see us\nShe says come back and see me who has personal that's personal\nNow upon retrospect I'm sure she says that to\nEveryone who I'm ... but in that moment in that moment it struck my soul and [laughter] so that's what this was\nBefore I don't say before cell phones cause they existed but not everybody had one this is what Fifteen sixteen Seventeen years ago\nUm and so I left and I'm just thinking I really think I think she meant when I went to a gas station\nAnd I found a phone booth and I looked in the phone book and I found that number to the store and I caught him I said hey I was in there about an hour ago and you probably don't remember me but you help me with this and you say come back and see you\nListen I don't live in this area but I Would love to take you to dinner oh when you get off work\nAnd she said okay\n\nSo we went somewhere real nice went through all Charlie you know if I had to step up from apple be thrown in the past I wanted to go with like the caramel pie the Charlie and we had a nice time and then she got to shore she's like listen I'm having a great time and let them loose again but\nMy friends and are actually this back when Monday Night natural with the wrestling was on the oh yeah I Would love to stay\nBut I've got to go to Monday Night and I drew in a couple of days and we've got to make posters so I've got to try to go home and make posters and then my roommate heck of a woman the rational and and so we did and I gave her a hug and sadly I never heard from her again\nOh like I Would love to go out again but I have to shave the\nPony exactly so I don't know if she did in fact go see Rick Flair or Goldberg or whoever was the wrestler of the day but uh yeah ... and even if she didn't if that was her maid of excuse I applaud her for it because I'm like hey you're leaving me for a wrestler\nI think that's great\nThat's good that's good to Brussels the kind of guy that ah ... thinks every Hooters waitress at the restaurant is falling in love\nWith a look at the dress for me that that line or as a ... [laughter] anything for me you know I got to take a break 'em like five minutes behind we'll be back right after this law was ruined just\nI got to take a break 'em like five minutes behind we'll be back right after this\nLaw was ruined Jessica\nRecently on the Michael archer drivers how are you\nStarted out my ex wife she was raised with a silver spoon in her mouth well dinnertime cc's of handful of banking race and she thought in the dishwasher you know\nI wake up I'm like I'm ready to throw it out homemade biscuits and make them any good old military\nAnd I see no paying\nI look at I look and I look at dawn on me to look in the dishwasher surely nobody that they've been\nLet me let me let me let me let me stop you there is this your wife for your ex wife\nA ex wife I say OK okay\nYou're allowed to take care of tasks are she has no place in my house in\nA\n... show\nOn superstation one on one W why do\nThey just did a milk and I'm Jonathan food and we want to invite you to listen to our show the laying show with David Johnny every Saturday morning jobs we have right gifts and regular segments of farmland timberland hunting for offering rural tourism anything having to do with\nAlabama comic view of land you'll love our show this is a show for you to tune in every Saturday morning for the way and show with David Johnny\nLiz true Saturday mornings at my\nOwn superstition one on one that there'll be why the\nBeer super station one on one we're committed to bringing equality programming that as a formative as well to\nSend us an email to feedback have one on one to be why the dot com and let us know when you think you feel is super station when\nHe was thanks for listening super station one on one\nDid not back with yeah\nWe ... we we really push that break to the max\nBecause now we're going to take another brain but that's okay\nI'm going to take a phone call or two before we go on to the next break ... his microphone I to be that guy\nNo I mean I did notice that had that area than when I have that to\nA recipe guys man I gotta Hooters story to tell you about in your lap\nWell and that's because the big the big man standing here and heard that Jay be they may make ... now and then they're going a little talk\nThe ...

I'm married just you know it's just a thing he said but when we used to go at the station a word that in Texas we learn how to perfectly a shocker wing yeah and the the wing that's like the two bones

I don't know how long have you here I don't remember when he said he will not horror one one zero wind wind then we will be back\nRight it\nIs a long\nLong\nHey you know you mentioned Hooters and stocking and this is kind of sort of shocking story but made much of the guys on the ship when I was out there in Twenty years ago we would go to the shooters up mission valley and there was this one really cute waitress and we always sit in her table\nOr section and one of the younger guys that worked for me it was going to be the ... daddy and he was going to get her number and he just bugs snot out of her and she finally gave them a fake number but then one day right in front of them she gave me her real number oh\n[laughter] yeah it was funny though is when I go out of the water with some other friends and party and the nightclubs and if you want to see me down their party affiliation dance and\nYou know share a few drinks or whatever and hang out nothing ever happened but it was just funny that this guy thought he was going to be all this and that and what's interesting about that guy was the rumor was a few years back that his ex wife killed them in self defense\nWow what why\nI was the rumor was a few years back that his ex wife killed them in self defense\nWow what why why he was abused well\nShe she never she didn't kill 'em and I think she did vote gun on him but yeah they end up getting a divorce she got away from home and then you know come to find out on Facebook as I was talking to some other guys I served with like no he's alive he's right over here they jak them and posted all of a sudden these threatening me\nOh you know\nTalking about jumping over where I live I'm like you got to do it but you know I I'm Glad you're not dead and ah you know all the best for you and you're\nTelling me is a lot of people who come over here and trying to mess with them because it was a blessing\nTo yeah I don't understand why he was threatening you though him a girl\nWe never we never got along I caught him and dereliction of duty a couple of different times and it took him to captain's mast Adam demoted\n... hearings for it to Japan he was better yeah OK well\nAny especially since you know after he gets the fake number any tax to the attacks that number and he's like yo girl this dirty red\nAnd yeah and it's not working out from yeah yeah it's been Wilmer we're glad are hitting ... yeah I wasn't expecting a male a male do or not I didn't see that having some mellow mellow I own\nMy wife my wife banished from voters after a girl that such a loser was messing with Ben's on my bike or vast right in front of her so that was\nAll women should than men homeowners that's just standard [noise] you really think so the banks are what you think you think they are people in a relationship shouldn't be allowed to go to the mood or not get me started even if you're going to go I'm just asking I'm just genuinely cure now my situation's different because if the if\nThe waitress is over they're touching your man right well you know\nFirst of all she should know better than men second of all the let me live slapped her that's OK\nAnd let me ask you a question what was Hooters created for it was not the\nFood because you can go and eat wings anywhere All right I mean and nobody is saying all wings are created equal on said no I'm not saying that because I don't believe that but I'm just saying what is the appeal of Hooters and why is it that it's mainly man they got there I Know some women go there too it's because of the eye candy okay\nAnd my ... well I mean it's true so if you're in a committed relationship or you're married why are you going to a place that you know what's going to be a struggle to not lost after or look at other women who are scantily clad I Know they're wearing shorts and a shirt but let's be honest there busty and they're wearing really short shorts why would you want to put yourself in that situation\nI think that that's just the the relationship to relationship decision I\nThink that that would require you know what I'm not even I'm just saying I don't think I think relationships relationship I think it's called wisdom\nI think if ah if ah I think scientists it's not the right thing to do and that's perfectly fine\nHell and some people watch pornography together and their relationship and I would still say that stupid even if it's a mutual decision the men and women are created differently and men are visually stimulated and the more you stimulate that\nI the more trouble you can get into what do you think there's people who were addicted to things like pornography it all started somewhere and nobody ever got up in the morning and said you know what I think I'm going to be addicted today that happens over a course of the time\nBy the way outside of that my girlfriend made me aware that\nI saw her on social media until I found a reason to actually hit her up oh look at you yeah little player was right ... actually uh I I utilize the the radio station here by offering her\nTickets to the women show which ...\nActually uh I I utilize the the radio station\nHere by offering her tickets to the women show which she politely turned down by the way\nBut it's still wearing now yeah she turns you know she turned down when I was trying to give her

I. D. E. on Facebook okay about this migrant caravan\nUh a lot of outlets well I say a lot I Know a Fox\nNews if you go to their Facebook page they've been following this thing or all day and the older shows on TV as well but they've had for a majority that they had a live video\nFollowing this caravan around in particular when they were at the the border of Mexico video of him tearing the fence down I'm looking now to see if that video store up there and because you guys want to watch it uh I don't think it's going anymore but as of\nA couple of hours ago they didn't have a video you can go back and watch it\nA of how many\nHow many people this really is I mean we can say the number four thousand and it only means so much to us\nOr it's just like talking about the deficit and talking about trillions of dollars and whatever else or don't really mean much because it's hard to comprehend it's hard to comprehend what four thousand people look like marching down the street but when you go and watch this video\nMuch pulled up when you turn on the phone down here ah\nYou see that a lot of the same thing that I saw yesterday when I was looking at images\nOf this quote unquote caravan there is a whole lot of young guys\nAnd whether that means late teens early twenties or thirties there are more of them than there are anybody else in the pictures I saw yesterday and for no women and children now I'm starting to see some women and children but they are far out numbered\nNow if I were if I hadn't seen those pictures and I would have just gone off what I heard on the news today as I was watching ah MSNBC\nThey portrayed this it's all women and children who are just trying to flee the violence or find a better life and really just keep themselves alive because they are under so much dressed so much threat\nFrom the the culture there of gangs and drugs and violence and violence and whatever\nThat's not the case I'm a military several videos that were shot today several photos\nIt's not all women and children and that's not to say only women and children need to flee but\nI I I see more able bodied the people in these crowds than I could possibly count\nAnd you would think well if we are looking to get people to safety and and we're trying to do it and maybe an orderly fashion why don't we do women and children first and then we'll worry about the quote unquote finding age\nThey're trying to do it and maybe an orderly fashion why don't we do women and children first and then we'll worry about the quote unquote finding age men\nTo uh get them to safety if you will so that's going on a\nDonald Trump's rally last night he brought this up as he had over the past couple of rallies\n[noise] and he begs the question who is paying for the\nThis caravan who's paying for these migrants in this caravan now that's something that a caller brought up on the show yesterday and I don't disagree with it there is a larger\nOrchestrate shouldn't if you will going on with this mass migration\nOf people from Guatemala this is not a town of four thousand people where they all came together and they say you know what I'm fed up with Guatemala let's go to Mexico bus down their border wall and just continue to take the two thousand miles track\nTo America and then we'll all have a better life no this is set up by somebody I firmly believe\nThis is set up by somebody\nSomebody with lots of money somebody that is deeply tied to the political system here in America\nTo get this caravan traveling through Mexico and up to the border within or on\nThe day of the election\nNothing would suit the Democrats more than to have images on election day\nOf border patrol agents trying to sweat immigrants of the border fence of the border\nWall yeah the optics of that are powerful I'm sure\nOr the lack of a border wall where they're trying to you know just detain and arrest people like they are obligated and should do\nIf they are crossing the border illegally if they are seeking asylum first of all they're breaking the law by not staying in the country they first reach after leaving their own country\nBut second of all they would have to go through the process of\nSeeking asylum the proper way where you come to us you say hey where I'm from is really dangerous I have nowhere to go or can you please take me in well\nWe do that we do that all the time but we don't do it for four thousand people at a time\nSo you have these people for thousands of people show up at one point of entry is that what's going to happen what are we supposed to do\nEvery day for me five which is a new on superstation what uh what do what do you why do\nYou like sitting around the board your dinner table sharing stories were friends that's what we like to do here at our American story and probably will be in each week night we bring you stories about American Love funny stories about first jobs in this day in history American dreamers in marriages and even the stories of\nMusic and acting legend I invite you to sit around the porch with us as we share our American stories on superstation one on one point one W why do\nOn a Sunday that new for inside with Bill Wilson right here on the one on one W why deep\nPatriotism is supporting your country overtime\nAnd your government when it serves\nYour your home town got an countries fictional\nSuper station one on one WIP [noise]\n[noise]\nThe line Andrew in ...\nThe line Andrew in ... won W why the two of 'em down for one one zero one one [noise]\nI'm gonna get you guys on the phone just him second also we're we're still taking your stalkers stories if you if you've gotten a stalker story let us know and uh well uh well here you out since Jessica almost put her in itself in that\nPosition I think it's appropriate gosh uh anyway the Internet's reaction to what you heard from Donald Trump\nTalking about a gym\nForte body slamming reporter and says hey you don't want to mess with bad guys and big dumb guy he'll he'll body slam you we've seen it\nI'm just a few\nTweets from blue check marks and I don't know who most of these people are the political pundits are reporters or whatever\n[noise] uh this guy said this was a crime or\nThat guy pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault for that body slam of a reporter Senate community service treatment for anger management and find another guy says yeah the Dems are the party of violence Trump just applauded an assault on a reporter shocked I'm just shocked\n\nTrump is a psychopath with lots of followers and among generality he prays their congressmen for assaulting a reporter what else ... praises the violent assault of a reporter his supporters cheer horrific he's declared open season on old journalist\nHow about Trump has astounding timing days after the writer or after the the Saudi reporter was murdered he praises a congressman who physically attacked a reporter\nWhat the crap is the matter with him\nTo a flicking through ready for this Trump just hit a new low while at his Mac a mob his Mac mob rally he praised GOP senator or I'm Sorry representative for claiming a journalist tease applauding the assault\nOf a journalist and the Washington Post journalist was just assassinated so on and so forth the narrative starts to be built\nBut I I don't know that have nothing Trump said led to the Washington Post guy potentially being assassinated right there were around narratives going on that led to the violence potentially that don't take this man's life right she can't really draw the connection there\nAnd it's it's funny to me in in reporters aren't being assaulted 'em\nBy the Mac mob is this guy so eloquently put it uh it's just not happening now if we do want to talk about the journalist and reporters that are being assaulted just take a look back at any riots or Fox News has been reporting\nTalk about Ferguson, Missouri during the the Brian silver Michael Brown\nThink about the riots over Freddie Gray in Baltimore if you're watching Fox News you couldn't have your kids in the room because people would run up to them as soon as they saw the Fox news logo start screaming and cursing at 'em and in some cases assaulting them for nothing more than being from Fox News\nYet CNN says Trump supporters are dangerous because they chant CNN sucks and lock her up right\nYet as Trump supporters are dangerous because the chance CNN sucks and lock her up right the the violence against reporters was completely ignored back when it was actually happening because it was happening to Fox News people\nAnd nobody else no body else\nThat's what's great then Jim Acosta lost his marvel you know he's just an average correspondent reporter you know you have no opinion on anything\nLike that but uh he complained and
