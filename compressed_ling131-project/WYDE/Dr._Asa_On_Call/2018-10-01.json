looking for not any home will do the one thing we've learned you know since we began our friendship with family and Russell\nIs they go to extreme links to make sure you get in the home that you want\nThat you get in the rye and home there was a one story they told us where they literally Pamela ... literally drove around with the client and looked at homes in the neighborhood until she found the one she wanted and\nShe found one wasn't a house for sale or anything they contacted the homeowner and they're like hey you know we realize your homes on on the market but if you consider it we've got somebody who really like to buy your home and this is what they're they're willing to pay for it\nThey got the home the homeowner sold the home that's insane and they got this lady who picked the

well let me set the stage if you if you've been in a a a box all day or or cubicle or you've been at work and you haven't been able to figure out what's going on in the Senate Judiciary committee voted today to send the Kavanaugh votes to the Senate\nThe they voted along party lines in an eleven to ten votes\nThe only stipulation one Republican Jeff Flake had was that the FBI conduct this\nBig fancy FBI investigation that the Democrats have been screaming about he says he ... he believes Kavanaugh he also believes the accuser and he will feel better if there is this quote unquote FBI investigation now what is an FBI investigation and tell it's basically a supplemental background check\nWhen he's only had six of them he's just going to have a seven to one last one more and he said I Want this to be limited in its time and limited in its scope this doesn't need to turn into a special counsel Robert Mueller do deal or anything like that I Want this to be delayed only for a week\nThat in fact seems to be what's going on\nThe FBI has now been instructed by the White House to conduct this supplemental investigation\nAnd get back with the Senate with their findings they won't have a conclusion you know that that's not what the FBI does they provide a three oh two which just shows what they've figured out what they got testimony wiser interview wise from people that were friends people that are allegedly witnesses to the stuff\nThat will provide that to the Senate once they do that Democrats will do the same thing they're doing now\nThey'll freak out and they'll say this just shows we have to delay it even longer because they don't have the votes to stop that by themselves right\nTired of reading fake news\nHaving condescending liberal media\nHead over to

the terrorists you know if you're not sure the terrorists you know there'll be nasty you know\nWhen I don't mean a lot when you're going to start planning dirty ... because they can't they don't know how to play dirty tonight is what is going to get keep getting beat and keep that they don't keep running up the score because we don't know how to play off ... we just know how to play defense\nUm or am I wrong\nJackson have you ever met he before yeah\nI have not\nGotten a little bit of that he's fire inside of you know I could I could run that actually that's a compliment by the way\nOn thank you thank you [laughter] I don't know who he is but I like him [laughter] and you might have even like you yeah who would who would need we need to grab that law and I say I have to get the ball at aggressively step in front of\nA woman oh no you can't do that 'cause I'm In LA right now right is that what we're headed apparently so I think women are right yeah matter what does it matter ... ... that's all right we are all men just go drop off a cliff you're on the right track jogging\nAnd are you making grew nominate last\nBy about awkward ending to a phone call um I ... and listen to me buddy I'm with you I'm with you on that\nBye bye awkward ending the phone call um I actually listen to me money I'm with you I'm with you on that the Republicans are far too nine is we need Republicans whenever you want to call 'em they they are by far too nice\nThis situation in in the most important situation we've seen in a while since the presidential election obviously\nI Wish Jeff Flake ... but\nWe are simply concerned with those swing votes swing Republicans and even Joe mansion in the ...\nAnd Heidi Heitkamp\nWe're simply worried about appeasing them now and ensuring at the end of next week we can vote and have no worry over whether or not\nBrett Kavanaugh will impact you can burn 'em\nBy the way for all the all that we are on hold our phone took a took a big dump and I'm like yeah I can stick a tumble and everybody got kicked off but a lot of people call back they did and I've got a one line up and so called me to five nine four one one zero one one Derek exact salary they're\nGoing on you know\nThe thing thing logically and not get emotional and mad 'cause obviously we'd all be bad too like ... like moment but ah let's let's play the sound logical soccer for storing a lot of old older witnesses\nOffer for statements saying they don't remember this you're going to ever happening that happened uh the scopes that the president for Kurt credible allegation so that's yeah I was going to look at all the issues and beside legally and logically if the carnival or emotion not going to get involved\nAnd one they're either going to say a lot of these aren't credible we're just going to dismiss them altogether or to they're going to play them out and then they\nWon't eat everyone says this is happening and they're going to go to med school or to have her on record and they have the main the sport boy they don't want to go get a masters or most likely also say don't remember this happen\nAnd then the FBI is going to come out like a doctor for this thing happened so the Democrats overplay their hand like not going to happen\nYeah how they're going to this woman under the bus in my opinion the logical looking at everything I've gotten on I mean\nYou while you're I dare I amount of time but you're exactly right I mean they didn't expect to find that you may have a lot of money our back after them\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen you should not assume he's guilty I mean and and that bothers me that that's not being done if this wouldn't hold up in a court of law and he'd be found guilty then he should not be found guilty on the Senate floor and the reason\nThat I Know that can using part everyone seems like the guilty or not guilty court case and it's not a court case I think it's confusing to the public and everyone involved treated like a court case that not have that\nHave the same standard yeah\nAnd that's the ... that's that's the purpose and that's also the reason that logic is absent in this whole thing because they aren't looking for the truth I firmly believe Republicans are looking for the truth but the Democrats are not looking for the truth is no political\nThere's no point to delay and ultimately\nI cancel out a Supreme Court pick and in any means necessary if they cared about women being abused or assaulted they wouldn't have married the Keith Ellison story\nThey wouldn't let creepy Joe Biden go around and continue to grow people yeah they wouldn't let the all these all these uh Democrats friends they're getting off the hook if they actually cared about women wouldn't you love and when list thanks good to hear from you\n[laughter] Iraq wouldn't you love to ask Cory Booker why he has stood up for the ex girlfriend Keith Ellison yeah\nKamala Harris those women don't matter as much and just say\nHere and that's what I've done if I was ... have you ever thought about actually not bearing the Cory Booker story\nAnybody anybody anyway\nNext is show my phone my my my screen since Cho oh I think that's what he said but that's what I heard\nHey Cho tickets they yeah what's your name file [noise]\nWhile you're name now is Charles C. H. A. W.\nAs always Jessica support [laughter]\nI show up\nJust here's what I Would love to see and I know it will never happen\nAs long as time goes on but I Would love to see the next time they pulled the stock because you know like you said it's going to get old again\nFor Kavanaugh to come over the state just be like look you guys know that I Am a great person you guys on the critical judge and you guys are doing nothing that's my main purpose\nShould be out of here so I no longer care about your questions to answer your state\nAnd every time the shit ever come up like Mr personality is\nPartisans are getting off the list of allegations and accusations against that senator or whoever it is and not just Democrats but Republicans as well yeah I think doing all the you know by heart was\nSpeaking of Cory Booker though think about this how shame do you have to be mad that Lindsey Graham is more Spartacus than you are\nOh man yeah that's a dagger in the heart and there\nWere you when you when you write a book about your exploits that right\nThe other thing that really kills me is the apostrophe behind all of this they keep telling us at Twenty one I served in the military I serve the kid 'cause I wouldn't have twenty nine but I served decided kids that were Eighteen hour thing\nOh at Twenty one I served in the military I served as a kid 'cause I was twenty nine but I served beside kids that were Eighteen our thing not we are they not mature enough responsible enough to hold a garden adult until they're twenty six I Believe the ages\nBut yet you want to hold this me on account of something that when he was Seventeen yeah it's a good air when he was clearly wasn't mature enough to know what he was doing if anybody we should be holding his parents responsible\nYeah those are good points John appreciate the bunny\n\nHe's excited he he'd go and tell us when we're going to embrace that I Would it's a pretty cool name my\n... my favorite radio show called me Charles when they do start\nNew here on out in the room so I don't know why I just gave me ... I don't either because they didn't have one but John sounds like a southern yeah isn't that like tobacco like chewing tobacco isn't that what they call it child\nShe no no no no no it'd be that serious I think that's also another slang for now they have to look it up I hate yo what channel do not think shah was actually an All right\nAh yes chewing tobacco and beliefs of variety [laughter] slang Manno smart I think it's too when you see it is for you but it's also saw it was like a strong\nChow give me give me a pension that show\nYou never heard that before he now that you're saying that I Know I have Clark Howard you buddy\nI'm well and really the binocular there Andrew would be give me a ...\nGive me a child oh okay yeah like opinions like hands go sing written fill in the annals of mark\nWas dead on with the uh remodel in two thousand and eight somebody's going to the trouble of looking up the building permits that they've pulled the have that done and it was two thousand and eight so there's another whole you know if you start looking at how many more allegations were going to have you got to thinking about that\nAnd everybody wears the St cat in protest would gladly volunteer to be an alligator but it's not like being a bone marrow zone or your bio has to match enough to be a little credible so it kind of limits the field doesn't it\nYeah okay and we can't get any more in the ditch than we have been for the past couple of days with this mess much room so I Want to tie a couple you're a hot cakes for the week together\nHow you doing to pull it in the debts part or all all that out on a really good\nDid you were in the ...
