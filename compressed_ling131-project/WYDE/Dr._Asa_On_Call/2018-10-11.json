that I I didn't know how to go the grocery store I didn't know how to really do anything at all on their own um that's another thing that they do to keep you under their control because you know it's a it's a constant here\nAnd there was a constant fear as\nOn me that I Am this horrible person there's a constant fear that\nYou know I'm going to do something wrong to every single thing that I did was always wrong no matter what I said or did it was always wrong and I either got um some form of gets punishment sexual punishment or um [noise]\nThere was just tons of things that\nThey used to control me\nWhen I was in my twenties I began to\nAn eating disorder and\nEvery single little thing is controlled so\nEvery single little thing is controlled so\nYou know had a lot of a lot of issues about um\nDepression and\nAm it's very obvious on\nMe so I was in a in a situation where\nIt just worked out to where they\nThey took steps to try to help me you know\nI was finally able to open\nLittle at a time about what was going on with me and I'm\nAs I began to do that they began to take steps to give me a place to live\nAnd they gave me a car to drive and help me find jobs\nYou know just a safe place to just day now\nIt's hard to understand\nWhen every single\nMovie that you make has been controlled it\nDown to who speak to normally\nIf I ever spoke to anybody that they didn't want me to speak to that wasn't involved in all the things that they were doing they would tell me\nWell you know that we're going to sell you didn't then\nSo they are involved as well and so I just\nEverybody you know that's just what people did to me and I didn't I didn't know there was anything different so\nThey began to make these steps to show me love and show me kindness and it just started breaking down walls that\nCould never done I'm ...\nAnd um so I began to to learn how to trust them like it\nYou know night after night would think OK well when it's going to be the day that they're going to\nLike that of all the other people like when when are they going to change 'em because I was continually told that\nYou know they would be just the same um\nOver time\nHaving them

do\nEverything you get in everything and that even your basic needs are because you've done something to earn and it's not in not seen as for free and so as I began to do things for me and love me and show me\nThis kindness it just began to break down the walls\nAnd I know it's very hard and difficult for people to understand that I'm Still waiting in traffic during that time because I just\nI had been so trying to think that that's all that I deserved\nSays I began to just show me my value and show me that\nYou know I just started fed or and\nAnd you know it was just waiting and waiting for

was so terrorize\nThinking that they you know they would do something to the people\nAnd you know I think it just took time God was striking down laws and helping me to say that I could be free\nYou know I I just\nI Can't say that any other way and then God gave me the strength to to step out and I\nI had some money saved and I uh\nYou know just left and\nDidn't tell anybody you know make sure they knew you know that\nThey knew that I was going to be okay the people that were helping me I knew I was going to be okay and I was taking\nCare of but I I I Want to protect them and I left you know pretty much packed up everything left without telling anybody exactly where I was going and I'm pretty much for a whole year\nWas so Tara afraid you know they were going to find me I didn't really speak to anybody until a about a year later and you know I\nI guess it took that long for me to really believe that I could be free\nAnd believes that God\nLet me enough that I can\nI could really say that I was\nWasn't a controlled I was in the science any longer and so it was a long long journey but I'm extremely grateful for every\nLittle detail that ... to\nTo rescue me ... ... ... ...\n... when was it that hope realized she was asleep and the victim of sex trafficking [noise]\nWell I\nThink that are really\nRealized until I meant this couple and I began\nI began to see how they treated their children\nAnd I began to see how their children with their lives\nAnd\nAnd it didn't change like it it wasn't like in front of people they are one\nWay and then when they came home they were a different way or if they were church they roll one way and I left and they were different like it was consistent all the time this is consistent with\nThe people that didn't you know traffic to me they were hideous and in and and tortured me I mean they um\nIt is hard to even say the things that they did [noise]\nBut then when they were in\nThe public at church or at school\nOut you know whatever they were doing they were\nCompletely different um and so I was the one that was taking all the pain and her and all that so\nFor me it just meant that\nTaking a cane that show [noise]\nFor

level it's all about your mindset do you want to get well that's the question do you want it are you willing to do whatever it takes no matter how hard it might be do you want it that's the key being well living well\nIs an attitude it's a choice it's something that we decide that we want and being well a sense of whole wholeness and wellbeing\nIs something that's so powerful and it comes under choices that we make every day so it doesn't matter if he'd made bad choices in the past that doesn't matter today is a brand new day you can make new choices today and have better health tomorrow but it comes down to you it comes down to the choices that you may just key\nDiet drinks of course have been a hot topic and of course the diet sodas and the sweeteners and everything that go in a big topic and a lot of people want to know well if I if I drink a diet so that must saving the calories and not getting all the sugar so that's going to keep me from\nGetting overweight or it's going to help me lose weight right not so much that actually has some studies that have come out recently in American Journal of public health\nAnd within within John hopkins their university there Bloomberg School of public health they they studied\nDiet soda drinkers and the reason is they were claiming or they were seeing if when you drink diet sodas if it actually goes in and still does trigger the receptors in the brain to tell the brain to release the blood sugar in the insulin and and that it does the same thing as the actual\nHigh fructose corn syrup or the sugary drinks and they found that it really did\nSo what do you drink something that's sweet or you don't\nWhat happened is because the the dice the diet drinks had the artificial sweeteners had no calories and then it triggers the brain to think that it's getting more calories so what happens is actually ... making making you ah eat more food\nAnd as you begin to eat more food that's where the challenges because then you gain more weight [laughter] so they're saying it's almost better to if you're going to drink soda to drink the regular ones because you're actually getting the calories out of it and of course there is some debate on the health\nThe natural sweeteners to certain ones in what they can do to your overall health example surfer Los has got chlorine in the sugar molecules that they use and you know

health benefits\nWith these sweeteners and the difference was that we use in some of the drinks he can put your ... and whatnot they make so does now is the yeah we'll be right back [noise]\n[noise] our health is determined by the choices that we make every single day health is not the absence of disease mindful about our daily lifestyle that's where my unhealthy comes in to the easy to use mine healthy at designed improve wellness and build strength between your lifestyle choices and\nAnd sorry to hear that I Know I Know it's tough going through that and if the doctors are looking at it and they've run all the basic test and it just kind of scratching their heads\nAnd it's not easy is kind of like what's going on you know this is your body it's your health and you want it to be taking care of and you want to be healthy and you want to feel good and and feel\nLike you know you don't want to lose you in the middle of it so I Would really encourage you\nIn a lot of ways to really start seeking out a a lot of nutritional help because when you're dealing with the digestive track that's where it begins everything starts in the digestion and eating the right kind of foods on a regular basis makes an incredible difference\nWith your overall health tremendous\nAnd making sure that that you're getting good lean quality protein sources like chicken fish for eggs low glycemic carbohydrates in the form of fruits and vegetables and then you're healthy fats your ... your wallet your cash you draw because you're oils like coconut oil grape seed oil\nReal butter oh that that matters but with your digestion when you've got an inflammatory response like that\nHave to cut down inflammatory food so to foods typically that are good to eliminate in this kind of situation are definitely without a doubt the wheat products the bread the pastas\nThe cereals and the crackers you want to be really cautious of those and then the dairy products and of course because the casing protein can be tough to break down if you've got a lot of information going on you might want to hold back on that not that you have to stop it forever but it's just for a period of time\nAnd you know dairy products can be actually a very healing a lot of the wrong pasteurized can be really good for digestion but if your body's not handling them very well that's where you have to be careful and you do have to be a little cautious of that\nAnd as you start to to change that you can of course instructed healing in the gut then you can probably had those back in but I Would talk to your doctor maybe a nutritionist look into pro bioethics because the good bacteria having that in the digestive tract is just so vital\nIt's critical to get all of the digestion where it needs to be and supporting that clearing out eastern fungal issues making sure you got the right kind of bacteria there\nI mean all of that is tremendously important so it would look and make sure somebody's guiding you in that process to get you to help that you need because it's critical and and also look at fatty acids like a mega threes like cod liver oil can be very healing to the gut Paolo and also el

fact using it on salads and whatnot there there hasn't been any major warnings that have come out\nBut again depending on the specific medications you want to run that by make sure that the doctor says it's OK but in my experience hasn't been anything that I've seen\nA on that the apple cider vinegar is great for increasing stomach acid which helps to break down proteins much better and really supports the body in that way so it's something you definitely want to look at\n\nAs you as you're kind of going through this journey because if you're dealing with blood pressure and you're dealing with anything cardiovascular related make sure makes sure make sure make sure\nThat you're eating the right kind of food every single day you got you know low glycemic carbohydrate you got plenty of fruits and vegetables you got cut healthy fats you're combining all that together\nAnd you really have a good total game plan as you do that then you ... really be able to kind of go to that next
