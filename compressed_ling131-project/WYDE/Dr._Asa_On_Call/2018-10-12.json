were three people in the company who I've now been here thirty five years or more\nThan passing perseverance and of course they've been successful the pick up the road and all the way\nMy husband and I were pregnant with our first baby back in two thousand seven and we went in for it the ...\nTwenty week ultrasound and essentially we just thought we were going to find out if we were having a boy or a girl and we learned at that ultrasound that we're going to have a boy so we went out we buy clothes and just different things for him\n[noise] been about two weeks later we had gone out of town and our obey doctor had been out of town to so when we went in for the ultrasound we were just with the same ultrasound technician\nWe received a call from our doctor\nAnd he said that\nThe ultrasound showed that David our son did not have kidney\nMy first thought was okay how can we fixed that and\nOur doctor several you need to go in the apparent in college as a specialist to see if you know to to for him to look at it further when we went to the doctor and he checked everything\nOut and confirmed that our son did not have kidney and what we learned was that kid needs help actually produce the lungs or or develop the lungs because basically the baby will drink the em the audit fluid and then he'll pie it out and drink and that actually develop\nThe lungs because basically the baby will drink the em the audit fluid and then he'll be it out in the drinking\nAnd not actually develop the lungs and so the issue wasn't necessarily his lack of kidneys the but the fact that his lungs but not develop\nWe were told that we you know that he would probably come middle mid thirty weeks that station\nAnd so um we just continue the pregnancy and I'll just try to enjoy every moment that we ... that we had with him just a sometimes he would move he couldn't move a lot because\nThere was no fluid by we would just to play music for him at night and it just tried to\nSpend whatever time we could with him [noise]\nAbout uh thirty four weeks into the pregnancy I started to having contractions and went into labor\nAnd so we went to the hospital to deliver David now how this whole this whole time you know I at that point it has been a couple of months that we knew that David would outlive I also learned about an organization called now I lay me down to sleep\nIn that organization provides remembrance portraits two parents suffering the death of a baby when a friend first told me about it I was a little hesitant I thought is that appropriate to be taking pictures of a baby\nIn the situation but I went to the website and I saw how beautiful the photographs were and I realized that we would never have this opportunity again\nTo be able to photograph our son and so I decided to have the photographs of our son\nSibling we went in to deliver David out his heart was still beating and when it was time for me to to push me pull the heart monitor often him because they knew that you could possibly die during the delivery process so they took to hurt monitor off\nAnd the thing I was hoping for the most was that he will be born alive and so when he was born they he did not have a hard heartbeat he was not breathing\nAnd they handed to him to me and I was I was so crushed that our son was important to live but then at the same time I remember looking at him and thinking\nWow he this baby was in his beautiful and just like any first time mom would feel about a baby there their first baby just how beautiful and I cannot believe that I was carrying the baby but then the reality struck again that he was not alive [noise]\nWe we spent some time with him and then our photographer came in and she photographed David and just\nYou know documenting or time with him we gave him a bath we helped him she weighed him a we have pictures of him on the scale of each of us holding him of us as a family of him alone and ah we've you know we just cherish those moments that we\nHad with him\nAbout six hours after she was born we just we knew it was time that we needed to let him go and it was one of the hardest things I ever did too I give him over to a nurse and know that I Would never hold them again so at that at that point we uh\nYou know I was being discharged from the hospital and we now needed to make funeral arrangements and because we knew ahead of time we were able to speak some of those things through there's many many as ...\nIt is to make funeral arrangements and because we knew ahead of time we were able to speak some of those things through there is many many other families who who's a baby and it's set in and they don't have that time to prepare but we knew were we were we would bury him and\nSo I remember going home that night and trying to go to bed but then I realized where where is David as you get the hospitals funeral home pick 'em up and I called the nurse at the hospital\nShe was back on her shift again and she assured me that he was still there and I was just wanting to know where my baby was\nSo we went a so a few days later we had a memorial service and we buried our son David\nWe were told that we could go on and have other children that this was a fluke occurrence and I have seen on line other stories with babies who had what\nWhat it's called Potter syndrome a whereas if the parents go on and have healthy children and his chromosomes ... uh turned up okay and all the other tests for find so we were clear to have another baby and we got pregnant a couple of months later\nWe we're cautiously optimistic and um we went in for a number of ultrasounds I was still considered an ... a high risk pregnancy\nBecause of our situation but we still would need to wait until the sixteen week ultrasound to see if our baby had kidneys [noise]\nSo the sixteen we ultrasound we went in and the doctor within their with ultrasound technician and I'm laying there and he just pause and he said wait a minute let me step in and\nSo he stepped in for the ultrasound technician and he was looking and I kept asking what what's wrong what's going on and he wanted to tell us but he just kept looking and I said does he have kidneys and he said he does and I said okay then what's what's going on because we knew something had to have been wrong\nHe\nHad us go into another room and my husband and I just we waited for the seemed like forever and then the doctor came in and he said\nHow your baby has as just around the neck and severe flu would build up in what we later learned was that it has to ... hydra high drops the fluid and following around all of his organs\nAnd at that point they were unsure of the gender of our baby because of all the swelling and then um the doctor said that his heart could stop beating at any time and so\nUm he said you can't move and I didn't feel and move it all that I Need to come in every week to see if his heart is still beating every week we went in and I started getting more hope because I thought maybe this\nIs our miracle maybe this is what we had to go through to have to have our miracle and and nothing has ever been too easy for me throughout my life so I thought maybe this is the miracle every week we went in and then by twenty four weeks since the pregnancy\nLearned that our baby's heart stopped\nAnd so the doctor said you can you know you can still carry the baby for a while and you'll\nProbably going to natural labor if you don't buy a certain period of time I can't remember how long that was then we would have to induce or you can go ahead and do and I looked at him I said what am I supposed to do if I'm Still carrying him and knowing that he's died so my husband and I went to the hospital that night and they enthused\nI'm like I said what am I supposed to do if I'm Still caring and and knowing that he died so my husband and I went to the hospital that night and then these labor [noise] and we had a little boy that we named Ethan\nAnd that I had a camera in my bag [noise]\nAnd I remember thinking you know that's gets the picture is because [noise] when his when he was born and his condition was extremely severe a lot of teachers were not identifiable he gets his hand at the at the spelling was selling was pretty severe\nAnd I knew it wasn't a situation that we would bring now down to read that too and I remember thinking about the camera in my bag that maybe with him covered in a blanket\nAnd my husband and I holding him we could have a picture of him but I just didn't have the courage to it and I didn't have anyone encouraging me to say you know go ahead and take some pictures and um so we never photograph the and and that's one of the biggest regrets in my life\nAnd what a story Gina's story and more of

don't ask why any more I resolved and I'd ask why anymore because I Know that\nI'll I'll never have the answer until I meet them again until I Am in heaven with them all know why and\nEverything will make sense that's her that's her story and it's it's not over\nPeople ask\nMe questions and I don't know exactly how it's asked but the system and that everything better because now we have our Jay and yes I I think\nPartly it's better because when my husband and I we're dreaming the loss of our babies but before we had RJ we're also grieving the fact that we may never raise children of her own and at least that part has been answered for us and we've chosen not to have any more children we just\nDon't know how we would handle it if something happened and it's just not worth the risk for one for five at this point and so that's why we're we're sticking with RJ now but I think sometimes people build once you have another child\nThen things are are better for you and um there's healing that's come over it'll be ten years this month since we last David\nBut there there's a lot of healing that's come with that but we still miss our boys we still love them and and I often say when I was speaking to people is that we have a\nWe have a choice and how we're going to respond we don't have a choice over a lot of the tragedies that happened in our lives these things happen and we don't have a choice of what's come our way but we do have a choice on how we're going to respond are we going to be\nBitter or are we going to be better [noise] and even though there's part of me that goes into the bitterness and I feel sorry for myself and bad about what happened I always try to focus on\nThe better part and what can I Do to give David in Eaton life purpose and meaning and I found that how I can do that in a number of ways and I I couldn't do it without my face either that's been a significant part of his healing journey for me\nSo I Would have people asked me if you have children and this was before I had RJ\nIt depending on the situation would would depend on how I answered it but when I Would\nTell them yes I have two boys in heaven I typically was met with oh I'm so sorry I didn't mean to bring that up and then my response back as always\nThank you for bringing it up thank you for asking if I had children I Love my boys I'm so proud of them and every time I can speak

politics\nIndeed indeed and and you know we just spent some time with David McCullough not long ago\nAnd the curiosity of the Wright brothers was remarkable I mean these two guys just kept going at it and they were curious and they tested and they were curious and then the wrong way they were hobbyist but they were doing things that well Leonardo was thinking about and puzzle over him self that curiosity drove them do\nRight you're absolutely right of course you you know I mean not all where he's ideas I mean ... it will be fewer than the things we think we're you know there were things that were in the air at the time but the fact that he was interested in all of those is what makes him so\nWhere are you know there were things that were in the air at the time but the fact that he was interested in all of those is what makes him so absolutely unique\nIndeed indeed and and very few people have that kind of mind and that level and breadth and depth of curiosity let's talk about that other person you talk about the book Richard Simon and by the way who is for folks who may not have ever heard his name\nYeah So Richard Feynman was uh one of the most uh celebrate that physicists are over twenty century he works in almost every area of physics and also a Nobel laureate in physics [noise]\nUm but in addition to everything you did in physics he was interested in so many other things he was a bomb go drummer ah he's studied how to draw a he was an expert in a cracking safe\nOr he was an expert in Mayan hieroglyphics\nAnd things like these so he was again a sort of of the ... type person although more you know in the science is a in a in the arts uh but but really a person that found everything interesting it basically said\nEverything is interesting if you look into its deep pretty enough\nAnd you coined the phrase curiosity is the best remedy for fear talking about that\n[noise] yes you see very often thinks we're fearful about are afraid of ... I think that we just don't know much about or we don't understand\nAnd by actually learning more about them and under trying to understand them better we actually can get to redo that fear ... and that's why I I truly strongly believe in the statement that curiosity is the best remedy for fear\nAnd indeed uh you you sort of intimate that curiosity is better than bravery for overcoming fear\n... yes a curiosity are very often\nWere drive people to do a more risky things than you know or you just associate with brave people\nRight I think great people and intimate risk and risk taking and a

getting a physician to check and see what kind of labs\nAre might look like you know as far as\nAny kind of\nA nutritional base labs and they can check and see if there's any weak spots any weak areas to be able to build from there that's what I Would encourage you to do for sure a triple eight to eight three Seventy seven to\nCheck out the website or job Wayne you down that's the question so again most people spend about a hundred hours or a hundred thousand hours of work in a lifetime\nThat's a lot to our brains are wired to store certain behaviors that are frequently repeated to reduce stress a mundane activities like brushing your teeth and it serves as an excellent purpose to ease daily stress but can also backfire so if we don't even notice unhealthy habits until we collect of course and understand that they're they're like\nGrabbing that piece of pizza for or eating the doughnuts that come in every single day that sit in the in the break room\nBut our behaviors really do add up over time and of course that could derail you from your overall productivity and I always encourage people just to get into ... into a good mix as far as your eating habits goes because this is a big issue in the workplace I mean when you start when you're talking about corporate environment\nAnd understanding what that even means and and how to support people at the corporate level\nThat's one thing because in in that environment you're always going to have those types of foods\nSo I study showed recently the eating desert for breakfast within the limits of an otherwise low calorie diet might decrease cravings later in the day and it's best to go with caution though because it throws off your blood sugar levels so here's some great tips again everybody has the muffins and\nAnd the cakes and everything to get left over at work so here's some great tips of what you can do to really keep your cravings at bay and you stay in charge of your health for what you can walk right by the break room and not get this extra calories in\nOn a regular basis suffer for breakfast it's always good to get a protein and I don't know if you know that that's been kind of the the new study that we've all been talking about health and nutrition world so\nBasis suffer for breakfast it's always good to get a protein and unless you know that that's been kind of the\nThe new study that we've all been talking about in the health nutrition world so getting enough protein in at breakfast during a shaker smoothie I think is a great way to go so you get a good organic powder way protein is really good or organic protein is great too and it's more the vegetarian\nAnd you mix that with your berries you can do an almond milk or an sweet and coconut milk it puts a great breakfast together it's got a sweet taste to it and you know to help you got any kind of sweet cravings in the morning so when you get to work you won't really won't the donor\nAnd don't forget a mid morning snack is great because it curbs of blood sugar level so you want to do some type of healthy fat\nWalnut cash ... whatever it might be\nAnd and make sure you get a you know some type of maybe carbohydrate or lean protein couple of horrible the eggs carry something with you or another protein shake that's fine lunch and dinner though need to have a pretty big serving of vegetables we don't get enough vegetables everyday so eating enough of those can make a big difference\nIn your overall health so I don't encourage you to look at some of the dark leafy green spinach kale they all are great choices\nTo really help you get the right kind of nutrition and that will help you are in the right man or so you want to really focus on that so lunch would look something like a big green salad some type of protein meat or fish or some healthy fats ... guacamole whatever\nAnd then also add in maybe a little bit of carbohydrate black beans you could do sweet potatoes brown rice gets something like that same for dinner afternoon snack hit something there as well and keep something at work with you I mean only one great great tools everybody says well I forget or I get working or I don't have the food with me\nThose are all reasons why this happens well there's some great ways to actually do this so let me see what that is\nOne of the big keys they want to look at keeps him nuts big bag of nuts almonds in mixed nuts whatever\nIn your desk just keep it right there at your desk leave them there don't take them back and forth ... higher chance of you not having something keep some bottled water probably have water machines and all that at work but make sure you keep nuts and fruit maybe a big bag of apples\nSomething that you could Munch on and have a quick snack mid morning and afternoon that it won't disrupt your work pattern seeing kind of eat it within five minutes and get right back to work\nYou know there's just a great way to go and it cuts down and it manages your blood sugar a Mayo Clinic study showed recently that those who have a financial incentive to lose weight will drop seven more pounds over the course of the year then with out it\nSeven more\nPounds I mean that's incredible leader that so there is the accountability salmon a friendly competition to work will also cut back a lot of the unhealthy um\nOffice behavior so a lot of these big challenges you know the big thirty day challenge sixty nine Ninety they challenge for war it increases people's success rate now\nA bacteria filled fridge is another big one so of course a lot of a lot of people eat food in the work\nRefrigerators and it can just grow mould on it and all that if you ever gone in there and seen all that\nSo be cautious not to leave too much food of yours then they're probably keep your own private stash like I said maybe even get your own little refrigerator keep it knew your desk or or have snacks you can keep with you\nIt's one of the best ways to go make sure that you have enough of what you need so that you don't get those extra cravings that will team to lean toward the cakes and cookies and\nAnd the candy bars in the sodas and all that is not doing you any good plus you want to eat foods on a regular basis that are gonna bring wife and bring health to the body those types of process\nSo does and all that is not doing you any good unless you want to eat foods on a regular basis that are going to bring wife and bring health to the body those types of processed foods [noise]\nDefinitely will not so keeping that\nIn a strong sense of taking control of your health

movement ever seen in this country ever in the history of the country\nSo you have guys like and everybody knows this named George Soros but others as well with unlimited amounts of money we're basically um formed organizations\nTo attack and destroy people with whom they disagreed this is why it's different than the Tea Party or the uh hypocrites on CNN and MSNBC who you know from day to

political power so that's what we're looking at\nDo you think that uh the president's handling\nOf this ah the star and the way he's addressed it has been helpful has it been illuminating\n\nI don't think he knows what's going on the way I just laid it out to you and your listeners are just don't think he knows what's going on I don't think he knows the seriousness look whenever you have

people All right they say okay you pay us this and we'll do that the woman who confronted Senator Flake in the elevator is paid one hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year\nBy George Soros funded foundations\nWas widely reported Laura you hear that\nMm no no no\nAnd so people think it's spontaneous all this woman just showed up to yell at a flake because she's a victim or whatever she said she is that's what's happening\nAnd you know I I draw the correlation between what's happening in America now what happened in Germany\nIn the late Nineteen twenties and Nineteen thirties where you had a fanatical movement Nazi ism\nAccumulating power behind the scenes by violent methods\nAnd there and it was big money in it as well okay while the population was looking way wasn't interested was engaged and the media in Germany basically we're afraid of the Nazis and they wouldn't tell the truth about that\nThat was more of a fear thing than than a what we have now is that the media in America is ideologically in line with the progress ones there cause in the media is the same cause that George Soros so it was a little bit more extreme than the editors of the New York times but not much\n[noise] so this big picture that's formulated over the past I Would say ten years um I don't think President Trump understands it\nUm and I'll give you another thing if I were President Trump I

an accident\nIt was no accident it was leaked the instructor for its wishes which I'm not exactly sure were sincere\nBut let's say let's take it for face value that letter was leaked putting the woman in danger and it was leaked by somebody in Congress because only two people have the letter\nSo the FBI should be investigating that and should get to the bottom and I'll tell you if they start that investigation which I Would order if I were president\nSo the FBI should be investigating that and should get to the bottom and I'll tell you if they start that investigation which I Would order if I were president that scandal that whole thing is going to unravel fast because that was no accident what happened a cabinet\nAnd the women were all the women are all lying by the way they were all line\nTwo and a couple of people are looking into this who actually knew or knew both of them now now new to them and\nWhatever it was ... I went through this I went through this myself mhm right and and I saw things\nLeveled against me that were insane and\nAh you know at this point in this country people are gonna have to make a decision by the progressive left this figured out that they have the media in their pocket and they can do what they want\nThey can do exactly what they want and they almost got Kavanaugh they almost got him and this is kind of country what\nIs is it you're not going to get an honest take from the media they're not going to investigate things they're not going to try to find the truth except it\nExcept that because it's been ... been in Plano for quite some time so who do you depend on\nTo get the truth the only the apparatus is the criminal justice system and I'll put forth a President Trump should really see a bigger picture he takes everything personally any fights back effectively himself but I don't know if you see in the big picture what's happening here\nYou know once you start to erode basic rights like presumption of innocence you process which you say they don't matter as the senator from Hawaii said don't matter\nDon't presumption of innocence of somebody accuses you of misconduct none you're guilty\nBecause in the past some women have been abused I mean think about it\nThey're they're attacking the fundamental rights that Americans have and have that\nAnd nothing what is what is being done nothing\nAnd I think ... I mean it's a division but I'm just so worried about it I Can't\nI Am ... I Am petrified of this I ... I completely agree with you and I was slammed\nFor the last three weeks for saying just because someone alleges something and says this is my truth doesn't mean that you can just say okay this person has to be fired this person has to be boycotted this person has to be a thrown to the\nTo the curb denounced um put upon across crucified lose a promotion this has got to stop\nThat 'cause I got to have it anybody well and it had happened it happened to me it had have obviously things happen to you look what happened to you things yeah and it it is a brutal unfair situation and and once you're accused of something where do you do to get your information that way\nAnd there isn't anybody in place to rectify it although President Trump could do it by trying to get to the bottom of this cabinet mess my new column posted on Bill O'Reilly dot com is it is about this issue mhm is about ... exactly about how uh your truth has replaced thought truth\nOkay so and I and I take it off the University of North Carolina which now wants to honor Christine for 'em and and I I've I never comment on a doctor for one way or the other because I don't know what happened", "city": "Birmingham"}
