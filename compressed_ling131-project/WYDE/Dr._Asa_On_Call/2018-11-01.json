about gaining a metaphorical sense who is dating Houdini is five foot three he's considered at this time period and outsider Hungarian\nAn immigrant at a time when more immigrants were coming into the country than ever before\nHe's a minority is Jewish\nSo already you have a lot of things that people in that time viewed as stacked against you he was an outsider he wasn't thought of as American and yet somehow he became America's\nFirst superstar and he really was that's not really even a debatable statement he was America's first superstar because although there were people who are famous actor is on the stage and later in silent pictures they were famous for portraying other people other powerful papal\nHoudini was famous for who he was [noise]\nHe's this small Jewish immigrants like Shane can hold he can escape from anything\nMetaphor and given the time period this isn't a time when most people are feeling repressed most people are feeling like there's this feeling to how high they can write here's a man without education without any money at the ultimate rags to riches story\nFrom Nineteen oh seven inch around Nineteen to Houdini performed with reached success in the United states\nYou freed himself from jails handcuffs chains ropes and straight jackets optimal hanging from a rope inside of a street audience or out in front of a major newspaper for the extra publicity because of imitators Deanie put his hand tough act behind him in Nineteen oh wait began escaping from a locked water filled milk yeah\nHere again is Joshua ...\nHoudini was largely known for his escapes but truthfully most of his skate for publicity stunt that were done outside and harbors to get people\nTo come to his magic show so this is why he would be seen upside down the straight jacket or doing underwater escape British jobs but in Nineteen oh eight he had a brilliant idea to bring the major escape to the stage\nAnd this was the one that he brought his milk can escape it said original Houdini illusion and this is the original milk cat he would go inside the can so only has had with him or and then he would do something really he would\nTo everybody in the audience I have here the biggest stop watching the world and they would bring out of big clock and he would say I want all of you to help me warm up my lungs by holding your breath for a minute with me and it would get everybody in the audience to hold their breath the timer would start and he would go\nTo merge himself into the cat [noise]\nEverybody tries to hold their breath thirty second go by and\nThey learn it's heart he comes up after a minute they kick the can and and now it's really\nThirty second go by and\nThey learned it's heart he comes up after a minute they kick the can and and now\nIt's really because what does he does he hasn't shown you that what he's doing is impossible like most magicians is shown is that what he's doing physical and real and that is a way that everybody remember even if there were three thousand people in the crowd\nCould understand and identify on a very intimate level the real danger that he was just have\nThe region is magician Joshua ... with the details on how exactly the middle of June ... and worked\nSo this is how the allusion would work he would say after a moment of meditation\nI Will now hold my breath much long and it would re submerged six assistance would play the top on the can and then the last six had locks on the side a small curtain was placed around it this was to protect the secret of his illusion remains a secret for this day\nAnd then the clock starts ... after a minute almost everybody in the audience couldn't hold their breath after two minutes a skeptic for scare at the three minute mark\nThe theater manager would come out with an accent his hand looking very confused like this never happened before and of course that happened every night to same exact way this is ... brilliant with orchestrating a play and playing with your emotions\nAt the four minute mark everybody in the audience was shouting mercy mercy for Mr Houdini and just because he was about to break open that can within ... who would emerge from behind the curtain soaking wet funding arrests applause\nSafe hated they love [noise] then with the way to hurt had sill fluff it was his is no sisters aside\nYou know just because this was an

years after Houdini that what you didn't know is that as a crew was unloading the can\nThey dropped it and we don't know how old you needed it but we do know that genetics than did it with a trap door lit a lid that even when lock you could escape\nThrough when they dented the can they stopped the method of escape trap door wouldn't open Jeanette that didn't know this until he was underwater inside the can with the padlocked lock no way to shop for health no way to signal what had happened\nIt took his wife who was watching the trick from the wings three minutes\nBefore she realized something had gone wrong she assured all the assistance in to help unlocked the cat but of course remember the way the trick is supposed to work they never have to unlock the padlocked they couldn't remember which he went to which law so they got mixed up and they lost another\nPrecious minutes by the time the unlocked the can open it enough to live only long enough so that they could explain to him how he had been held\nVery Houdini out a few close calls himself over the years being very long I was one of the most dangerous stunts that the magician ever pulled off\nShackled uncovered Houdini\nTrying to dig his way out he soon became exhausted panicked while calling for help his hands finally broke the surface of beer and he passed down in his personal diaries\nHoudini wrote that it was a very
