forget that our choices matter this is a great plan for your life you know you were designed with a purpose you got gifts and talents I don't have\nYou have abilities that that I don't have and I have abilities you don't have did you know that I tell you that because I think one of the biggest pieces that people miss with their health is knowing why they're here\nWhatever it is whether you're a mom grandma whether you are a dad had no kids or you're just you're working every single day and you've been given a certain set of\nOf abilities it's finding those in in using those to serve others so you kind of know your in your sweet spot when you're doing what you're good at\nAnd and you're making a difference in other people's lives that's what we're here for and I found that people that know their purpose that really walk in that and they they can live in that that their health is pretty amazing okay the ones that don't that just kind of drifting through life I don't know why they're here don't really know what they're great skill sets are\nHave a real hard time health wise and you see that with people when they get older like the whole concept of retiring nephew retired and you you claim that and you're good with that that's that's fine it's just not for me I don't like the concept of it I don't like what it means\nBecause you've been given talent and abilities that you're supposed to use your whole life\nSo I think once you you're mentally once you tell you the brain that you're retired that it you know it's kind of just season where you're just going to play golf\nIf you look at the statistics that people that that do retire men or women and you look at their health their health declined and we say well when you're sixty five and you're retired you're sixty five right so it's just one of those things where you're you're older and ... the body supposed to get sick at some point or break down or\nWhatever and it's not\nThe case is that mentally you're not on point everyday mentally you're not on purpose everyday you see that with with moms a lot like once the kids grow up and they leave the house and they leave the ...\nEspecially if the kids become disengaged right like it's okay that go do their own thing they move halfway across the country and they have their own life and you see 'em twice a year\nWell there there's a lot to that and if a mom has all of her stuff worth in in her own purpose wrapped up in the kids\nNow what can you see that person get into a situation where health declines\nSmall point of telling you that as this is that you really want to get into the you are your district ... what what they're four\nAnd you'll find that great health no matter what your ages will come out of that and that's a real big key so we're talking about arthritis want to jump in on this because it's a big big topic before I get into these two points of arthritis rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis I Want to get on the phones for just a minute so let's get to marry Hi Mary\nI'm calling from my husband Mike\nThis rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis I Want to get on the phones for just a minute so let's get to marry Hi Mary\nI'm calling from my husband Mike and she and diagnosed with MS how my question is is there a protocol for reading and math\nYou know there Mary I'll tell you this\nMultiple sclerosis as a challenge for for so many and it it's one of those situations where most just break it down for what it is okay it's looked at as an auto immune process in the body\nThe body attacks itself and it's the actual nerve if you think about a nerve kind of like a piece of of electrical wire so you know how the electrical wire has the copper in the middle right in the mental and then it has that rubber coating around the outside that's kind of like a nerve in our body\nSo if the nerve is healthy but the ... Mile Island which is ... around the nerve which kind of like the rubber coating on a wire\nWhat happens is the body say something's wrong with that so it starts to eat that away\nAnd when that breaks down and you begin to eat that away than it exposes the nerve the nerve because a lot more fragile and in creates a lot of dysfunction the nurse begin to lose their function and then of course they are you there in turn you lose a lot of the ability and and the function of the body and that's where you see the decline of someone\nSo really you have to look at what's going to slow the process down because right now in medicine and with with a lot of the findings and the evidence as we call it\nThere is technically no cure right but but there are things you can do definitely to slow the process down and that's what it's all about it's about maintaining the highest quality of life you can when you're faced with any challenge\nThat you can for the duration and that's really what the focus needs to be on with MS so one of the keys that you want to look at and this is really interesting\nBut if you look at what makes the mile and in the body there's there's something because it was created remember this is all being built when you were in your mom right when you're in your mother and and God was developed in the body at that point all these different process just for being foreign well guess what makes smiling\nIs milk so there's a milk sugar called galactose it's very different than glucose which has table sugar or is or is it a form of sugar in your sucrose and yet and you got fructose which is the fruit sugar sucrose as one of the table sugar\nBut the galactose is the milk sugar and the the mother's milk created and built the mile and\nWhat's interesting is goats milk and goats milk yogurt anything along organic goes smell is a very similar almost the same molecular structure is human mother's milk\nAnd what what's really interesting they found is that by eating the goats melt and by utilizing that galactose no sugar it can potentially helped to reproduce smiling and help that grow even better or prevent the breakdown of it\nAs well so is that is that a cure no is that something that you can incorporate and you're eating plan along with high level of mega three fatty acids\nTo to really help support the nervous system sure\nAnd that's what it's all about so there's there's a lot of natural things you can do information and cutting down information in the body is a big key too\nSo that's that's one of the major major keys is cutting down the inflammatory process and and mental and emotional stress with somebody with MS\nIs a major trip so if there's any kind of emotional stress going on at all you have to eliminate it you have to get as far away from it as you can and build kind of a fortress of that person\nThe most so stressed going on at all you have to eliminate it you have to get as far away from it as you can and build kind of a fortress of that person\nOf of just an entire situation with them where there's there's a lot of\nAnd you do that and really make a difference to slowly ... they did it in the higher quality of life as a person of faith hope that helps to lead to a three Seventy seven to ... to pay three Seventy two separate lives are open to tell\nUs what size and shape network dot com we're here for each

daily lifestyle that's where my health becomes in welcome to the easy to use mine healthy ad design improve wellness and builds strength which when your lifestyle choices and your progress with the might help ... you can easily track your health goals\nSomebody's any person's a mega three fatty acids levels are mega three six nine and then you're trans fat sorts of cancer fat so you want to figure out\nHow much a person actually has going on and how well their body as is functioning with them that's\nA real big key because with rheumatoid arthritis the higher the omega three fatty acids on the body the better the joints are going to feel\nAnd the veterans can function now to contrast that to osteoarthritis remember osteoarthritis\nDoesn't have the auto immune components of the body's not attacking itself with osteoarthritis is a general wear and tear so an athlete that starts to get wear and tear on their knees start to get knee pain or low back pain or neck pain or shoulder pain from say a tennis player or a golfer\nSo someone has repetitive motions or a factory worker that's been moving things UPS workers it's been moving things\nFor Twenty years or Fifteen Years that's what we call wear and tear so last year is right is a good anti inflammatory based diet\nIs is something that's great to follow so you're eating believe it or not your food habits\nMake a tremendous difference in the way you feel makes tremendous difference in the joints they make a tremendous difference in the ... the overall way that your body functions and so if you're if you're going to have\nGood I'm Out like let's say equal amounts of lean quality proteins that you're eating every single day like chicken fish beef or eggs that's great you want to cut back a lot though when you're dealing with arthritis\nAnd a lot of the starchy carbohydrates so bread pasta cereal crackers potatoes rice you want to cut a lot you want to cut back on that because that can sometimes for some\nCan raise the inflammatory response and one thing you definitely do not want to do low fat\nNo when I say get fat I mean things like nuts seeds things like whole eggs right or things like the fats found in fish like we just talked about avocados and great coconut oil is great too\nBut getting the right amount of fat in your body every single day is tremendous on cutting down the inflammatory process to a huge deal so when you're dealing with arthritis makes sure make sure that you that you have those kind of on point your eating habits going to be one of the greatest tools and weapons everybody looked for a pill\nEverybody looks for a patch or by looked for the lotions and the potions\nBut at the end of the day it's going to be your daily habits that make the biggest difference triple eight

I'm just wondering what to do about it\nYeah I'll tell you when depending on the course I'm not there to see it\nBut I can tell you that when you have a certain cows from it's usually from repetitive motions or repair uh repetitive wear and tear from say the way that ... hit your foot\nAnd the cows can build over time and it can also reduce so it's it's obviously to not wear those I Would get to a

that you really need to get and let them always on the big special guy I think that\nThat it's always good to have a professional opinion from someone in that field and then you can create a good system around at for example they say oh we can do this this this here's how you avoid it then you got your answer if they throw their hands up and to say well I don't know then you either need to
