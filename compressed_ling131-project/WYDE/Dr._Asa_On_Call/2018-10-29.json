a cut my teeth in my dad I was fortunate enough my dad took me trout fishing over in the Ozarks I grew up in them yeah and a\nDad took me a trout fishing at a very early age and that really started it now you know it was left hunting fishing hiking everything to do with the outdoors really\nYeah and just to make a a kind of a long story short I mean I spent I spent my time in corporate America and a lot of background in information technology and marketing and such but always kept that love the outdoors and\nYou know of course this land business is just a perfect combination for that so well I'm just really enjoyed it and um got my license in a story and uh I've been to land farm ranch every cent\nYeah well you you been doing a lot you do a lot around the national forest in before we talk about the the national forest in in the way and do you own there I didn't get introduced to um to fly fishing until I was an adult probably five or six years ago and I always thought it was kind of a

are you guys are\nGood man good well hey listen I Want an update on the ... tree on the ... are you in\nA robbery king and John Horton and some of our other team are over there all of our Georgia folks were over there for the uh some bill ... and I got to hear how it was man I was so excited to get that report from chip away like a few weeks ago and to hear that they were actually going to get to do it after the hurricane I just I I've been waiting to get a report from yeah\nYeah well we uh we had a great weight they are thanks so you know um\nOh we saw a lot of damage coming into the the expo grounds there\nI'll ride around the expo or was it was rather\nA until it you know limbs down that kind of like a little bit of power outage around ...\nBut um we had a good show there are there was a lot of people would come right I think the crowd was all a little bit I Know lots of water people when I say local twenty thirty mile radius of a military there probably had better things to do and yeah and it's lower for that reason um\nBut we still we talked with people from Virginia a the Carolinas water Florida South Florida people um and I actually talked to a guy from Texas\nA M and we still had the international ... we saw a lot of people from all over the world that come through and that's pretty typical that we see that uh there at that exposed so yeah it was a it was a good week uh I enjoy the time they are the weather\nOver the world that come through and that's pretty typical that we see that they're that exposed so yeah it was a it was a good week uh I enjoy the time they are the weather was a little bit warm the first three days and we had a mass cool morning on the last day on Thursday\nAnd I'm a you know you're just a you know as as usual we come away with some contacts and and so I'm a maintenance and people would talk about our farm listings and that kind of thing that I think it'd be beneficial for your\nYeah absolutely why not our thoughts and prayers are still go out to all the folks in southeast Alabama south Georgia and then\nUh Florida just received a lot of damage from Michael and we had an ear and basically uh with the Alabama count them as association on last week Randall and she was talking about\nA lot of our cattle producers in the south part of the state are still recovering one she she mentioned one former specifically that had about thirty miles of fence down just around his one form\nThat that are out there there's a good bit of\nA that kind of damage around especially look used in ... I'm probably Geneva county there in Alabama that are just stay in that kind of damage and you know a lot of times you might drafted in area after a storm in and you look at the buildings and there may be\nYou know a roof some shingles blown off for some metal blown off and he's like well the the building sustains itself but\nWilliams uh they fall a lot easier and it doesn't take a lot of wind and awesome Williams down and get on fences right when you've got five hundred acres is spent on bad happens you know a thousand times that takes a long time to go through there and it was apparently it\nYeah and it doesn't take long for the cows to find the how does it\nExactly exactly especially this time of year when\nYou know for just starting to get a little slimmer on the ground right I just don't want to get to the fall months a year and so those cows are are there out searching and looking and you can bet the first place they're going to go ... that has leaves on it right ... leaves next thing you know what they said that hold the fence and they had to go\nWow I didn't grow up around cows I I've spent you know a little bit of time round and but one of the things it's always amazing to me that the the most Warren ground is usually right there around the fans they follow the perimeter of the fence and man if there's any way for them to get out those rascals are going to be out on\nThat that's right that's right I mean I can tell you from experience [laughter] travel is getting the it um the phone calls that I get a for cattle out or when I'm gone right sure I can leave town and I met with Anna that happened on the cattle out there trying to round up somebody go that cows that for me\nOr they're watching your Facebook page cows and watching your Facebook page to know where you are going to do that and there will\nRead so but ah yeah and and that's that's the devastation I mean when you've got cattle and you can't get paying them\nA man they're either in somebody else's pasture or they're in somebody's crop field um you know the guys got peanut Cher cotton or things like to you they don't want those cattle out there in in in their crop right uh they're they're battling enough as it is just to get everything big so\nYeah that that's a huge thing um one thing I saw that was really disturbing to me\nGoing through a that southwest Georgia area was the pecan orchard yeah just just looking at those uh we saw some you know a lot of trees down but almost every tree ... right and just to clean up from that and they were you know they're just a few weeks away from harvesting those on so I'm I'm sure a lot of\nThe ah up on their own the ground and I don't know if that can be harsh or not but there's a lot a huge task layer and those pecan trees\nThe uh up because they're on the ground and I don't know if they can be harsh or not but there's like a huge task they are in those pecan trees I mean you can plant one today in your seven or eight years yeah they start in production\nYeah that's that's almost generational destruction when something like that happening to becoming greedy and\nIt is and it was you know there there was a lot um down through Webster county towards ... and there's a lot of new recalling a rose go when ... when you stop and even those trees\nWere laid over a you know they were they were a point at all in one direction there and uh so hopefully those can be straightened back up and be okay but you know you can just see that's long term damage yeah cotton crops you could see the uh the cotton and been stripped out of the bowls are a lot\nOn the ground there's a lot still in the plant but it it was not in a bowl form and rhyming harder pig I'm if I'm sure that a lot lettuce is aloft crawl up our our big metal in their body and said it was going to be above the crop this year and\nA lot of farmers were going to get out of bed and have you know have some ... ...\nYou know random we were um it ... meeting a last week in Montgomery and ... industries cheap for the state talked about the damage in Georgia being used in Alabama it's in the millions\nHundreds of millions when George age the billions and um I think we're probably going to find out Florida will be the same so which is the generally astronomical damage into\nThat trap you know own a a poultry farms are I Know in Alabama I talked to a guy yesterday falling away so that actually this year\nI'm In Houston county he had some damage there nothing major\nFarm down the road um that I've been on before a lost the roof off of a pool that house layer and I'm I'm\nHopefully they can repair that they had birds they are so ... you know I Know there was some damage to poultry houses in Alabama Georgia the last I heard about Ninety two houses damaged or destroyed wow um and so there's a pretty significant number there\nYou know the net southwestern corner so you know if there's ... there's all kinds of other\nEgg a top building sure a grain elevators pay the elevators shops dry she is the whole nine yards wow um\nAnd uh I spoke to another guy or earlier this week that um he's out of the Mariana Florida area a past and stuff and and southeast Alabama there too but they're big watermelon uh like for a lot of cotton picking up there in that area and and uh they had major structure damages\nOr their farm near Mariana there but I'm older begins were toppled over ... D so they didn't have anything there to hold him a lot of farm sheds and structures are are gone and they had a lot of equipment that was\nTotally out of Amos book out buildings fell on them or you know other other kind of damage\nRight well there are a lot of struggling yeah there are a lot of folks down that way that need our thoughts and prayers and help as we can give it in a rental I Know you're burning up the road headed to to show some poultry houses today look at some forms if somebody wants to reach out to you or about buying or selling a farm or poetry foreign how do they do that\nYeah just give me a call on my cell phone numbers to five six to three man five three seven that\nThat's right or you can reach Randall up turns to the southeastern ... office at eight six six seven five one land Randall thanks for being on the show today brother in a blessings in your travels\nLike Johnny yeah Dave I'm excited right now we're gonna leave clay County Alabama we're going to go down to Tallahassee, Florida we don't uh don't often covered that part in our topics on the land show here but we've got one of our own Daniel how to\nBut go down to Tallahassee, Florida we don't uh don't often covered that part in our topics on the land so here but we've got one of our own Daniel how to Mackey there who's going to give us a timberland report from\nTallahassee oh Daniel how are you this morning buddy good Jonathan how're you doing\nI'm doing well man do ... I was glad to hear for for our listeners that that might not know 'cause I don't hear you weekly I'm you're one of our southeastern leg or a page and she lived there in Tallahassee, Florida and had to evacuate for hurricane Michael and I'm Glad to hear that you you came home and and your things were were relatively okay\nYeah I'm yeah I'm Tallahassee itself had a fair amount of trees down and on and had some power outages but we were owned the the far east side of the hurricane and um and were spared um for the most part and you know all points list I'm definitely got a lot worse than we did\nYeah and I know part of your family business or the or for one of the other things that you do in addition to being a an agent with southeast Joanna group is you help folks uh your your family company their maintenance timberland and ah and timber assets and what have you been seeing a post hurricane\nAnd I'm sure at this point a lot of people have started to see some of the um graphics come out from the floor for a service and um and some of the damage assessments that are coming in as far as the numbers um I think the last figure I saw was about three million acres of wild of agricultural land affected in Florida for this hurricane\nAnd the rainbow trout hatchery and and probably you know we've got ... member radio stations all over Alabama and more on the you know the Internet and everything and probably have some list or that don't even know we have trout in Alabama so\nJust tell us a little bit about you know about the tale re stay here you know maybe the history of our trout got there and then tell us about your business and how you get started\nSo uh when they built the dam and sixty two they started operations of a mess like damn\nAnd it impounded such deep water to a Smith like is is it really deep lake and I think the original idea was let's put them on trial in the late\nAnd the what happens you know to give people a different layer of the lake to fish do you know brand bass Missouri warm water species are going to stay up near the top but if we put some you know some trout in there they'll go deeper and that'll give\nPeople more water to fish and after a couple of years they realized nobody in Alabama I knew how to fish sixty feet lead from Florida [laughter] and\nThat's the price surprise um but it's not but some of them were coming through the dam and getting into the river system low it and\nSo they were targeting ah the trout and the river and they found guys down there I'm I'm sure most of them fly fishermen who are who thought hey there's document lake maybe there'll be on the river two and a and they were really targeting them and doing pretty well\nAnd so they changed over and said well we'll we'll stop talking to like start docking at the rivers and I think that happened in the seventies\nAnd er instance then you know they they started talking I think probably once a year that's twice a year that every other month and now we get docked I'm with rainbow trout every single month to help 'em or it it helps our catcher aids has helped people have more access to 'em and stuff like that\nWell are are the fish able to reproduce or do the child live long enough to reproduce there\nThey wouldn't live long enough or the the hatchery from which the state back\nOur fish are supposed to be sterile fish um even if they weren't the cost the hydroelectric dam\nIt rises and falls and pretty thick and fast Sharon wrong and uh yeah that that flow would not allow them to uh to make a good read and uh and be able to raise a offspring and in that part of the river and you know it could be that\nIf conditions were right they could go up some of our creeks and a ... on but we haven't we haven't documented any of that taking place on the fifty\nRight one of the cool things just about where I live in Perry county as we have a fish hatchery in the town of Marion and they raise a lot of the fish that we swapped for tendency for their uh for their trial we send our spot I mean a ... scenario right mass and that sort of stuff up there so it's kinda cool\nUh than our little towns having a part in that but it it is how far down river from the damn will you find these drought\nSo I've got a picture of a guy who has who has a five pound rainbow and his town in his hand or down at Copeland ferry bridge which is probably\nWho has who has a five pound rainbow and his town in his hand or down at Copeland ferry bridge which is probably\nI Would guess forty miles\nDown while wow who I wouldn't have yeah when I either that had some ...\nSo where are you doing it\nGorgeous gorgeous is the kind of cut off but rise or when they're operating edits putting way too hot of a water back and um for the route to to go down and that's only in the wintertime so now you know as temperatures start football is the water temperatures start to drop back down this time is it hitting the water for his long\nUm the stamp starts to drop and they'll start those are migrating they'll start maybe they'll do look for food look for better places to this that and eat and uh and they'll they'll just keep going until they found the right spot\nNo one of the most iconic scenes to me in Alabama as you're driving through is when you drive across the river right they're below the damn early in the morning and ah and water temperatures cooler than the air to him when you you get all that the same you know as an off the water that's really cool there and their brand\nIt it is that that bridge is probably a hundred at least a hundred feet above the water yeah and there are times that you're driving across the bridge and that fog is above you [laughter] well to the both the rivers down that low and the fog is coming up a hundred feet yeah over it\nI'm not a fan and that is really cool\nIt is you know right on the surface there's usually a clear spot and so I'm so guys\nYou know you can see what you're doing you can see right or what's around you but then you kind of you kind of take a break and look up and all you see is that that ... moving no across the face the trees and over the surface of the water it's uh it's pretty amazing\nWhat brand and on I Know this is a real family affair or you know your wife Mary care on your and your father Randy ... helps run the shop and a beautiful children there and you know you just tell us about your business how at runs the services you all for\nThe type of God's servers you all for in a little bit about the flood shop\nSo we offer um guided trips we do waiting trips where were you furnish everything um we've got waiters in boots and all sizes and so just people just show up at the shop where you get 'em geared up they come out and stand side by side\nOr either four or eight hours the other half day trip for a full day trip\nAnd I talk about the river about about trout about how they\nFunction and operate and try to get you you know the the right casting and the right or ability to read the water in order to have the best\nAnd catching fish and that's you know pretty heavy on instruction in it where we spend a lot of time working with you and helping you um be more successful would fly fishing\nWe also offer a drift boat trip and uh I have a boat trip Andrew boat called an added post and it's made in Montana and it's a it's designed by two guys that really worked at it and and made it basically the perfect fly fishing boat\nAnd uh it's just convenient it is um it's comfortable it's super stable and so we can go out and that and we get to cover a lot more water we got to travel more\nUm we we have good success catching fish but it's it's more of a relaxed or if it's got it's got pedestal seats in it so why is that if you want you can just kinda sit down and relax and uh it's just a a great way to enjoy the day I'm spending targeting\nWant you can just kind of sit down and relax and uh it's just a a great way to enjoy the day I'm spending targeting the\nTrout and talk and in and get your downriver many how many put food on the boat their brand new I mean I can fit three anglers over on a on the job so yeah it's you or I can do as many as a ten\nOn a waiting trip but we we divide that out by depending on ability and uh and number a guide\nThose those ... are fun and I've never done it in Alabama but we my wife and I did it uh in Wyoming and it's just it is a relaxing in a beautiful way to to get to how how much water can you cover in one of those drift but so I'm sure it varies by current but how much water do you fish and a day or and a half two\nAnd a half day will typically do about two to three miles nine I'm older down and then come back out\nIn a while yeah not a wholesome man that\nSuch a such a great job so you said you you were talking about kitchen five pound rainbows\nUm I mean how you know ... is that as big as I get\nAnd that's a trophy fish now for our water for sure um it you know there are um recorded instances of people catching fish up to right around the\nEight eight and a half pound drink while on the steps before it yeah so yeah\nThe motives and record it and it was just a record in Alabama states\nNot I think nine and a half okay oh wow yeah\nSo and I know yeah that's it all catch and release are you able I'm assuming since they don't reproduce you can take them\nTo get to this state rag is a bias fish and no calling so if you catch it or at least you can you can fish all day or if you catch a fish and you um designated as part of your ... that you're going to take it home in any way if you put it on a string or a puddle on the side of the river or in a bucket\nOr that is one of your five fish for the day you know try and uh and so we do all catch and release with our church just because it's\nIt's too much work sure it it just changes the changes the focus of the trip\nWhen we got to keep them alive yeah I'm assuming you're family likes to eat trail I mean that would be my guess\nWe do it so we had it it's kind of like the guy a while when I was younger I raised ... for for eight\nOr ... or [laughter] you know they're they're kind of your pet to kind of it's\nKinda hard I get when you were you really want our class to catch fish yeah you really we I mean I Know I've been on many trip with clients where I Am way more anxious about them catch that dry are worried about it\nWell always all I got to feel that way [laughter] if\nIf I take a if I take a fish out the next trip\nAll that's running through my head it you know they could have caught that are making it so that yeah we we don't really\nPay you know if we have one that has been injured you know before and we you know we're able to then that it ... and get it you know that I had fish could could go home but it's not it's not one of those things that we really are focused on\nOne more time the superstition can be dialed up on Ninety five point three\nOr twelve

I felt for actually meeting him and he even had a line T shirt on whether or not was geared that is really cool I\nFelt weird taking pictures with you well I did too with a a little character right that's not real but that's OK what Stanley travel the world and sometimes he stopped in the line studio and he made it to a radio station he did yeah it's not a good time just and then at the time that's right that we send them back off\nI'm into a wherever he goes no he'll make so little ... who\nAre you just send it to where it came from so I mean people said that oh so you don't send it to like a random did not do not have a flat Stanley is what they are one several clearly it's usually it's a school project then you have to take my I think it was lost on done it\nFamily is so flat stay on that one several clearly it's usually it's a school project and then you have to take them out I think it was my son's done it you have to send him to different places if you got a relative out of town you a ship it over there I mean it's really not that big of a thing and they just take pictures with a flat Stanley and then they send you the pictures\nAnd you put together this little collage of all the places like family spent ... so some kid out there and wanted him to be pictured on the line yeah what do I know yeah I got it should make you feel good about yourself\nIt does um I'm feeling sluggish today though you could say you said right now because of lunch oh okay well then what\nWould you started off the show saying he felt sluggish yeah I didn't know I didn't ... I didn't know that we're sorry I'm trying to interject some of my life and to the show as well um\nUh we had a an employee appreciation\nLunch today some have called it the last supper but it was a what you're talking about was a\nIt was good for the food was good I don't eat lunch normally as you guys know and uh uh this is why it made you sluggish this is why the ... diet has been so good for me\nIs because I can just even though I Do get hungry when there's that kind of food\nOut there those burgers cooked by the one and only Justin Brown and some sort of death I heard was amazing there's hot there's heart gigs there's hotdogs chips dip candy cup gigs all kinds of stuff and I just when a bit\nOverboard and all that I had one hot dog one hamburger that's and I had to go to help them about the\nIt was good wasn't it was good I think you might talk does up a little montage and you're the only person that said that to me everybody\nElse went crazy on just make it was the only reason I can talk about this because it doesn't really take any skill to make it it's literally just cream cheese sour cream bacon and cheese and green onions and you just throw it all the time and\nThere wasn't nuts and they're not no not at a ... bacon and now I thought they were like ... or not I don't like nuts either but I don't either swarm no I'm not seeing that algae was wearing\nA that was not for me that must have been from something involving Justin ground about fitness burgers and that was not I mean we all do not\n... you ever had a peanut a peanut butter burger\nNot can't say that I have a verb a peanut butter on it no that's discussed no it's actually pretty good I don't have anything I had one of those that I'm mug shots made me a I've never been there yeah you try it out also peanut butter many sandwich that's disgusting and well I haven't tried that yet but I'm about\nTo well we were thinking about trying to pickle juice stress old on the popcorn my daughter is a huge pickle fan and somebody here I called in to the show and suggested that and so she's um she's really wanting to try that and I'm not looking forward to it but I'll Try anything once I'm guessing I'll let you know and as\nWe know that's real yeah you either a Carolina Reaper chip I did\nYeah I bought me on that but you mentioned that well this is is the problem when we do that stuff against so disappointed 'cause Jessica instead of just going all in and given at all she's got she takes little lifts the smallest safest peace\nIt's obviously if we still had a morning show I probably would have handled that differently but all I could think was we can't both be out of commission or offer game for the afternoon show and we always do these things before the show starts at I'm just really concerned that it's going to have some sort of stomach distress\nAnd I'm just saying as a producer I Can't be running to the bathroom ever thought of bucket in there right yeah I'm sure nobody would mentioned that the corporate so ah ... let's then I just I'm more did it for the show for myself\nThen there oh right yeah I'm sure nobody mentioned that the corporate so ah ... what's that I just I'm more did it for the show for myself I just but it's less than I got enough of that jet for it to really do it's dirty work and my body [laughter]\nIt it it did what it needed right it was bad yeah well I can take much all I can picture analogy moving into but I don't want to take my evening day a young you\nHear that so somebody's playing the drums what is the noise [laughter]\nYou're going to get a call from that what what was his name Jay Jay Mr PHD out yeah the Mr cage they talk about your filthy mouth your\nYour nasty disgusting\nOr you know we've got people with ph D's and rocket scientist that listen to your show all turn it off right now you know there are lot fuzzier bucket called the ... I\nI don't doubt there's some very smart people I mean we we talk to you guys on a regular basis there's some smart cookie is out there I don't know your accolades but we probably got some PHD people out there yeah and guess what\nTo assume P. H. D. people don't have a sense of humor I think that's offensive for don't fart right poop or anything\nThat is extremely offensive that's like saying blind people can't get an id\nTo do something to point out [noise]\nThe Justice Department held a press conference and ... Jeff Sessions Christopher\nWray and others came out and spoke about this this whole thing and one thing Christopher Wray said that most of the mainstream media is really harping on now that these were not hoax bombs\nThese were not fake bombs if you will but\nIf these were in fact real bombs with real detonator is with a with a working ignition system don't you think Christopher Wray would have said that\nInstead of just saying there it's not a hoax mom\nBecause we can't seem to find any evidence that these things we even had the ability to explode nobody even as much as stubs their total or Ghana splinter through for teen pipe bombs nobody\nAnd and what had let me just that nobody was doing or he didn't really have any intention of them blowing up and he was just trying to scare people we have no idea at this point you got to be interesting to see if he even talks about that or confesses either way\nLet's hear what you guys have to say two oh five nine four one one zero one one Jay Jay is first how are you Jay Jay\nLeno well tell us what's happening or I just want to say that the the guys on the job and\nAnd that's all of them will say about that you can kind of walk out in first of all the all record to say that Andrew and Jessica are do bomb\nAnd he's saying you know that's part of Zion go up\nI heard one of my favorite things while ago I remember a conversation here a while back when I called in and we were talking about some foods and I mentioned something about like ...\nAnd ... and ... just ... [laughter] yeah\n[laughter] I Love it around just not heard it called ... now you had it right until agree okay about your\nJob I mean you know that on the creek and in in shows like Alabama that's where he found out about ... alright but Andrew log oh you said something about a peanut butter in Laos ...\nIt's a killer Mike it kills you know it's the gospel I held\nAs do bomb this strange combination animals or\nA bomb oh but see the money will have to peanut butter slow\nSlide down the going a little ... about her that I learned early on I was Catholic I mean I was going to give it a chance until you said that I don't want anything to help that keen about are slow\nI don't ... or\n... about that I was coming I was going to give it a chance until you said that I don't want anything to help living in a butterfly down south areas it's thick in and it's like the peanut butter for that reason when they get that sticks with you to take to reveal round layer alleged\nClean up water or a little less ... what you got out of both\nYou go well one of them every one on Facebook video next week so prepare yourself for them to\nI Hope I can see that I think somebody ought look\nStill up but he's saying love the show and thank you for loving the show buddy Joe is next ... Hey Joe\n... mind is just like your it hasn't changed that if they ask you get in a hurry that night but it has a ... tail end of the year and I love the show thank you\nThank you Joe Joe now that's that's one vote for crazy one vote for\nObama than twenty eight teams are going to keep a tally tally okay we've uh we've got plenty of people that are looking to vote so uh\nWhat do you think is your mind changed it and this is for those of you that were conspiracy theorists yesterday\nIn the end of the Democrats were possibly behind this or something somebody that is pro Democrat was doing this in order to make Trump supporters or Trump ... bad to have your has your mind changed today now that they've apprehended the guy Elon\nYes well first of all I Love your show thank you for that long to let you know a friend of mine sent me a copy of WWW dot ... dot com or whatever they looked up the name of it was known and lift him a Democrat\nSix legislator they've stripped Republican\nI've seen I I've seen several\nOf those because people have been sending them to me today and I I don't know I I see I don't know what to do about that because I'm not saying that didn't happen but\nIt's just the fact that when they go when you go through his social media he's obvious obviously a Trump supporter he has been the Trump rallies chanting Trump is wearing trunk shirts magna hats all this other stuff into\nThe race just social media\nWell they did but people that are screen shot in the old video and and pictures\nClearly him like there's no denying that it's this guy yeah\nYeah I I don't know not all that I just think it's interesting that you know nobody looks from those things look up yourself dealers tightens up yourself and see what's known about you or whatever and it got changed and we don't think of that change\nYou know I Know on on what kind of ... fell in love with other now\nNow I'm scared [laughter] shut is it just it it's I I don't think it means I don't know what it means they get such as well and the snake\nI have no problem with with people put myself out there too and I really appreciate the people that look that kinda stuff up because it's like today will as soon as it happened thanks so and as soon as this happened\nI'm I'm I said you know we got to rely on the Internet sleuth on this one because people are going to start digging they're going to find out about this guy the government's going to tell us very little and uh here we go we're off to the races that stuff's already happened and you see there with with Ellen ... about Ryan\nHey you know ... and ... on the very end again to the moon is moody trees\nWell\nIt sounds like there's a hurricane going on right now in your phone\n\nWhy do this work I got Ryan I'm up against the break I'll bring you back on on the other side and uh we'll get comments on that stuff do you well five nine four one one one one plenty your phone calls coming up some don't make a move\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething really bad happens\nAnd now that this is here it's their chance to jump on the bandwagon and say see we told you\nIn place the blame directly on Trump I even saw CNN CNN post said that time this whole thing and in putting part of the blame on Sean Hannity what of all people that's right wow\nThe media is eating is up they're going to continue to use this against Trump but I think just like all their other tactics in an effort to thwart the Republicans' chances in the midterms\nThey're actually going to have the opposite effect\nAnd they're going to drive more conservatives\nTo the polls to stop this nonsense Jeremy\nHey hey well\nThe way I feel about this whole thing is is if it walks like a duck\nLike it though\nFor the postal service for a little while and is there one thing that you notice and missing on those packages\nYeah the ... the show it's been processed\nShows that process so um everyone that I've seen are missing\nThose packages yeah the ... the show it's been process\nWhich shows that process so um everyone that I've seen are missing key thing\nA number two most fanatical people everybody's calling this guy and uh I'm calling you know have a upon I'm calling in whatever yes I Am a conspiracy theories of there's a lot of shady stuff the support that all the way back to Lincoln\nWon't go there but um\nI think about those people that you see that or [noise] um I don't know really trying to get a point across with bumper stickers\nThe bumper stickers always just typically go straight on a window of most people that I see with bumper stickers they're everywhere on a car drain there is this the financing I live in North Alabama I live in um I live in uh outside of foreign\nAnd um there's this one individual and spruce time Alabama which is going from Russell hold down to um to Hamilton to hack a bird\nDude will pull this trailer he's got he's got this piece of plywood that says American Atheists wow he he just dates people to pull over there they're talking about somebody that's crazy psycho I mean I could see somebody like this doing something like that or whatever but\nThis guy's got stickers everywhere it's all anti Christian stuff and he's just due to use just dig in for somebody to debate him into prove them wrong\nBut I'm back to what I'm saying look at those stickers look at look at the when the placement only sticker there's nothing out of place if all perfectly owned those windows\nUm it just the whole thing smells funky to me from the beginning um you're not going to make a a real bomb um I mean I'm not a bomb making it for me that I've seen them\nIn a that is not a real ball I mean that's as whatever the intent was to cause fear of the calls media hysteria I feel that it's something to\nKnow to get the media pointed toward show you know that he's this crazy Sacco pass it by these kind of people and that to me that's the whole ...\nThat would tell me this I'm Jeremy do you feel that this poor so here in the fall guy from much larger sinister plan\nAbsolutely one hundred percent go mark one from Madison yep yep yep well\nI Love your show appreciate what you're doing and God Bless America\nWe appreciate you brother moving down next to Jennifer Jennifer how are you\nHave this rich\n[laughter] well I didn't screened the call I just thought it was sorry [laughter] to name well your name Jennifer so you know Iran how are you ...\nAnd I'm I'm just I'm starting to see how Jones made all his money\nUh these conspiracy theorists or\nYou know ... me how people with zero evidence can buy all in all the credit conspiracy but then when presented with real evidence or in total denial\nAnd and I mean I mean we're cocoa for cooking for cocoa puffs here what evidence is there\nA democratic conspiracy yeah\nAnd I mean there's got to talking about bumper stickers are risky one is the guy living in a car\n[laughter] I'm not either look I'm not you know look I'm the I'm by far not a Trump supporter and this is ...\nI was living in a car [laughter] I mean not he look\nLook I'm not you know look I'm the above far not a Trump supporter and this is this this guy has nothing to do with Trump he's crazy you know and crazy people have different things that triggered them some of them it's you know when I was a kid it was dungeons and dragons some of them and people would have died that are heavy metal music\nAnd some people blame poor or whatever crazy people you can't understand them you can understand what's going to trigger them or or what their fetish or or obsession is going to be this is a nut job is obsession was called\nWho did this it's a ... row nut job\nWell and it is the same thing that there's people who will take the Bible and completely flip\nIt on ... and take it out of contacts and make it something it's not and then there'll be labeled all their insane Christian one another not but I mean it it ... they were exactly right I kinda feel the same way about this guy and and for all I Know I could be totally wrong but I'm with you I feel like\nFor whatever reason I just have this feeling that the scotch just to not let me just complete and not and he went off the as\nWell and and right now at this stage in the game ... there's as much chance to the guy being\nIn a nod as there is some sinister plan put on my my politicians because we just I mean we're just on the heels of of him and this guy off we we don't have the evidence all we have is a a a book cover which is in the form of a van and a mug shot to go on\nUntil we get more information which should come pretty pretty rapidly at any point let me ask a question\nReal quick I'll let you go to me this is a bigger question you know I spent a lot of time on Facebook with with relatives and friends and you know with the these political post political means that are clearly factually untrue\nAnd it would take their mental research to understand that they're not untrue but yet people are so desperate to believe\nThese crazy outlandish what is it ... you know how is Alex Jones so popular why are people so desperate to believe these elaborate conspiracy theories it it reeks it like a mental illness\nI don't get comes from people and just not wanting to except to what we're told and I think it all starts for a lot of people too but it's like a ... year told stuff and you just believe that and you get to a certain age where you realize just to get somebody tells me something doesn't mean it's true and then the search for the truth happens and I think sometimes that spirals and some people for some people it spirals out of control\nFor others it's just you know you're going to have wisdom and ask questions instead of just believing everything you're told and I don't think there's anything wrong with that but I think it can lead to end situations like this you're always like well what if it was blah blah blah and again there's nothing wrong with asking questions but I'm with you I think it's just as possible this guy's just a couple of late night I mean that would make to me as much sense\nSometimes the simple answer is the simple answer but I this is the most were ever going to agree guys have a great weekend\nThanks rich you know we don't ever agree with rich I'm\nI I don't know I mean I think if you're exploring why people are are blind in to ah\nTo this stuff you need to look at what what brought them to the point that they were willing to to question it and what series of events happen to get people to where they're like you know I think it's possible that our government would do well when I get a candidate on stuff right I mean that's\nEvidence enough to me that I questioned the motives are what they're capable of our how far they'll take\nWe're no conspiracy theorist but we've launched the Democratic party do some things over the past two years that's really really bother us and it it it's really eye opening that makes you think what to tell us that who's it tell us they they wouldn't do that right we don't have any evidence\nIt's really eye opening that makes you think what's to tell us that\nWho's to tell us they they wouldn't do that right we don't have any evidence that they did\nBut the the fact the Democratic party has pushed us to a point where we're saying it's possible that this is a false flag that people like Alex Jones voice on but we don't really talk about false flags on this show but maybe that's the thing because these people\nThese people they're they're obviously capable of doing it but the biggest thing is they've shown us they're willing to do some\nKind of like have you ever been in a relationship like where things went sour and you realize that this person you thought you knew was lying to you like most of your relationship and it makes you question every single thing that happened and if you stay with them then it makes you question everything that if in the future for a long period of time and again your trash bag I feel like the same thing it's like\nThey broke our trust because I think that they showed us if if they ever had\nThey showed us what they were capable of like you're saying and now we're just questioning everything but I think that's a very human response\nWell and you know everything's normal in the relationship and instead of bringing you flowers and starts bringing your pie bomb\nThings are kind of started climbing yeah I kind of you know I'm ... and we're back to the Alex\nJones thing rich a ritual was bringing up though\nI think another thing to look at it as we're looking at when average Americans started accepting conspiracy theories is what was the one thing that ah\nThat put Alex Jones over the top that really turned the corner and had so many people willing to follow Alex Jones I Believe\nHeard one reporter spoke with an attorney to represent them on one of his minor criminal charges and he said he was the nicest guy you'd ever represented\n... great guy nice guy and can than of good things about him and I'm just like me and it it's a weird bank that mark we'll talk more

Native American now everybody says this guy was inside it by Trump that no one's saying hey we have a Democrat\nBut a lot about her nationality and got special privileges that Native Americans get\nBased on claiming that area as a Native American\nNow maybe you know maybe he was provoked by that because you know so angry that she was claiming Native American heritage and they just send them over there and when they took it out\nI Would be interested to know the town lined up when these packages\nI'm so angry that she was claiming Native American heritage and it just send them over the end when they took an online Democrat and\nI Would be interested to know the timeline that when these packages went out and when she came forward with you know her final statement I mean she sent breathing for quite some\nWell and they had to be 'cause the Elizabeth Warren stuff that was either the end of last week or the beginning of this week where she made the blast statements we remember which was the reason I did I did the DNA test was because I wanted to\nBring trust back to government wanted people to trust the government so took the DNA to that really did it totally helped uh yeah I think we could we can certainly put blaming all moved with worn at this point\nYeah I mean I don't know um you know as a Caucasian a small amount of Native American you know the liberals are always pointing out what Native American ... thanks a lot and and all their suffering and so I don't know you know from a travel standpoint um you know how deep\nThat emotion and you know anger run but I'm not having conspiracy theorists scene Obama approved a weapon and things are at\nWho would've ever thought that would have happened and yet I guess what it's reality so that's all\nI Want to thank thank you making 'em yeah there there's so many instances that with the bones the theory that that the government is above this the government um ... this is this is beneath the government they would never do something like this\nI can dismiss them also can't say that the government did do that is\nThe only thing I can say right now is the government is very capable and willing to do something like this murder or were you\n...
