it'd\nBe the list is our American story and we love to tell every kind of stories you're from arts for sports business and of course history and we do with this day in history every day and we love books\nAnd we've done David McCullough and the Wright brothers and we've done that great great book about Mark Twain's last an epic tour in his life to well get some money back because he'd been broke from so many adventures and misadventures in the stock market and in\nBusiness and a book review caught our attention in the wall Street Journal and the title was the Franklin house divided and here's how it started\nThe fourth of July Seventeen Seventy six Benjamin Franklin was in Philadelphia having helped to draft the declaration of independence while his son\nThe governor of New Jersey was under arrest in Connecticut having been branded an enemy of his country for persisting in his royal duties and opposing the revolution in less than a year William Franklin would be taken to the notorious\nWitch fields go a destination for among others traders who abuse their privileges and lighter incarceration\nAnd that led us to the gas the joins us now the book review was for the loyal son the war in Ben Franklin's house and Daniel mark Epstein joins us now thanks for joining us then\nIt's a pleasure to be with you and then they'll tell us\nHouse ... joins us now thanks for joining us then it's a pleasure to be with you and then he'll tell us what drew you this book\nWhile I was always interested in Benjamin Franklin from the time I was a kid you know it was the one of the most versatile Americans man who was a great inventor [noise]\nUh [noise] and probably the ... the first great scientist in terms of electricity and of course everybody knows the story about been flying the kite\nAnd I remember seeing that would cut of a Benjamin Franklin followed flying with tight with his little boy\nAnd I wondered what would it be like to have Benjamin Franklin as a father I mean a man who was not only a great inventor but um [noise] created the militia in Pennsylvania and order to defend the frontier against the Indians and then you know created the first postal system in Pennsylvania and\nThe University of Pennsylvania and then of course became one of the greatest American patriots during the revolution but would it be like to be that man's son all and then of course I found out that I'm Benjamin Franklin's only son was illegitimate a bastard\nAnd I'm at that point he retired from the army and uh his father got him a really good tutor and he started studying law and then he worked for his father I'm In the legislature in the assembly of Pennsylvania so he got his political career\nAnd then when his father got the job to go off to England as the agent for the assembly of Pennsylvania\nRepresenting the the assembly against the proprietors who refuse to be taxed his son went with him and in England his son rose very quickly uh he went to the bar and got his law his law degree in his mid twenties\nAnd shortly after that she was appointed to be the governor of New Jersey so at that point of his life he was in his late twenties\nOr his father was a fifty in his mid fifties he was even more powerful in the uh in the government than his father was so he had an extraordinary career\nAnd so let's get down to this conflict I mean by the time we get to this damn back this indicator for the country was in pretty much open rebellion in the war was brewing and William took the stand bend to\nTalk about their final meeting in particular was remarkable before we get to that build up to that if we can set up that I I think almost\nJust tragic scene between the father and son\nWell it's really extraordinary the extent to which the two men were living in different worlds ... because I'm by Seventeen Seventy five\nTwo years before the actual a declaration of independence or we had been living in America he was the governor of New Jersey and he'd been the governor of New Jersey for more than a decade\nOr in trying to represent king's interests in America and trying to prevent this revolution which he knew would be a disaster and a lot of people even Benjamin Franklin up until Seventy and Seventy five\nFelt that would be a big mistake for America to separate from the mother country meanwhile his father is in England and his father is still working on behalf of the colonies representing the colonies interest\nIn uh in England or against parliament and he's seeing more and more corruption\nIn uh in England and in the meantime the the the the English government is sending troops to Boston\nAnd the rest of America in order to enforce these uh taxation laws and he's growing more and more bitter against the uh the English government so that the two of them were living in different worlds\nAnd when it finally came down to the ah Seventeen Seventy six\nAnd the declaration of independence a Williams thoroughly on the side of the king and the crown and his father at that point was confirmed American patriot revolutionary so they just went different ways even before that I think it was a certain amount of jealousy between fathers and sons as sometimes\nHappens tragically [laughter] um\nIn ways even before that I think it was a certain amount of jealousy between fathers and sons as sometimes happens tragically hum and um his dad but I think it was a little bit jealous of William\nSo let's talk next about this father and son there at loggerheads what happens to William next as he takes the in the country is moving more clearly ready for war Williams not\nWell first of all his father came home in time to try to talk his son over to the the side\nThat ... the safest that is the side of the revolutionaries\nAnd the two had some very very storming confrontations I'm In Pennsylvania and in New Jersey oh where where his father visited him and he did everything he could to try to get him to come over to the side of the revolutionaries\nBecause that was his side and the family side and William refused and William uh ended up being the last um the last royal governor to do the kings business in America\nA stubbornly refused to leave the governor's mansion and had to be taken away bottle am was put into the worst prison in America the ... field jail\nWhere he was in solitary confinement a with bread and water for Eighteen months or in suffered terribly during that time um he finally was released prisoners exchange but his father had very little to do with that and eventually went back to England\nAnd they said they're really heard Ben Franklin I mean hey it's his son and no matter what kind of jealous you might have existed and watch this before this kind of like a fool your son had to be difficult more over he's a very public figure\nAnd it wasn't as if his son was some wallflower he was a governor who is now in jail how do they need all that\nWell Franklin said nothing I'd ever heard him so bad in this entire life and you have to believe that [noise]\nAnd it was a lot of public criticism of him for not for not helping his son out but remember he was the minister clinic potentially to France\nAnd could not be seen as being in collusion with a you know with Atari and so he was a horrible ... it's really a tragic situation or which really is kind of like the um [noise] ah the revolutionary war in microcosm\nAnd do you think he really understood the sons or should\nI don't know I don't really think I think the the part of the tragedy of the book and what I finally ended up saying in the end is that\nThese were two men who could never reconcile although the son wanted to weigh in on it to more than his father did they could never reconcile because they they just did not understand each other and these are two very intelligent man\nSo it shows you just how extreme of this break between father and son can be when it happens\nIn in in the end the father didn't understand the sun the sun didn't understand the dad either\nI don't think so I don't [noise] part of the what a what we haven't spoken about is that at the end of the war William became a counter revolutionary violent counter revolutionary and um this his father could not could not ever forgive\nAnd indeed he couldn't in by the way father son stories will rebutting ... everyone in I mean this is Arthur Miller made his living selling father son joined packets now Bruce Springsteen's made his\nAnd it's good herring and found his story is I remember Daniel markets dean loyal son more in Franklin's house thanks so much for joining us\nThank you was you know we love\nIf his are always brought to us by the find folks at Hillsdale too\nAnd my goodness one of the things I had forgotten to ask\nA Daniel was what the similarities word today\nTo then uh in large measure that populist movement of the revolutionaries well it came about because they'd been felt like they'd been governed by foreign and far of power and that's of course the British Crown and in large measure today a lot of the populist movement\nMany people believe is because it's a far tower called Washington DC and many people in this country feel like\nThat foreign power or that far away power isn't responsive to their needs and to their lives again as always these stories stories about American history\nAre brought to us by the great folks at Hillsdale College and if you can't get the Hillsdale Hillsdale can get to you go to Hillsdale dot edu\nAnd folks they have terrific terrific online courses they're on everything and the one eyed most highly recommend to start things out is the constitution one on one\nBecause it digs in drills down on the founding fathers and what they were after she created the most important document in world history\nAnd many people believe that it's not just us saying we don't have a lot of opinions here in the show we just tell stories and one of the stories coming up we'll be doing a long form series on the constitution\nAnd how it came to be because the Hillsdale dot edu or that's Hillsdale dot edu and again the loyal son is the book\nThe war in Franklin's house and we learn in this story if there was a civil war in this country long before the civil war and it started off\nWith just a small minority of Americans wanting to fight the revolution but ultimately many more joined many resisted and again many well they just hid hoping it would all pass\nAnd the story of Ben Franklin and his son and his son being and\nImagine this solitary confinement for

ground\nWhat better way to come up with that or your caused by changing the narrative and I think this is a left wing conspiracy because\nYou know what better way in sending the prominent Democrats and you know I just speculating but it just kind of makes sense I don't put it on them at all\nI don't know I I don't I don't know what the [noise]\nI don't know what the truth is I I Do know that\nWe should wait until we have actual information about what this is\nA you're listening to your health the radio and a five five\n\nThe following is not an actor but a real life story from trinity debt management is\nMy story begins with that a lot of credit card debt and I hurt a commercial for trinity I gave them a call\nThe FedEx FedEx bombs um that took place and not too long ago I'm so those those are the kinds of things that we're looking at I'm In my office here as a uh some indicators\nOf this is a functional device or non functional device and with the X ray coming out at least of one of the delays I Can't speak to all of them but at least one of them now you're looking at non functional devices here just to instill fear in people\nWell it seems again that we have a very odd and yet obvious kind of list of people from a political standpoint all of them\nAre are critics of the president or all of them outspoken critics of the president of course you have President Obama and so forth but does that tell us anything the kind of obvious nature of this last\n[laughter] yeah I I mean I guess it speaks to ah some some motives behind why they're doing it I mean\nIt's it's detracted from any other news that's on there on the TV right now this is the rate at the front view of everybody right now\nSo I don't know what political motives are trying to establish your what they're trying to ideologies are trying to push forward but the bottom line is there's a clear cut a destruction of of normal normal news that would be out there\nAnd when you think about how this individual would be track what again with authorities be looking at\nLooking at um you know trying to establish who the person did it or not to give away all the investigative techniques but I mean right up right up front to be focusing at a fingerprint analysis from the tape of the device or\nUm you know or the other other um no doubt that you can use to to get um DNA evidence off of off of the device if if in fact it was left I mean you're never gonna have a completely sterile\nUh item there are and especially since this wasn't render safe by a I'm a bomb squad um there's lots of entry a value to this um which they should be able to ascertain a lot of information over the next few days\nWell it seems also that they've had a uh they've had an ability to to know that some of them didn't actually go through the post office they were hand delivered or one one initially said it was delivered by courier the stamps weren't actually stamped\nSalvo hot yeah it is odd and\nYou would think of someone had to pay for that so they should be able to to track down who gave it to that person you know who actually delivered it trace it back to where it came from I mean are there has to be some kind of accountability to to a courier service to who who you know where they picked it up where they got it and how they got it there\nNow if it's an inert powder as it looks like it was again not meant to detonate um another comment that was made yesterday was that if you're going to send something\nIn in you really wanted it to cause damage you wouldn't send it like this like a letter or a letter bomb apparently can be make much more lethal than a package like what\nCause damage you wouldn't send it like this like a letter or a letter bomb apparently can be make much more lethal than a package like with a pipe that people kept saying that you don't send up pipe bomb like this through the\nPostal service because it's too easily detected\nIs there anything to that\nWell I mean if you look or you know historical data the uh bombs have been used you know through the mail um especially when you're like a you know Ted Ted Kaczynski and what you did this or do the Unabomber stuff I mean you can't use the the post office used other means of\nCourier service FedEx or whatever but if you're gonna do you're not going to use what they used in the last few days you're going to use something that's not detectable um look at this again refer back to the FedEx incident that we are where the the devices actually went off\nUm those were intended to go these are these are intended to be found in my opinion so\nThey were meant to instill fear in people that's the bottom writer or if they're getting that is just my opinion\nUh Brian Morris uh Ryan we appreciate your incite fear and we'll bring you the latest as a press conferences will be taking place throughout the day on this issue with these\nAh know that there are terrorists or they're ... they're not attacks and that they they didn't\nAchieve their go if they didn't achieve a goal of violence however they're terrorists and that they do terrorize people\nAnd they're meant to intimidate and dominate the news ah and get attention and perhaps make a political point of one sort or another but we don't know yet we don't know exactly what one town\nA we have a lot more to get to on the lower income show the campaign or is heating up both in Florida where we had another debate last night between Rhonda Santas and Andrew Gillum\nAnd now it's tightening Gillum had opened up a sizeable lead over on the fantasy congressmen so that all important governorship\nIn the sunshine state and now it's you know about six points and Andrew Gillum is now having to explain themselves are given the fact that he\nLied on TV about accepting gifts or from a lobbyist well it turns out that the land developer that he believed was land developer turns out it was a a a FBI had been surveilling him\nAnd it looks like he had\nWalked right into the trap and I thought he could get away with lying about it I don't ... to me this whole thing is very strange with Gillum claiming that he's not under investigation how can they not be under investigation when the FBI had this ongoing operation involving him\nAnd ... with text messages now confirming that he knew he was getting theater tickets other benefits from someone who was ultimately the developers thinking favors\nTrying to use his brother Marcus as a shield for the past through these gifts so Andrew Gillum finding himself in a heap of trouble and of course is
