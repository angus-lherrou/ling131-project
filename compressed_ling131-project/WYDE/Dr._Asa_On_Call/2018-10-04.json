twenty five and he was born in a little town called Kingston, Texas his parents were sharecroppers and um that means that they\nAre picked cotton in fields but they didn't own the fields as fields were owned by someone else\nAnd in return for working all they got was a a little shack to live in an a tiny little bit of the money that they are and everything else went to the owner of the field the house they lived in was no more than a little shack it had no running water no bathrooms\nNo electricity they had twelve children altogether and as soon as the kids were\nOld enough maybe four or five years old they went to work in the cotton fields with their parents or the later said that he just worked and that it was a fulltime job just existing in fact\nWhen Audi was born his mother Josie couldn't take time off to take care of the baby so she put them in a baby swing\nAnd took him out in the cotton fields with her father his name was and that and and that\nHe was pretty lazy more interested in in gambling and having a good time and the only time they\nGot any meat to eat was is already and his brothers went out and hunted them a neighbor once led Audi his gun and it had eight bullets in it\nIf he was if Audi and his brothers went out and hunted them a neighbor once lent his gun and it had eight bullets in it and what he went hunting came back with four rabbits and four bullets still left in the gun that's how good a shot he was\nHere's Audie sister the dean Murphy\nThe little little twenty two I don't know we're seeing this really good at\nMaking killer rabbit on the ... well that's how we that's how we're going to have the time we have to go out and kill squirrels rabbits and I guess we can say we're alive die because he\nHe was my hero even leave for he ever did and I think it's great to me they\nHere again is Dr Smith\nOne of the things that defines him throughout his entire life is his sense of duty to the people who are depending on him he felt his duty towards his younger siblings in a profound way\nTimes we're beginning to unfold that would shape is destiny forever the country was in the throes of the great depression now one point things got so bad for the Murphy's that they moved into a railroad boxcar\nWhen he was Thirteen Years old ... left the family and he never came back so now what he had to step up and be the man of the house and in order to do that he had to quit school so he never got farther than the fifth grade\nBut the person that was hardest hit and the family was his mother Josie and in Nineteen forty one she died of pneumonia and he said\nEarly death was not unusual in the story of a share cropper family I'm particularly when the share cropper himself runs off leaving his wife to take care of their children [noise] anyway so what he was only sixteen he had younger sisters and a brother to take care of it and he couldn't take care of them because he had to work\nToday were sent to an orphanage and then everything changed\nHere's Murphy historian Michael West one of the time but the Japanese\nBombed Pearl Harbor December seventh I Believe all the Murphy and Monroe Hackney we're actually will double date at a movie theater and after they returned from the movie theater they learn the course of of the bombing\nImmediately all the young man or a number of introduced to\nWell that included already Murphy is well well at that time he was only about Seventeen and a half years old plus he was playing with a baby face and immediately a recruiter recognize that he's too young or tries Marines\nThey virtually laughing about he has the engines of joining the paratroopers well that that never works out so finally he is just simply run off in essence that he does enjoy\nSo all these old districts grin got in the fall of birth certificate that showed he was a year older than he was so after he turned Eighteen as it said on his birth certificate he was actually only Seventeen he went back and joined the army and was accepted into the infantry\nAnd one of the story so far\nI've been a fan of the movie but just didn't know\nIt just didn't know the circumstances my goodness losing a father and mother\nAnd then having kids or for living out of a boxcar\nAnd when we come back more from these great historians\nMore on this remarkable live the life of all the Murphy here on our American

fall back toward the for it and he stays out at the front point of the position because he has a radio and he's calling\nIn artillery from the rear and he's telling you know where to drop the artillery rounds and he was always very good at this which\nServes him very well and he realizes that if the Germans over run this position that he had and they will go straight to the headquarters of his company and over in their position and then he realizes that over to just write the tank the knock out of commission\nAnd that the men inside or dead he realizes that the fifty caliber\nGun up on the top of it up on the target is still op rubble and he climbs up on the tank\nAnd he's he trains the gun on the Germans coming across the field towards him and the tank is burning so it's producing a lot of smoke and it masks\nHis position that gives them covered like a smokescreen and he'd he'd slipped back and forth with this fifty caliber shooting at least German soldiers that are coming across the field and getting really close and he thought\nThat the Germans had no idea where he was because they couldn't see him\nNumber one and they wouldn't\nEven believe that somebody would be foolish enough to be up on top of a burning Hank shooting at them\nLater he said I remember being up on there and the thought I had was this is\nThe first time my feet has been warm for three months\nAnd there's a story and I think it's true\nThat you know he's up on his tank with his right hand on the gun with his left hand holding the radio to his ear yelling for artillery support and across the radio comes the question how close\nAre they your position [noise]\n\nResponses he'll just hold the line I'll let you talk to one and\nIt gets to the point where the shells coming in are kicking him around the hitting so close and\nFinally they they begin to pull back and and he realizes that the Germans are\nWithdrawing any crimes done off this tank any shaky and he walks over to a tree and leans against treating swamps\nDown on the ground and right about that time the tank he was standing on explode\nAnd it blows that target you know way up into the air and off into the

now so I I did feel alone for a time and I decided to write a couple of letters to the editor which got picked up by the Columbus dispatch fairly nerve wracking for me but I thought to myself if I'm quiet all these people speak for me and\nMy husband is a really good man and\nHe does not deserve this and this is wrong I was so worried\nOh I'm going to have repercussions at school but you know what I thought to myself if you're my friend and and you know who we are than your support me [noise]\nAnd because your union stops supporting her she decided to stop supporting it\nI decided then to

concentrating and specifically reading and it seems to be related to the health\nOr activity or lifestyle and it could because they comes and goes and I don't know you have any suggestion or you have any ideas what could cause a\nSo you're having a hard time concentrating yeah concentrating and particularly\nReading and if you know like I said if it comes and goes\nNow when you have a hard time reading meaning you lose your attention span and you'll dressed so as soon as you start reading three or four sentences you'll start thinking about what you got to do tomorrow and you won't be able to focus on the actual content is that right\nYeah that that some of it and that's a you know just concentrating just concentrating on anything um you know it just seems like it would come and go when I just think that it's lifestyle or diet related because of the way it sounds and goes\nYeah it is but there's there's several things that could be or what do you eat on a regular basis I mean what is your life give me a day and the wife or run like give me breakfast lunch and dinner today what it looked like a\nA breakfast probably you know isn't Monica breakfast bar or something like that um is like fiber with coffee in the morning I'm lying usually just the family or\nA banana for a you know if they enter a tonight we had a spaghetti and um yeah so that's generally it I I you know I I Try to get in between three and five or vegetables\nOr fruit and vegetables that are\nSo high they only other thing I can think of as my activity level as far as the act of exercise has decreased over the past year and I'm kind of wondering if that isn't a part of it\nIt can be I mean all your lifestyle factors make a big difference\nWith with with everything that you're doing so the symptoms that you're seeing is not just one key factor I think it's several things but you know what you're dealing with is you're actually you're almost dealing with a little bit of attention deficit type symptoms and that's why you're having a hard time concentrating one of the big reasons that\nWe struggle with that whether you're an adult or a kid it doesn't matter 'cause the mechanisms of same in the body but you're not having to think I mean you you've got too much information in your digestive tract you're not giving your body the right kind of nutrition and that's an easy fix that that is easy to correct\nYeah I mean you you've got too much information in your digestive tract you're not giving your body the right kind of nutrition and that's an easy fix that that is easy to correct because all you gotta do is change what you're doing every single day and you'll see good results but you're also having\nA low level of omega three fatty acids and their mega three fatty acids are what are so important for stimulating the frontal lobe of the brain and the front of love of the brain is important for overall concentration so it's a big kind of catch twenty two it's a circle and so once you start working on one thing you'll begin helping the other\nSo the first thing I mean you're doing a a a breakfast bar and coffee in the morning for breakfast your lunch is a sandwich and dinner spaghetti and you're eating a lot of processed food you're getting zero nutrition\nYou really are it's not it's the food you're eating or not bringing health to your body and you got to make sure that the things you are eating do that\nPretty simple what you'll do get on the anti inflammatory diet to my book comparing your health real ... it's basically this equal amounts of lean protein sources so every meal so breakfast you'll do two to three organic eggs there's your your lean protein sources you're low glycemic carbohydrates and former fruits and vegetables\nHave a bowl of fresh blueberries or ... or strawberries are blackberries\nSomething like that and then also you're healthy fats took it and coconut oil the eggs and then you've got the yolk so the eggs have plenty of fat in them so there's your fat content for breakfast\nAnd that's a great breakfast you have plenty of brainpower plenty of fat healthy fast to make your body ... to help your brain concentrate and focus and also your hormones systems will function better\nLet's move into lunch lunch you can do a big salad with maybe a ... big piece of salmon on it full dressing you say you know maybe an olive oil and vinegar dressing something like that you've got your fast you got your carbohydrates and vegetables\nAnd it gives lean protein source plus she'll get plenty of omega threes\nOut of that piece of salmon and then dinner same thing piece of fish maybe a steak you have some asparagus and maybe half a novel Cato because being a guy you need to be taken out of the Cato everyday any way is healthy for your prostate gives you all the healthy fascinate plenty of your low glycemic carbohydrates and high quality protein\nYou eat like that which is all listed in my book plenty of different food choices if you follow that\nYou will be like a new man in thirty days I'm not kidding your brain will work twice twice of what it's doing now your for your ... you'll be sharper you won't have any brain fog you build a focus should be able to concentrate and your body just function better you can't put junk and your body and expect your body to function well\nThey just can't so\nYou have to be in a place where you're willing to change and make make some make some tough choices because you know the bar in the coffee in the coffee right now stimulate your brain it seemed like a fern all over the brain and it'll work for a short period of time but it's in the aftermath\nOf that meeting after the effects of the caffeine wear off it's going to go the opposite way then you really can't concentrate\nAnd just put yourself into a big cycle\nAnd rather than your body be able to function the way it was designed to so therefore you wanna start mega three fat she get that from\nBasically cod liver oil is one of the best places to get it from and I would do a tablespoon twice a day at a table spin in the morning and the tables tuned in the evening get your vitamin D levels checked to buy your physician I Would get a simple blood test done\nMake sure your vitamin D levels are hanging between Seventeen Ninety vitamin D although such huge immune system builder and it's great for bone density in our hormones systems that also plays a key role\nIn concentration of vitamin D is just one of those super vitamin matter of fact it's not even a vitamin hits the hormone so I Would make sure those numbers are rife has a lot of times you'll be surprised and see your vitamin D vitamin D levels to be quite low when you started with that that's gonna help your concentration your vitamins will help too but not as much as\nVitamin vitamin D levels to be quite low when you started with that that's going to have your concentration your vitamins will help too but not as much as three fats come off all the processes and the grains there's a component in the wheat flour cause\nAnd it can cause and wreak havoc on your concentration level's okay I Know that's a lot but if you'll get my vote you started on

getting bad for me [noise]\nUh well you can help airbase\nBased around the vitamins but they also have some other components in there that the five our energy has been marketed now on TV all the time you got to have a gas station right by the checkout counter us them\nSome of the road quite a bit traveling different things you see them often have a lot of patients have asked me that\nBut really what is going to happen to be vitamin concept is good so I Do like that in the product and it's a great concept and there's some other components in there that will not really build up your adrenal gland say your adrenal glands are the body's stress glance when they get worn out when they get beaten down\nThat's when your body gets tired on a regular basis now what are you driving you're pushing really hard so you need to stimulate and strengthen your adrenal glands on a regular basis and the best way to do that\nIs to actually start utilizing vitamin C in a buffer ... for about three to four thousand milligrams per day split up into doses\nAnd also vitamin B five which is paying authentic acid split it up into doses you can do about five hundred to seven or fifty milligrams in the morning five hundred seven hundred fifty milligrams in the afternoon around two or three o'clock and that's going to give you a much better energy kick and I would I Would encourage you to go that route over using those little energy shot\nIf you will they're they're kinda they're just too hard on the body and they're not great for long term success\nThe other thing you want to do is you can increase your caffeine by doing green tea but not the green tea you pick up in the stores that would actually carry the tea bags with you just get a box of him when you're home before you go out on your trips but
