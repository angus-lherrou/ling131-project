Seventy six degrees warmer for Monday afternoon thunder mostly sunny skies\nAnother nice day on Monday after starting in the morning with lunch I'm sure you're fifty degrees warm nicely into almost some nice for the afternoon stay dry on Tuesday a low temperature in the upper forties late afternoon high near Seventy eight degrees on WB chill Thirteen year old ... along with your forecast almost call for broadcasting station\n... you know you sit on the homeland security committee in and of course important ... you're in Alabama on agriculture a you know we'd go to a lot to talk about congressman um you know there's a poet booming is this a caravan coming up from Mexico\nKnow we'd go to a lot to talk about congressman um you know there's a park bombing does is I'm a caravan coming up from Mexico or your first impressions with a member of armed services on what we're seeing on the uh on this race today\nWell I I was fully expecting them to have him arrested within a twenty four to forty eight hours I've seen the FBI before or do this do their thing when it comes to kind of collecting evidence on these kind of suspects\nThey are really phenomenally good at it and uh I expected they would catch in quickly\nMy guess is they knew who he was yesterday and we're just watching to see if there's anybody else involved they are bringing in but uh it was impressive the way they got him I'm I'm anxious find out more about uh what was going on with him but my guess is there some mental health issues what usually we find to be the case\nYou know not wanting to give you know give away the farm here how does the FBI you know this is extraordinary how does the FBI or mobilize so quickly and roll someone like this up so fast\nThey have just built a a a pattern over the years of of knowing exactly what they're looking for immediately and collecting that evidence I in this case this guy gave so much of it\nOr by having these unexploded bombs which is just give them a bundle of information you know they they demonstrated several years ago I'm here in Alabama there was a fellow that\nSent a letter to mouth as to senator um\nShelby's office and I I think Senator Sessions I Can't remember I Know she'll be in may and one other one uh with some white powder novel loans and when the staff open them in our district offices or the pattern came out and it was a letter saying I Hope you down this road you know the hazmat grooves had to come in they had to empty the courthouses and\nUh but bottom line was the the letters had no return address or nothing but a staff an address to the office right it was just that they were able to track the fell down\nA little longer but as a trek ally can figures DNA from the on the low road all of this thing up or something of that nature I don't again I don't know how how exactly it's all like in the same but he's in prison I mean they found him I think he found him in Missouri somewhere like that\nThat is amazing isn't it when you think about it\nYeah I mean but at because I was so impressed by how they they were able to capture that fellow with much less evidence and this guy gave I'd ... I'd if I asked\nA but you know there's a lot of of technology now that we in the homeland since we've stood up the homeland security department that we used to monitor way packages move around the country\nI knew that would they be deployed and in fact it did turn out to be deployed a we have a lot of camera systems now they did not exist Fifteen Years ago so there's a lot of things are able to do together to be able to isolate somebody like this and find out who they are\nTrue the as though we could do a whole lot more and I'd been urging that no one of the things they do in a in London is\nEverywhere they go you've got when you're out in public you know their writers these ... these and and those things turn out to be in value but when they had the subway bombing they catch all cost ya that within hours\nI think that particularly in our in our major urban areas especially we should have that because when you're out in public you should not have no expectation of privacy\nRights incumbent on that is one of my things people are always jumping up and down and ... my parents do a jumping up and down well its privacy this property that well I'm Sorry uh I don't want to get blown up by some crazy Islamist when I'm coming out of a bus stop\nOr not I'm quite happy I'm not doing anything bad I don't care if they see me going into ... polite\nYeah no I ...\nComing out of a ... ah I'm quite happy I'm not doing anything bad I don't care if they see me going into ... polite\nYeah no I ... I Believe if you're in your whole or in your business if you do have an showcasing the privacy but once you go out into the public domain there is no expectation of privacy so nobody should have concerns about the ... circuit cameras\nAre particularly in this day and age of of terrorism and again particularly when you're in major metropolitan areas where it's been proven this is where the terrorists are going to go for the major impacts able to get international\nCovered the biggest self the saga and these are the folks that are jumping up and down to the same ones that post pictures of their kids into vacations and where they are all the time they're not at home and the kids doing this and that uh there is no expectation of privacy anymore\nNo not in public shouldn't be a so anyways my whole and that's one of the things we've ... we've been pushing along and we're we're making slow progress on the homeland security committee but I like just make a lot more progress on that front because whether we like it or not we're going to have more tax in the future yeah we've ... we've seen that a\nA button when it comes to a terrorist attacks domestically around the world the terrorists to have started to move away from just a airlines and they started to move to what we call soft target yeah from Venus for concerts\nMajor uh games and such and stadiums are it's much easier to get a ... close to one of those being used and blow it up than it is to try to get a bomb on a plane so we need to adjust and start recognizing adapt and start recognize that we've got to take better care of soft targets\nRight and then he has like a bucket of having the terrorists don't now they do when the super bowl every time they carry an attack like a nine eleven kind of attack and I just need to inflict pain and Hanks and uh so I'm I'm fear in the in in ...\n... as far as animals that here in our hearts they want to change\nIt and they want to have an economic impact on this they want to get us to stop doing some of the things that we do to keep our economy moving so are we just have to be thinking and round the curve about where they go and what could they be next to try to do some things that are a responsible to make sure we protect these kind of targets that we anticipate than here\nYeah we'll sit down congressman you're also you serve as we mentioned on the homeland homeland security committee or\nImmigration illegal immigration that's a mug bearable I don't know it's a bug Barrow much the folks listening to the show a\nLet's talk about the invasion caravan or as as NPR away schools that there's a migrants caravan I mean give me a break you know it's thousands of people what can the administration what can the United states do to stop these illegals coming into the country\n[noise] well I think what the president is already started that's moving the national guard troops down at the border or he this has been a a tactic that's been deployed by previous administrations as nothing unique to this president Rocco bomber did it when it was necessary\nUm I think the ... president needs to move as many National Guard troops I'm now down there as he thinks is necessary to prevent them from getting in the country\nAnd to send a signal to the rest of the world don't try this we're not going to let it be successful ... one of the things I'm hopeful that we will see a and and what happens when they send the national guard at the national guard and lose into a support capacity and freeze up and border patrol agents\nFrom their administrative another responsibility so they can actually moved to the border\nTo keep the illegals out\nRight so a National Guard taek up like violence and had men and\nBut he's so they can add to the border to keep the illegals\nOut right so the national guard up like the violence and admin and that so that\nYou be absolutely stuck on how many trained border patrol agent you're sitting at a desk ... down in Arizona New Mexico and California these are highly trained highly qualified skilled\nLaw enforcement officials pushing paper are working on cars that means you try to keep them working in his it's insane but what will happen is the national guard will relieve them and those responsibilities what is the breed the detainees\nOr just ... minutes breaks last building so that all the border patrol agents can move down to their large role of protecting the border but what I Want to see us do as\nMany of these people from being able to get in\nAnd a story and and being trained to be able to say the magic word so they get to stay in the country until they're hearing ... which may never happen like congressman we get you to just hang on the phone for one more minute and we'll come back to you on the other end of the strike because I really liked it told her that this little\nAnd much harder to detect right now Congress when we got a couple of coal\nBut now Congress when we got a couple of coal Cola's that have been waiting to throw question do I think we've got to totally on the loans that might be good yeah totally going hey buddy\nHey they're a congressman Rogers can you hear me I Can't\nHear okay well go ahead ... will [laughter] will relieve him a question\nAll right I Want to say the congressman Rogers punishment I like you I I like how you suggested that Edward Snowden should be put on a kill list I like how you said that when you were a chair in the intelligence committee that the NSA can't violate your privacy right if you don't know your votes Raj being violated and I like how when the uh laws proposed\nThat said the government should be able to get all the information from Facebook and Twitter and Google they want to and the Google and Facebook and Twitter could violate the privacy agreements where they use or without legal recourse you said that people arguing against that the system deals where just fourteen year olds in their basement\nSo I like the way you do that also I like what are your wife works for a contract it I didn't see the benefits from all this\nSo I just wanted to say thank you for being on the air today\nWell thanks for the call and under working late your caller has me confused with Mike Rogers of Michigan who retired two terms ago oh he's still watch you know\n[laughter]\nAh we do we have another cool a big dive over by a car goes\nOn the air go ahead you're on the air was Margaret Rogers ... represented my grown\nThank you\nSo representative Rogers my understanding is the number of people that are currently in this caravan is probably about one percent of what we already caught at the border this year\nI mean we're we're somewhere around four hundred thousand that have been caught so far this year aren't we\nI I really couldn't tell you the number of ... it's a large number yes\nIs there a way to put me through so you can hear me\nHe said he he can't tell you what the number is right now ...\nOh okay so yeah I Want to say maybe a couple of weeks ago I was reading that so far we have entered and extend on the order of four hundred thousand for this year\nThat was what I Do I'm hard to do ... things where the guy I got a question for Mr Rogers\nHow can we\nWith not having the wall and everything and they use this caravan is coming up once they step over here we have to take care of them correct\nOnce we let them in yes that's exactly right here's one of the things give you an example\nWe have somebody that that we capture that comes across the say the come across the river and in Texas and we capture them we take 'em to do the briefing center and and the brief them if while we have them at the D. briefing center they see\nA much yes I've got just hangs we have to take them to the hospital and if it turns out they're having a heart attack we have to pay for their heart surgery or whatever has to be done to them and not only pay for all that we have to keep ... agent within twenty four hours a day while they're in the hospital\nWe move really saying\nAbsolutely you you have somebody come across a woman that comes across as nine months pregnant and then while she's over while she's in our detention facility she says I think I'm starting to go into labor\nThere's nine months pregnant and then while she's older while she's in our detention facility she says I think I'm starting to go into labor we have to take her to the hospital we have to pay for the birth of that baby all this I mean it's ... and there's no records and\nWe did his own and what they call an anchor baby congressman\nAs a ... minute exactly becomes an anchor baby was born here under the way the laws being interpreted even though the baby was here with a new legal mother in the womb of an illegal mother or that becomes a United States citizen and then all of a sudden the entire family can come over and uh\nTo that it is and is anchored by Dan is and I know is insane in saying\nYou know we're the only industrialized country on the planet that does that rod is let's say let's say that that my wife and I went to a Paris and my wife was eight months pregnant we were over there visiting for\nFor Ninety Days and she delivered a baby while we were there France would not recognize a citizen that would be a United States citizen that just happened to be visiting over there right in our country you're you're a citizen if you're born here even if it's illegal parents can we just change that little\nWe've tried Democrats fight it left and right\nYeah that is that is not so I didn't quite realize that now congressman or do we bring came here I did something or just have to talk to you about and I was going to get big guys to play the star wars thing but I don't think we're going to hear\nYou you're the sub committee chair of the strategic forces subcommittee on has 'cause I'm not mistaken\nAs correct can you talk to me about like I just saw the report coming out this week I think from the Pentagon signed that they've got their path forward for the spice voice or can you talk to me about where that stands do I need to get you know the march cyber or or or what what do we need to do here\nThat's funny yeah a lot of people have had fun with this because Trump came out in order to do and all of a sudden people thought were trying\nTo create a star trek\nKind of work on it\nHas nothing to do with that this is all about national security satellites which we have are heavily dependent on to fight and win wars\nOr people think that the GPS system is up there for their ... to be able to tell them how to get to the local hearty restaurant [laughter] the it's up there it's a military satellite constellation that's up there to guide missiles moved troops do a lot of things the timing\nOf but most people don't realize they're using a military satellites Curtis United States government uh but that's up there to fight and win wars we have satellite constellations\nThat look for a ICBM launch is uh when we when the President Trump sent over those cruise missiles hit that Syrian airport take out those warehouses that were store and chemical weapons those missiles were guided by our satellite systems\nSo bottom line is we have become heavily dependent on satellite systems for command and control of nuclear weapons enterprise for a whole host military\nI mean you guys are enterprise rowing we'd have to protect them because both China and Russia\nHave realized how dependent we are and they developed offensive capability\nThat can disable or in some cases destroy our satellites settled and we have fallen behind in in in that endeavor and allowed them to to rally catch up with their own path to surpass us what our armed services committee came out with on a bipartisan completely nonpartisan basis is\nWe have to restructure our military to be able to deal with that threat and the owner where we can do it is to pull those existing space professionals out of the air force Army Navy mhm into their separate service where they single mission to be dominant space\nWell this is no different from when you know the air force was created\nArmy and navy mhm into their separate service where they single mission to be dominant space\nWell this is no different from when you know the air force was created out of the U.S army apples\nThat's exactly right Seventy years ago it was it became obvious that the army which was addressed real force would never popular up a properly nurture fund and develop this air mission right so the Congress force them to just pull it out into separate service\nThe same things happening now the air force is not properly nurturing the space mission mhm so we're forcing them to separate that out into a separate\nOr let them different at all they're playing golf that's why congressman [laughter] well my air force a I'm an ex navy guy and all my air force a coal exist seem to play golf all the time is what I tell them they have not golf courses that story I Love golf course now we're almost at a time and I really appreciate your being on\nA ... eleven dies it's a you know it's the election uh\nThis is probably the most important election certainly since I've been in the U.S was like the last sixteen years you know we've got the lowest unemployment generations you know you guys in in Congress just recently passed tax reform\nHow important is it that people get out to vote\nIf if the conservative and Republican base to not get out and vote with intensity to house we'll flip\nA because the Democratic base is completely animated and ... and energized just like we were eight years ago with rock Obama's first midterm and we took away sixty three seats from well 'cause their base was happy they had big government spending big government grow\nOur base was apoplectic over Obamacare Dodd Frank consumer financial protection board the stimulus bill all that stuff\nOur base turned out in huge numbers and we took the majority away\nThe roles were reversed now mhm we have a Republican president Republican House and Senate we've been doing what conservatives due\nTo the court to spending to the tax base to the military and their size apoplectic right now\nSo if our race will get out and vote in and help the numbers will keep the house not as big a majority but we'll keep it and we'll be able to keep this path toward prosperity that were own Barbara but if if our base sits on a will lose the house Nancy Pelosi\nMaxine Waters a joke Schumer they will do everything they can to stop the Trump agenda and I'm ... and it fast\nRepresenting rod ... ... ... last question can you do something about the deficit please\nThe only way we're going to be able to deal with the deficit cheapest kind of me growing so we have enough money to close the deficit and hopefully grow enough to start paying down the old and his history demonstrated is you have to grow the economy to get revenue coming in\nTo close the deficit now we can we're the president called for a five cent reduction across the board and spending I agree with that", "show_name": "Dr.
