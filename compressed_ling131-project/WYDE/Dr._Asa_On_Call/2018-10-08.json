it's it's getting to be a big time of year for you and your industry and you're a bow hunting and bow manufacture a and and call tell us what about yourself and then we'll we'll talk about new breed archery\nMy name's Kyle no oil and uh like I said I'm a native Alabamians I've moved around a little bit but I seem to always make home here in Alabama [laughter] you know I grew up in uh near democracy Alabama's ... county ... county that area is a great and Iran yeah a grip on a small farms ...\nHad a lot of access to soybeans and we it so that definitely increased my hunting and getting bit and then a from their uh got out work for a a small company that had moved to Alabama and got a fire what go\nBecame an engineer sorted out out of the archery side of it as far as engineering I'll\nStill stayed in archery tournament shooting a that was kind of thing but it wasn't going to work and archery and then uh for some reason my passion drove me back to it and now just couldn't leave it alone I always trying to build a better mouse trap and that sort of where I got started and then that's how ... came about was really\nTrying to build the the best of myself and just turned out that everybody else ... hey\n[laughter] good well you know I I was a ... a month for my brother and brother in law this past weekend and both of them are big bow hunters and they and they were talking I was telling them you're going to be on the show and both of them were talking about what a great product you make and we my family I have a shot in several years but we used to ... we've been shooting for twenty five years\nOr and they just had really positive things to say about your bows and I I guess before we talk about your product somebody who introduced you to bow hunting how did you get involved with that\nWell like I mentioned I I grew up on a farm just outside of democracy so it's pretty easy arm life a little bit um I think is the catch ... just called it live and back then anyway uh my dad obviously got me involved in hunting in general a at a young age out\nI was with that got the you know go out after dad and kill something then leave pretty well a kind of field dress a date it right there you know an ugly and bring it home and mom was making breakfast all we were finishing up there and we butchered our own and then ah he had a ... on the wall or urban and\nOh my mom was making breakfast while we were finishing up the deer and we butchered our own and then\nHe had a boat on the wall or carbon\nMan I wanted to play with that thing all the time he kept telling me eyes too much for you you know and so um as I got a little a little older I kept nagging him and I think he figured out a little bit and I was getting close to the teenage age and he was thinking you know I got to do something to keep them grounded so yeah I mean a boat and got very carbon\nAnd started teach me how to do on a little bit now on I'll be honest we probably did not know we were doing\nA should give you a little bit of age range I'm forty five so you know back in the eighties so uh yeah\nAnyway we didn't know what we were doing but we got out there and he he was determined to ah to give you a deer and believe it or not that the first Iraq deal with a boat actually feel the same way you would if you were on a a a man job or a shotgun tiny\n... of the woods and push one bombing and I got lucky in the same stuff for me to get a shot at it I Know that also\nYeah so I was so thin that fourteen out well I think I'll start the report came right around there I'm Alice who looked at me from that point or has been a major part of my life I Know hunting and generally as but for some reason it's my passion\nSure and you know you travel all over I I've seen some videos tell us something about I mean do you go all over the country but wanting or maybe all over the world\nNot well I've been out out of the country as well but uh I travel a good bit in in a in the United States I've been to Colorado several times I've been to Idaho\nAnd to be able to help people to expand\n... uh they're they're a production and and or just\nBe able to do what they do with a\nBetter a Linder is focused on what their what their processes and\nWith our patronage programming and everything being able to give us some money back at the end of the year when we get done and and lower that affect the cost of borrowing money you know it's just a really great to be a part of their team and and seeing these configured running and and uh the combine is running and right now it's just a it's a fun time of year\nFor us because they're they're evil we're starting to see those all those uh investments come to fruition\nWell one thing I I like about your team is you you have offices spread all around the state and\nI Know when I give somebody the name of one of the loan officers there with Alabama had\nCredit you are going to take good care of them and I get constant feedback from people saying hey\nThey're Williams in Selma made it easy to work with ... you know made it easy to work with that sort of thing so I I mean you all do a fantastic job of making these ...\nEasy and your gas here in Montgomery our top notch man their top not\nIn operation a job than it is in a way I we take for great pride in what we do because they have what separates us from everybody else you know because when you come and not only\nDo we gonna treat you like any by where we don't treat you like to see any other customer but you're going to become a stockholder Ryan or if you're an owner you know in in then from there\nWe just build our relationship and and it's it's really easy to be able to to keep going on that along the way when we do meet that person and they bought a piece of property and then they want a tractor and they say you know will forever skin we do a tractor and yeah we can do a tractor\nOr can we build a lake yeah let's build a Laker fan and they want to build a large and yeah absolutely let's go build a large so we become that uh that Linder for everything that they want to do to to make the the\nYou know a lot of people just really want to be out there in that that goal of theirs to have a place in the country under a tire or have a place where the family\nThat's way way become part of that dream and yeah and it's really really beneficial for for us to go this makes it fun\nI think the thing the thing I Love about you about your own as I said you were talking about being a being a shareholder is you know your your your borrowers have a voice because not only the ... bar or are there are also part of your party your company and so every body part of the team\nOr the patronage programs tremendous I had a guy called me of the day and he was complaining about rates going up a little bit as I look at you know about your patronage and explain it to\nAnd you know you all been in that that ... percent range you know sometimes a little less than a little bit more than that you know if you got a six and a half the interest rate than you are effective right maybe more closer to five\nIn ... you know sometimes a little less than a little bit more than that you know if you got a six and a half the interest rate than the effective right maybe more closer to five and a half by the time you get you get you patronage back is tremendous Programme and folks out which have a voice because they're part of the family explained it and\nThat's right and you know every ... every loan a requirement is a year you become a a stockholder and do you have a voice in in college and the board of directors\nIf there's a concern that you have you have direct loans to either your lender the branch manager the a senior lender\nAll the way up the line and and all that you can get directly to those folks so you know any any time they see anything comes a week and we can focus on a need and make sure that we're handling anything that uh is is is needed by the borrower effectively\n... like I say you guys do a fantastic job and if somebody wants to reach out to you how can they get information about Alabama I cut it in general and then here specifically Montgomery\nAd out uh in general best place to go to Alabama credit dot com we've got a great website with a lot of information about our programs and what we can\nDo and here in Montgomery Ala direct line to the offices three three four two seven zero eight six six six and even if you may be in another county where the right to call the way it needs to be to make sure we handle any requests effect\nWay out to a fantastic job but we've we've had Travis Jordan on here and I joke he's the bulldog man if he if he gets a chance at alone he's going to do everything he can to make that thing on again before\nBefore we get off the I get a real important question now did you use up all your eligible appeal Moffett\nSlanted I talk to you and the way I think\nWe need to like ... we you know you could\nMake good for you know maybe ... maybe a quarter of a quarter of but now we're uh\nIs is is stuff to watch them and I know they've got a lot of challenges up there and and those guys are just you know we we will see them coming together yeah and uh you know it's uh believe me I Know those guys being in that position they're not\nThey're not there to try and do they really want things to be working out ... and then they're working out and it's going to come to get out and goes five\nGuys almost once they figure out what the guy next to them doing all the time then we're going to start saying the life out\nThere doing a great job and well man I I think we just gotta if bin is a great but\nWe'll keep this thing going for a while and saying we're not going anywhere here or or minelli album act credit thank you so much for being a sponsor and thank you for being on the way and Saturday nights you guess what ... uh enjoy that

'cause I Am trying to get my feet cluttered with all this other stuff I Try to just follow politicians and you know people I Need to know what they're saying\nI use it for a research if you will\nAnd I don't need a bunch of people talking about their cats yeah it might be with us clutter up your feet a little bit\nBut anyway uh our number two you want to get in on the show two oh five nine four one one zero one one with uh being friday\nI Am willing to just let you guys got loose and take over the show if you want to yo got comments questions or you need a as we do sometimes a therapy session yeah you can uh called the show\nAnd we will talk about it\nA real quick before I go to the phones or the protesters from yesterday\nFigured out what the armband was about so pleased we are getting out yes the police were given a green arm bands to protesters and we couldn't figure out why\nWell the police were telling people why we're we're ramping missing up it's enough you know so you got one or two options if you want to get arrested you can let us know and we will provide you with us aren't banned\nAnd if you don't want to be arrested you can get up and so we were kind of riding our gas yes they were being arrested wasn't armed band saw yep [noise] uh\nBye bye so we were kind of riding our gas yes\nThey were being arrested wasn't armed band saw yep [noise] uh there was a way I found this out is Amy Schumer and some other actress\nEmily round a cow ski I guess I don't know who she is um they claimed that they were arrested and it turns out they really weren't\nThey I I think they got the aren't banned but police basically just walked a mile from from says but they claim they got arrested oh that sounds more traumatic as you say that and I'm like yeah yeah it's\nReal cool you got the old green are banned slaps on your wrist and that's right that's what they should have done instead of housing they have seen ones out at once instead of having a little paper\nThey shouldn't go with a slight price lead you remember that yes there will be so much more efficient you just walk over slap it and walk to the next person and those were number one right to love the ... never the pants that had the\nBlack blue or red or colors yes and you click on down ... like a movie star he had one but it would be like two days and it'd be broken well ... ...\nAh this Emily ...\nThere's Jay in there and I don't know if it's silent I'm Lee as she said today I was arrested protesting the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh a man who has been accused by multiple women of sexual assault men who hurt women can no longer be placed in positions of\nBut we all north central oh\n... what I Want somebody why do you [noise]\nJug allow allow me over but\nAmong the mountain well I'm going to meet ya baby\nCome along the lines of her second one on W. widely any later on the song that's a good song is just kind of warm you down over the years over the years over the two years\nOr two oh five nine four one one zero one one Andrew Jessica and a guy you heard just an hour and a half ago the one and only Russell pie the man from down the hall I didn't get to listen to any of your coverage as you filled in on the Ford faction again today\nUm but opinions on what's gone down\nI think Jessica can bounce I predicted it I think it went down just how I said it was not an expert [laughter]\nThemselves me that's a lot so in the twelve o'clock hour Alice gig down and excited about how things were going to go it kind of felt like a game day one o'clock I get nervous thing that Susan Collins was holding a press for not press conference but a public announcement\nI was worried that can become crashing down it didn't she laid out the case sick quite well as to why she was voting for him and I was thinking about kind of the contract so it didn't go as I worried it might but it's like Lindsey Graham gave you the emotional coverage to vote for Kavanaugh this is is it an outrage is terrible\nAnd then Susan Collins took her time giving the logical reason that really the only vote is a yes vote that that's the way to go so I got a little\nAntsy 'cause I wanted to get to the point we were joining the audio and it's like All right all ready to get to uh get to get to it but I think looking back we will we will think of\nOf Kavanaugh's road bottle of those accusations coupled with Lindsey Graham his emotional response and kind of finger wagging the Democrats and then Susan Collins her kind of a detailed walk through his\nCareer and look at those moments combined as to what helped push it over the hump so I think that uh at this point as schizophrenia gets my emotions can be I'm feeling pretty good\nI think a Susan Collins speech was the best thing the best route bottle if you will since Wednesday grams outburst I've got a couple of Chuck Grassley ones that I like to think is a from yesterday or the day before\nThey were doing a press conference and the Republicans in the Senate where we're speaking to draw reporters\nAnd he just let some of 'em I'm lucky but so far\nHe was fired so here's my thing is I Try to speak to those who disagree or would do my critics I think Chuck Grassley you could if you're not a Republican you can eat at a given angry all white man whereas Susan Collins was not angry she was not so\nPassionate that she seemed on hand she was very logical it wasn't a motive emotional if she was long winded like\nShe was not so passionate that she seemed on hand she was very logical it wasn't a motive emotional if you know she was long winded like a book or out of Jersey but she actually had things to say that a value so yeah right I was a breast well\nUh I'm I'm excited to see where this goes you got one lone Democrats do you predict that they will have more than one Democrat voting to confirm Kavanaugh tomorrow\nYou know I think if I I think you will have Democrats who might want to but they won't have the courage to do so\nBecause it it's a situation now and it's really the way Joe Manchin went about it as well he didn't want to be the fifth year but yeah he wanted to see what Susan Collins had to say because I I feel like he was going to vote yes the whole way through not the whole way but at least after the FBI investigation\nUm he wanted to wait for Susan Collins may have even got confirmation from her that she\nWas voting yes ah and have her mounts that before he came out with his statement 'cause there was immediately after the speech was over he went ahead and put it out there that was the fifty first yes while that fifty first yes\nDoesn't matter if if the vote stay the same as they are today they go and do the same thing tomorrow or it doesn't matter because you've only got to have fifty and then my parents is your tie breaker for fifty one so starts and cover it does it change the outcome of the votes\nIf Joe Manchin votes yes or he votes no but after hearing from his constituents in West Virginia he knows he's dead and meet if he votes no if he feels he can appease the Democratic party and say I'm only doing this to save my backside and it's not affecting me outcome\nThat could possibly happen with other\nReddish state Democrats but I don't know I I'm not willing to make the production than another Democrat comes over but just because there is there will ... it'll make no difference if that Democrat who thinks that's what their constituents want votes\nOr I mean that's a possibility you think of somebody like Doug Jones was smart he would obviously vote yes now because again it doesn't affect the outcome right and it can keep some of the people in Alabama happy I don't think he's going to do it because I think he's an absolute idiot and I really hope he doesn't do it because I don't want him to getting brownie points from anybody [laughter]\nAh but it would be smart for some of these people to do it and I guess that's the question do you see anybody else to do in that [noise]\nI think uh my predictions didn't not and I try not to predict I was just kind of had a gut feeling and it didn't play out I'm pleased with the way it played out your gut feeling\nYeah into Johnston are saying that there had been it was a forget the friday ... yeah you have the time why they here's a question I have\nEvery time you fill in on Ford show and I come in here\nAnd you've got food somebody's brought you food and I'm like well yeah it is I I'm over here putting in a hard work on the microphone Russell comes from from one day right brain and food [laughter] what is that I'm navy\nAnd hungry well and and it was Andrea ties and she made a point of saying she wants to make sure Russell knows this is not something that will continue\nTo rise when I'm not going to continue filling in unless they get mad if I'm not mad you know I Am Andrea tight and we heard it here you could corroborate it might not do you think Andrea times has got\nBeef with me and that's why she has no for me and he\nHad enough or ... I don't think so I offered me beef but [laughter] I think it's a timing issue you go in there at three and she's probably not anywhere to be seen\nBetter and better because we call or chicken fried ties\nI think it's a timing issue you go on the air at three and she's probably not anywhere to be seen a lot better and better because we call or chicken fried ties you know if anything you think that it's hard to buying you or at least a reminder\nWhen I think if you Andrea I think if we did tell her that we thought she can be Dianne Feinstein for Halloween [laughter] [noise]\nI probably won't be getting any more dry I'm like what do you stay on the pillow seem to be easier to what you said there are and you're getting paid not me I Would never have earth [laughter] after he um\nYeah you won't be able to get hit me Andrea I'll tell you Russell's food next week\nBy poor wide one zero one one we got emails and your phone gong Jackson guard Jeremy Brian they'll go anywhere back after this\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'cause you know even you know what I was a kid you know you you you had Democrats and yet moderate Democrats moderate Republicans and they would argue about a ... a few things but there wasn't nothing compared to what like what we have now and which is just extremism on both sides\nOf the norm for a nomination or or confirmation of the Supreme Court justice would\nBe like Ninety Ninety to Ninety five votes in favor of the justice you know and that's like lately going now\nIf we could get back to that you know that would that would be great uh but I don't I don't know how to get back to that or you know Joe Manchin came out and uh\nHe's really not a Democrat at all I I think he just kind of got caught up and being a Democrat there for too long\nYou think they got some dirt on him\nI you know you know I don't think they've got some dirt on him I just think that he's been a Democrat so long and you just don't realize that he's been the wrong party\nDown the hash tag along the way yeah\nYou know that party um that party that heat belong to a it's kind of like the parties that are Susan Collins belong to originally when she became a Republican that those parties don't exist anymore yeah and um\nSusan Collins belong to originally when she became a Republican that those parties don't exist anymore yeah\nAnd uh but you know you know he he came out because he looked at a fax and whatnot and ... which is important when you're thinking about you know putting someone in the high court the land you need to go off of stack and a judicial ah opinions and rulings\nRight well even going to the allegations the accusations are ... you had these guys are looking is facts and they became enraged while looking at the facts because they realized\nThat this wasn't just a matter of mistaken identity or you know Democrats standing up for women 'cause they're so notorious\nFor that they realized in the middle of this is that it was a political ... job yeah and that's why Wednesday grants or acting the way he did that's why Joe Manchin had to to\nCome to grips with the fact that Kavanaugh's an innocent man and you know the rest of them that the bank bones that we've seen is just from Republicans realizing what that whole thing was and it was a hit job\nWell and there was laying in the FBI report and I don't know what it was but that that Kennedy ... his first name the Republican senator right from Louisiana yeah he was on um MSNBC this morning and then they reference says some remark he had made about how furious he was over some parts of the FBI investigation the results of that background check\nAnd he wasn't at liberty to expand on that but I I've kinda heard from other sources to that uh there was something in there that kind of exposed the fact that this was a hit job and I don't know exactly what those details are if we'll ever know but apparently there was something in that report that showed shed some light on\nThat is why Feinstein was crying when honorably Marymount yeah\nYeah we do Trump does have the power to ah make that document public which I really wish you would\nWell all in good time yeah you know how Charles and yeah just give give it a\nLot of baby in a bar morning Rob you know I I'm up in throughout this whole process you know I I tried to politicize for a while but this this this cabin out here and was just too much and I had to enjoy it\nAnd it's like a a like a a shot back it just sucks you write magazine that really small attacks\nI I'm really disappointed in Cory Booker because it the first shift is local career I kind of had some hopes\nAnd it was almost like the same hopes that I had for Rocco bottle when he first started going All right well you know ... you know we disagree on some key issues but maybe he can you know do some good in it and he's become a partisan hack just like\nHe's like I'm only like a mini Michael ...\nIs he is he's a dark yeah\nAnybody that disagrees with me about that they can call Robert on his\nPhone on their way will ah will number out there for you Jeremy I'm pretty sure the buddy\nGuy ever going\nCory Booker is like\n... [laughter] he's like the black\nAre and I'm Still moving Jackson's next Jackson our you\nKnow how\nTo stay in one place so that was actually he Jackson Jackson back the train up body actually can't hear you you're breaking up trying to stand in one\nSpot or pull over a ... year let's bring in yes\nDislike for thirty seconds to go to break\nIt's like a little on the ... I go listen\nThere's like four and ... ... I Want to get like thirty seconds and you know how to go to break\nIt's like a little on the ...\nI go with banks and I got a break when I Want to go [laughter] you just tell me what you need me to know\nAll right Jacqueline thanks well that might have something to do with it [laughter] [laughter]\nAh what did you Jackson I just you can call me back I'll take your call again just because I couldn't hear you so I don't know what you were trying to tell me or if it's complaining about the Ford vaccine know call me back when he got something else on I'll take a call\nClark hey now what's going on there now\nSo you know the vote today it's kind of overshadowed what probably is the biggest story we're looking over as the Monica McLean saying how much of that if you looked into\nA I was actually I'm going to talk about that next hour but that's a that's a bombshell this come out uh with all this stuff\nWell there's just I mean it just keeps coming you know she was with for the when they crafted the letter a robot speech she pressure do witness her lawyer is uh how do you say it ...\nOr ... ... yeah that's ... and\nI think is it ... is Andrew in the caves lawyer as well\n\nAnd I you know it gives me a headache what's really needed a court forward with pictures and strings go on between them\nKinda wiring when they're doing for us crime or the old saying oh ... yeah but\nWho would have um this is incredible you know if you had a family tree where names were repeated than the tree as often as they are in these things you'd end up with three finger children in two or three generations\nI mean everybody's related to everybody here right which is weird little bit it's got a bit of um\nSlept for had failed to know who he is [laughter] [laughter] yeah that stuff's illegal uh yeah that does a good car hang with my buddy up next our I'm going to talk about that stuff that we need to bring\nIt up it was a Wall Street journal reports uh and it's a pretty big I mean it's something needs to be known and I think it leads to another place that that directly relates to the FBI and Christine for a a row we will go down\nEverything you thought that this could have been in terms of collusion and crafted\nIt is yeah\nNo doubt about it ... good to hear from you buddy as always\nTake care now let me go next to\n... Ryan brand or\nUm you were talking earlier about these protesters were given arm bands I thought that was interested in uh [noise] I don't think they've ever given out are ... Republicans have\nNow 'cause we were ah were all at work that day\nYeah we're too busy at work I'm actually well ... are we saying that Republicans are civilized and low information Democrats are not like it might have something to do with it\nWell listen if you're a if you're a low info type of person you're not you're not very bright it's easy to act like an animal I mean I don't you think about it and hills are\nAre inferior beings just on the sake of the food chain or whatever you want to call it so yeah if you if you've got that just a couple of my brain capacity semi will act like\nIf you've got that ... that brain capacity semi will act like the species that have that brings us yeah\nYeah all the details and integration I thought it was a little bit funny of course the low information Democrat protesters were breaking out storefronts and burning stuff all that was a stretch limo in downtown Washington these little snowflakes a\nCell that is a ... that stretch limo on fire and come to find out later blown to Democrat\nOr a number that I wasn't in the Muslim guy and he was thinking of running Muslim Redman yourself\nBut if all of these girls the sound like our teenagers hoping and all around and show and all that of course they might not have been born and but that we're still young a\n... a Democrat women then ... water where all these protests women back when the slick willy ... really molested in women over a period of many many years I I Can't figure that out one of the ones that in protest back then\nThey were nap and for the Republicans to protest again\nYeah well probably that let the fact they all had a ... I think it has led to it but you know this also at points out something else [noise]\nThis is amazing how much power and influence the media has over the public that's that's the key right there people don't realize how they can influence the way people think no yeah\nAnd I'm oh I'm Sorry I just thank God for talk radio\nFor you and literally let you look at everything they got\nMake it a day go out to ... ... the um the what the hype is all about five six nine seven four sixteen thirty three to five six nine seven four sixteen thirty three on line Billy Mitchell jewelry dot com or\nOne county road one oh one in most and get down there and tell them\nYou're hurting right here on the line we'll be back after the oh\nDo you want to do the up and Goldman W why do you are you in Birmingham W two or three Seventy ...

Thirteen year old is she comes along with our cash Maron counties in English and all afternoon\nA Susan Collins ramped up all the drama where they link the speech laying out the facts and announcing she will vote yes on Kavanaugh that puts the vote at the same number\nThe cloture was and that's fifty one forty nine\nYou had one lone Democrats saying he will in fact a vote yes tomorrow and that was one Joe Manchin we've talked about him several times on the show and\nAnd uh I I was pretty confident in thinking he was going to vote yes and it seems he's going to\nUh one thing that is in Port and is that the lone Republican that voted no on the cloture and probably will be voting no tomorrow and then there's one Lisa Murkowski\nShe voted with the Democrats and opposing the motion I assume that means she will be voting no tomorrow as well but it's a done deal because done deal so we've\nTalked about that we've talked about the protesters have gone through that whole thing and how the protestors probably helped cabinet are more than they hurt Kavanaugh\nBut the biggest thing is is what this is done to the Republican base when it's done to Republicans in general in in the Senate and on Capitol Hill\nIt's gotten people fired up and now people will make the argument that the excitement will die off by November but I don't know I think\nThis is pretty close to the midterms ... yeah that this can ride over for another four week\nWell that's and that's all we need is for way see I mean if you were talking three four months I Would agree that the energy is going to wear off a little bit but um I think people are still going to have that certainly planted in their minds\nThat is correct All right with that said we missed out on the email so we won't do that now right after I tell you about legacy roof contractors who are the best absolute best in the roofing industry\nYou need a new roof you need repairs whatever the case says I Want you to first called legacy roof and tell them you heard it on W.

Samuel L. says Andrew with your disbelief of global warming how appropriate you should do some looking into an article that just popped up today\nA study has found that wind farms cause global warming therefore it does exist wind farms or a wind farms warm surface temperatures and have been for years not being ignorant and read up on your business\n[noise] your ... you know so many I don't know what you do in your spare time\n... cause global warming I make it into wind farms oh maybe I should add something to look into\nProbably should a Britain is next Brent says Andrew does today's vote on the Kavanaugh stuff really mean anything one senator senator vote didn't include\nHow she would vote tomorrow so what's the point of today's vote I Swear if Kavanaugh doesn't get confirmed I'm going to quit my job and go into full time protesting we need a revolution in this country\nAnd nobody wants them milder Graff uh Jessica's hot cakes coming up next segment just to make a couple of points that we didn't get to yeah there was a a surprise op ed that was released last night from Brett Kavanaugh did you\nSee that I did actually\nYeah he stresses in this thing that a a good judge must be an umpire a neutral impartial arbiter who favors no political party or or policy and who is not swayed by the public swayed by public pressure\nUm he says my hearing testimony was focused while I'm Sorry was forceful and passionate that is because I've forcefully him passionately denied the allegations against me\nAt times and my testimony both of my opening statement end in response to questions reflected in my overwhelming frustration of being wrongly accused without cooperation\nOf horrible conduct completely contrary to my rock burn my record and my character my statement and answers also reflected my deep distress at the unfairness of how the ... has been handled\nHe said he was more emotional during the hearing than he's ever been in his wife and that he might have been too emotional at times ah during the testimony due to the vial and violent threats that his wife and daughters and been faced with and on the past few weeks he said I Do not decide cases based\nOn personal or policy preferences I Am not a pro plaintiff or pro defend that judge I'm not a pro prosecution or pro defense judge I Am\nPro law so it was his way of coming out and saying you know for you naysayers that saying I'm some sort of political hack and then I'm I'm part assume that can't be a judge for that reason you got it all\nAnd the you know for you naysayers that saying I'm some sort of political hack and then I'm I'm part assume that can't be a judge for that reason you got it all wrong and you came at me and try to destroy made me my reputation my family and\nAnybody else if they actually love their family would conduct themselves in the same way Kavanaugh did if not more harsh\nAnd I was going to say I think he was fairly restrained him and he did cut loose a few times but considering the circumstances and what he was being accused of I mean especially a an an it doesn't matter if you're a man or woman they the accusation brings the same but I'm just saying\nThat for him and his position and all the years of his reputation can you even imagine what that would feel like well it can't\nWin for losing because remember in his testimony or I'm Sorry not the testimony but that interview he did with whoever it was more than ... whoever I Can't remember um they said he was two miles to robotic and didn't seem genuine enough\nThey'll when he first responded to the allegation right so then he comes out swinging Clarence Thomas style and it was like oh it can be a judge look at him as a madman\nTelling a part of the same way and you can't have it both ways and either through robotic ...\nSo that came out also another bomb shell came out or in the wall Street Journal that said that wheeling Kaiser the friend of\nChristine Ford told investigators when the FBI came to investigate this last time that Monica McLean\nWho is a retired FBI agent and they've personal friend of Christine Ford had urged her to clarify her statement quote unquote clarify yes\nNow we know Kaiser leave when Kaiser is one of the one of three witnesses in addition to Kavanaugh himself allegedly who um Ford claimed was there they've also on the night it remember she said leave when Kaiser had health issues and that's why you know she couldn't corroborate\nWell and she said it as though she had mental health is she right the implication\nSo apparently there's this\nMonica McLean who is a former FBI agent and dear friend of of ah Christine forward\nWent to leave link Kaiser and try to pressure her into saying that the ... that actually happened that that the party happen that the sexual assault happened\nAnd that she could line up with Ford story a retired FBI agent you think about all the links we see in this stuff yeah the least of fusion GPS now a former FBI agents is this FBI agent the one that conducted the or the polygraph\nBecause think about that remember she said it was a retired FBI agent did the polygraph well does that mean this is that person and that made it sound me thought about that that person who gave you the polygraph them went and pressure but one of the alleged witnesses wow that's deep and that's why\nI think at this point after Brett Kavanaugh gets confirmed the FBI must investigate Christine forward\nI think they should investigate I mean and for good reason I ... that should not be\nThat it should not be said for that you can make these allegations gets them to the point where it got to the level it dead and then she's able to just walk away nothing else happens and you know what not just her but anybody else that was complicit and as we've got to put a stop to that are just gonna keep happening\nTake that report and you can consider\nAnd you know not just like anybody else that was complicit and we've got to stop the church is going to keep happening\nJust take their reports and consider wheeling kinds are being pressured by former happy I did there was a friend a doctor for changing her story the fact that Ford said\nShe was given a polygraph by former FBI agent and if I had the gas is probably going to be this McLean like I'm sure it is she refused to turn over her therapy notes or any sort of documentation from the polygraph\nTest which is very questionable it's curious because she was really interesting is why wouldn't you turn over every single bit of evidence you had the support of your story\nThere's still a lot of confusion surrounding the way in which these allegations were first reported and then made public\nAnd then the fact that Chuck Grassley last\nNight sent a letter to Ford's attorney asking for the third time that any relevant documents they had needs to be turned over if they want a fair shake at this thing\nI guess what they are not\nThey'll\nDo at this point I think we have no other choice then to have the FBI investigates Christie for especially when I see things like um you're a member that Chad Weddington former\nFormer college classmate of Brett Kavanaugh I came out and said he was a bad year on Israel yeah\nWell I don't remember who was in the ... yeah I was in ...\nHe came out and talked about how bad of a drunk he was in how he's perjured himself and all that\nHe invited the media out and spoke to the media\nI Want to his interview because it is pretty humorous begins a statement and then he didn't blame it on the answering questions button he answered a few anyway and it went south of really quick little boy that for you on the other side do well by nine four one one zero one one they'll go
