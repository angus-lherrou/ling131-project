I mean that's I mean that's going to cover for for some knows for sure\nSo I mean they got everything they're doing everything they can that's why they're not keeping her there because she's somewhat stable and then only going to do is punish killing off the bacteria and they just there's no reason we're sitting around ... will go home so you're wondering is there anything else you can do on\nTop they have like I Know she's only like pro body 'cause I didn't know how soon we could start 'cause I'm sure after six weeks of this she's totally wiped out\nYeah I mean they absolutely she can I mean technically when you're taking antibiotics you can take robotic says well that's kind of a stain or just because it won't really interfere it'll just keep replenishing\nAs long as far as far as the pro or any antibiotic it's going to wipe out everything neutralize the gun\nIn robotics on and so you're just gonna keep good bacteria and there can only help her digestion and and that sort of thing and it's smart to use ... robotics when when you're coming off of a round of antibiotics but you know obviously I ... I Would get with her family dog in in discuss some of that but I mean as far as where she doing right now\nI mean off of a round of antibiotics but you know obviously I ... I Would get with our family dog in and discuss some of that but I mean as far as where she doing right now that what the have our own sounds\nIt sounds like the standard of care so I mean I wouldn't\nI wouldn't really pushing the diet and everything else building the immune system up that you know push you know drink a lot of water all the basic things she wishes she just would I Would watch your diet if you're asking my thoughts on if it was me and that's when I Would do as well I'd watch what she's eating making sure she's eating non inflammatory foods you know the whole thing when you're dealing with a bacterial infection of any kind\nTo just eat whatever and don't worry about it I'm not a big fan of that I think you have to be really careful things you eat obviously bland food but but even so much getting salt in\nLet me see when I say salt and she had high blood pressure\nYeah okay yeah I mean like the bras like chicken broth and beef Ross and that sort of thing when you're going through recovering those are really good for just stepping on those throughout the day along with drinking plenty of water helps the electrolytes and the body and that can help build the body up so there's some things to consider\nUm they might want to do some research on that but I mean with the death\nYou know it's about killing the bacteria but at the same time you want to keep the body restored as much as possible and and eat healthy foods and you know just commonsense things there's there's no silver bullet I guess if you're asking me for a silver bullet there's really not one for this they'd given her the silver bullet [laughter] they pulled out my wife is\nA kind of game grant was how how long they're going to kind of get over there\nHow many ah when did they give it to the uh ...\nStarted [laughter] because I had my eye and they had her own I'm\nPlanning on weight yeah you know a typical typically it just depends on how many of those antibiotics typically tend to fourteen days so she's looking she's looking at probably a couple of weeks to to be completely recovered that that's what's typical and you know obviously\nYou know as far as that goes depending on how strong your immune system isn't and what kind of lifestyle habits she does for the next couple of weeks that will play a big role too so just creating a good healthy environment for body to to thrive in that would really be me my thoughts on it\nSo I mean I I think that she's she's had some of the best care she can she can get is what they've done is I mean again this is just my thoughts but it sounded like everything's standard of care\nDown the line which that they're going to follow everything it's evidence based anyway\nSo I Would just encourage or be a cheerleader and and just you know make sure she's not eating much fast foods [laughter] it just basics and and there are things you can keep her body strength and in the middle of it all but I'm Glad you called for her I mean just so you know there are some natural things that can help\n'em I mean but at at this point with all the antibiotic she's had it's not going to do it it wouldn't be worth looking into I don't think like on a silver and some of the other\nThere's some other herbal formula and all of it it's it's not even worth talking about because what she's doing right now\nIt's the big guns so she's got everything they've put in her to make it happen so it's just about let in all of that medicine\nDo its thing and then her making the right choices every single day to you know to make yourself healthy and make better choices and all that sort of thing so keep me posted in and I'm Glad you called for her and she would appreciate that as well and\nLet her know we're thinking about her right Lisa and

... usually if he's just got brown spots that are\nOn his leg and he needs to go to a doctor and have that checked out because without seeing it without seeing blood work without knowing it's total history and all it can be a host of different things can be liver spots that could be an issue or sometimes to brown watching can come up on the lower part of the leg that is in conjunction with diabetes\nMore even someone that's been in a pre diabetes stage for some period of time\nIt can be nothing it could be something you know 'cause they just ran in the kitchen the\nPigment changes in his leg you know again a dermatologist or even a family physician someone that can really look at that and you know through years of experience of seeing different skin conditions was ... that's going to be his best bet eternal just come up with some random idea I don't think is a is a wise thing to do that's just my thought but\nYou know again it could be something simple and it could be something not so simple so getting a full evaluation and it's great to take supplements and all but you know getting a full evaluation getting blood work done and really seeing where\nOr what's going on this body in that area would be a smart move sought encourage you to have just having to go see a doctor and they can run some tests and figure out exactly what's going on okay thanks so much for the call

well it just depends psoriasis being a skin condition\nRemember skin conditions or what they're inside out thing not outside in thing so you want to look at it from an inside out condition not outside in all those psoriasis can be\nIt drives me crazy can action in the skin just get flashy and scaly and it can be just a big nightmare well a couple of things that we know about skin condition psoriasis during the tightest eczema they all kind of fall in the same category\nOne thing we know about them is that there's usually in a mega three fatty acid deficiency in person it's easily deficient\nIn that in in some capacity so cod liver oil or a good omega three fish oil always a good thought when you're dealing with a skin condition zinc is another one we lose ache just through stress and especially men lose it because of so much that's going on\nOr just an interest in life and we burn up a lot of zinc for testosterone so that's one of the reasons\nIs it because of so much going on\nOr just in interest in life and we burn up a lot of zinc for testosterone so this one of the reasons that that happens and then also with any kind of skin condition you want to think about certain food allergies such as wheat products so bread pasta cereal crackers you know anything any flower based food processed foods you\nMight want to consider eliminating for a while and then also cow's milk dairy cows militaries and the other ones who Casey in protein which is the protein in the ... and pasteurized milk products\nIs is another one that's just a big a big mess so you want to be careful that in a raw milk so little bit different the body can handle that and that's coming on strong whole raw milk industry\nAnd they're they're working on some laws in some legislation right now which might really be good for or are people that that have and sell raw milk to be able to sell it commercially is right now you can only do state to state and has to be sold pet food and a lot of
