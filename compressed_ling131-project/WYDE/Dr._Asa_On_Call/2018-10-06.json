I've got Batman bands and friends that they ... they watch the game they're not it's not they're not watching it but the thing about it is you have a conversation you don't have to hang on a replay\nAlabama right now it's like okay and I'm gonna go horse racing with two of his cabin secretary it\nAnd then also getting the best jockey in the world on secretary and it's just not fair because secretary it's going to win with the worst jockey you know in the world right right I mean 'cause it is because you secretary at a you know the big\nThe big problem this week was the fact that there was a controversy about how NPR students section was yeah right so I mean you've got a lot of early game too yeah the early game but you know the students section was pretty lame and\nI I'm a big believe there's a whole lot of factors involved with a lot of students actually there's not filling out but one of the things that I think the people are talking about is we now have a majority out of state students write\nA lot of those majority out of state students are coming because of Alabama foot now but they don't have the same connection to it lifelong connection to it that the people who grew up in Alabama have it could be so when they think about an eleven o'clock kicked off\nYou know they're not going to come out there for that right so I think that a lot of it is because we have such a high percentage of these out of state students now\nIn Alabama fair unfair is always got the reputation of not being the best home field\nIn middle one they well as well and hear what I'm saying about that they did lose I mean they will only they well they don't matter you know the more they play right now they're going to play the parking lot here they're gonna win that's not what I'm saying is though in years past I think it's gotten better they ... you know it's getting better\nBut for a long time metal fans were known to sit on their ... their hands well that's true but I was there because they are they're like Laker fan you got to show me something yeah it's just not as rabid as ...\nBut to take objection with that I Would say in the last five years so it's been different because there's been some games and and brought any state or a special night games that you know I've been pretty live is it the magical Jordan hair no right yeah but is it comparable with ... and in the swamp yes\nNo I think so you think it's comparable with those young yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean when they when they get that sound system up and you know you have to place back and students action is actually\nWhen you're actually there yeah and again last week a lot hadn't do you know Lebanon am Saturday what was going on at two AM friday night yeah exactly you know I've been to most stadiums um the SEC\nI've always thought she was slightly over rated don't get me wrong as well and I've been down there on Saturday Night it is but you know for the formula only lost a lot there on Saturday Night they have [laughter] I mean that you know ... two thousand eight nine ten it was that was a crazy place but I Will say though it is extremely loud yeah it's a lot of that's just the ...\nOn Saturday Night man [laughter] I mean that you know ... two thousand eight nine ten it was that was a crazy place but I Will say though it is extremely loud yeah a lot of that's just the way they built you know you in LA she if you're up in that top that you're literally about six thousand feet above the field in your own top on it on where you were with\nMe when we were to them is when Mississippi State was number one in the country a few years ago back in a twenty four and tell them how it is that was yeah that was a a lettuce\nThing I've ever heard of it and they already to rain and when it was our with them\nAs they they don't need more cowbell here's here's here's here's the only thing\nAbout me the state and cabbage and it's the only thing I always if you had to use capitals\nThen you're probably not don't have the best I mean this was that bright Denny I'm Talking about it right now I'm the same I mean who steak I Know that that's going to come up and say we have a home field advantage of sixty four people there and they all have cabbage data I'm just not that impressed with it um\nI like old miss a lot it's a nice little place been there once but Florida and I you know again I don't want to be biased here but all I mean it's just not right and not I mean I've ... you know I told you this happen and ... and I I mean yeah and the join here at night\nHave in your ear to ear to an injury way from possibly because he's got to play to get injured than to understand that we got Jay Leno yeah you ... record yeah but they're but they're but there's actually playing pretty well right now really is but let's say someone there that the drop\nAnd you know and I'm not going to I'm not going back to jail and the great guy but there's a huge watch it as it is really a big drop out but he's playing some of his best that they are it's not as big a drop what happens if state I'm painting my in some of his best even when it's all about yeah in starting quarterback let me say that they\nLet me let me say this I don't think anybody touched them what to you can beat him with ... yeah well I'll give you that\nYou know I mean you know that's what I'm saying that the irony is that like I said I think jailing his play in the best ball that he's playing it's been there and that's the irony that he is yeah step he he stepped up he's a better quarterback this year he's I ... I think too is the best quarterback\nI've seen Alabama in my lifetime probably so\nWhen it comes to throwing ... yeah I mean I don't I mean I don't think I slows though I mean ... it's too and then there's a huge yeah and then we got his brother coming right behind him any known ha McCarron was good he was a good thrower he was a good leader you know he he got one three national championship you really should have won three and he doesn't it'd be it'd be doesn't lose ... yeah that\nFor the new one Alabama didn't get stopped him came down score as good as as good as a J. was though\nHe's not he's not he's not the Oscar are pigs and are you are going to go with a B law tech first\nI think uh I Know which way I'm going to hit blazers maybe runs door there special guests on how good is chaired I've talked about this all you have I loved him take his own I'm going to come in and don't tell anybody but this year might not make it after the broadcast\n[laughter] of course I just said that on the radio um versus loud ... takes the jerk you Amy lots of what you think will\nUm when it comes to those teams I'm not too well versed in [laughter]\nI Will nobody asked him ... take UAB the blazers a laser they make the blazers\nOr I really don't know that much about law check 'em I think they're better than you they be yeah I'm\nJust because I think well I'll take it used to playing some big teams and they ... they had to do it just uh I Would miss my daughter goes UAB Blazers but I think the logic when just when All right so Jayme curly is going to\nGo ... when you got a big win last week against Charlotte but I watched that game and they look really sluggish on awesome and they were efficient but they wouldn't really sluggish they do have a top three a difference of secondary to cut your if you can really was or wasn't a good blazers but tech look pretty tough against LSU yeah\nAh and sluggish isn't going to get it on the road in a night game or so give me a lot of tech ... right I'm\nI'm going to law taxes will out alight law say that when they played in the second half of the athletes in secondary other the girl ... somebody go with lots we all uh we went to me you and Jamie with ... you wouldn't be so will you will be a genius later when next week\nAnd they and they actually could win the game well so you might come out the the winter on that All right let's go with the next game is going to be Missouri on the road of South Carolina\nI Would have solved that either one of these two teams would have been possibly the second best team in the east and\nGame is going to be Missouri on the road of South Carolina I Would have solved that either one of these two teams would have been possibly the second best team in the east and it was kind of shots I think South Carolina has ... I think they've uh pretty much that it's not going to happen but we got Missouri\nOn the road at USC I Would say if you listen to ... between the man's podcast\nIT which way I'm going what we will wait and get there in the moment and we'll wait I'm not happy with the south Carolina and that was\nGoing on within our own while South Carolina really writes okay the reason why\nMissouri's just Missouri [laughter] goes or even South Carolina's South Carolina I think they're still I think maybe or North Carolina or South Carolina connection maybe show a lot of friends that she doesn't of the show me state so it wasn't a shade at the tigers okay ah Jimmy early ...\nYou know this is Jeff one hard to tell if if Missouri's not not at all not seven to eight Missouri zone they're there but you're dealing with a defensive guy for South Carolina he knows anything you know so much that down all the answers but I don't I don't think you can do it I think ms ... alright so Jayme curly goes\nMust do right\nNow I Will Glenn brasher windows ... will he go a different\nUh South Carolina as we know started the season and one of the teams that we thought you know could be second best and he is a point there loaded with talent on both sides of the ball but the problem for them started a season was the lack of depth on our fence and that has gotten worse as the seasons going on\nUm I don't think they're going to be scored enough to keep up with Missouri even that even though they are at home I'm Down in South Carolina after most of Kentucky so give me Missouri\nGlib brasher goes ... ... remember it started a year we were in South Carolina might take down Georgia we knew we felt that way I Know they didn't pick it though we ... we can we pick Georgia but we both said well we got there were like you know what I tell you right now I'm not gonna be surprised at all so I Know what happened yeah but I'm with you here's the deal\nUh Missouri when you've got a game on the road\nAnd your deacons is not right because Missouri's not but it's better than was last year\nWhat you got to do is you got to have a quarterback and go drew law is a next level quarterback nine the aisle in Iraq ... has had a terrible year I think so I think coming in to see maybe ... yeah I think can be positive money blame yeah so he's seven and six right he's got seven a touchdown six pick someone you're\nNot drew lock loving touchdowns to pick some of the year\nI'll like Emmanuel hall brown tree Crockett I just believe offensively Missouri will score\nI think South Carolina can slow down but I truly believe Missouri puts a twenty ... Twenty one I don't see South Carolina doing that they just know that I mean they don't have the ... they're not playing well believes a trigger man unless he has the game of his wife to more I don't see it happen\nGovernments do I like this along people go ahead and go with Lockett yeah All right let's go with another lock that I like in ... in a swamp\nExcited will make again LSU\nHe's on a deep thinker wheel is a man of few were right there and working and windy more will [laughter] I should not\nBe any reason walk and stretch point excuse for allied that that's what I Do because she's got a team this year yeah they do they do have a team this year they are nasty on both sides the ball what do you think you have a girl like\nI said it last week I think it was she was a paper giant while well you're wrong last week there I was very wrong last week on most of my thing that I'm going with Florida then Mullen's as he can turn things around they got the when I think they pencil then last week\nI get Mississippi State so I think he's going to get them on the right track it is hard to play down there that was fun\nBut when I think they ... last week I get Mississippi State so I think he's going to get them on the right track it is hard to play down there those folks get crazy I've been there there twice with Harvey duck you well I think that he's on a different level right now and I think they just called Florida flat or rights but I'm going to Florida alright\nGo getters Sean ... is I never do that oh my gosh I never say go get your ... whatever she ...\nFlorida's got nothing [laughter] they had a big win at state but I'm convinced that says more about states than it does Florida ... LSU emperor or getting away stronger\n[noise] ah there often is a better LSU outfits and they've had a long time mainly 'cause they're breaking LSU offensive tendencies there so\nWhat about the first day on JV LSU and who about four and I'm a I'm a fan of throwing the ball ...\nThey're taking down film shots right I mean they don't always complete I'm going to take and snapshots that's not ... not right so I I'm a great when my ... my nephew here I think that she was\nPutting it together and listen to fold miss ... score against LSU Florida is definitely not going to school [laughter] so when is taking ... that's ... that's my job with a high school coach don't talk as I got\nA job or up doesn't turn the ball over\nTo not two hundred yards passing last week also I don't want to say what eighty or Ninety on the ground he's a good ... getting run ... at that game you're right I Want to deal with that is good especially on the back in greedy Williams I mean he is Asia now Dave he's going to shut down your best ... taking your best receiver\nOut of the game yeah Florida doesn't have a good receivers whoever the so he's taken the best of their work for Sievers\nOut of the game I like it lets you they don't turn the ball over and have a great defense and that sort of when you\nThe majority of your games and your schedule\nNo matter how bad your fences I light borough um we're sets a glorified full back when you're playing well the one thing I question that God is they don't still have that gal on the outside that they've had in the past\nBut she goes and went to a game I I think I don't I think Mullen's always been over rated\nI think we pay for an example I said it before the ... I think it's a quarter not a fan and the better quarterback when let go ahead and go with Joe borough and LSU did knock it out or this games interested to maybe one to go to Texas Oklahoma the red river something needed a shootout showcase events or name the red river game\nAnd so you really read have you seen the river and the only way I swim twice there it's mentally read yeah it's it's like a like a fruit punch taste to it is a lot of analysts I should all very much so we'll sexes Oklahoma which thing\nUm I don't really think Texas has what it takes to beat Oklahoma at all and you're almost putting up some\nBig numbers slamming the will to slamming teams do what it takes them to manhood from [laughter] All right so you got to you like are you like Oklahoma you you're you're saying boomer sooner", "show_name": "Dr. Asa On Call", "month": "10", "state": "AL", "day": "06", "station": "WYDE", "city": "Birmingham"}
