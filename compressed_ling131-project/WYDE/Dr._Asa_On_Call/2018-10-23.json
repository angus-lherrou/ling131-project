things they get because all the structure [noise]\nIn the department of justice in Maryland is particularly active in pursuing this structuring money in the fiscal year two thousand eleven Marilyn brought forth teen the nation's Ninety nine structuring cases or ... percent of them\nEven though they only make up one point eight percent of the nation's population so supposedly Marilyn citizens or eight times more likely to be committing crimes than the rest of us or\nSomething else is going on or raw they're frozen steam is on the record as saying that anti structuring efforts are quote an increasing area of emphasis for the Justice Department and there has been an influx of resources\nTo investigate it is\nI'd be disappointed if there was an uptick\nIn prosecution [noise]\nSo by lawyer called\nProsecutor was on the case robbed residency and actually it was a department of justice and Maryland at the time I'd like to see him go to jail now go visiting\nBut he called him one of rods deputies he said well that's the way it goes and we will and will negotiate new will probably keep half that money you might have ...\nUh the deputies\nHe said well that's the way it goes and we will and will negotiate new world probably keep half that money and you might have you been able to negotiate that down some but you know use the you know we'll negotiate some kind of a deal\nTreating it all too casually like it's negotiating some thing at a garage sale not thirty thousand dollars above businesses\nOf families live\nSomehow I don't know how\nIt all came down but there was another lawyer showed up\nAnd he'd been working on the structure thing for a long time\nWhat they all told me\nYou know to keep my mouth shut and not tell anybody about it\nI think all the newspapers but when I went to the farmer's markets that weekend everybody knew that the governments told my money\nEverybody woke up and say well now I Know how we goes I told him the story\nAnd they are where they they couldn't believe it\nSo it wasn't too long after that that uh\nI got a call from Baltimore city paper and he was questioned me about you know this because he saw the docks\nCome out of federal court in Baltimore\nAnd I said you know I'd love to tell you this story but my lawyer said do we get this thing's\nSettled out better just not say nothing that's what the government wanted everybody say nothing so they can still your money and nobody knows what's going on\nSo he said well you know if that's the way you want to look at it but I'm going to do the story of do look good on your part far right from what the government says\nSo his government's allowed to speak about him but they say that he's not allowed to respond\nBecause people already thought we'd done something wrong I mean everybody her her parents thought we had done something wrong I think my parents might have done something wrong then so I told the whole story\nSo when we got her settlement papers\nYou know we knew from the\nCase on the eastern shore with a\nWho knew what their settlement was with my son was different housing method I did something wrong in the settlement I wouldn't do it\nSo now lawyer called them\nHe says because your client went to the press\nAnd they sent us an email it said it\nRosen teens deputy Stefan could sell off actually vote an email that they were treated differently because quote Mr Taylor did not give an interview to the press admitting as clear as day that the government is acting\nAccording to a rule of vengeance not according to the American promise of the rule of law\nSo he said wasn't\nGoing to do is be any negotiating you know they were keeping close to thirty thousand dollars into other than the ...\nNow since I went to the press\nIf we would have fought him if we're to fault him\nThey would have got\nTo the whole three hundred and sixty thousand dollars away the pauses and checking account that year so that was another thing they were holding against us and didn't find this you know you're not going to win and they were going on three hundred and sixty thousand dollars [noise]\nIs what you call black male either pay us thirty thousand or going to come after you for more three hundred and sixty thousand and by the way fighting us in court will cost you a lot more than thirty thousand so you might as well just pay us right now\nThe south and in by the way fighting in court will cost you a lot more than thirty thousand so you might as well just pay us right now a pretty good business to be in if your if the government they can do this all day long and do\nBut not a great business proposition if you're Randy and Karen especially when you're trying to do your actual his sense of farming it's a no win situation for them if they lose\nNo matter what\nSo this hour decided to forfeit the thirty thousand dollars of their sees the money to the government\nAnd tried to move on with their lives [noise]\nFarmers are a lot of time to go out and fight and you can't fight him surely can't fight the government [noise]\nBut in the meantime there's two for justice had been working on some of these cases\nIn our in contact with them and they came out we had a meeting\nBut says like cases already settled they just\nReally wasn't a whole lot they can do [noise]\nAnd when we come back we're going to hear what happens when liberty lawyers get involved in that sort of the Institute for justice his lawyers are\nThey protect people's property rights from the government and always remember why the constitution was formed\nAs we all know that most of our cops and prosecutors are good guys but the bad ones and boy there were some bad ones here folks and you know it right\nThe law on behalf of the citizens starts to take action [noise]\nRandy shower story here\nOn our American stories here although we do sort of our American network dot org give us your email address and we will send you are five best stories of the week [noise]\nAnd there'll be a transcript form\nYou can read them or you can listen to him by the way if you have your story about government power coming in on your life you've settled on an iris form\nOf you settle for something when you didn't think you are guilty send those stories to us we'll run them down because this is happening all over the country and it's happening a lot more than you think\nAgain this is our American stories when we return the dairy farmer Randy shower shaken down by his own government the guy just trying to get along every day like the rest of us\n[noise]\n\nBack [laughter]\n\nHear a lot about Hillsdale College here on our American stories it's a special place were students study all the things that matter in life all the things that are beautiful in life and I know I teach there every year for a couple of weeks\nIt's going to be nothing was going to be like any other country you don't have any right you're not going to run a business\nAnd that's why Randy is so grateful that the nonprofit Institute for justice is their fight\nTo win for him and for the over two hundred other citizens from the government had their backs\nUp against the wall and couldn't afford to fight them until Institute for justice took up their case at no cost to them and with no reward ever going\nTo the nonprofit\nWhich will be for justice of the bus or young lawyers that are concerned about this country\nI met a good many of them they all have the same outlook and they're not out there\nTo make a lot of money I have no idea how much money they make I don't care most all the money comes in donations from people that like what they see and not people like me 'cause I don't have a lot of money to give up I mean people think I have a lot of money I mean so now live in a big house but\nYou know the house came with land we both are they really want the house is too big that's why I'm living in just two of us because nobody does want to live in it\nBut you know the people what people think about farmers is is ridiculous because they think you're rich because you've got big machines because a lot of money and that's why you're not rich because you've got to have those machines do what you do [noise]\nAnd great work there's always Alex and what a story\nBy the way a major bank CEO confidence\nAnd great work there's always Alex and what a story\nBy the way a major bank CEO confidentially told us that the government has essentially forced them\nInto being their own private snooping army with their compliance department selling the mind their customers accounts but what the government like deemed suspicious activity giving them no choice but to report many innocent citizens like Randy ... hours to the government for investigation\nThe c._e._o. said that this for snooping sweeps up for more information than anything that the NSA did related to phone records and yet has received almost zero attention and that's what we're doing here in our American stories bringing this story to your attention is also a big problem of selective prosecution you're\nThe government has seized the bank accounts of innocent farmers like Randy ... hours but refused to charge politicians like former New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer who was actually guilty of structuring his payments to prostitutes and you bet he knew what structuring was\nThis bipartisan legislation out their folks and it's sponsored by Democrats like congressman Sheila Jackson Lee and Republicans like Senator Ted Cruz and that doesn't happen too often so that's how bad this prosecutorial abuse is folks\nOf course that would change the statute so that you can't be charged for a crime that you\nDon't know is a crime it's called men's ray of folks it's the heart of criminal law if you don't know a crime and crime you can't be charged with it\nThis is Lee Habib Randy shower story and thank goodness for the Institute for justice look them up folks give them some money they do great great work protecting property rights for Randy maybe one day for people like you\nAgain this is our American story [noise]\nHi hello Hi were the

show show where you know [laughter] just well here's our in the news there's also all kinds of business going on is coming in\nAnd summertime so they're saying that weather now is triggering migraine headaches especially the mild one new study\nAnd with the heat coming in and the temperature changes researchers have found as they tested this that the temperature change can be a culprit about a fifth of the time or study provides evidence they said that there's a link between perception of temperature sensitivity\nAnd the actual temperature itself so it's interesting some of the mind plays a role in this the doctors to Jim Wang\nOr the hospital in Taiwan sent in a recent news release you said whether more commonly trigger mild headaches the moderate to severe migraines study shows however when people perceived that the weather was a certain way the migrants were still strong about thirty six million Americans have migraine headaches\nAnd six million them experience them as debilitating headaches at least Fifteen days\nPer month so if you've ever been around someone or even you if you have headaches on a regular basis migraines\nThis was completely debilitating or many of the triggers they say that we're a part of the studies were the hormonal fluctuations that they looked at food sensitivities stress bright white sun glare and loud sounds unusual smells can be a big trigger also changes in wake in sleep patterns\nPhysical exertion answer medications so several things going on\nThat can be really helpful or for migrants now you're all the triggers what can you do for a while from a natural perspective there's a couple of things one if their food since devotees obviously you want to remove\nCertain foods for a period of time at least two to four weeks and you can really see as the body kind of gets rid of the food at any any buildup of that in the system is kind of a basic way to say that\nThen as it kind of leaves the body you'll notice a if not you start adding to foods back in ... you can actually notice the triggers will happen again so\nA couple of things on that another one is from migraines if they hurt really really bad over the right eye you might want to get checked out and see if you don't have some form of an iron deficiency ... or ... you can have a deficiency or can be an excess either one\nAnd simple blood test can do that they can check ferrets in levels which will say the storage tank um the iron and if it's on the left hand side\nAnd then this happened to me the other day you know all of a sudden we'll talk a lot about myself much here as far as what happens if it was interesting is of course I teach this all the time right so you think [laughter]\nDrive or take my own advice which is kinda funny but really this to this that and the other day and I was taking a some supplements and I was ... there were some new supplements I was trying now and it was actually from a different company and working on those and I was already taking which I didn't realize I just just didn't\nThere were some new supplements I was trying now and it was actually from a different company and working on those and I was already taking\nWhich I didn't realize I just just didn't seem to look at it but I was taking the supplement that has a natural form of zinc in it it's like a whole food based something which is what are our brand has and I was I was taking when that already had sink in it so it was already getting plenty of that plus I eat a plenty of proteins and nuts seeds\nAll of which have plenty of zinc\nWell this is one supplement then I was taking for I don't know maybe a week had excessive amounts of zinc in and it was one of the one of the key ingredients and the milligrams was quite were quite high and I started getting these headache over my left eye I mean pounding ... I never get headaches ever\nPounding headache over my left eye\nAnd I went to a friend of mine of course you know when it's happening to you all your knowledge for for some reason since go out the window\nAnd I went to a buddy of mine who does a lot of natural based medicine and and we were talking I just I've got this headache over ... died you know I Know deficiencies and in an excess can cause it and he goes well you teach about the lifestyle in time what does it and I said was ink\nAnd so we we we we did some some looking some research on that and I looked in the cell phone so sure enough so I came off everything in went into within two to three days it was completely gone and it was how to build up of sneaking the body my body was letting me know that your course there was an excess now here's the deal\nThat's not in standard medical literature about that that comes from more natural passing based research a lot of it was known in Europe and so it doesn't hold a lot of weight as far as medical studies go swimming traditional medicine\nWe really wouldn't look at that as as anything substantial but I can tell you that learning about that years ago\nJust from more of an alternative approach it's amazing what some of the things they have found throughout the years that aren't technically uh\nIn the medical literature but yet still you can see really good results from it so interesting to say the least triple eight to eight three seven to seven two lines are open let's go to is the idea is that am I saying that Rite Aid and\n\nAll right so low um I've got two questions one is a first I'll start off like five years ago I got electrocuted with some high tension power lines that was in ICU for about a week\nAfter that um several months later started getting math if he cramped are now I don't do tree work anymore and stuff I work at ready guy and okay what do you call it uh I mean fix the degree weather and I'm getting the cramped\nAnd when I get a hate crime it's like it bends Neal rates in like ... near where my kidney is but in my back more\n... than me over where I'm Crying out that God and the only way it or leave me is uh if I mean I can drink all the gay parade I Want and hardly anything but if I drink probably half a gallon of water in that period uh\nIt it it it\nEventually stop and that but I'm\nI'm completely drained yeah\nYeah are you often are you exhausted in the mornings when you wake up\nI Am I from the time but like I mean as long as I get a cup of coffee and me or do my uh I Do like an I exercise which is I stretch my eyes open 'em up widest off well and then when I Do that usually I'm I'm pretty wide awake\nBut um if you're getting the cramping like that and drink called ...\nAnd then when I knew that usually I'm a pretty wide awake but um\nIf you're getting the cramping like that and drink all the water and then the cramping goes away but you feel exhausted it sounds like you've got some issues with the\nAdrenal fatigue and that's pretty common your adrenal glands are little Glen is on top of the kidneys which kind of interesting because that's where you feel like some of the cramping is\nSo I've got a couple of ideas so we'll talk about that one come as breaks I ain't tight\nVery back [noise]\n[noise]\nOur health is determined by the choices that we make every single day health is not the

out\nEat how many soldiers do you drink a day I'm maybe three yeah bring a thought about Macs\nYeah phosphorus than fast for gas at the dinner in those sometimes can be a little bit challenging and of course\nThe advantages is it can it can lead possibly just in kidney stones and whatnot I you know it's it's tough to same and that's something Dr definitely is going to get when you want I'm just letting you know a lotta times infections the first thing kidney stone second\nIt's got to be a pretty bad case for it to be big C word so I I don't know that I worry too much about that but it's probably something simple a lot of times\nYou know if you do a lot of physical labor or guys that exercise a lot of heavy weights I'm you know heavy weight lifters and whatnot can have blood in the urine that you literally just breaking down of\nTissue strain on the kidneys and all that so there can be a whole host of things I Would get it checked out it's probably was a ... did she tell you is it like a\n... a year now so this was the only two plus one plus did they did she mentioned numbers like that\nNow see that yeah the one in low stress and that that's the way\nSo I could to plus one plus did they did she mentioned numbers like that\nYeah\nShe just said OK yeah just go just go see him I wouldn't worry too much about it just let let them run their test and and come up with it you know a lot of times is infection and some time\nAnd you won't even know it like low grade infection and you wouldn't even know anything was there they just found it in the in the UAE so having to take a look at it if it should be pretty easy to get rid of if it's even anything okay I mean sometimes you can do a test and have some blood in the urine and then two days later passed it and it's gone\nSo again it could be you know getting it tested again would be a smart thing to do most doctors when they see it if there is no major symptoms they'll wait no tested again there shortly and sometimes a minute wait a week or something and see if they're still blood you know there and if there is well then they can and I guess in different directions with it but\nI Would get it checked out again just kind of see what's there but don't don't stress\nWouldn't worry too much about it just stay on top of it and make sure they're treating it okay to play to eight three Seventy seven two
