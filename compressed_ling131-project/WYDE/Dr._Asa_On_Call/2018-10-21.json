were coming in off the break I looked up at Fox News they're talking about the ... murder but someone had someone they put in ... and I was like well I Hope no one's reading that on air cars that can that they don't go well All right let's go to merge Jason and days on the line and\nLet's have them weigh in on do you have something to say about the first man movie a ...\n... and the wall um I have not seen the movie I'm not really interested in seeing it\nIs that because ... is a Canadian is that it\nNo I don't know I I may wait for it to come on TV I don't okay [laughter] but um here's the thing though that the producer of the movie\nSo I may wait for it to come on TV I don't know okay [laughter] but um here's the thing though that the producer of the movie is some big time left the global is type\nHe's got some French lady working for them then they get a Canadian to play the the hero of the story\nAnd so you have a whole bunch of I'm not going to say anti American folks here but definitely not pro American folks trying to promote a movie about American exceptionalism\nAnd there's a lot of them do I need money backing it too from what I read\nTime at the movie but what you say that the the movies about American exceptionalism we understand that the landing on the moon was that but that doesn't mean that the movie has to be that specifically made doesn't matter let's not forget they're actors\nThey're paid to pretend to be somewhat I don't need someone to come from the meal Armstrong bloodline to be qualified to play him it's fine the guy play Superman is also English that he's not from now what I'm\nSaying Russell I like representing what you're saying\nI what I'm saying ... is that in the promotion of the movie you have people that do not buy into American exceptionalism and and I would\nOf course they do and that's why they live here and work here of course they do they may not say it but they say it with their actions yes they do that is why they're here\nThey're not going to say with their words now when when they set foot on the moon he said it was a giant leap for mankind and that was certainly the hope in the attention because the both the ...\nBehind the space race wasn't just American exceptionalism we're going into space whole world's gonna be unified where do you think Star Trek cancel right idea that when we get into the space race we're all going to be one big happy peaceful\nA utopian earth and then we'll be the center point of the galaxy of the universe for all other aliens to come together but let's look at the reality of it is it hasn't happened like that it hasn't United the western world it was a ... point of tried for America\nThat we planted that flag on the moon so regardless of the intentions behind it being some world peace effort\nOr you know in a grander scheme of things it hasn't been that it is still a point of American exceptionalism nobody else has ever gone\nThat I Know in the movie it's portrayed that way in the movie is portrayed as American exceptionalism all I'm saying is when they were making the movie\nThat didn't have to be their only point of storytelling that is woven throughout the movie at no point is it may not to simply be a human accomplishment the dialogue in the movie is we've got to beat the Russians like five times they keep saying that\nI'm going to exert myself in is a peacemaker here between Russell and murder of and just say if you want to see the movie ... based on the plotline eat is pro American yeah don't want to see the movie based on who's a directing it producing it paying for all that because you don't feel that they're\nBuying into American exceptionalism than exceptionalism then I guess you can with ... hey thanks for for the call appreciate it All right we're going to go over to Jason see what he has to say how are you going to go see first man\n\nOh no it's not it's not a form of protest it's more or less and I just I just really don't go watch a lot of movie yeah but I hear a listener Russell puppy\nTalk to him saying so many things in a row so I figured I think you're the nicest guy who was a closet liberal I think the biggest hoax ever played on superstation little one is Russell Peters gonna come out of the ...\nWell you know we all have in hand\nI think you're the nicest guy who was a closet liberal I think the biggest hoax will ever played on superstation little one is it Russell is going to come out of the ...\nWell you know we always have your hat [laughter] no tearing down to have another opposing opinions so we\nWere not but I did have a I had a federal funny\nAbout the flag on the moon I used to work in the oil fields and I traveled a lot and I worked with a lot of uh a nice nations and different nationalities that during that line of work and one of the things that I caught so much crap about about being from America and\nHow do you guys not use the metric system they just never it never let up and so I got the point where would I Would go on these trips I Would take things with me\nTo kind of a passive aggressively or women's argument for instance I bought a shirt that said that about World War champs America\n[laughter] oh [laughter] what are the one of the things that I just got so sick of about the you know what are you what do you what are you guys thinking without using the metric system I used to just say hey whose flag is on the moon [laughter] would always just start you showed up all that crap\n[laughter] and now we got there without losing\nThe metric jaded and ... and I don't think I'm a closet liberal but maybe I'm a closet global if because I Do think we should move to the metric system it just makes a lot more out that\nRussell pie uses the metric system I bet your caller except for kilometers\n... Marshall you have to see the next two hours that you know we we count that way you're going to count to\nTen and then a hundred and ten times than a thousand attempts our brains work that way the fact that we don't use the metric system to me is American arrogance it's a simpler system\nBut it's also not worth the retro activity that would take place to convert over I guess if you're not worried about\nThe rest of the world does this was this was real this is absolutely true this is another one I used to throw in there twice and they speak English you can use the metric\nOh you want to but when you buy tires just what you buy those in\nIs that right even around the world I didn't know that\nYes yes another thing a lot not every part of the world but a large part of the world they might use the millimeter socket but they're turning the socket with a three eighths\nDr rats [laughter] I guess you guys thanks for taking my\nDate and I appreciate in you know what I'm okay with is not going to the metric simply because I have a little streak and me that doesn't like to conform when everybody's going that same route I it's not it doesn't appear all the time but there are certain things and this is the case where people are always\nTrying to persuade you and it makes sense and and even have a little snooty attitude about it and that makes me my me bristle and\nI I I only saw the nonconformist and you're like okay I don't feel the need to conform but if you were to lay them out which is the simpler one\nOh I agree it makes total sense so what I don't know why I don't want to purpose use the more difficult route why what because America is coming to the ball game with the ball and they were coming to the ball game with a ball we set the rules and we're not going to ... their day how now fairly guy you there Dave\nI guess I'm a single Johnson was the uh the the head a engineer over the ... they they were the laws that that built the fast is a most stealth aircraft on her in the Nineteen fifties\nWow ... ... years ago that to me ah\nYeah and he had a big part in in place for all these guys you got to remember these guys were were most of them ... these guys were aircraft pilots they had the biggest bullets coming at them during World War two so that we are tough as nails um there was a a a ...\nAircraft all say they had the biggest bullet coming at them or or cases that were tough as nails um there was a a an exercise that came out about ten years ago it was some of the engineers that they fired and and the only relief after that\nThe Russians would would lie about stuff that you can't get when you have a totalitarian will a country like they had\nYeah um and I think that the capitalist now by the way that it would uh nobody will work for you yeah you're you're Decatur man they're they're trying to get out of work you and um but that would roll out a shell of an aircraft I this is faster and what you got\nIt wouldn't even have it in ... right I mean the whole thing was authentic and a propaganda yeah now there's\nNo way we had rejected or what was it like you said I was always about was the the lander nothing was working right and some of the new said we're not a lot about this they said and I did a they all night was like an hour program and came home\nI'm bringing her back into the news this grace you gonna run and twenty twenty is what this guy's salad it raises my blood pressure just looking at a picture of her but apparently he's just he's saying what so what is it\nInto the news this you're going to run and twenty twenty is what this guy salad\nAnd it raises my blood pressure just looking at a picture of her but apparently he's just he's saying what so what is the age of saying we don't know that she'll come back and run twenty twenty but it's a shame that nobody's even thinking about\nYes he was he seems a little irritated that no one is mentioning her as a possible oh candidate all he has a girl he's saying it's not he doesn't necessarily think she will run but it's not a done deal that she won't run\nAnd they point out that ah you know plenty of other some some of the reasons that she wouldn't run is she's already run she already has um competed twice before in last but so have Joe Biden and a good chance that he's going to run again\nSo simple because she's lost before should not disqualify her according to\nThe ah the eight and then also her age where she is old is she is not as old as Bernie Sanders\nAnd she's not as old as Joe Biden's use a year younger than Trump if I remember the story yet her record barely and so the thought is hey don't be so quick to dismiss her she did win the popular vote but she did have support two years ago who knows if there is support will be there two years from now but\nAh Felipe I think is a guy says\nPhilippe ... Filippo reign\nHe's saying you know John Glen don't give up on on Hillary just yet so wouldn't that be funny if we get Trump Hillary round two\nOh yeah really you know what again I have to say Philippe Reines along with Elizabeth Warren are completely completely over estimating the situation we've got two weeks to go yeah for um\nThe midterms and you want to throw out the idea of Hillary coming back into the scene I don't think any [laughter]\nMore Republicans were riled up and out to the polls to make sure that there is a Republican Congress Senate and house yeah if just to to secure Trump and give him the uh go ahead to continue with his agenda because uh the thought of Hillary reentering\nOh my I mean I Know we're two and a half weeks away from the midterms but we're really three weeks away from the next presidential cycle the moment the midterms are over we're going to start hearing from Democrats who are going to run and it's going to be\nA bloodbath trying to win that nomination to be in their mind but Trump killer the Trump's lawyer yet and twenty twenty\nAnd so I mean we're basically a month away from it all beginning a new and you may have by and then you may have Bernie you may have Hillary you may have ... Harris and a Cory Booker all that\nKnow all that just that just reminds me once again I was going to talk about this after you leave\nHow important it is that we do get out and vote because the only way to to tamp down on these Democrats\nAnd their maniacal session was power\nAnd the fact that they will like you said one week after the election the all claws out all hands on deck um they're going to be motivated because everybody else and the only way to go that down is for them to lose rights are like we need to um I hate to say this this sounds on Christian we need to crush their spirit [laughter]\nDo they need to come up and say New York to be brought down to the lowest level right humbled\nAnd in humbled and defeat because right now they they keep thinking Trump's an anomaly they keep thinking that he's a quirk that needs to be corrected and the only way to correct it is for us to us and them or the Democrats to threaten you to that if you don't put him in office\nUm they're going to come they're not going to go\nUs as ... the Democrats his threaten you to that if you don't put them in office um they're gonna come they're not going to go way\nSure and I don't think anyone knows exactly how this election is going to play out but we're getting close to and a half weeks ago news as it is there still could be another big news story or to between now and then but Democrats they want the house they had hopes on the Senate the likelihood of that is pretty slim I think at this point based on some projections\nBut who knows I guess anything could happen\nI think I think you're right I think that some where the\nStatistics are showing that the Senate is is good because all of a sudden I've noticed in the news all this and they're talking about the house right before it was all about the Senate sure it's like ... what have you just been told all of a sudden you got to\nShift in pivot and go for the house hey speaking of Hillary in her again or at least for aid tried to throw her name back into the mix\nApparently the New York times isn't even happy about this so apparently the grey lady is going after the grey lady [laughter]\nThey want her to go away yeah so you apparently the editorial board\nUm has said that the broadly unpopular Hillary Clinton\nMight want to stay out of the crucial midterms because she has the risk of firing up the GOP based see your point yeah yes\nSo they already see that she comes back in she shows or face people get scared and panicked and concerned you know and they say I Can't let this happen again [laughter]\nSo hey whatever it takes I mean I I Would hope that people would be voting to continue that Trump's agenda but if a little fear ways in and get you there faster so be\nIt now what do you make of some on the left will use a Joe Scarborough over a long time was a Republican I guess he identifies now as an independent but he is no fan of Trump was for a while\nUh but former ... feelings hurt either gotta feelings hers girlfriends and his uh his sweet lady that as well but he he was out you said this on his show on MORNING Joe but he was on Kobe on CBS this week saying that he doesn't think\nThat Trump is going to run for reelection and twenty twenty he thinks he's going to kind of cash in cash out I did my thing I gave you a term I'm Out\nDo you think that's a possibility of Trump not seeking reelection\nOh no [laughter] no Joe Scarborough or is just he wants to remain relevant and somehow so we've got to throw out an odd ball\nTheory yeah and see if it sticks right just last night Trump was at ... in Montana and he's already referring to twenty twenty showing a neat talking about what he's going to do and how he's gonna you know go back and you know run for reelection so I don't see\nThat the hat I Want to have or want to see the slogan is make America great again\nAgain [laughter]\nNeither have I don't know when they're going to switch to this other one keep America great because magma has really caught on and I don't think you can slow it down right I really don't think they're just going to have to keep it up because keg\nThat doesn't want to go to work at all
