House the Nixon White House special counsel\nThis fall from power was sudden and it was hard you ended up in federal prison he was one of the Watergate seven\nThat's a good part of this story the beautiful part of the stories what happened after you ended up receiving the presidential citizens metal in two thousand eight the second highest honor and the land for civilians you'll hear how you'll hear the entire remarkable redemption story of Chuck wholesome\nChuck was born in Boston in Nineteen thirty one to a family with old school American values some would say classic American values let's take a listen to Chuck\nAnd I'd been phrase this way I did a marine officer I learned about duty and honor I learned about integrity is a marine and as a kid growing up in the depression and tough economic times my dad was going to school at night studying to be a lawyer and I ... and he was working days but on\nThe weekends he spent some time with me is a tough one thing I always tell the truth and never lie when you work work as hard as you possibly can the mode of what it is even use the example cleaning toilets he said no matter what you do it do it will\nEarn you pay to a hard day's work for an honest day's pay pay your bills I mean I was steeped in what we knew was pure work ethic and I'm being honest uh this was a big thing with the\nSo young Chuck was learning what almost every American was learning back in that day there was a sort of a common culture and the people from all over different parts of Europe and all over the world but these were pretty much the things that we all took his true\nCharleston started out as a young hot shot his friend Eric my taxes even described him as a wonder kind here's Chuck on this early time\nMy early years it was the first\nPerson in my family or to go to college I thought if I could get to college and I don't want a scholarship at Brown university\nWatching his office one day and still feeling kind of empty and\nI looked at him and he was a completely different guys got like myself report this way up the hard way self made man\nBecame a hell of a CEO others corporation when he was barely forty years old a dynamic guy\nAnd he was at peace and he started asking you about my family I find that said don't Tom you've changed since I saw you four years ago he said yes I have a job\nAnd then he looked up at the clock and he didn't look nice right now but he said as accepted Jesus Christ and committed by life too\nI got to tell you a good people I took it for a grip on the bottom chair I'd never heard anyone talk like that I grew up in that vast Unitarian wasteland of New England I never heard the gospel I never heard anybody talk about Christ as a as a person I'd gone to Sunday school and learn to all the lessons you learned in Sunday school but it didn't mean anything\nHe looked away as I later found out because he never done this with anyone before it\nI thought about that for the next three months and I couldn't get a lot of my life and and so I went back to ... in August of Nineteen Seventy three and I was a time you got to explain this to me\nAnd he said before I Do I Want to rejoin chapter from a book chapter I'd recommend for all of you particularly because you're Taipei high achievers you wouldn't be a Columbia rather was\nAnd I uh uh he read to me the chapter from cs Lewis says Mira Christianity entitled the great\nAnd I I'm a he read to me the chapter from cs Lewis says Mira Christianity entitled the great\nVice great Sam\nProbably not as always looking through life looking down on other people and things and therefore kept seeing something above themselves measurably slippery it God\nI listen to this chapter and she goes for us if you know on the Oxford dean who was a great Christian apologist as well as the great professor of medieval literature\nI listen to that and I realized he was running about me\nI thought I'd done all these good things because I wanted to\nServe my country and I wanted to be a success that my profession and\nIt was really all about me\nAnd I was up there that night in pain listening to that chapter\nAnd I'm Tom told me how we'd gone forward and saying here in New York with Billy Graham preaching and given his life to Christ\nAnd I was really moved he wanted to pray with me and I said no I I remember a parade except on the church so he probably but that might he\nHe told me of his own experience when he gave us like to Christ and here I was the tough guy and\nI don't think I'd ever cried or I'd love to know if I did I left his home that night\nI look back and I got into the automobile and I tried to drive away but I could not\nBecause the tough guy was crying too hard I couldn't see the rodents Ronnie ... pulled over and sat there I have no idea for how long\nWe used to now maybe longer\nThinking about could there be a God that is if the work that I Know him\nAnd I just called out to them I don't know any of the words I'd never seen any brochures about other ... I never knew that was such a thing about organized Christianity except once in awhile been dragged to church as a kid\nBut that night for the first time in my life I was sure those ...\nAre we sure he was hearing me\nI woke up the next morning figured I was going to be embarrassed and is that I couldn't wait to get my hands on ... and read it from cover to cover it\nAnd I can only tell you that but did it for me to forty two years without God and same chapter and that's where I almost wasn't going to be able to speak after that I'd not heard that clip of for\nI mean if you are struggling with pride pick up near Christianity it'll whack you over the side of the end\nSo you're taking that first step in his Christian walk but if it was so lonely first up is author Erik ma taxes who wrote the

dirty politics that this guy became a Christian and nobody would believe that she became a Christian and because I knew him personally I can tell you this man was the real deal\nWell a lot of people

because that was part of God's convicting me of my own past in my own sons and\nGiving me a new life and the crisis\nAnd that's a remarkable what he was grateful he was grateful that leaves and they have to pay his dues and he was grateful that he was humble and without that conviction who knows what happened the troublesome and look at all the things that would not have happened\n\nThis is something for all of us to remember in our own trying times remember that there's a purpose in them it's happening for a reason hard to understand when it's happening it's happening all of us stopping and many of you right now you're wondering why is this happening to me\nThat his lawyers encourage them to stray from the new person you\nBecome boy those lawyers will always get you in a gym with yourself here's our protectors again\nHis lawyer he had a pretty good lawyer says guess what check I got ya a plea bargain you're not going to have to go to jail all you have to do is say you did something you didn't do but don't worry about it you just you know play the game and you won't go to jail or Chuck ah because he became a Christian\nAnd because he actually took it seriously said um yeah I Can't do that I'm not gonna lie or if I have to go to jail I'll go to jail\nHis his lawyer I and I I tell this in in the book\nWent crazy he said you don't understand ... ... ... you take the plea shut up and take the plea bargain Chuck refuses\nChuck refused again the new man has to do things differently and not with the lawyers say not what the lawyers say Carlson knew he didn't have\nAny culpability with the Watergate scandal but he also knew any soul\nHe wasn't guilt free and his face wouldn't let him walk away from that fact\nI got back to Washington and I realized I was guilty as one of these and other sort of being a little bit with the prosecutors and I just it was forty four times on the roof\nAnd one day I realized I got to put an end of this and so I took the one thing actually or something I hadn't been charged with what does that resonate with just one day and there's no deal is no bargains this was something I did all plead guilty and want to get it then\nAnd when we come back well you're going to hear even more this riveting story is Chuck ... who is going to face prison time and far away from home in Alabama of all places\nBarry ... who is

campfire atmosphere with friends and brought to your ears wherever you are\nBible embraces both\nThe only one that is filled with grace and six restoration\nIs the Christian view of justice\nIndeed indeed\nAnd let's see how Carlson actually put this biblical approach towards incarceration into practice\nI saw the toughest in NATO was in Washington state prison system he'd been known in California is that most incorrigible in late in the state of California\nI met him when I was in the wall to wall a prison in the state of Washington more than it was about to erupt in a riot because the inmates were rioting over the fact that they've been locked in their cells for nine months because ten guards had been murdered over twelve month period it was the most brutal place I've been in my life\nAnd I came into a room just watch like that's the only in prison\nAbout the same number of people a few hundred scattered around the room\nNo guards came that one guard you know they took his jacket also wasn't on ...\nAnd I've talked to these guys about what had happened to me in person I talked to them about what Christ could mean to them\nAnd the guy sitting down front the toughest of the tough\nLooked at me and they came up to me afterwards and he said\nI think you're for real these laughing back\nI was I was glad he thought I was real and he said would you come in here and help us\nAnd so we started going in that person\nHe was converted his name was done done at sea was converted\nWhen he was released from prison he came with us and he spent ten years before he died working with kids on the streets of Dallas texas\nThat's something worth getting up poor in the morning\nThat gives us a reason for a living\nBecause something somehow some way each day I might be able to advance the kingdom and serve Christ's calling\nAnd that's it wanted to read a bit from Eric my taxes on coal since conversion and all the convergence he worked on the rest of his life\nQuote and the

I had my flag on a teacher's desk and the teacher said watch this thing on my desk\nAnd so I got up and I approached the desk and I'm shaking like elite and he said why you got too many stars you don't even know how many states we have\nTo understand everything that was going on\nAnd take a call like in my strike\n\nThat was on a relatively good day at the infamous Auschwitz concentration camp in Nineteen forty two in the words of the only known person to have ever volunteer to be a prisoner there his name was v told ...\nThey told Polanski's family going back as far as his great grandparents were ... and the side of the SARS regime in Russia which at occupy Poland along with Austria Hungary and pressure since the Seventeen Ninety\nBecause of their opposition to the tyranny of the ... the family was exiled seven hundred miles to the northeast of St Petersburg in Russia\nSo for several generations this polish family was not on polish soil or they were exiled five is art to a place that they were completely unfamiliar with Polanski himself was born in Russia in a small village called all and that's but he always felt\nThat Poland was his home and would someday be his home\nIn Nineteen eighty when World War one came to a close Poland\nWas a re carved as a country and re feared on the maps and the first time in a hundred and twenty three years but immediately and the Russians under the new regime of flooding Marilyn and in his ... invaded polling they did not want to give it up so to secure polish independence that at\nLeast for the moment was on paper\n... while they were still a teenager in so many other brave polls had to pick up arms against the ... and in a three year war they were successful and expelling them and London had\nTo bring the troops back home so it wasn't until Nineteen Twenty one that you could say Poland had indeed secured its independence as a nation for the first time\nSo Polanski settled down and raised a family and painted [noise]\nThere was no indication that Poland's independence was going\nTo be threatened again only in the late Nineteen thirties says Hitler began the rental saber did it seem as though there could be yet another war but still\nOn the eve of it lots of people didn't see it coming we had the Munich Agreement that was agreed to in September of thirty eight that basically said hey everything's fine that we have to deal with Hitler and as long as he doesn't go any further uh there'll be peace in the world so\nThere was a long period of almost Twenty years when Poland was free of\nConflict but it came on them with great ferocity when the Nazis invaded from the west and the\nSoviets a couple of weeks later invaded from the east in September of Nineteen thirty nine [noise]\nWas tremendous resistance from the polls\nAnd when we Slater invaded from the east in September of Nineteen thirty nine\nThere was tremendous resistance from the polls suddenly the polish army but an underground resistance that arose pretty quickly so the Nazis and the Soviet never had a quiet day\nPolls were have always been courageous people who don't take tyranny lying down and they've resisted in every way imaginable does the landscape was one of them along with another gentleman he cofounded a resistance movements and\nVery bravely [noise]\nIn Nineteen forty after a year of fighting ... realize that something was going on after the sprawling complex near ... that would become known as the outfits concentration camps in wasn't yet the notorious death camp there was so easy to come\nBut ... men to realize that many people were being taken they're not just Jewish people and they wanted to know what's happening there and they felt that or whatever it was the world needed to know about it so Polanski\nVolunteers to get arrested five the Germans in the hope that they wouldn't shoot him that they would in fact sending to outfits and of course there was no guarantee that they wouldn't simply kill him on the spot\nAnd no guarantee that they were sending outfits\nThere were periodic round up by the German polish citizens and in one particular round up for some two thousand or he simply walked into it and was one of those two thousand people arrested by the Germans\nAnd he did not supply has proper\nIdentity papers she had them forged ahead of time and that was largely to protect his family did not want his name or his activities be traced back and make them the objects of any reprisals by the Nazis\nDid you told wife know about and approve of him doing all of that\nShe fully supportive what he was doing knowing full well what is it an enormous risk it was probably expected to never see him again but he got his wish and after an interrogation and being wrapped up he was sentenced to ... he was out Schmitz inmate number forty eight fifty nine\nUnless we knew what he was sentenced there than it was a place with no good but it would be the next two to three years went outfits really blossomed into this ghastly concentration camp that the world\nNow knows upwards of two million people ultimately would be killed al ... [noise]\n\nI'm sure that Polanski had to think long and hard about how to get information out I mean he was stealing documents along with others that he recruited into his movement whenever they could\nA movement that he built up to more than one now things are actually died off [noise]\nAnd then they had to find some way to get them out there were a hundred and forty one people\nWho did manage to escape and some of those were people that Polanski had recruited and he was sending material with them\nBut Poland feed the on switch volunteered didn't try to escape you had\nMore work to do\nThere was a time in Nineteen forty two\nWhen Polanski and some of his closest confidant in the resistance movement were able to rebuild the remnants of a radio transmitter with various spare parts and things that they could find around the camp to the point where they were actually able to broadcast and for about a six month period\nThe transmitter with her as spare parts and things that they could find around the camp to the point where they were actually able to broadcast and for about a six month period they were broadcasting from this crude radio transmitter from inside outfits when you're measuring hundreds and hundreds of guards on watch\nFully armed at any moment and they were in\nPower to shoot us I suspect that anything and yet this man and his men were able to get information out those reports along with the documents he smuggled out\nAnd the testimony from people\nWho escaped became known as the told to report the most comprehensive eyewitness accounts ever compiled of\nThe happenings inside the outfits concentration in [noise] I'm sure that the polish resistance\nHad to find it incredibly inspiring to think that one of the road was on the inside and was getting this information out that it was reaching the capitals of the allies Asians and this had to be an incredibly inspirational things to\nJust imagine if the office it was the case if they'd never heard anything from it you have no information was getting out [noise] that would have been tremendously demoralizing\nWould have said hey there's no hope\nBut the fact that he was active and busy and hadn't given often was getting this information\nHad to be a great inspiration [noise]\nTo be told what his report had done his part\nIt was over one hundred pages long and reported that where he was was like another planet there were sterilization experiments going on there were three criminal tore up with the gas chambers that we're able to burn eight thousand people daily\nAt one point he writes about some recently murdered Jews quote from the new transports over a thousand a day work gap\nBritish officials received this report and found it so shocking that they didn't believe in thing to themselves and why would the Germans who shot in star Jews on a daily basis put in all this effort they thought it was an exaggeration from a desperate for some\nGovernment who was seeking more help from me ally it wasn't what they found a reporter way that they know that there was no indication\nAs to which reliability\nThe Nazis so took his report seriously [noise] they just didn't know it was [noise]\nAnd when we come back we're going to continue with the story of each told Polanski and by the way we tell these stories for an important reason a recent survey found two thirds of millennials don't know what House with his it's unimaginable folks\nAnd that's why we do these stories and why we partner with the U.S the Shoah foundation to broadcast they're incredible archive of fifty five thousand video testimony from survivors witnesses and perpetrators of the Holocaust and of course it was a government [noise] the ... the German government and when we come back\nMore a veto Polanski story here on our American story [noise]\nHear a lot about Hillsdale College here on our American stories it's a special place which students study all the things that matter in life\nThe imitation of Christ\nPolanski was a devout Catholic the very end\nOn the day of execution in May of Nineteen forty five may twenty five in fact his last words were recorded as long live free Poland and that certainly was the model by which he lived his life\nFrom the day he joined the polish army at the age of Seventeen ... the man was absolutely fearless and totally committed he endured unspeakable cruelty and hardships\nAnd all because he wanted his country to be free free free foreign invasions free from a tyrannical government said even though we had a family to think about\nUh his first love I think was freedom for\nNot only his family but all of his native country of Poland and I have just enormous respect for that\nWorld War two with Poland being a communist country now governed by a puppet Soviet regime really the story of ...\nAfter World War two with Poland being a communist country now governed\nBy a puppet Soviet regime really the story of Polanski was suppressed\nAnd the reason was the polish communist government knew that you couldn't tell the story the full story of the toll Polanski\nWithout revealing what he had done after the time that he resisted the Nazi so they they would have loved to have had this story told\nOf what he had done to resist the German\nBut of course everybody would then ask for what did you do afterwards and then you'd have to tell the story of the fact that he was against the tyranny of the Soviet Union to it was against the communist regime so instead of having any of that story being told they decreed that his very nice cannot be spoken in public his own family\nWere advised by the government that they could be federalized wouldn't be finalized jail if they spoke of the top ... in public it wasn't until

can be blood pressure issues that are going on but usually that comes from your dream Austin in having that checked out with your doctor smart thing to do I would definitely go in and have them run some additional test and make sure that everything checked out okay\nBut then again the business could come from a host of other issues are meant to be blood sugar level issues that could be anemia there could be a lot of could these [laughter] so I don't like doing could be just one of the testing is important to go to your family dog and have them do it\nCould be a lot of could these [laughter] so I don't like to go on to these that's why the testing is important is to go to your family dog and have them do any necessary test and that can be quite helpful because once they find out where any of these weak areas might be\nThen they can come up with with a really good plan that were you when it comes first because even if it's something simple like blood sugar related issues or or something of that nature that can be corrected pretty easily but you definitely want to rule that out\nSo they can no because you don't want to be stuck in and be dealing with something that that could be a little bit more serious always good to have that with that for sure right thanks for the call triple eight to eight three Seventy seven to give us a call Rebecca\nIn Dallas texas and

might want to look into another couple of things such as if you're if you're dealing with the ankle and it's not responding well there's a laser therapy\nThat can be very very helpful and getting the laser therapy done most doctors carry that and their office now a lot of the sports medicine doctors will and also physical therapist will keep that in their\nLocations as well so yeah I Would just look into that\nAnd see if you can find someone that's kind of up to speed\nOn a lot of it and then build against our game plan from there because it you got to have that treatment\nWhen certain joins

eating habits that's the first place you want to go\nSo eating the right kinds of foods on a regular basis is an absolute key and cutting you know all the reds and the pastas and materials and the crackers cutting that out\nAnd then of course keep you healthy fats up in your lien quality proteins up chicken fish ... all that can be helpful in law and the information but given your body the nutrition that it needs to thrive and that's really what you want to focus on his keeping\nThe body functioning at a peak level and with arthritis depending on what kind is is that what you want to look at those go there first to have someone like a nice fishing or nutritionist work with you\nOf all in with arthritis in what kind it is when you look at that was the first to have someone like a
