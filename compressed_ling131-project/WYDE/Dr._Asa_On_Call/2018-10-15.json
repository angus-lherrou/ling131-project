October the twenty first though\nSo that it has to come and her wife yeah just a week or so well I I was first introduced to your orchard back in the early nineties when I worked for microwaves that raised peach farm up there and heart and soul and we used to\nBuy some apples for your from your for the fruit stand and uh just I've been impressed with your price for you know over over Twenty years for sure tell us a little bit about your family form there how long has it been in existence and and how big a price or your foreman\nWell currently I'm as to how we have a just a little under three hundred acres wow um\nWe we try to vote at least fifty to sixty acres to teachers\nAnd about forty to apple ... wow and then the reminder the ground is an rotation between various crops or then again it's like every other farms them I was just out in the world\nAgain even more folks have no idea how much ah fifty to sixty acres of pages in\nForty acres of apples is I mean that is well that's a lot of grain\nWhen we do not plan how dance today or you can go up\nIn northeastern in parts of the and especially at ... state where they\nA ... minute northeastern empowered said the and especially at Morgan State where they they really intensified\nMaybe they're doing a thousand Fifteen hundred trees per acre while um but uh it's very labor intensive and the trees can get away from me in a hurry I'm we still use a modified\nCentral later and our our tree a dance the is about a hundred and ten trees per acre\nOkay every one of those every one of those beautiful trees has to be ... by hand and picked by hand and [laughter] Koreans corrects\nAnd if it's a big ... page crowd they had to be playing by hanging on rye so a lot of people don't realize that the fact that you have people say oh my pages they're hardly biggest golf ball this year well if you don't pull any else that's that's his biggest they're going to get you know the apple space that's right and I know\nYou can you can sell one large page while you're trying to give away two little ones [laughter]\nShe's like\nThem for all of our power farmers' market bugs around and say well how long has your family been there when we talked about this I was really surprised at how long you been farming that we\nWe have of course you know a as anywhere in the south you know we started out as an agrarian society to begin with so you're either a farm or a bank or a lawyer you know but you know in our early ... right\nAnd uh we first came into this county in the early Eighteen\nHundreds the around I think fourteen I think if teams they're more in that neighborhood right are we there was a large group of our some senior at one time there were at least Seventy a bill I sometimes uh at the turn of the century you know several different just the bills right up but we're down to the life family here now no wild yeah\nPart part of the arm or my grandfather believe it or not was born in Nineteen eighty nine [laughter]\nAnd so in my diet is only two generations away from the civil war right anyway\nUm ... land from his father and Nineteen a living and we still\nCurrently on that land now how far back uh hey you know when he had initially\nParcels that land I Can't tell you for sure because the records have been lost down there right now man here while\nYou're your father ... Mr Joe he he really started planting a lot of those fruit trees Disney\nThat's correct or he works um he was like everybody else he wanted to get off the farm you know right now and work your job or two here or there and the guy down with more than ... mix and rocket fuel in the late fifties early sixties than a\nCourse green day to continue to disarm and uh\nOh he went to a couple of layoffs you know I'm ... I'm Out and I say well you can stay with us if you moved to Georgia and you know this\nAnd that and so he hates I'd try his hand it teaches so his first orchard was set out and pay the seven ... grand day they had a few\nPastries but he never had more than just two or three acres at a time right and we set our first apples than a Nineteen sixty six\n... when I started poultry south dot com and two

and\nYou know I Can't wait to talk about yeah absolutely well I'm excited to have Mr David Morris with the American chestnut foundation on the phone with us Mr Moore's how are you today\nI'm doing very well thank you for having me\nOh yes sir thank you so much for being on the show and ah and and you really do a you're involved with an organization that that is a ... a fascinating subject because ah American chestnut used to dominate the the landscape uh in the Appalachians in and even down in our state\nUh but before we jump into that Mr Moore's tell us about yourself and how you got involved with the chess no foundation\nFor sure [noise] um I live in a life and I live in Chelsea, Alabama a then and now that I'm most of my life oh we're both retired now and I retired about four years ago I worked as an\nEnvironmental engineer for about forty years okay and that started working with the chest ... in two thousand\nAnd during that period from out two thousand more on the two thousand five there were\nA group in northwest Alabama there were interested in the ... just in order to work in the warm up that's out there and so I was involved with al yeah oh yeah when I was in a chapter ... thousand uh\nOkay so what is the American chestnut foundation what for those of us that aren't real familiar with it what is the mission and vision of what you're doing\nOkay that American chestnut foundation it's a nonprofit oh it was that said quote dirty Nashville North Carolina I'm six things regional chapters including Alabama\nAnd it was formed in Nineteen eighty three different scientists\nHad watched after bring back the chestnut well I'll let you down but that's all\nThey sound like they could bring back the Bible is that's that's not a conventional breeding met a man of Charles Burnham a method called back calls Brady and\nThat's why I really only\nFoundation started yeah the mission is really not all that to your store the Americans just know the eastern part of the U.S the okay ideas that produce the ball I resent tree they can and grow and wait for days or a\n... or ... say\nWell tell us about the American chestnut I you know a lot of our listeners have heard that name\nIt's hard to say\nRight well tell us about the American chestnut I you know a lot of our listeners have heard that name before but that may not be familiar with with things about the tree and then the blight also that affected it\nSure I'm American chestnut it as you mentioned when ... was it was the dominant in the eastern shore is something people even call it ran would look to the east right now it was so\nGreat orange tree that grows to over a hundred and ... oh they're the diameter they were a major source of a warmer or a shelter and and for\nLots of different uses it was called\nThe cradle to grave trade people what we have from cradle to get that people were very right and then all of you know the guy is so\nIt was very important region a not for a very important people even turn on their ... in all the them that's not you know\nI'm In ... Marshall by make it other than that for for food and also the Atkins bum you stand them into the city is Val I'm right\nI'm Mr motion and most of our listeners or you know are probably just when I think about justice or thinking about the Chinese chestnut that they that they've seen in St planted or a lot of hundreds of wildlife and threw juice you know plant Chinese just much explain Canada different genetic down there but Chinese or a whole lot smaller but just just kind of give a difference in those trees\nOkay the um [noise] the Chinese tree is ... ... ... ... and that's mark an apple\nTree in terms of its shape and it's really been bred\nOh for commercial on for for them for that I mean it is a lot a lot of what a larger than my daddy along in the American lives a little while trade is baller stranger on\nWas it was um you know more more prevalent in while sitting right and\nYeah it's it's always been fascinating to me to see the old the old photographs of a you know I Love the\nThe Appalachian south and I've got to get we got a cabin up close to ... my wife and I do a lot of time and the national forest and\nAnd it's really interesting I've seen some old pictures around there of the of the trees are I guess in the spring when they would bloom and it looked like snow fall you know on the on some of the hillsides they're really amazing\nIt here and there were quite ... of them and that that was a script you know I've seen those descriptions to it [laughter] it's almost like\nNinety eight is why it just we we can't gain perspective for had ... which is really amazing\nWell and that's I I have heard it said that one out of every four one out of every five trees and the Appalachian Mountains was a un American chestnut so I don't know if that's accurate or not but that's a lot and I I when I was in college I took an Appalachian ecology class in the ...\nAnd we went up and found places where chestnuts had been cutting the stumps were still there and it was amazing how big some of these stumps arm and then you can still get up on her organic perspective of how big the trees are\nAnd it's a ... you know it it was a shame for sure to lose all of those trees in and tell us about the blight described the blight to us\nBut the blind or what was in the St accidentally through um\nThe by two as well so\nLong ago was the easiest accidentally through you know\nSome panic little specimens that were brought into the country a first appeared in New York so logical part which has now no one wants to say\nBut in Nineteen oh chore curator at the latest yeah a lot of his ... and trees were were dying or some kind of disease that she didn't recognize the video that it's done in a\nIn a couple of years almost all trees and and the park had died and so\nI'm able to accidentally interviews from from Asia probably the um some plants that were brought over from China and Japan him\nUp in my current thinking is there any from Japan but it spread very quickly um down even into the deep south the rate of about it you know I don't think we're while until in the forties and fifties um did you\nHit the deepest part of the south and killed all electricity back on ...\nWow well I I haven't heard a debt in two thousand five or two thousand six somewhere and there are there were one or more trees found in the Talladega ranger district the Talladega national forest is is that right\nAnd typically during the summertime yeah I Know they're still trying to get some last minute spring done now\nUm but generally late summer early early fall typically\nThe general area when you're a spray and then what you want to do they weren't allowed to about six or eight weeks or so just letting letting those chemicals are absorbing the root system um and really get a good kill\nA owned the vegetation that has grown up since the temperature was harvest a harvest it um and then after that typically in October November maybe early December\nUm is typically when you you burn burn off all of that debris all that slash those towels tops\nAnd um and have a good fire that'll that'll carry 'em through the property and it's important to ah if I might\nDo you want to spray you want to have a good stand of natural vegetation coming back you want this week downs to come by those those briar patch is those kinds of things you won't those to come back that way when you spray you get a good bang for your book when you spray it and that is right there dirt right yeah so as far as planning\nA once you spray you burn it\nAre typically December January maybe first February somewhere in that time I'm as what you do your tree planet\nAnd um you wanna you'd like to get it done and as soon as as soon as you can December January and then ah just ah hopefully have a good wet spring that way those literally a root systems and started Gil established right um during the ...\nYeah and all you're trying to do is to give those are new seedlings the best chance they can to out compete all the other stuff that's naturally going to grow and then hope that their water to and so I mean that's in that essentially what you're trying to do\nIt is you want to get on the best chance of survival and have the highest you know when you put those trees in the ground\nAnd I'm just trying to do everything you know as soon as you can with a good uh early spring rain from Mother Nature and uh and it ... typically in the states we just kind of walk away from it for\nTen twelve fourteen years yeah a long way to all different you know with fire regimens and everything but um ... which is what you see a lot in the south now the planet I'm you typically uh once you do that you're you're good to go for a while\nOh yeah how are you folks to if you if you've got some timber and last year or two um now you need to strongly consider you know spending this money and replace your property\nKnow ... we we we don't have time to get into the to the yield curve but you're you know if you just look at the numbers of what you are you going to be with with a a property bitch that's been replaying it and managed in in sight brampton chemically treated and burn\nYou yield over the long haul was going to be way way way way higher\nMaybe two to three times as high as it just it just an actress name brand real quick before we get off the air yeah you were really sharing a compelling story with me about you know about him\nIs it just just an actress name brand real quick before you know be a year you know you were really sharing a compelling story with me about you know about helping helping somebody with a timber sales mission tell us about that\nYeah I was reaching out or reached out to a client or you have reached out to me and I'm\nSomeone looking to do something with their property and um you know from cell and that didn't know if I wanted to sell it or cut the timber\nAnd um I've taught what this gentleman for a a couple of months and uh right now he's decided who wants to do something with the timbre of its own this property and um it's roughly the but the temperature is roughly about a hundred acres and um\nTold me that a hit\nOr

a per unit pipes sale and he's won the clear cut everything\nAnd all the ... per unit type sale and ah he was telling me some of the prices that he was offered and I told him that they were low uh Reilly as good as horrible it is you know right now and everything and\nYou know in one case it was you know over half of what kind of what's going on right now and I lost a lot of ...\nOh yeah and

feel good to be able to help someone in that situation who\nUm may not have gotten paid for everything you know what the proper ... the trees were right and um\nAnd that's what we do they know

that they're getting the word cautiously optimistic oh you know they they like what they're seeing so far\nMean you know as so many things to being on its board of ... yeah and uh you know we don't know how some of the things that don't work out but but everyone feels about it and as so\nOften is with the economy which is reality yeah or if we if we really go\nBack and just look at things you know what the white people playing and and how they're feeling has as much to do with how our economic ill as anything else in the world and\nYou know as far as our farm sector or the people that are driver they're\nThey're they're pretty much in favor of curl up in his policy yeah you know we might have some heartburn here in their own different thing but as as a general rule uh everyone is on board with the policies of the perception is good\nOh one of the things that I Would kind of point to the fact that ... ... ... for a month of August all\nTime record the thirty dollars\nMore ahead a in two thousand I thing and he was out the thing so uh if there's some things that are really pushing the economy that one\nWell that's I don't think I mean I don't think I needed to the moon in

make David Jake or am I going to happen so those those are the two best minds in the business\nOr sparse board ops go and they're going to take on the guy who me\nAbout the other but we're not yeah I don't really know that you know I'm just ... you know the more of your reduce cash well\n\nBoeing were just for the board out there you go on to say I'm ... well you know there are things are true\nSee that guy ever\nUm but yeah if you guys want to stop I Do make it happen or I'll put some stuff on their Facebook page with the address I think I already have I think I posted a link to where we're going to be at so y'all come down here\nAnd see if we got plenty of news to to talk about today I mean off the top you've got a\nThe hurricane Michael updates it's up to Thirteen people have been killed a cross that path or\nIf I'm not mistaken I don't know where the numbers are located but I Know just yesterday we were like two yeah and in this morning it was in Lebanon and now it's like Thirteen and this is all the way from Florida to the east coast\n\nThat everybody wake up like this this morning as Miller fridge and middle legalized\n\nLook for ...\nEverybody wake up like I did this morning and see the average middle equalize that several of the thirty nine people\nLook in the mirror America in two thousand Thirteen were sixty five thousand bridges that needed repairs\nIt's like buying a house she bought a house with us all to fixing it on\nEverybody wants to look like HDTV right shipping\nJoanna you always want to replace the fridge and the countertops but no one ever wants to change the route\nI'm not saying it's high ... if you moved into a house I needed a new roof\nOr new countertop what would you replace on\nAmerica that's not a big enough to wake up call to see of our infrastructure to be self and how you look at one point\nSixty five thousand villages\nTake a look around and count how many bridges\nEvery day for me five which she says new on superstation ... W why de\nDa de mille and I'm Jonathan good and we want to invite you to listen to our show the land show with David Johnny every Saturday morning\nJob than we have great gifts in regular segment talked about farmland timberland money properly rural tourism anything happen to live in\nAlabama ... view of land you'll love\nOur show this is the show for you to tune in every Saturday morning for the way and show with David Johnny liberalism show Saturday mornings at night\nWas the uh the the\nThe palace or whatever they call that thing is and they they killed him I haven't followed this story great well and we don't know for sure\nWe don't know what happened we just know we got video him going in and and he never came out right and so\nAnd they had a they have audio of him being killed\nThey're claiming the Saudis killed this guy because they had before them used to be a critic of the government and all this kind of stuff he he used to work directly I think what the crown prince ... or so we've got ties but then he went on the backside and criticize him and all that kind of stuff and then ended up coming to Washington Post reporter\nSomebody thought it was an idea to send them over there I guess to do some more reporting and now he's disappeared\nWhat what I heard was he actually was there to get a marriage license because he was about to get married and he's not an American citizen oh he's still a Saudi\nWhatever resident I guess that's what your citizen of Saudi Arabia right so he had to go in there to get his marriage license and apparently they knew about it or something of this is reporting that I heard\nAnd so once he got in there they kind of had it all set up to where they're going to take him down and then they just number to him and took his body up pieces allegedly allegedly nobody knows for sure and of course Trump's getting a lot of criticism for not\nComing out against Saudi Arabia but nothing's been confirmed yet\nGoal in for guys and if you remember back in your early twenties when you would get married they would compare that to the government oh right to you know a sort of like write one of the same uh that's too soon and I apologize I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC amid only give you the tweet that he sent out about this Fisher\n[noise] he said it would be nice to definitively rule out that the Saudis are paying the president massive bribes\nIn exchange for a approval for murdering critics so he is suggesting that it's possible Saudi Arabia is suffering Donald Trump's pockets with money\nSo he will look the other way when they murder of critics of their government wow such as this guy\nDoes it under the guise of well it'd be nice to rule it out but nobody went to this question right or really grow really\nWell and doesn't Trump path I mean there's some ... they played on MSNBC this morning where he had made some comment and this is way back when he was like a love the Saudis they paid me money all the time it's something I think God I got a hotel or something right or is deals with okay well that's what he's talking about so he's like of course I Love 'em and so they're taking that from way back when and throwing it into this story as though it's something\nHe sat at like yesterday ... well that's not true and the the the insinuation as what to do anything about it because he's got such a good relationship with these people in a financial mess that ah well in\nIn another uh aspect of this thing is the fact\nThat we've been rebuilding our relationship with Saudi Arabia we all remember the footage of Donald Trump dancing with the guys with all the swords yeah as you say oh let's just Saudi guys dance around with other turbans and that was nerve wracking and all of the things that's our president he's in the middle of all those guys there\nOh it's just Saudi guys dance around with other turbans and that was nerve wracking and all the things that's our president he's in the middle of all those guys they're swinging sort yeah I Know nobody seemed to care and then he's dancing around and they're all holding the orbit together and it was a\nIt was a coming together it really well and we ... all of France\nAnd now here we are now I Can't predict whether or not this will strain or put a halt to that relationship I Would hope that the assumptions and the reports that we have about what's happened to this guy or faults because you would have something like that to to be the\nEnd of the relationship or put our relationship back where it was yeah strain but at the end and not to give these guys a pass on it but when you deal with those kind of governments when you're dealing with the middle east we know that they do this ah yeah it just so happens\nThat this guy was considered an American even though he didn't have ... and ... he was a writer for the for the Washington Post so\nUltimately we consider him one of our guys\nSo that uh it's it's a different ball game when they murder one of our guys opposed to one of their well\nIf the Turks really do have the proof that they claim they have why don't they just released said they should but I mean what's holding them back I mean if there's some kind of political move that they're not are they just hoping that the string it out and make us look bad and well and understand there\nWhen it comes to turkey there's a lot of different political angles with with a lot of different countries for me to act like I'm educated on the relationship between where the political relationship between turkey and Saudi Arabia I Can't really speak to it all that much I Know the U.S relationship with Saudi\nAnd the US's relationship with turkey\nBut I don't know what the disconnect is there for them either they're talking smack or if they do have it why they're not given that I have no idea but that's something definitely to watch that we'll we'll be keeping our island back to hurricane Michael before we go to break a I saw\nA who was it Bill Nelson on Twitter posed this link in a tweet that was\nUrging people to donate supplies in money for hurricane relief and I I didn't think much of it I'm like okay this is Bill Nelson and bill Nelson's an idiot but he's a politician they did is kind of stuff's especially when it's his home state whatever whatever\nI go to the link and it's not a standard donation thing it's actually his campaign page what where you can\nDonate not just to the hurricane relief part that he set up but you could donate to his campaign as well oh yeah a little too far [laughter] it'll move to first so you go on there you think you're going to donate supplies and you end up on bill Nelson's reelection website can you imagine if Trump that that\nUh right they would lose their lines also another link on that page takes you to that Soros funded website\nAct blue which is an organization put together to is exclusively elect Democrats across the country so\nHe's gone and this is nothing new for Democrats we all know that they've been raised off of tragedy and whatever else whether I a a mass shooting and gun control and they campaign off that that that the cabinet stuff they try to raise money off that they do it anywhere they can\nBut it just seems like these people need to be called out for this stuff once and for all because I ... if they continue to get by with this stuff\n\nLet it slide\nOnce and for all because I ... if they continue to get by with this stuff\nLet it slide will complain about it but then just forget about it once the tragedies over with for the the the the donation\nProcess is done there's going to keep doing it well of course the work of it there's a real backlash were consequences involved to keep them for wanting to do it again I Know you're going to be excited about this but we're going to try and talk and we'll Kanye West line outside of the law and the only reason I Want to talk about this is because\nOf what I'm witness on cable TV on the mainstream media last night I was actually a poll for once Don Lemon uphold you know it's hard to believe that it happened\nTwo oh five nine four one one zero one one is the number don't want to call in hook it up causes a line that's W why on Facebook will be back right after this\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah that's not going to work that sounds really good and it doesn't it's good Paul I'm going to try this at the little poor here right and how we do the show where Iran here let's try that she just had foreign\nWinging it I can ... I can hear it but just barely well see if we can hit the volume there no that's us drone no that's that's what I was again okay well\nI don't know how to ... we'll figure it out at the bright\nCause I can barely hear yeah I don't think anybody else in here let's just let's just unplugging felt worth it was everything will be so ah well I don't know this is the first time I've ever tried this\nYeah well and now I think my headphones jacked up my only hear one side just wiggle that chord I think we I think we\nAre we good I think we're good okay [laughter] so shocked about okay so let me just tell you what women said he goes through and he talks about how this is a a a circus it's embarrassing\nIt's not just embarrassing for Americans for the best thing for African Americans in particular and he even brings up Kanye West dead mother why and says that his mother would be so embarrassed and rolling over in her grave\nBrings up Kanye West dead mother and said that his mother would be so embarrassed and rolling over in her grave if she could see her son at the White House acting the way he did\nThe funniest part of this as I was listening to Gina show last night and everybody was getting on there and talk about Kanye and whatever else one guy called in and I can't remember who it was like he literally sad\n... of a dear friend of Kanye West mother and she said I'm Sorry he knows somebody that knows calling us his mother drying up and he said he got word that Kanye West mom was completely embarrassed by that I watch this Kanye West\n\nI think that and we're back our we have no idea\n\nJay ...\n\n\n\nJust over ... miles off time she sees a painful injuries and she throwing the dishwasher\nI wake up I'm like I'm ready to throw it out homemade biscuits and like Mr Obama\nAnd I see no\nWork and I work for me to look in the dishwasher surely nobody's that sleep it's\nLet me stop you there trying to use your wife for your ex wife\nSwap ...
