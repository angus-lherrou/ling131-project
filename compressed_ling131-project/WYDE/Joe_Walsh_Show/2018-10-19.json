about what is wrong with me too movement and what is wrong with what is happening to Brett Kavanaugh right now here's the headline\nThe cabinet controversy is a meat to victory however it turns out\nOne more time Washington Post headline this morning the Kavanaugh controversy is Amy to victory however it turns out\nWow so it's a victory for me to no matter how it turns out\nSo it's a victory for me to Brett Kavanaugh did not do anything\nHe's been accused of doing\n\nIt say victory for me to if these women are line\nOr confused that's a victory for me to [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nSeriously that's a victory for me to if\nThese women who have all alleged that Kevin I did things\nIt's a victory if they're making everything up\nThat's me too is all about the truth doesn't matter that say exactly what that Washington Post headlines said this morning the truth it does not matter\n\nAnd you know what slaves me is the or the left Democrats rightly accuse President Trump of having a problem with the truth he does\nWell it seems to me that\nThe me too movement doesn't care about the truth either\n\nThis is a victory for me to\n\nJust taking Brett Kavanaugh down the facts be damned the truth be damned that's it\nIt just taking Brett Kavanaugh down the facts be damned the truth be damned that's a a that's a victory like me to\nWho would be proud of that\nAnd ah Brett Kavanaugh\nUm\nHe he does not matter here at all does he see clearly what where understanding more and more and more here and this headline\nReveals it more and more and more here it's clearly not about Brett Kavanaugh and what he might have done thirty five years to go\nTo any woman it's clearly not about that again from the meat to perspective\nIt's all about being able to say in general that women are good there to be believed men are bad they're not to be believed\nIt's not about this case\nI mean that that headline makes clear no matter how this thing turns out me to baby the me too movement one\nJust taking down another man\nThat's what this article in the Washington Post today is saying just the act of taking down another man\nWhether that man deserved to go down or not whether that man did anything wrong more not none of that matters at all I guess the me too movement is all about just taking men down\nPeriod period\nCabinet Brett Kavanaugh collateral damage big what he he got caught up in the battle he got caught up in the hurricane men don't care about him any\n\nEight five five six for two fifty six hundred\n\nYou see what I mean about the ... since of any balance you we've heard United States sends or speak this way\nIt doesn't matter if he did it or not he needs to be stopped I heard yesterday or over the weekend\nWoman say this is about whether we're going to believe all women are not this Brett Kavanaugh saying\nIt's about whether we are going to believe all women are not and I I think I screamed at my TV no it's not it's about whether we're going to believe a doctor Christine Ford or not\nIt's about whether we believe her or not period it's not about whether we believe all women one man has been accused of doing something\nIt's not about whether we believe all women one man has been accused of doing something\n\nEight five five six for two fifty six hundred\nAnd I I guess the point I'm trying to make here is that what you and I think has fed up as we are with this whole freaking situation\nAt the end of the day you and I know it's\nIt's about it should be about whether Brett Kevin I did what he was alleged to have done thirty five years ago now I I Know like I don't even care about that and I know most to you don't either I'd confirmed than they should be on the Supreme Court right now but if you did care about it\nAll you care about is did he do it or not did he did he do it or not\nPlain and simple when you make it\nAbsolutely plain and simple when you make it more difficult for a cop to do his job crime goes up\nAnd involved in most of these major cities we're talking about black on black crime we're talking about black lives being lost\nYou know the irony it's mostly the black communities in the cities who protest and hate

bringing to close the Saudi Arabia they didn't say anything well Bob and what they're about to their key they didn't say anything when they were growing danger also offer buildings\nAnd they were given tens of millions of dollars to to the Clinton Foundation than they were fun people my\nOther just want to use which is a Web trees you will be prudish\nThings idiot Democrats in Chicago\nAnd the

don't want to talk about what I don't want to talk about that it's not about the one guy to me it's about Trump Trump is following through on Obama's policy see we pretend there's this huge difference\nI Want to talk about that it's not about the one guy to me it's about Trump Trump is following through on Obama's policy see we pretend there's this huge difference there isn't Obama was interested in protecting billions of dollars of weapons sales to the Saudis that's what I Want to talk about\nUnderstand and we're going to have a guest on at a uh five thirty five and I'm really looking forward to my choices ... my my point is it's a false choice to choose the Muslim Brotherhood who is fighting for theocracy versus a tyrannical monarch\nThat we have cozy up to that has stabbed us in the back for Fifteen Years they are funding all of our enemies\nFrom Afghanistan to China to everybody in between they in fact they threatened Trump today or through the print by four hundred dollar a barrel oil by saying that they will conclude with Iran who supposedly they're sworn enemy\nThe point is to recognize that this ideology itself is our enemy to break the middle east by becoming completely energy independent which we could do overnight\nAnd we refuse to do with why because there was a money flow to politicians from the Saudis there is a money flow from the old ... countries there was a money flow from the European Union it's about enriching the politicians who pretend to be representative when they're not\nThe represent themselves or give me a gym we got one

their negotiations whatever they're doing well while they're there the Marines are garden all the classified material and we're in a pretty nice palace and this palace there's gold everywhere sure\nOkay the only ... ... it's about four or five days after the whole thing to which leaves all the secret service guys when the guys that don't travel with him yeah they stay behind they have what's called the wheels up parties oh\nSo they're all standing around we're getting ready to have this party and now you know Saudi Arabia's dry unless you're on the embassy compound shit\nLike Atlantic City ... ... and I get ya go ahead exactly uh-huh so\nWe're sitting there were packing up all the stuff with this palace that we're in and\nI Would yeah I guess I'd say a very high member of

ballroom press the button on the wall and a fully stocked huge bar comes up positive\nAnd ...\nAnd so as as awful as it is that's the set of choices that we I mean we can disengage completely from the middle east I suppose and say hell of a\nPolitical I Want to break academically syrup I'm so sorry I got a commercial but I got a little saying I'm gonna leave you with when you stand for nothing I

left your your current career\nAnd work I'm not talking about being up on a roofing roofing that's more of a young person's job but you know what I'm Talking about the idea that America has to import uh foreign workers to do every American job is lunacy\nI when I grew up we didn't need that probably didn't have that problem when I when I was growing up Americans did all sorts of jobs from picking a tobacco which my brother did to picking fruit which I did\nWho I mean all of us did all of this work in yeah if you have to pay more to get Americans to do these jobs good you should pay more and I told you when I was in Switzerland it was really interesting to talk to the Swiss about a Swiss jobs they don't do this big importation of laborers in Switzerland they don't do it\nThey then they actually people who do everything from sweeping the streets to caring for children they get paid for doing that work eight five five forty Laura let's go to Evie in Florida heavy\n[noise]\n[noise] Hi Laura I again I think on on with this than an American state situation as far as the border but at the you know an American citizens here I I don't want to just think that this voting is going to help what more can we do\nWell the border the border has to be in for\nYou know an American citizen here I I don't want to just think that this voting is gonna help what more can we do\nWell the border the border has to be enforced the president's right if these other countries won't enforce their borders we need to put a we need to put some thought into how we are going to better do it here and he's got a ... and if it's a national emergency the president has extraordinary powers\nAnd drugs guns or criminal element or gangs we've already caught them trying to get into the country and we've already arrested people who are within the so called migrant population\nWho are only coming into the United states to hook up again contacts we brought you story after story about that\nAnd this president understands that they this president gets this like no one else how many have you saw the frightening the frightening display last night on the ... it was called meet the chairman you remember that movie made the parents\nSo it was called meet the chairman and I went through chapter and verse what would happen to various committees and the house of representatives\nOr if Republicans lose control of the house and let me tell you something forget the new Jamie Lee Curtis rendition of Halloween the movie the most frightening thing you can imagine is what's\nGoing to happen to the financial services committee the house ways and Means Committee the Appropriations Committee the intel committee the energy committee\nIf the Democrats have their way five five forty Laura let's go to Eric in Michigan Eric go ahead\nI Believe that the easiest and quick solution to the border problem would be to open the home studying act to all of the federal I Am for rounding border and as you can make a structure dwelling a part of\nBeing able to get into the home studying act you could just as easily make it that they need to put up a barricade a fencing or whatever and with the ah that's already having a priority on any old studying at the open up\nYour could wind up with a lot of our own studying which would be helping all the American and at the same time\nPut one hell of a wall dollar\nAh another interesting idea well our our callers have more interesting ideas and most Republican or Democrat congressman Democrats just want an open border open borders open markets don't go after\n\nThe ... that are real life story from trinity debt management\nI had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't pay my bills I was feeling so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and contacted trinity\nAnd you I Can't blame illegal immigrants I mean I Can't even blame them because we did this to ourselves\nOther countries don't do this we we did this to ourselves\nBut now it's got to stop joining\nUs now Michael ... of course former Trump campaign advisor Republican political strategist he's involved in some of the key races\nIn New York he also has a great a podcast called still standing radio dot com so just go there are still standing radio dot com\nAnd you can listen to Michael who has a finger on the pulse of what's happening in this mid term cycle Michael it's great to talk to you I think the Democrats made a huge miscalculation and embracing these caravans of people who want to storm the border I think most people from all walks of life life across this country find now this is all a bridge too far\nIt is and I got to tell you I saw that Chris ... a prime time last night she Cortez as a warrior oh yeah we're here for the president he really is you know he he's a Latino and his president as parents\nCame here legally and he in doors so much for joining the president's policies including his immigration policies on CNN it's just amazing to me you know are pure on CNN often as well but I looked at as a model\nHe I Know when I get off CNN after defending the president\nI get so many threats some of the death threats I'm certain team gets the same kind of feedback from CNN viewers and yet he goes on every day swing and for the fences I'm so proud of him and you're right um but uh the ... the Democrats signed up for this and I think they're going to pay for it\nI think that again people who work hard for a living try and take care of the kids just\nAnd up for this and I think they're going to pay for it\nI think that again people who work hard for a living\nTry and take care of the kids just you know they don't have the money to send their kids to than the private schools they're just out in the country and they're working and they'd like to take a vacation every now and then and they see that the economy has improved so much under the president's leadership and then on the other side they see chaos\nIdentity politics constant cries of racism\nOr an embrace of illegality and and now open borders which is you know it's been the case for some time but now it's literally they want to open borders its it's beyond clear\nAnd I think it I think this blows up in the Democrats faces morning noon and night if the Republicans do the right thing here and hold on to this issue and actually pass legislation to stop this this is an emergency what's happening to this country\nTo learn the now with ... income and toward the border and I think the president is standing tall you know I I've been in politics since the Reagan Era and do you have to we first met in Washington back during the Reagan years and you know I worked for Jack Kemp and\nWas people like Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan stood up for this country\nAnd and had backbone and unfortunately over the years we really haven't had a president\nLike Donald Trump and have backbone and would never have stood up to these caravans coming up against the border would never have stood up for justice Brett Kavanaugh and you saw what happened when the president said simply nope I'm not looking at another another nominee you're going to have to approve\nA confirmed a Brett Kavanaugh we saw spines grow in senators we didn't even think Adam any re Lindsey Graham was a hero\nOf German Grassley a hero Susan Collins a hero in all emanates\nFrom the strength in the White House and the immigration issue you know he has not backed down you remember when he came down the stairway in Trump Tower and then his speech which shocked everyone he promised starts the word and they tried to conflate like you mentioned\nUh illegal immigration with immigration and they've tried to do that\nOver and over and over again and they're still doing it today but it's not working because the average man and woman working every day in America you know taking their lunch buckets of work\nYou know dropping their kids off at school they understand the difference between somebody who jumped the border fence and somebody who comes here and stand in line and does it legally\nAh you're listening to your health a radio addiction eight five five forty Laura every poll that's been done the last few years on immigration a show that most people want legal immigration\nEither to remain the same and that's a million people a year it's a lot or or to be decreased so it was like thirty seven percent want it to remain the same that the Gallup poll from June\nUh thirty seven percent want that level to remain the same I'm Talking legal immigration twenty\nNine percent want it decreased okay twenty eight percent wanted increased now that's legal immigration\nThat those are the convenience factor the inconvenient fact that people like Chris ... they don't want to deal with because when you live in a you know a doorman building in New York you don't have to worry about illegal immigration as it doesn't affecting your life\nYour kids go to the best schools your kids or you know probably driven to work a and driven a school excuse me but you don't have to deal with illegal immigration and you don't have to call in with a a legal immigrant for\nFor a job and find that wait a second they're doing the IT work I used to do for thirty percent less so you know people don't want this\nFor a job and find that wait a second they're doing the IT work I used to do for thirty\nPercent less so ... you know people don't want that\nYou're right I live out in western New York where it's a it's a very blue collar area and ah in recent year a year or so we've seen you know truckloads of illegal illegal immigrants arrested or the seven eleven\nOn their way back from a construction site where the or were they were working we've seen a chain of Mexican restaurants\nAnd uh and west in Buffalo or wherever they pulled out of a whole load of workers where the owner of the restaurant was housing them and paying them cash on e just got a found guilty the other day of this kind of crack down needs to continue because I'll tell ya\nAnd buffalo where we used to be a strong steelworkers town were not anymore we're we're starting to come back under the leadership of president Donald Trump\nBut men and women here me these jobs need these jobs and and the they know who's taken the job they know what illegal immigration is all about and the Democrats in the mainstream media spend their time trying to gas light them on this issue\nTalking about how important\nAre ... immigration to the United states when they're really the issue that they're they're they're complaining is illegal immigration the president isn't against immigration\nIs against illegal immigration and I think the American people see through it you know my wife is an immigrant we went through the whole citizenship process the first the immigration process\nAnd then the citizenship process it's difficult it takes time and if you got to hire a lawyer it's expensive but my wife will tell you it's really worth it you know and the problem she sees is it the surrounded by people were all surrounded by people who are here\nIllegally some of them are now over ... visas etcetera\nAnd since it's infuriating [noise] and again I say this repeatedly\nYou ... if you can't even blame you can't blame the people who are trying to get here because they've been given a green light probably from their own governments and in one way shape or form\nA and they've been told you can come and stay so people who are just want to come here and work I don't even blame them but they it can't happen because because well without a border you're not a country Reagan said that he was completely right\nA border exist to help you maintain your sovereignty and to protect your own people an orderly process of immigration is what we need but\nLook the chaos at the at the border is is not dissimilar a Michael to the chaos that we've seen in the streets and the ... and the aftermath of Kavanaugh\nA and the Democrats prefer that because if this chaos you need more government\nGovernment grows government gets bigger and the Democrats are never happier than when the government is growing and growing and growing that's what they want\nIt's true and if your listeners white\nWhat they saw during the month long confirmation process of justice Brett Kavanaugh the screaming in the hearings the uh the people running down the uh the always based out of the United states Capitol screaming at senators the the people trapping senators in\nAn elevator illegally and screaming at them for the cameras the mobs of people outside the capital and after he was confirmed that people trying to literally ... their fingernails through the metal doors of the United States Supreme court building\nIf they like that they're going to love twenty Nineteen if the Democrats take over the house of representatives and you know or if the\nThey liked that they're going to love twenty Nineteen if the Democrats take over the house of representatives and you know or if the election were held today we would lose the house the Republicans would lose the house because\nA lot of people who were not measure well by the polls and twenty sixteen they\nCall us deplorable right that people who haven't voted in recent elections because of their frustration with issues like illegal immigration thinking that their vote didn't matter at all they found a champion and Donald Trump someone they fought a non politician could make change for them\nAnd you know in in a midterm election\nThose kinds of folks to tend to think well I got my guy and\nI'm going to go ahead and sit this one out and they don't take their lunch break to go vote they don't drop their kid off early at school so they can go vote on the way to work or they don't you know a skip the but the birthday party after work to go vote on it and and that this time around they better do it because\nThey think the part of the president's not on the ... he is\nOn ... you know ... that's an excellent point and Michael what's happening the twenty seventh congressional district in New York Congressman
