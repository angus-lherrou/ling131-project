me right [laughter] that's it I I really\nDid say I said you know I I've heard waterboarding is it they say it's like you're in a job that you really don't you just can't free so I I thought that maybe that's what waterboarding felt like for me sitting there watching that game last week but get to see my tigers up and going against\nYeah that that was that was a a rough one a very ... getting into the into the meat of the interview 'em how are things going with the the Alabama GOP 'em and before you answer that I just want to go ahead and say uh when we appreciate your\nComing on and discussing the seat of the um Alabama Juppe we have reached out to Nancy worldly I'm to talk about the state of the the Alabama a Democratic Party\nUm several times we've reached out to them they have not responded to our request to talk about it because we want to be fair and balanced year we went to make sure that both sides because we are in the election season and everybody needs to get both talking points I guess so to speak\nChair well and I think that's very fair if you're not think that the right thing to do as well so you know the state of Alabama Republican Party I I could I could talk for hours on that it's big it's loud is active on the leaders as active as large in every type of number category of numbers\nThat you can call out to me I'm with that when you have such a red state of Alabama there come some challenges at the same time or what I attend the Republican National committee meetings or I'm One of the safety of the state chairs\nAnd I'll be sitting next to a blue state chairman and that'll be moaning and groaning because [laughter] you know they're in a very blue state and they can't raise any money and they don't have any candidate that\nAnd I just get real quiet because [laughter] I thought the opposite I'm challenges in Alabama\nBut I've been there and those days I've been there I'm I'm a forty two year volunteer or just turned sixty bits forty two years of volunteering the party since I was Eighteen and I I I'd rather have these days in those days so uh we're we're a healthy\nUh our our county parties or roaring right now it it is amazing and I'm so proud to be a part of the same um you know and everyone says all ends here\nNo no one's saying hey we're all volunteers and uh it's because we love something we believe in something very strongly so it's a busy busy time I've been working on a party thing all day long I probably do about\nForty hours a week a minimum [laughter] probably a little more than that but I I'm a conservative so I'll go live on that is that we are so it's a good time to the Republican in our states\nNow ah you know there's\nA lot of religion that we've got a lot of incumbents\nI'm the only a congressional district that the Republican Party is not running anybody in is a congressional district number seven um ... do you are you confident uh about the the incumbents retaining their seats\nThe district number seven um ...\nDo you are you confident or about the the incumbents retaining their seats\nIn the state of Alabama absolutely yes no question now that does not mean we take things for granted if that were working as hard for this election Eighteen as we didn't twenty six thing and as a presidential year and everybody kind of comes table all those years\nSo it is just really busy and allowed right now so yes I I feel like we're going to do really well in the United states are six congressional seats\nAnd of course would have us sit at a candidate yet that will be twenty twenty and and I'm very confident we're going to win that back\nNow speaking of the United States Senate candidates ah last year was the special election\nAnd um there was a a wide protests but I'm against a Roy Moore the Republican Senate candidate um that basically allow a singer Doug Jones a do not believe that if uh\nThe evidence that had transpired against for more and more and more would probably be United States senator really more um if the last second allegations against him did not to come to light\nHow right and I I totally agree with you on that too\nSo I mean as far as looking\nFor Senate candidates are you looking for somebody that is going to be reaching across the aisle for a twenty twenty or you looking for somebody that is going to be more\nMore hard right\n[laughter] well what we've already got someone that that the city it's senator now US Senator Doug Jones that claimed he was going to reach across the aisle so um that that's not happening and never was going to happen so I think\nFor the Republican primary voters are going to be looking at you know who best represents their values you know we're very very conservative state ... and I think they are going to look as if candidates I could tell you that that there are some people that are popping up\nAnd up by the time qualifying rolls around ... golly that'll that'll be a year from now so it it really is going to come upon fast\nI think the people in Alabama are going to have a fantastic\nCandidate for that uh twenty twenty way and and it's interesting that people said no that's also the presidential election year in our state across the nation so Alabama has been right at the number one highest approval right at stake for Donald Trump\nSo I'm like in my eyes I had to have to tell you with Trump or Alabama thing never want a approval state for him with him at the top of the tickets I I think it's going to be a good year for us it's twenty twenty a presidential an offset pick it back up to say\nYeah I I don't really foresee um centered Jones being senator Jones past twenty twenty on especially with um his allegiance with a Chuck Schumer\nAnd not really listening to the constituents are which are in this state though he has to be very small percentage of people that he represents based upon his actions yeah as senator and yeah you\nDid when I went inside I long term lease and they say if I was you know you might want to take it you know luckily or six months that at five an hour if they do it\nNow I Know that I'm On social media on in the in the media you have also been very active in trying to persuade US Senator Jones to vote on more conservatively uh than what he ran um did he ever contact you or did you guys ever have any discussions\nOh heavens no no not not not not anything it's I'm a on it it's not my responsibility\nSince oh heavens no no not not not not\nAnything it's I'm a on it it's not my responsibility to you know go to the Democratic United States senator and a\nHunt him down and ask him to do this do that now I did it publicly I did it at press conferences and press releases and on social media he clearly does not you write in a state for [noise] you know hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Republicans in the day he\nIgnored it and not only just Republicans but other people to um he said it with his own mouth in fact the day that he decided to that no cabin off so he was on CNN YouTube or Google it\nAnd a commentator on CNN said all the people in Alabama I Would say the majority of them again yet you're voting no answer to that which I appreciate him making our TV ads for with his\nUm [noise] they they are they are not talking about the values that we share\nAs American as Alabamians not just what the color of our skin is that about our families are business is our schools because those are the things we all have in common and I do find very often that I Believe in the political world if I may be so bold because I Believe it's an honest conversation\nIs to say that we use race as a device that tool\n... and and so um that that is I think is the poorest and\nIt it it is very bothersome to me just as a human being that that tool is pulled out of a tool box and you very often times when it's not apple will\nKnow in in current\nPolitical environment as a conservative as a Republican\nI'm In the vast majority of the news outlets now or if you're conservative if you're a Republican if you're part of the Juppe you are now being labeled a apparently kick it gave you the Klan is making huge comeback neo Nazis and making this huge come back\nA year now labeled All right you're no longer a conservative\nOr how do you um balance that and pushing back against that narrative and trying to decide because there's a lot of people in and I have many friends in different\nWalks of life and they are now viewing the Republican Party\nAs an extension of this All right which does not really truly exist it's a very slim minority of people yet they will not distance themselves or de ... uh the grilling rise in the brown dirt tactics of a ... or the the radical I'm liberals are older\nWell I think we do and I think that set all the time the problem is what we're going to go back to the media they control what you and I hear and Silvio we'll hear when it said he says it how it's written what gets on the air what doesn't get written and so I I'm very I'm bother\nJust bothered as a human being it just starts as a a state party chairman here what you just told me that you have friends that you know that have bought into this narrative of these words that are being slung upon us that\nFake news it's just not true but that is that part I Believe are getting out ... and I'll tell you something that's popped up that has been a massive ah\nImplementation of the political process as social media mhm and all get picked up a phone and it's it's it's easy to do because you're a hunter can't board or what your computer and you just kept kept ... whatever you want to stay and hit stand and it's gone and there's hardly there's no ramifications that you can call anybody at night\nUh you you can you can put this title thought people but that doesn't make it true\nAnd it's very very bothersome when I hear things like that because it's just simply you know it's just it's just not sure I'd\nMiss laziness as Sylvia Rogers how you doing tonight hey how are you don't let him pick on you about Phil Collins\nNo no no\nI'm gonna try to change the subject just forsaken on before we brought you into the conversation Bryant Bryant and I were discussing the lottery and the fact that we don't have it in Alabama and how much we think that would actually benefit our educational system where are you on the being that you actually used to be a school teacher yourself\nYes I was I was a public school teacher for about ten years fifth and sixth grade I I I missed my classroom not just in a different classroom with\nAdults right now [laughter] type of teaching\nFor about ten years fifth and sixth grade I I I miss my classroom and just in a different classroom with adults right now [laughter] type of teaching educated people um but I'll tell you that I I think that a couple of things on the lottery first of all the governors who\nI Am seeing a Walt Maddox in particular talked about\nHe will into minute lottery he will do this he will have a lottery he can't do that and he's being disingenuous when he says that could take it that is a legislative process\nIf the Alabama house in the Alabama Senate cannot come up with a bill to gather sensitive to the governor's desk\nThat's not going to happen and so first of all I always tell people\nUh we can talk about it but you must ... cat your elected officials and let them know what you think about it I Do think if it if it came up with it were something if there was an appetite out there and I I think there is really I'm hearing it everywhere I go\nOr not to a party Lance just as an al ...\nOr if it's well written and written why for education you have a shot it might have a shot right um this is totally up to the people that we can have this conversation now which is always good to do but if people did not call their legislate tours and tell them they want\nTo look at this than it's not going to happen and I know governor Avi is publicly said um that she thinks the people at the right thing to do this and allow them to let them make the decision\nSo there is a lot of chatter about it but all eyes are the legislature and I'm up in February I Believe is when they go into session a twenty night saying\nOK cell said the lottery doesn't pays what's your idea on something that will create better revenue for education system\nSure well one of the things that's happening in our state which is\nWonderful and it is a direct correlation\nTo the president's a mega making America great again and the Republican agenda I mean that there this is not magic all these wonderful economic news is happy\nOne out of it is you're to grow your tax day ... and the tax base is growing because people have got tax cuts and what do we do with that we put it back into the economy we buy a car or we we go on vacation or wait a greater in our house or\nDo something special you know with our family and so that's happening not only across America Sylvia but here in Alabama therefore our tax base is growing the fact of the matter is this pass legislation passed legislative session\nI'm we passed we'd be in the Republican majority\nAnd a sense of ... by the governor the largest\nEducation budget in ten years was over six billion dollars in the larger and so the money is there some times I think it's that filter home we're talking about\nUh getting messages out sometimes but you know maybe the average person's not thinking about it or knowing about it though the highest six billion dollars that was signed this past just this past spring and so I think it's there\nIt's how you use it you know how you cut the tie up in one of the other things I think it's important for all of us to just really basically understand Alabama in our process there are some things that are earmark and there is something that the legislature has\nThat they they can't they can't undo it too great degree in less safe they vote to undo something you don't mistake and I don't want to give you the wrong number for some reason I Want to say\nTo great gray and less safe they vote to undo something if not mistaken I don't want to give you the wrong number for some reason I Want to say Ninety three percent of the general fund is earmarked that does not give us much to play with right there right in the general five because then you got the education budget\nFor so yeah I think that's the biggest problem with like a lot of people have with\nThe way that the state government um operates in there is not a lot of wiggle room and that there are people out there who kind of a take advantage of that and uh\nI Know there's a lot of there's there's a lot of chatter out there wanting to change the process so you don't have yet to earmarks where they are but there's also a lot of resistance to that a terrier we want to be respectful\nTo your uh your time this evening or want to thank you very much for for stopping in a talking about the state of the uh the Republican Party in the state of Alabama I'm it\nIt was great having a conversation with you again ah it's been in over a year's insistence you and I had a conversation we were down immobile a as the\nSenate forum um the last time that we spoke um and I greatly again appreciate you taking the time out of your evening and glad that we could a schedule around some over and football for a [laughter] for you to come in\nI Know a October twenty seven is Alexander both off so you know they're going to say that the day in Alabama or if I was

opportunity let let's make sure it's it's not that much time goes by call anytime that I'd love to cut back on maybe after the election we can\nKind of play you know what happens but we feeling good about November to six fulfilling good because working really really hard\nNow we're real quick on before I ask you where um where people can find you how you feel about nationally\nOr do you think uh I I I'm pretty confident that\nThe Republicans are going to hold the Senate and pick up seats um how are you feeling or just from your perspective about the house of representatives\nYes I agree with you on the United States Senate but it always depends on who goes about I think there's a silent majority out there that reward I sixteen to presidents reminded them again on nature back [noise]\nUm I
