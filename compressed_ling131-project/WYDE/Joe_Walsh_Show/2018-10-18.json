however it turns out\nWow so it's a victory for me to no matter how it turns out\nSo it's a victory for me to Brett Kavanaugh did not do anything\nHe's been accused of doing\n\nIt say victory for me

victory if they're making everything up that's what me too is all about\nThe truth doesn't matter that's exactly what that Washington Post headline said this morning the truth it does not matter\n\nAnd you know what slaves me is the or the left Democrats rightly accuse President Trump of having a problem with the truth the does\nWell it seems to me that\nThe me too movement doesn't care about the truth either\n\nThis is a victory for me to\n\nJust taking Brett Kavanaugh down\n\nFacts be damned the truth\n\nIt's just taking Brett Kavanaugh down the facts be damned the truth be damned that's a a that's a victory like me to\nWho would be proud of that\nAnd ah Brett Kavanaugh\nUm\nHe he does not matter here at all does he see clearly what where understanding more and more and more here and this headline\nReveals that more and more and more here it's clearly not about Brett Kavanaugh and what he might have done thirty five years to go\nTo any woman it's clearly not about that again from the meat to perspective\nIt's all about being able to say in general that women are good there to be believed men are bad they're not to be believed\n\nIt's not about this case\n... that headline makes clear no matter how this thing turns out me to baby the me too movement one\nJust taking down another man\nThat's what this article in the Washington Post today is saying just the act of taking down another man\nWhether that man deserved to go down or not whether that man did anything wrong or not none of that matters\nAt all I guess the me too movement is all about just taking men down\nPeriod period\nCabinet Brett Kavanaugh collateral damage big what he he got caught up in the battle he got caught up in the hurricane men don't care about him any\n\nEight five five six for

yesterday or over the weekend\nSome woman say this is about whether we're going to believe all women are not this Brett Kavanaugh saying\nIt's about whether we are going to believe all women are not and I I think I screamed at my TV no it's not it's about whether we're going to believe a doctor Christine Ford or not\nIt's about whether we believe her or not period it's not about whether we believe all women one man\nAnd there we believe her or not period it's not about whether we believe all women one man has been accused of doing something\n\n[noise] eight five five six for two fifty six hundred\nAnd I I guess the point I'm trying to make here is that what you and I think as fed up as we are with this whole freaking situation\nAt the end of the day you and I know it's\nIt's about it should be about whether Brett Kevin I did what he was alleged to have done thirty five years ago now I I Know like I don't even care about that and I know most to you don't either I'd come from them you should be on the Supreme Court right now but if you did care about it\nAll you care about is did he do it or not did he write did she do it or not\nAnd involved in most of these major cities
