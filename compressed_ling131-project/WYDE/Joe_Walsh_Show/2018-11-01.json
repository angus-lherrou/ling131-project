Obama\n... I Believe then fervently and I believe more now was not at all a friend of Israel\nAnd in fact I believed and I still believe that Brock Obama in a way despised Israel he worked against Israel you know we've always had this dynamic in America with our presidents\nIt's like there's a fight going on over there a fight between Israel and the Palestinians\nAnd America has got to be like the referee\nWere like the mediator right in between these two warring factions and that's the role that every American president has pretty much played until Obama\nNow that's a dynamic that I'm I I don't uh uh uh approve of\nAnd that's a dynamic will get into Trump in a minute that's a dynamic that Trump does not participate in either but it's always been that way Republican Democrat president\nUh you don't take sides you want to bring peace so it's like a boxing match you got the Palestinians in that corner you got Israel in that corner in the American president is the referee\n\nThen along comes Obama and it was clear during the eight years of the Obama administration ... Obama was not the referee he wasn't\nThe guy in the middle of the ring he wasn't some objective a broker for peace he was not some mediator now Brock Obama comes along\nAnd he's the first president at least in my lifetime who picked a corner\nHe picked aside and then it wasn't Israel\nBrock Obama through his deeds his words in his actions made clear that he pretty much sided with the Palestinians\nHe viewed as\nHe pretty much sided with the Palestinians\nHe viewed as\nThe left in this country views Israel as and oppressor\nAn occupier and Obama\nViewed the Palestinians as the left in America views the Palestinians as the poor oppressed innocent people\n\nThat's the way Obama talked when you look at\nObama's policies visa v the middle east every every day week month a year of his presidency he was wrapping Israel across the hands he was he was slapping Israel across the cheek and he was embracing the Palestinians\n\nSo I go to Congress in twenty ten I notice I see this I see Obama and the White House I get I understand that he's not a friend of Israel so I consider my duty\nTo fill that vacuum\nI considered it my duty to let Israel no that America's still stands with her I was part of a big freshman class of Republican congressman a lot of evangelical Christians in that class huge supporters of Israel\nI went to Israel\nI saw some things everything I saw only reinforced my beliefs\nThat there will not be peace in the middle east as long as the Palestinians are the Palestinians period\n\nBut I spent those two years in DC trying to be\nAs loud a and as we sit for is and\nAs outspoken of a supporter of Israel's as I could be I did that because I Believe it was the right thing to do I did that because my religion teaches me that about Israel and the Jewish people I did that\nBecause Israel is our greatest ally on the planet I did that\nUm because Israel is like this little tiny speck of good in a sea of of Islamic evil in that part of the world I did that philosophically because Israel is generally free open prosperous country\n\nBut I also did what I did when I was in Congress being a very vocal supporter of Israel because I recognized that that's not what we had in the White House in Morocco bottom\nAnd it was important to me almost every week to lead Israel now\nThat America's still student with her even if the president doesn't\n\nThe United States Congress still stands with you Israel even if the guy in the White House doesn't and when I was there and Netanyahu came and spoke a at a joint session of Congress that was one of my greatest thrills\nWas to hear him speak in that chamber\nEight five five six for two fifty six hundred eight five five six for two fifty six hundred\n\nEight five five six for two fifty six hundred eight five five six for two fifty six hundred it would be great one day to retire\nAnd die when I'm an old old man in Israel\nI Would have to talk my Jewish wife into doing that I Would have to talk my Jewish wife into a limousine that far away from hopefully what will be grand children one day\n\nA man if you've never been there and if you've never been to a beautiful Israel\nOr you're missing out\nIt is a once in a lifetime experience Christian or Jew really citizen of the world really citizen of or member of any religion that sacred ground upon which it seems like\nAnd if that leads to peace great if it doesn't [noise] too bad\n[noise] eight five five six for two fifty six hundred eight five five six for two fifty six hundred I'm Joe Walsh hey It's Wednesday don't go anywhere [noise]\nThis is the Joe Walsh program with us Joe Walsh former congressmen show a guy named Joe Walsh infamous Joe saint on radio and it [noise]\nIf you're a small business owner then you need to know about you line you line is the leading distributor of shipping industrial and packaging materials to businesses to North America they serve hundreds of thousands of small business customers right here in the U.S\nIn July understands that small business owners are the engine of our economy\nIf any part of your business involves packing or shipping materials then here's the deal you need you line their catalog is huge and it's full of high quality products\nThey offer ... shipping more than twenty seven thousand industrial products in July and customer service is second to none\nFor all of your shipping and industrial product needs contact you line called them today at one eight hundred\nTo nine five five five one zero or go on line at you line dot com slash while stats U.
