Alabama\nBut today\nWe witness the combination of events that was extremely partisan and nature\nExtremely damaging for culture going forward and we have to ask the question where do we go from [noise] silly Roger\n[laughter] how're you doing just fine lovely evening\nI'm good I'm good I Know we are aren't going to run out of things to talk\nAbout [laughter] so well you know I mean it's it's\nWe talked about on the Joe ... show\nYeah similar like a a whirlwind or to say the least like you got\nOn I was just like one thing coming after the other you get the um conviction of the guy's name and then we come through with these allegations and everyone wants to compare of is the case to the ... and somewhat the same family it is and compare\nIt All right and we're not going to get into how I feel about um what happened with Bill Cosby because there's a whole nother show and and that\nIs a no other as the\nDetails in specifics that came out of that particular case you went from having American dad in your stomach than you know just start turning in training and you just start getting upset in sick\nBut see the thing about it are there are some similarities though with these cases because I'm just like there were inconsistencies with the accuser this time with you know certain events or what happened with this and that there are people that came forward and say well\nI did a lie [laughter] you know Bill Cosby didn't affect me so now like I said\nYou're always going to get those people that want to jump onto a bandwagon and I think that some fortunate especially when you are dealing\nWith the subject so serious as this it's\nNot something to be taken lightly and it's not something to just\nThrow your at nurturing right you know hey you see me every year without any evidence\nI'm over here too and you know a ... a perceived victim and you're not in a victim\nI'll tell you something those they're really really gets under my skin with these types of situations and I'm not saying that timing um\nHelped me decide whether or not what you're saying is true or not but it bothers me that these accusers and alleged victims\nOr whatever you like to call them only come out when these people are making major moves ... you know\nJust say for some reason you know you went for president the next time\nYou're eligible to run and now we have people that went to middle school with you Brian ... mileage many\nNew law did their lunch receive but it won't come out and so you do on big things that are right right yeah no I'm at ... and I understand that um it\nWe we witnessed it with a in the Alabama us\nThey won't come out and so you're doing big things right right yeah no I'm at ... and I understand that if we can we witnessed it with a in the Alabama a special election to thousands Seventeen wrangler ruined more that's the commentary on without ... but it's\nNot something that's new because when you're running for president there's always that\nOctober surprise and your opponent is always going to wait to the very last moment in order to drop the bomb show and to see what sticks to try and sway public opinion because\nThe majority of Americans are not going to be like me and you were we delve deep were geeks when it comes to this kind of stuff you know where we live we breathe we eat we sleep in it or sometimes to our detriment or which the past three weeks is definitely been to our detriment I Believe um\nBut at the you know at the last minute thirteenth our eleventh hour however you want to look at it you know they drop the bomb shells and they want the emotional reaction and you saw what happened with Roy Moore and when the ... the rental grounds emotions got Doug Jones elected\nBecause really more before these allegations dropped three weeks before the election he was twenty percent I feel like a lot of people\nKind of felt convicted like you said emotions um get Doug Jones elected so it's kind of you know well if I vote for Roy Moore am I you know somewhat condoning this type of\nA ... I wasn't going to vote for ... but I was not going to vote for Roy Moore so I was one of\nThe uh the protests desserts that helped get Doug Jones selected um I did not want really more as my senator I did not think that he could uh accurately\nRepresent everybody with his personal theological ideology why\nOr because of his viewpoints on gay marriage is actual live on others with alternative lifestyles he was um he was very very very ultra conservative when it came to certain family values or I Am an individual that once equality for everybody I Want me\nTo be approached it any situation equally\nI don't want there to be any type of discrimination based upon our sex are color\nOr our ideology I think that is wrong and I do not think that really more would have representative of holding those values of liberty um that I hear too I also don't think Doug Jones even though he would more so than Roy Moore\nHas how we have witnessed his tenure in the Senate right now I Do not believe that he is actually representing\n[noise]\n\n\nSorry guys in Eighteen minutes after the hour and it is college football season is\nLow tide roll your\nEagle but you know well you know it's even more important is that we are in the mix of major league playoffs and the Yankees and the red Sox are added again go socks\nAnd the best place to watch these games Fifteen till vision\nDrink specials ... is this oh so it is the social in home would Alabama you guys need to uh go to sue hosts social\n... bar they have a private room in which you can rent out the host any function that you want do they have several televisions in there and they also some really comfortable uh couches in some chairs and other type of furniture that you really wouldn't expect in a race to beverages very tasty beverages and they also have a giant ...\nThat you can play it his dog friendly\nAnd are you guys go to sue her social ... bar and be sure to support them because they support us You're on a for the people\nBefore we went to break we were discussing\nWhether or not I believe uh the question that you were who is to uh before uh the Joe ... show went off the air and you're kind of put on the spot\nA shrine to kind of a you should you should read your mind that you asked\nMe whether or not have believed ...\nAnd I said I wanted to believe at first you know I wanted to approach this head on let's look at the facts because you know me I like to look at all the socks on and make sure I Want to hear her I wanted to hear him\nTo approach this head on\nLet's look at the facts because you know me I like to look at all the facts don't want to make sure I Want to hear her I wanted to hear him presumption of innocence and let's take her story let's believe it for right now and then kind of see how everything plays out\nAnd then it just got dragged on\nAnd she started making requests of what the FBI should do and what the Senate should do and that they needed to conform to her and her once not needs once in order for this investigation to go forward in what needed to happen to judge Kavanaugh\nNow justice capital\nSo patiently waited for the testimony as all Americans wanted to hear her story and I listen to it\nI had all the information that was a provided to us going in about what she may or may not say about the information of evidence and amusing evidence in quotation marks as well here um of what she is present afford something that is uncorroborated a\nBaseless as far as credibility goes\nAnd everybody that she had named had said that didn't happen and even her best friend says she didn't even know who Brett Kavanaugh was had never met him so going into it I'll listen to her story and her story seem credible ... and there was a motion behind it\nBut then after her opening statement the questions started coming she didn't know that an offer had been made for the committee members to come out to her or she said she was afraid of flying\nAll of that kind of got put to rest because she flies everywhere she just didn't want to fly here um\nThen the polygraph test which is in the Supreme Court was only asked two questions um administer the test in somebody is somebody that senator Feinstein's office you paid for it um then Brett Kavanaugh spoke\nAnd a lot of people are saying this was his job interview\nAnd it wasn't a job interview the week prior was his job interview where he went through a on those eighty hours of hard questioning\nBy sixty senators and then having just three live hearing the Senate Judiciary committee going through his judicial record of his judicial temperament\n\nHe was emotionally scorn he was emotionally hurt and you could tell the fire of being falsely accused you could tell that that's what was happening with him\nAnd you kind of compare and contrast the more that he spoke with a more belligerent the Senate Democrats were to him where they were not so much towards\nHer they were praising her for coming forward which was understandable and the partisan divide you all knew it was going down I was going to be like the right\nBut the Republicans wanted to treat her with respect so they brought in the such crimes prosecutor\nAnd she handled the situation very well you know she kind of a softball with her a little bit ... asked some point you questions that were credible questions that we're looking holes in her story and how she was responding to\nIt\nThey asked some point you questions that were credible questions that we're looking holes in her story and how she was responding to it\n\nAnd at the end of last week I really felt like she had really gone\nOr something I Believe that but I Believe that it wasn't Brett Kavanaugh but then\nThe past four days more news to come out about how she was trying to convince her friendly inland to change your sworn testimony to support her\nUm her lawyers or were trying to do the same thing that they had sent out letters asking women to sign a in order to say that they had also been assaulted by judge Kavanaugh and that is completely changed my opinion that it was a ... it was politics\nUm I Believe Brett Kavanaugh I Believe Brett Kavanaugh's one hundred percent innocent um I Do think that he did not want to be completely open with maybe his um rambunctious behavior\nAs a teenager who ... who really wants\nTo go back and talk about how crazy they were in their teenage years because we've all done stuff in our team maybe maybe not to the same as the elites that he was involved with but we all do\nCrazy things were teenagers we say stupid things we do things and we everyone's than something that they don't want everyone to know about\nExactly so I Want to believe that something happened to her I Do I really do because I feel the same because I don't want her to have something ... been done\nTo her and nobody believes her and\nI Hope that she gets the help that she deserves and to help that she needs to get through whatever pains and struggles that she is going through\nA however do not believe that we have just put a rapist on the Supreme Court I think that is sensationalism I think that is an emotional overreaction and I do think that this process has de legitimize the me too movement in a way because you have\nBaseless claims being levied against an innocent man at the highest position on this possible\nAnd I do not believe that we should\nWeaponize the me too movement I Do not believe that we should weaponize believe all women I Do not believe that we should weaponize sexual assault or rape allegations because they're damaging and I believe that the Democratic party as it stands right now who's\nIn office right now who were being represented there they had done a disservice not only to their party their constituents but also for the rest of the American people because they have legitimize the weaponization there or\nAre they really are you spoke about like the October surprise correct what do you think the surprise would have been if judge Kevin I was a woman\nThat's a good question because we did have handled the you know the me too movement I'm not going to say it doesn't apply but you know that's not the train right so it it can apply\nBecause um I mean you look at the original not in the original accuser of Harvey Weinstein but one of the original women who has come out against Harvey Weinstein and kind of got the ball rolling about\nThe me too movement with the sexual assault allegations she has been accused of um having improper relations and having sexual intercourse with a minor\n...\nShe was going on about with the Harvey Weinstein on that\nRelations and having sexual intercourse with a minor ...\nWhile she was going on about with the Harvey Weinstein um accusation isn't known and well years yeah so it it can happen it does happen in everything needs to be taken and obviously she's push it aside\nNo no no no no no this is an happened everybody's going to be defensive when you have an accusation but\nNone of that magnitude right everyone knows with those type of accusations like carry right exactly exactly get up to the phone lines real quick hey jak how're you doing this evening\nOn bill signed up for like ... are you doing I'm great and they are like a dog or the way that I'm so happy the way to earn\nA so I take it that ah that year and full support ... associate justice Brett Kavanaugh\nThat right that's right you got it right but one thing on that you you know my\nThe house which doesn't happen when you have a presidential election usually the first term you know the house representatives flips\nBut because of this process of what has happened the allegations the ugliness that has been witnessed on the side the Cory bookers the Bernie Sanders the Elizabeth Warren's the Maxine Waters\nDemanding that people go out and confront Republicans\n\nThat's invigorated the Republican base yeah\nDo you think well how how were you looking at I mean you obviously we know the state of Alabama as I mean you can take right and just you know roll with it um but do you think that uh some of the uh uh the political\nOpponents that are there are correct that you know this is invigorated the Republican base that there is not going to be a blue wave that that's completely gone I mean we're only one months away\nBut you see the voter enthusiasm the intensity of the Republican base now I asked what do you ... center Chuck Grassley snapback you've seen\n'em oh God you've seen what's his face a Lindsey Graham ...\n... almost in the past couple of weeks with his snappy responses are Orrin hatches telling people to grow up\nYou've got Mitch McConnell that is and you know we're not going to be bullied you can't do this to us anymore it's almost as if the other Republican representatives that actually grown is fine\nYeah I mean\nOne thing I have learned especially as of late like you never really know which way you know things are going to go how people are going to sway and ah\nI'm happy that it seems like we're kind of\nKind of moving in a direction where you are political affiliation ... does it always does harming your outlook on certain things like\nI like the fact of having a candidate in place that may be a Republican but you know has some loose or views on you know just throw it out there maybe abortion or\nYou know again we're just like you say you're wanting more moderate candidates you don't want somebody that's\nGoing to be an Elizabeth Warren or a Bernie Sanders that adhere to more socialistic\nI'm a political ideologies but you don't want on the Republican side somebody like a Roy Moore is you know basically a the a lot and\nI was saying earlier arsenal feelings you know personal feelings that are going to be there because we're human but your personal feelings shouldn't always dictate and be in the center of every decision you make when it comes\nTo your job so how do you ah how do you think that this has affected uh the people of America because obviously I mean the more division\nMore to more where we don't need ... do you think that is recoverable because there's a lot of people out there saying it's going to be really hard for this to be recoverable there's going to be protests at\nThe Supreme Court um you know that for sure you're going to get more a brown shirt a type of tactics that are initiated by the Democratic um senators and their constituents and base against the Republicans um something we really haven't seen I mean um\nIt's almost as if this is kind of a McCarthyism type of environment that we're living and again\nI feel like as far as this uh\nI'm just as having a situation goes like this is only the beginning you think are they going to get worse is\n\nUm just if you have enough situation goes like this is only the beginning\nYou think they're going to get worse as far as the resistance right right\nAnd I mean we just see that even with President Trump right like I said I've said before I'm not saying I'm his biggest fan but I'm not as big as enemy either like\nWhen when when we're talking about the resistance and we're talking about the mobilization of a political ideology\nUm the believe all women\nPhrase that has come out in the last three weeks where it's just it's been yelled and screamed and if you don't fall in line and believe Dr Ford than your big ... your ... colleges or the um the women's march said that Susan Collins was raped apologist now\nUm you know that's not good for\nAmerica you know they're saying that just because you're a woman and a woman makes an accusation that you must\nBelieve her do you believe that\nYou know and even the women that are saying that they don't necessarily believe that either because if a woman came forward and accused you or you know father brothers son of something you just wouldn't want everyone to rush to write to her aid in you know beyond that it's not just because\nYou know so you leaving a presumption of innocence until they are they're very one deserves that\nI mean you just just because a woman comes forward and say that they were taste doesn't necessarily mean that everyone should jump on the bandwagon but it also does it mean that people would just say no way you know it didn't happen\nWhat ... what about those that are saying that uh this is just a re affirmation\nOf a old country or that is predicated on white treatment and that there is no quality anymore\nOh\n\nAnd then that's and that's the reason why the resistance to judge Kavanaugh on anybody that President Trump nominates\nI'll say these and I think we kind of touched on it before and I'm\nNow that's a very extreme statement to make obviously\nIt's been levied I mean\n\nYou want to address it when we get back yeah All right guys uh we got to take a quick break let us know what you're thinking eight six six five five one nine nine three three we want to know
