I mean it's all going to have a are you going to sue her\nKnow or or have right over it I'm just going to learn that one or just for her to break up yeah yeah I'm going to be immortalized by Taylor Swift how long you're going to date or like when you go\nAnd I have right over in ... during her just for her to break up yeah so at a song yeah I'm going to be immortalized by Taylor Swift how long you're going to die to like what do you go outside and\nI say six seven months and\nThe major lie on the handle and the ... okay ... okay you're waiting a little bit longer than others usually do you come on really sweet you can shorten that three three ... three and gets\nIn her new oh there we go ladies and gentlemen we are getting um a secret Mankato right now\nBut uh yeah so you know Taylor Swift came out and said that she was going to be supporting the Democratic nominees in the state of Tennessee um got a lot of race where she was brave\nCetera et cetera et cetera it's about time you know she ... she has been a politically agnostic I'm trying not to of been any of her um any of her fans\nAnd I find it ridiculous as we're talking about ideology and celebrity worship\nAnd as a kind of how I feel about Kanye West and do a lot of people like well he's doing something that is not how I Would do it in supporting something that I don't really support so therefore I'm going to just you know get rid of all my music and I know a lot of people are said I'm never going to be a Taylor Swift and again\nIn ... on I I'm always going to be a Taylor Swift fan you know [noise]\nI think people have a hard time separating um celebrities away from their works ... in their personal lives are these people entertain me and I and that's the thing and then I think that's the thing\nThat was like home ... um I don't want\nPolitics to be interjected into the NFL because I Want to be entertained I Want to turn the TV on go\nBrain dead for three hours and watch two teams beat up on each other while I'm drinking a beer and eat pizza and let's see that's the thing that people\nAre making the whole kneeling thing a whole lot bigger than it really is in my opinion will like how does someone yelling at the beginning of the game affect the way you watch the rest of it through your job for hours because it it's about respect\nIn Herschel Walker and jump around but come out and said hey you know just just the test week because of the response to Tony west and the Detroit has been thrown at him\nBut they they they support him even um and what is his name\n... bills come out it was and you know I loved the men you know he's a friend um I don't necessarily agree with everything he said and I think that's where we need to be it's like I said I respect you I don't necessarily agree with everything you say I'm Still going to be there for you we have lost that in this country we are now being ...\nInto small little sections of life\nBut we do know they kind of ... things to provoke people in the middle but he's an entertainer artery all these things as he really support Donald Trump in that way because I Donald Trump in ... friends for a while I saw a clip 'em\nWhere he was someone where the interviewer was asking him you know the significance of the make America great again hat that he has been seen wearing a few times\nAnd basically he was saying something along the lines of when he was in school he was really and people would take his head away from him now and then when he was a little kid and he didn't\nHave a father and his life and so he is projecting I think that fatherly figure on Donald Trump from when I was able to get out of it\nI Am wearing that I'm hats I Hope not made them feel like Superman ... wearing this that makes me feel like\nWe're not saying this um young men had some issues that's what I'm saying like if I really do think the death of his mother Canada\nThis um young man had some issues that's what I'm saying like if I really do think the death of his mother can kick started you know him into a whirlwind of you know depression maybe\nI don't know it's a little scary that\nIt could have mental health is a very bright but he is and then end\nUp getting slack for calling him mentally ill ... and you just can't throw that are out because ... health is a serious issue a joint J. guys during the conversation is six six\nFive five one nine nine three three tell us what you think of celebrity worship or whether or not celebrities need to be getting involved in politics I don't care if they um personally I don't care if they do or they don't\nA if a celebrity has a position that they're passionate about and they want to raise awareness on please get out there raise awareness on it's important to raise awareness on issues and get people educated maybe there's an issue that we do not know about Kanye West wanting to talk about prison reform\nIs a good thing but come with facts yeah why uh is prison reform important to him\nAnd that's a good question I don't\nI've encountered looking into it you know maybe ... but I really can't find a correlation with his injuries and things that actually going on in his life or they have gone on\nYou know I I don't know maybe has something to do when his early childhood that uh you know he really didn't say um but uh you know I mean just the reaction that a lot of people who've had towards Kanye West is kind of a a\nAn issue that we're having a nationwide is that if somebody you do not agree with your going to attack\nThem and you're going to attack them with everything you have personally you're going to try and knock them down um and I think that is wrong\nRight it shouldn't be that way no and\nWe in origin and when we started show talking about Hillary Clinton you know Hillary Clinton was out on the ah\nOut on the circuit again you know promoting her seven hundred and fifty dollar ticket to her and she said that we need to be on civil to those and we do not agree with for those that we do not agree with\nAre trying to tear down the country issue running for president I sure as hell not but she could be\nI really think it would be if she does it doesn't even know if she does it will be the final nail in the coffin for the Democratic party because she\nWell she gets the nomination I don't know I don't I don't the issue with me right now Joe Biden\nIs is leading in that process and he would be a very poor choice to be running for the Democratic party because he has a very sword history I'm with a touching when inappropriately and are you seeing inappropriate\nWell he says you're on the global family that's you know not to uncommon Nazi one common I guess there is a movement now they're called me to ... uh that particular thing\nUh but uh you know people are going to come out of the woodwork well there is a huge issue when he knows where there's pictures there's videos already\nSo was this prior while he was vice president this is while he was senator\nOh okay so did any of that come out why it was yeah people criticized them for it he would end up early advantage when I guess\nYou would like touch women's faces and give them kisses you know without their consent no I mean that this is just a Joe Biden he he's that creepy uncle\nI've got to say I'm now it just makes me think of him as a ...\nTheir consent no I mean this is just a Joe Biden he he he's the creepy uncle\nThat I've got to say hey I'm now it just makes me think of him as a ... you know like we're Bernie Sanders\nIs you're crazy uncle a Joe Biden is your premium\nI'm taking my front away from it you just referred to Bernie Sanders is crazy uncle yeah well actually the crazy all have you seen as there have you seen the things that he talks about where he doesn't know what he's talking about\nLay out with a man go to his ideology and everything else had used language is I'm Serious he he looks\nLike every single time that he's out in front of somebody one that he has an orange shirt and do a U just rolled out of\nBed he's always on the move he's working for that I think ... ... ...\nAnd that's it he's just an activist he should not be in the position I and I agree because he does not knew what he is talking about\nI mean a cabinet position possibly like building cabinets\nCome out of Democratic Party last Eighteen to twenty four months than I've ever seen come out of the Republican Party I have seen\nMore class warfare more division ... tactics come from the leadership of the Democratic party now I'm not saying that the Citizens United states of America\nWho happened to vote Democrat are the problem they're not\nIt's the leadership that is refusing to accept that they lost\n\nI mean I don't think is the um they have a hard time accepting that they lost\nImmediately they started saying that they're going to impeach President Trump immediately once Brett Kavanaugh got elected they were talking about impeaching Brett Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court which has not happened since the teen ET one\nI feel like the biggest issue is just hand they have an issue with him when Trump were battling any winning resident insurance or anything that President Trump is going to do any of the ... they're going to have some there ain't going to be some form of right and that's wrong\nBut that's what I think it is in my area that doesn't matter what he does even if we you know have the lowest unemployment rate in you know the highest wages it really does matter they're going to always you know find something to you know chats has about they're going to find something to eat Iran\nAnd don't get me wrong I got issues with\nRepublican I Am a Republican but I've got issues with the Republican Party because I don't think that we're a do really good job at PR I don't think we market ourselves very well I don't think that we really specifically talk about certain issues the way that we should I think that we are to adherence to some theological standings\nWe spend way too much money when we say we're the party of small government we expand it I don't\nLike it but I have never ever\nSeen any leadership from the Republican Party call for this type of civil discourse this instability\nThis brown shirt and not seeing them that we're experiencing\nYeah is that for a while for her to say to treat people I'm In and civil manner that\nThey are harder as you know when you're a former first lady Michelle Obama said when they go low we go high and Eric Holder said no the new democratic motto is not when they go low we go high when they go low we kick them\nThis is a man who is setting himself up to run for president it's different in and here's the difference you're\nTalking about a group of people in us a lot of people go OK well here's some what about what about president\nTrump mhm yep President Trump's attacks the media Ninety two percent negative coverage of him\nPresident Trump will attack an individual such as Elizabeth Warren calling her Pocahontas or crazy Maxine Waters like he will attack in individual he does not attack a large group of people he does not say All right winging to their guns and religion\nLike Obama and Hillary group says ... which one I'm\nWhat country that he um call\nOh where they are reportedly he called us all countries yeah uh he was talking about Haiti and a couple of Africa and large group is he's referring to ...\nWhere they are reportedly he called ESL countries yeah uh he was talking about Haiti and a couple\nOf Africa in large group is he's referring to nations but not\n... to immigrant sometimes illegal immigrants illegal immigrants All right\nSo there there's a huge difference in classification which left doesn't want they want illegal and legal to all be immigrants but there are two completely different class of\nThe games that well let's get up to the phone calls or a heat are you doing this evening\nPretty good I just got a
