not matter\n\nAnd you know what slaves me is the or the left Democrats rightly accuse President Trump of having a problem with the truth the does\nWell it seems to me that\nThe me too movement doesn't

more and more here and this headline\nReveals that more and more and more here it's clearly not about Brett Kavanaugh and what he might have done thirty five years to go\nTo any woman it's clearly not about that again from the meat to perspective\nIt's all about being able to say in general that women are good there to be believed men are bad they're not to be believed\nIt's not about this case\nAnd that that headline makes clear no matter how this thing turns out me to baby the me too movement one\nJust taking down another man that's what this article in the Washington Post today is saying just the act of taking down another man\nWhether that man deserved to go down or not whether that man did anything wrong or not none of that matters\nAt all I guess the me too movement is all

we believe all women one man has been accused of doing something\nIt's not about whether we believe all women one man has been accused of doing something\n\nEight five five six for two fifty six

should be about whether Brett Kevin I did what he was alleged to have done thirty five years ago now I I Know like I don't even care about that and I know most to you don't either I'd confirmed me

the list of targets are all Democrats in all outspoken critics of President Trump eight five five forty Laura we'll talk to the high camp challenger in North Dakota coming up\n\nDoes your dog it's scratched tinker shed like crazy come to die by pro Porter in Ninety Days supply of dynamite\nI'm along comes to the Brett Kavanaugh opportunity\nTo demonstrate in a substantive way that you stand with North Dakota and ... and with President Trump when he is right for North Dakota and of course she not only did she fought against the confirmation of of a great judge who's by the way very good for North Dakota or many of his his opinions and dissent a defense\nCame of course the majority opinion and the Supreme Court over things like EPA overreach and in\nIn many areas what land water air a just a brilliant judge for for North Dakota when he's on the DC circuit and so she has this opportunity to to prove or brand and sheep blows it by voting against him and her whole brand went right out the window\nAnd then we're campus is like ...\n... if she just doesn't fit with the north Dakota's code a mindset in the\nThe spirit of North Dakota which is one of I hearty courageous a mile still still has that frontier feeling well then it's not a very populous a state but it's a pro Trump conservative\nPro Second Amendment of course and believe in fairness just general fairness in the cabinet deal just wasn't fair and I think most people just well that and I and so she's obviously not going to apologize for not supporting him but I think that was the\nThat broke the Democrats back\nIt was ... but at the same time you know I've had a double digit lead for quite a while on her and and I think the comparison was already resonating with with North Dakota and she just blew up with the cab nothing because again her everything she says\nIn a while on her and and I think the comparison was already resonating with with North Dakota and she just blew up with the cabinet thing because again her everything she pretended to be was revealed in one major illustration so and the fair to say she's really big but also\nShe's a former state attorney general she was a former North Dakota attorney general so the idea that you didn't understand fairness or due process or the value of it at a time Laura when the polls in North Dakota\nNever showed ... never showed even thirty percent support for a for opposing cabinet but rather short anywhere from sixty to fifty six sixty four percent\nFavoring confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh so\nIt wasn't like she didn't know where North Dakota and stood so she had a hard time and by the way even ... blaming her ... she changed her her opinion first she believed him and believed a progress report then she didn't believe\nHim but believe professor port and then it was not about that at all it was about his demeanor she watched his hearing or you know with the phone turned often noticed his demeanor\nYou know it's just ... it was phony on top of phony and again I think it was just the veil removed\nBecause everything you described about North Dakota's lord that the independent spirit the rug and is\nThe frontier spirit that's what she has pretended to be and now all of a sudden it's quite clear that she's really quite a liberal activist\nNo I think again people have been well they've been exposed during the Trump era\nThan media has had a ... mirror um I think raised up to their bias\nAnd it comes out in different ways but Trump really has driven people to just peroxide the frenzy and fury and upset and and the last always takes it too far they took it too far with\nKavanaugh or we don't know what's really going on with this these packages that were sent to Trump critics but I think people have a lot of theories there um and\nI and the leftist they're never satisfied with they get one thing and that's like okay we're going to go to the ... and now we're going to push for universal health care and it's going to be Medicare for all and it's going to be healthcare for illegal immigrants than\nA one lesson that you you know assuming un what's it looks like you're going to um Congress than in North Dakota or what lesson do you share with others who are listening across the country about about this period and politics and\nWhat we need to do to keep this prosperity going obviously the markets had a rough ride in last few days but in general things can't be couldn't be going much better on the economy\nNo you know the main lesson I Would share and and you know I was a energy regulator before I went to Congress six years ago in in North Dakota and the thing I Would share is\nLet's return to a respect for states ... you know the the these incredible laboratories of democracy called states will show the way in North Dakota chief among them and by the way\nSo will the soul of the states that I Would consider bad states places like California North Dakota is the second leading producer of oil in the in the country not because we produce more necessarily although we have a lot of it obviously in technologies unlocked it but but because places like California that have lots of it has screwed it up\nOkay they have a right to do that and and they have a right to have a a cost of living higher than than there are a ... quality of life\nBut I I'd say that the thing I'd say is this trust the laboratories of freedom at the state level and that's what President Trump\nAnd there are ... quality of life but I I'd say that the thing I'd say is this trust the laboratories of freedom at the state level and that's what President Trump has done he's restored\nSpeech rights and and that's what ... what do you have a cabinet does on the court and ... and just trust people at the most basic and local level and that means with their tax dollars that means with regulations it means having a respect for a return to\nCooperative federalism and you can find a federal government is far more efficient and much less necessary frankly in many cases and you'll have a you know you don't have a much better country in my view\nUm congressman finally or a month at a time but your thoughts on these packages arriving at the residences or offices of Trump's critics\nWell it's my first thought is as a as a member of Congress my first thought is you know here we go again and whether it's you know the left or the right we all need to be more diligent and it's frankly it's scary but my my main thought is let's please not jump to conclusions let's\nYou know this was less than twenty four hours oh let's let's calm down let's let the FBI and the other law enforcement agencies do their work and let's see we're all of this leads before we create something different than than the reality that that is behind it all and in the meantime it's always a good opportunity for self reflection on\nOn our own individual behavior in what contribution if any we make to this\nThis discourse that's going on this lack of civility without pointing fingers today I think it's a good time for us to look at ourselves\nYou know it's a great way of putting it um and we really wish you the very best in
