uh there there's nothing we can do to stop what happened last week\nDoes that sound hopeless it shouldn't do you want me to amend that there's very little we can do about a man\nOr who's got some

people\n[noise]\nI don't know what we can do against that this guy preached a bunch of hate and a bunch of anti Semitism my social media that's that's not against the law\nThat's a red flag but that's not against the law\n\nI suppose it would be one thing if he had posted on Facebook I Am going to go into a synagogue on Saturday and kill a bunch of innocent people well then I think right that's a

that\nEvil exists hate exists and there's very little we can do\nTo stop it\nIn fact as we've said before as we've said this evening the best we can do really keep our eyes and ears open when we see and hear of hate\nAnd then\n... report hate when you see it report threats when you see them\nAll ways but then\nThe best we can do in a free and open society is defend ourselves\n\nThat's the truth

there might have would have been a different story\nWe have to decide because we're not going to shut down this society we are not going to close this society so we have to decide\nWhether we are going to seriously defend ourselves\nEight five five six for two fifty six\nHundred and part of defending ourselves a big part of that\nIs training and arming people to protect innocent lives\n\nAnd

left did head that Republican baseball field last year you want to go down that road America didn't really\n\nThat the country's gotta decide either as a country we are going to decide that the person pulling the trigger the person stabbing with a knife the personal setting off the bomb\nThe person getting behind the wheel of a ban either they are the ones responsible for their hideous\nHateful

hearing a lot of people and conservative talk radio today saying that he he didn't he didn't like Trump that's a bunch of baloney he was a hate or on the right who hated Jews and he believed juice controlled\nTrump don't you dare say this is some leftist who hated Trump that's wrong\nBut I've got I've even got like a a couple of polls were taken over the weekend who's to blame for the hate right now\nWho's to blame for the hate in our body politic\nNo violence the harassment the ugliness who's to blame his Trump to blame is CNN in the media or they'd blame our Trump's critics on the
