and more here it's clearly not about Brett Kavanaugh and what he might have done thirty five years to go\nTo any woman it's clearly not about that again from the meat to perspective\nIt's all about being able to say in general that women are good there to be believed men are bad they're not to be believed\nIt's not about this case\nAnd that that headline makes clear no matter how this thing turns out me to baby the me too movement one\nJust taking down another man\nThat's what this article in the Washington Post today is saying just the act of taking down another man\nWhether that man

hope you've had a good week chills this weekend God Bless all of you thank you for listening to ... or follow me on Twitter at Walsh freedom or a year ago in Montana\nA candidate for Congress a Republican candidate for Congress was asked a question by a reporter\nHe didn't like the question so that candidate for Congress picked up the reporter and body slammed him\nThrough him to the ground and then that candidate for Congress jumped on top of the reporter and started punching him\nIt doesn't matter I guess that at first the congressmen to be a denied that this happened until he was caught on tape the entire incident was caught on tape\nBut that now congressmen or a was arrested or he pled guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge a instead of going to jail or he did\nTested or he pled guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge a instead of going to jail or he had to you know do community service anger management had to pay money to the reporter who suffered injuries\nSo that happened a year ago and the president\nFound himself in Montana last night at a rally and he got to talking about that incident last year the body slamming and he had the guy Greg gene forte he was in the audience right there and the president proceeded to praise\nWhat gene forte did he applauded what gene forte did\nAnd the crowd loved it and the crowd loved it I I just think and I'm\nI'm actually curious ... friday\nIs there anybody misty who's going to call me who thinks it's okay for a congressman to physically assault a reporter who asked him a question 'cause if you don't if you don't think it's okay for a congressman to physically\nAssaulted a reporter and by the way I think that's really important distinction you can laugh at people in the media you can mock them you can say hell ain't answering your question you can walk away you can do whatever you want but to physically assault a reporter who asked the question\nIs if you if you don't believe that's okay\nWell then I don't know how you can approve of what the president of the United states did last night because last night the president of the United states approved\nOh he loved ... gene four day did he applauded it he thought it was a great thing he praised it\nHe said Jean forte he's my kind of guy hey Devon ... number one again and\nYou know what I mean\n[noise]\nHe's my God give me ... number two again deaf and I heard about it\nThat way indoors ... very early but I had heard that he body slams a reporter [noise]\nAny which way I think it was way up and I said oh this was like\nThe election or just before\nAnd I said oh this is terrible in general is the elections and I said well wait a minute I Know Montana pretty well\nIt might help them\nGreat thing great thing it was awesome what he did help gene forte when 'cause that's Montana in Montana they love it when you beat up members of the media great thing in the crowd went crazy\n\nSo many of you rightly called into this show\nWhen Maxine Waters encouraged people on the left to get in the face of members of Congress are people who worked for Trump is Trump's administration that's just horrible she's encouraging\nViolence Joe that's terrible that's the mob that's like mob behavior\nWell here's the president United States\nEncouraging physical violence\nHere's the president United States\nEncouraging physical violence praising physical violence against the media\nAnd I hope I hope\nMost of Trump's supporters out there aren't saying yeah bring you know\nThat's a great thing\nBody slammed that CNN reporter let me go to Dan Dan your turn\nJoe I gotta wonder are you turn on the Democrat because if you do they're going to teach you to not go against your party and slam every candidate those Democrats they keep\nTheir mouth shut so I don't care if Clinton raped ... a day any words\nDate but when you got to stay on June ... shot up and then stay on with\nMe don't leave don't hang up stay on with me you asked me a question let me give you an answer and then I'll ask you a question in my turning democratic God no I I've never been a Democrat in my life let me ask you a question then\nIs it okay for a congressman to physically assault a reporter who asks him a question is that okay\nI don't believe it's okay for him to assault reporter but both will pay for school lease and all those Republicans no job no and hear anybody apologizing for raising the red or Dan and they're still doing and could you read it on people like that hey Dan bounce all over Trump\nDan Dan it's all are wrong isn't it physical violence correct\nWell sometimes it's needed and that will wait wait wait herself\nWait wait wait but if if if a reporter asked you a question and you pick him up and throw him to the ground in punch him that's not appropriate right\nI didn't I didn't say that was appropriate but don't you don't have the hammer Trump area than [laughter]\nOkay good I think we made some progress there\nIt's not good\nIt's not good and when somebody on the left gets violent and it's not good when a Republican gets violent and I don't think it's good when say somebody on the left get violent and then
