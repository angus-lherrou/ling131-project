head grass in between the edge of the track wall which is a\nWhich is a disaster waiting to happen for these gas recall you know we're we're all over the crack up a couple of cargo that grass while we'll ... voice\nThe car is you know we're we're all over the track and ended up a couple of cars got over that grasp of it while it was the word exotic voice\nHey except for the guy who was in the car saying yeah yeah well the guy from New Hampshire is there for a well he's right he's right off and on with this for a couple of years he wasn't drinking [laughter] hey what right now uh I\nI can verify were they were not that he's a little bit goofy ... kind of hard sale is the odd\nOne right yeah I'm going to ever on a a crazy guy but uh\nHe uh had got a ride into an aide gas car for the weekend the uh the guy who does acquaintance dot put him in and they gas car and I put him in their ration weather split up they filmed all week long interview all the drivers they spent about an hour each car doing interviews with you land or\nHow they're supposed to air this episode of\nLearning centers or twenty that too and they're hoping especially with this wrecked\nThat happened to have it to maybe this by ... through a show of background for your gas or coal or Discovery Channel for her to the hospital for you know ... ... with a possibility this working to show for sure\nWell this is great because you know you'll put on a great show in ... you know some of the guys had forgotten that is is a show for the crowd and yoga one heck of a show\nYeah and it it's it's all it's a lot of fun it was it was kind of unique having him out there and the hype it up a little bit and\nYou know kind of a push someone at your rival with and you know they they asked me you know there's one car you want to eat out here and I said I Want but you'd ever want to know that that what the answer they wanted to try to single out someone you know that you're kind of a rival\nYeah well you know when you want it means you beat everybody there [laughter] in fact\nWell I didn't and Josh was all over the wreck given the full scape about it on his interview I was like oh that car [laughter]\nBut they had a they tell you that spends a lot of the gas shops at a\nLoss in my work so that it's a it's it's definitely they have a\nWhole field or that they go to the series has their own see how cruel and drones and everything flying around and do they do a a like a forty five minute rice recap of their uh their their race that was used to talk to those guys you bring over\nThe whole entire field crews I started asking questions is is completely the you\nKnow I did they put makeup on you [laughter]\nKnow gay bike up is like\nMy [laughter] well you know we we have right face for radio danger of course I'm gonna have doing TV commercials nest the strangest thing I didn't pay me ... you know they put all the all the makeup bone you help me if I if I get in ... going to be bad [laughter]\nI kind of I think they paid on\n[laughter] I Am going to live on a piece you got a big [laughter]\nYes uh yeah that's definitely unique right there [laughter] visual [laughter] but ah\nBut yeah we're just we're we're trying to get to ... and just a prayer for this last race we uh we're just hoping to have a good finishing you know maybe we can end up in the top one two or three were where she had to retire but I don't know if we'll be the champion again the ship went there for the top\nBut you still racing for what I Know the the ... maybe get a you had some handling in some uh ... horsepower and the problem that are trying to get to go down to track you got to ask right now\nYou still racing for what I Know the the just say I mean he got a you had some handling in some uh football was easy to undo horse power and the problem that are trying to get to go down to try to get his right now\nWe've got that pretty much straight out it's a ... or ... years now and uh uh I think\nYou know that that would be a a top contender in a way definitely got it worked in the right direction\nThat is great because you know that a new car blues had motor problems heads a speech and probably you know just make you make people want to say you make these things from scratch in a you know you you you think they were rat but when you let go click who knows what's gonna happen\nThat's exactly right and at one of the neatest things ever at this last track of it was a jarring track we went through with with liberal up there and the guy said hey ah I'd have to check your neutral safety sweetness or rather its ... ate his mom [laughter]\nThat they're not worried about that they have a place with you on them\n[laughter] but that's what everything yeah everything\nJust went through
