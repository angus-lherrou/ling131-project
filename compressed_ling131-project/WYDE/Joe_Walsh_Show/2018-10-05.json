movement and what is wrong with what is happening to Brett Kavanaugh right now here's the headline the\nCabinet controversy is me to victory however it turns out\nOne more time Washington Post headline this morning the cabinet controversy is Amy to victory however it turns out\nWow so it's a victory for me to no matter how it turns out\nSo it's a victory for me to Brett Kavanaugh did not do anything\nHe's been accused of doing\nIt say victory for me to if these women are line or confused that's a victory for me to\n[noise] [noise]\nSeriously that's a victory for me to if these women who have all alleged that Kevin I did things\nIt's a victory if they're making everything up\nThat's me too is all about\nThe truth doesn't matter that's exactly what that Washington Post headline said this morning the truth it does not matter\n\nAnd you know what slaves me is the or the left Democrats rightly accuse President Trump of having a problem with the truth he does\nWell it seems to me that\nThe me too movement doesn't care about the truth either\n\nThis is a victory for me to\n\nJust taking Brett Kavanaugh down the facts be damned the truth be damned\nIt just taking Brett Kavanaugh down the facts be damned the truth be damned that's a a that's a victory like me to\nWho would be proud of that\nAnd ah Brett Kavanaugh\nUm\nHe he does not matter here at all does he\n\nSee clearly what where understanding more and more and more here and this headline\nReveals that more and more and more here it's clearly not about Brett Kavanaugh and what he might have done thirty five years to go\nTo any woman it's clearly not about that again from the meat to perspective\nIt's all about being able to say in general that women are good there to be believed men are bad they're not to be believed\nIt's not about this case\nAnd that that headline makes clear no matter how this thing turns out me to baby the me too movement one\nJust taking down another man\nThat's what this article in the Washington Post today is saying just the act of taking down another man\nWhether that man deserved to go down or not whether that man did anything wrong more not none of that matters\nThat all I guess the me too movement is all about just taking men down\nPeriod period\nCabinet Brett Kavanaugh collateral damage big what he he got caught up in the battle he got caught up in the hurricane men don't care about him any\n\nEight five five six for two fifty six hundred\n\nYou see what I mean about the absence of any balance you we've heard United States sends her speak this way\nIt doesn't matter if he did it or not he needs to be stopped I heard\nOr over the weekend some woman say this is about whether we're going to believe all women are not this Brett Kavanaugh saying\nIt's about whether we are going to believe all women are not and I I think I screamed at my TV no it's not it's about whether we're going to believe a doctor Christine Ford or not\nIt's about whether we believe her or not period it's not about whether we believe all women one man has been accused of doing something\nIt's not about whether we believe all women one man has been accused of doing something\n\nEight five five six for two fifty six hundred\nAnd I I guess the point I'm trying to make here is that what you and I think has fed up as we are with this whole freaking situation\nAt the end of the day you and I know it's it's about it should be about whether Brett Kavanaugh did what he was alleged to have done thirty five years ago\nNow I I Know like I don't even care about that and I know most to you don't either I'd confirmed me should be on the Supreme Court right now but if you did care about it all you care about is did he do it or not did he write did she do it or not\nAbsolutely plain and simple when you make it more difficult for a cop to do his job crime goes up and involved in most of these major cities we're talking about black on black crime we're talking

protests letter that and now he's now he's ... do you have that James he sounded really confused today let's listen\nAs of last night I had not heard from Senator Durbin and wasn't sure what he's referring to I just consulted with him a few moments ago I Know what he's referring to and I agree with Senator Durbin and you agree that there\nWere previous and there was ordered an FBI of sexual behavior inappropriate sexual behavior by doing that got on what I'm confirming that that's not let's be careful here for was a ... abuse and because it's one of two things I'm simply going to say I support Senator Durbin assertions\n[laughter] Mm I think they're just they don't know what to do at this point they thought one of these things is going to pan out I mean they say the stall ...\nI think it's good news for Republicans I really do I think now Republicans are more United than they've been since the day after the election maybe even more United and they'd been since nine eleven that's what I said last night and that's why I really believe or let's go to a JC Florida on line one Jaycee\nLaura I just wanted to say like most on the right I'm really happy and grateful that Lindsey Graham said what he said and continues to call up a left but\nWe've grown so accustomed to our representatives not really doing our job is pushing back not fighting left on a consistent basis so when one of them simply does their job and says what needs to be said all of a sudden we're treating them like a hero you know this should be the norm and not the exception\nSo this is ... and the others were sent to Washington to do and we're all wedding ourselves with excitement because someone did what they were hired to do and that's a shame\nThat they would do that that's a great point you know I think you know when I when I think that when people tweet around things like look a man helps an old lady across the street\n[laughter] or look ... look a uh uh uh someone helps in autistic kid in the in the\nSeven eleven you know that video of helping him stock things which is nice but that's what we should do right that's humanity that's humanity that's that that is what we all should be doing\nSo I guess it's better to celebrate that than just keep saying negative things around people so that it is nice but it's kind of an all I'm saying is it's kind of sad that we have to we have to note that when someone is doing the right thing instead of as our caller said that's just what you should be no yeah well\nSadly like there's so many representatives and senators they don't reflect the will of the people so when they do it you have your job on look them Lindsey Graham the other day he walked through a Fox out of the green room people who are applauding us he's walking down the hall\nAnd hands shaking him like he just came back from war but he made a speech and the committee defending the nominee that's what he did\nBy the way the Durban letter just quickly it says no where this is Dick Durban to ... a Senator Grassley\nNowhere in any of these six cabin or FBI reports which the committee has reviewed on a bipartisan basis was there ever a whiff of any issue at all related in any way to inappropriate sexual behavior or alcohol abuse\nHe won some of that released he thinks that the tweets that Grassley has been sending out miss characterize what's in these\nFBI find\nIt so it's each casting a poll that there might be more information about sex abuse or alcohol abuse in this FBI reports\nInteresting poll that there might be more information\nAbout sex abuse or alcohol abuse in this FBI report\nLet's go to Scott Connecticut on line three Scott ... the\nUh the I think a lot of people I've lost an appreciation for actually outposts found your through all the political saturation of ... you know the back and forth\nAre profoundly positive the exposure of the left or they're they're I mean they're rabid aggressive approach to New York to need need for power um it's\nIt's really almost like a like a drug addict addicted to the drug they're addicted to the pursuit of power so they'll do literally anything to get there and what's happened in this cabinet hearing is literally\nFrom what I you know for I'm I'm fifty three years old and from what I can see this is literally one of the most important periods of time to witness you know that that they it's their own destruction they did it to themselves but everybody else can now see I mean I've got plenty a Democrat from that or\nIt's just common sense you take a look at what what's been going on and everything they're loving it this guy and they're really taking themselves down they did it for themselves and it's very very obvious\nYeah that was the uh that was the open to the show last night now if there's any doubt in anyone's mind just how out of control the Democrat Party is how they want to so chaos\nWhere we should have calm where they want to rebel routes and intimidate instead of show results intimidation over ideas\nThat's where it is I think about it it's intimidation tactics you saw in the elevator and the restaurants in airports intimidation\nOver information\nAnd insights they intimidate this is all ... they're the biggest bullies in town they're intolerant other of other people's views well they claim to be the most tolerant they call you haters while they're the most hateful they say that you're anti immigrant when all they do is talk about white privilege\nRacist and you're they're obsessed with race we want all people to be treated the same\nThe rule of law should treat all people to St doesn't matter what color of your skin is when you cross the border illegally that's the that's why the law so important doesn't give preference over one group or another shouldn't\nA five five forty Laura\nFull I Believe that's coming up next a former assistant FBI or\nA staffer from New York as interesting insights on what we're about to find out or not about these reports\n[noise]\n\nThe ... that are real life story from community to management and\nI had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't pay my bills I was feeling so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and contacted trinity\nWell first of all the the original background investigation was at a public document data so why should the follow up investigation be a public document what I'm going to be very interested in St Lois how long it takes\nA for that information to leak out of the skiff that's where they have to go to look at it and who's gonna who's gonna lab that it's going to be ridiculous but it will come out sooner or later during the\n... what a skiff is I Know what it is that my orders\nWell basically the skip is is a room that's a soundproof or you can't hear you can hear in as you walk in there you can't carry in the cell phone ... watch or anything like that you can sit there and read it it's totally a lead enclosed room so nothing kind of trade said\nYou can sit and read the recent report not make a copy of it I don't know if they're going to allow him to make notes I don't know how they're going to stop that and um and then they can leave it for the next person to review but this is it's just a matter of time before or something like that leaks out bottom line is how many and abused you have to do are\nAs many it takes the delay this past the election that's what\nIt looks like they're out of cards so the the current mayor coming down on this don't you don't get that sense there's no there's no more delays are going to vote on this this weekend\nThink those should not be any more delays you do the best you can do and the bottom line is the only thing that the that the Democratic side of the house really wants to hear is how many more interviews you can come up with people day after day after day that have something negative to to allegedly offer\nIs how many more interviews you can come up with people day after day after day that have something negative to to allegedly offer ... and only to the way of looking at a a vote I think this is a ... it's going to be voted on I Believe by the end of the week\nThe um the complaint is that they did not\nLooking to judge Kavanaugh's drinking when he was in college and law school or high school that that wasn't adequately investigate it and the supplemental what was your response to that they\nDo they know that if they haven't read it how do they know what's in the supplemental you know they they don't know what questions are asked who was interviewed they might very well have interviewed a couple of guys that the the judge has some beers with\nOr who should yeah I had beers with them and nothing ever happened to you know they don't know that they just surprising that they just want to keep the pot stir it up in order to the you know continue that the alleged doubt\nA contrived out I look at it as by those that are opposed to the\n... we have an update here that Bill Bill a question for you Ronan Farrow in the New Yorker is reporting that ah the FBI prove ignored testimony from former classmates of cabin all these are people that went to Yale with him and uh they ... the ... they're trying to\nRonan Farrow claims that these are primary eyewitnesses are witnesses to the Deborah Ramirez allegations the\nProblem is as you read and to the store you realize these are all here say witnesses who claim somebody told them that somebody told them that this happened so would the FBI prove those people are they just seen as not credible witness is\nProbably not credible witnesses and and bottom line first of all it's coming from Ronan\nA secondly I'm a these if they're if they're not I witnesses after that they not permitted on the stand and a quarter law never mind are doing this and you have to make that cut off someplace into what is ... you know comment what does make sense to do\nAnd none of these people make sense and if anybody can come up with some sort of a story I heard from a friend of a friend that doesn't that doesn't carry any weight with anybody [noise] mhm\nWell again people think that the FBI is conducting\nSome global investigation into any allegation no matter how remote and interviewing people\nOn a hearsay basis where people have just hearsay recollections of things that happen Thirty years ago it make sense\nIt makes no sense for and that's not happening I think the problem that exists here are the bureau is going to get sucked on the one way or the other if it comes out the way it appears it's going to come out the the the the\nDemocratic side of the houses are going to say they're all from Trump bands from the bureau if it if for instance something comes out that that does give everybody a pause and ... and it's credible uh then you know the bureau's got to take a black guy from the other side of it I was\nI just think it's a it's a very tough way to go but it's an investigation that um was demanded and done and let's get the vote\nI think again in the end people want to have people have faith in our in our institutions of government especially like the FBI and you you don't want to believe that the FBI is acting\nIn a political manner ever and I think that the media do an enormous disservice went on an issue like this with no you know with with no corroborating contemporary contemporaneous\nWitnesses to expect field agents or the FBI to be doing these types of\nNo corroborating contemporary contemporaneous witnesses\nTo expect field agents or the FBI to be doing these types of\nYou know broad ranging ... is this kind of broad ranging slew thing into the background of some and this is not what the what the FBI does and people don't either get that or the media has been so remiss\nIn not reporting properly what the role of the FBI us but\nIf you see the ignorance that it's a willful ignorance of the media and then the the poor people who don't know any better or who don't have time to delve into these issues like wait why are they keeping the secret outrageous this shouldn't be secret this is our Supreme Court you know that's going to happen\nOf course it's going to happen we right this is a combination of everything that you should or bottom line is the some of these people\nReally don't believe that there's anything going on that's wrong here it's because of who they support they have to say well I Believe that the judge Kevin I was guilty you can't look at the facts and come out with that conclusion\nBut they do
