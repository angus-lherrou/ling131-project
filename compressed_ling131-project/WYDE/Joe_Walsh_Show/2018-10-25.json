to victory however it turns out\nWow so it's a victory for me to\nNo matter how it turns out\n\nSo it's a victory for me to Brett Kavanaugh did not do anything\nHe's been accused of doing\n\nIt say

matter\n\nAnd you know what slaves me is the or the left Democrats rightly accuse President Trump of having a problem with the truth he does\nWell it seems to me that\nThe me too movement doesn't care about the truth either\n\nThis is a victory for me to\n\nJust taking Brett Kavanaugh down the facts be damned the truth be damned\nIt just taking Brett Kavanaugh down the facts be damned the truth be

more here and this headline\nReveals that more and more and more here it's clearly not about Brett Kavanaugh and what he might have done thirty five years to go\nTo any woman it's clearly not about that again from the meat to perspective\nIt's all about being able to say in general that women are good there to be believed men are bad they're not to be believed\nIt's not about this case and that that headline makes clear no matter how this thing turns out me to baby the me too movement one\nJust taking down another man\nThat's what this article in the Washington Post today is saying just the

I think I screamed at my TV no it's not it's about whether we're going to believe a doctor Christine Ford or not\nIt's about whether we believe her or not period it's not about whether we believe all

guess the point I'm trying to make here is that what you and I think as fed up as we are with this whole freaking situation\nAt the end of the day you and I know it's it's about it should be about whether Brett Kavanaugh did what he was alleged to have done thirty five years ago\nNow I I Know like I don't even care about that and I know most to you don't either I'd confirmed me should be on the

know why the auto he ought to try to lower the temporal lobe it\n\nHe ought to be president to night of the whole country\nDeliver a serious sober brief speech from the White House\nLibera serious
