victory\nHowever it turns out wow so it's a victory for me to no matter how it turns out\nSo it's a victory for me to Brett Kavanaugh did not do anything he's been accused of doing\n\nIt say victory for me to if these women are line\nOr confused that's a victory for me to [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nSeriously that's a victory for me to if these women who have all alleged that Kevin I did things\nIt's a victory if they're making everything up\nThat's me too is all about\nThe truth doesn't matter that's exactly what that Washington Post headlines said this morning the truth it does not matter\n\nAnd you know what slaves me is the or the left Democrats rightly accuse President Trump of having a problem with the truth he does\nWell it seems to me that\nThe me too movement doesn't care about the truth either\n\nThis is a victory for me to\n\nJust taking Brett Kavanaugh down the facts be damned the truth be\n\nIt just taking Brett Kavanaugh down the facts be damned the truth the damn that's a a that's a victory like me to\nWould would be proud of that\nAnd ah Brett Kavanaugh\nUm\nHe he does not matter here at all does he see clearly what where understanding more and more and more here and this headline\nReveals that more and more and more here it's clearly not about Brett Kavanaugh and what he might have done thirty five years to go\nTo any woman it's clearly not about that again from the meat to perspective\nIt's all about being able to say in general that women are good there to be believed men are bad they're not to be believed\n\nIt's not about this case and that that headline makes clear no matter how this thing turns out me to baby the me too movement one\nJust taking down another man\nThat's what this article in the Washington Post today is saying just the act of taking down another man\nWhether that man deserved to go down or not whether that man did anything wrong or not none of that matters at all I guess the me too movement is all about just taking men down\nPeriod period\nCabinet Brett Kavanaugh collateral damage big what he he got caught up in the battle he got caught up in the hurricane men don't care about him any\n\nEight five five six for two fifty six hundred\n\nYou see what I mean\nAbout the absence of any balance\nYou we've heard\nUnited States sends or speak this way it doesn't matter if he did it or not he needs to be stopped I heard\nOr over the weekend some woman say this is about whether we're going to believe all women are not this Brett Kavanaugh saying\nIt's about whether we are going to believe all women are not and I I think I screamed at my TV no it's not it's about whether we're going to believe a doctor Christine Ford or not\nIt's about whether we believe her or not period it's not about whether we believe all women one man\nHer or not period it's not about whether we believe all women one man has been accused of doing something\n\nEight five five six for two fifty six hundred\nAnd I I guess the point I'm trying to make here is that what you and I think as fed up as we are with this whole freaking situation\nAt the end of the day you and I know it's it's about it should be about whether Brett Kavanaugh did what he was alleged to have done thirty five years ago\nNow I I Know like I don't even care about that and I know most to you don't either I'd come from them you should be on the Supreme Court right now but if you didn't care about it all you care about is did he do it or not did he write did she do it or not\nAbsolutely plain and simple when you make it more difficult for a cop to do his job crime goes up and involved in most of these major cities we're talking about black on black crime we're talking about black lives being lost\nYou know the irony it's mostly the black communities

a comprehensive investigation but then Trump said this give me number five\nWas that being said I'd like to go quickly and the reason I'd like to go quickly very simple so simple because it's unfair to him at this point\nSo you figure you figure where we're at let me go to Jeff Jeff\nThat you are you doing I'm you know what I'm going to START I had to leave it all the ten trash bags by ten trash

done\n[noise] a thanks Jeff let's not get worked up about it this week that's my vice let me go to Eddie hey Eddie you're on with Joe Walsh\nJoe thanks for taking my call I was going to give you I tried to get in on friday and wasn't able to get through uh the fact that they've allowed this to go another step\nIs just so just to point um I I I think we're going to do this I think it's going to go through this week but I don't think having a ... it's going to be confirmed everybody had made their mind up already this is all just a big show and such but I I completely agree with you I'm staying out of it I'm not thrown in industry\nBut it's going to be so bad because I really believe he's not going to get in time\nAnd it's just a shame and I I watch what our senator from Illinois I get to that man yeah and and I want to move out of the state I'm so disgusted by Senator Durbin and ... ... it was appalling appalling what he did\nAnd you know Eddie I agree don't move out of Illinois because the Durban do move out of Illinois because of the taxes that's much better reason look don't I I I agree with that though everybody um don't let this week the last week there's nothing more that we can do\nAnd as far as the Democrats go guys\nThey don't matter here please know that I Want to say this again\nThe FBI's got a week this week and they're gonna\nCome back and it's going to we're either going to be where we were at the end of last week they're just going to confirm what the Senate told us or there might be something new and if we're where we are at the end of last week all the Republicans are going to vote for Kevin Oh we do not need a Democrat\nVote the Democrats\nNo longer matter in this process if the FBI just confirms what we know we don't need them if the FBI finds out that Brett Kavanaugh has been lying as I said\nAnd I hope and pray that that's not going to be the case but if we find out he's been line he doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court anyway so the Democrats don't matter I'm Joe Walsh don't go anywhere [noise]\nWell Richard I'm In answer like this no and the Supreme Court is necessary but you are rights or the Supreme Court right now is is doing things our founding fathers never envisioned\nAnd that's because the legislative branch has stopped doing their job and and they've seen it a lot of it to the president and they've seen it a lot of it to the courts what has to happen is Congress needs to do their job and take back all of their powers\nFrom the court's Richard thank you you're on it man you're absolutely

look at ... am I boycotting sure I'm boycotting them I I I'm enjoying my life without the NFL I Love football man I Love football uh but I so I don't watch I don't watch the NFL\nI'm ... and don't look I I Know that that I Am broadcasting out of Chicago\nAnd I know the bears one yesterday and there are three and one and probably Ninety percent of the people listening to me right now or Chicago Bears fans so what I'm about to say is probably going to anger all of them but I I don't not like the bears but I've never really been a bears fan\nI've kind of always sort of been a Packers fan don't get mad at me I don't love the Packers I just love Aaron Rodgers I'm a big Aaron Rodgers guy\nThe quarterback for the Packers there I'm done don't get mad at me did you see that flag that the Green Bay Packers of being a humongous flag that took up about a third of the field in Green Bay\nOr that they they displayed on the field during\nThe pregame ceremony at limbo field before the game yesterday it was a huge fly again took up about a third of the field and it had a red stripe a white stripe and then a blue stripe with\nWhite stars it was not the American flag not even close just a big black or read and then a white stripe in the middle and then a blue stripes and there were some white stars nobody knew what it was\nThe uh the commentary on social media was hilarious the color commentator I guess on TV said I don't know what flag that is I don't know what country that comes from but I'm not I'm not I'm not putting my hand over my heart for that flag that's not the American flag it was in the American flag\nAbsolutely crazy the Green Bay Packers issued a statement today that said the banner used during Sundays pregame ceremony supplemented the three us flags on the roof of the stadium\nAnd the flag carried by the color guard on the field we've used such displays from time to time in the past when other pre game elements take up a significant portion of the field the Green Bay Packers announced they will never ever ever use that\nIn other pre game elements take up a significant portion of the field the Green Bay Packers announced they will never ever ever use that flag again because the Green Bay Packers caught so much grief rightly and they should have\nAnd I guess there was like massive confusion that limbo feel nobody in the joint knew what this what this flag was\nPeople were trying to figure out what country this flag comes from cut it out I'm not just telling the Packers now I'm Talking to everybody if you're gonna if you're going to have a flag has a big banner on your field during pre game ceremonies it had better be the American flag I'm so damned tired of\nI'm so tired of of people are so many interest in this country reflects simply\nBe like being embarrassed to be proud to be American it's like it's like I guarantee you the Packers\nDidn't want to offend anybody by using the real the actual American flag what what were they thinking\nIt would be like I mean can you imagine an NFL game pregame ceremony and they uh they they unfurled Mexican flag or the French flag they'd be run out of town or they should have been run out of town Green Bay should have", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Joe Walsh Show", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "02"}
