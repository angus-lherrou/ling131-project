see clearly what where understanding more and more and more here and this headline\nReveals that more and more and more here it's clearly not about Brett Kavanaugh and what he might have done thirty five years to go\nTo any woman it's clearly not about that again from the meat to perspective\nIt's all about being able to say in general that women are good there to be believed men are bad they're not to be believed\nIt's not about this case\n... that headline makes clear no matter how this thing turns out me to baby the me too movement one\nJust taking down another man\nThat's what this
