turns out\nSo it's a victory for me to Brett Kavanaugh did not do anything he's been accused of doing\n\nIt say victory for me to if these women are line\nOr confused\nThat's a victory for me to [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nSeriously that's a victory for me to if these women who have all alleged that Kevin I did things\nIt's a victory if they're making everything up\nThat's what me too is all about\nThe truth doesn't matter that's exactly what that Washington Post headlines said this morning the truth it does not matter\n\nAnd you know what slaves me is the or the left Democrats rightly accuse President Trump of having a problem with the truth he does\nWell it seems to me that\nThe me too movement doesn't care about the truth either\n\nThis is a victory for me to\n\nJust taking Brett Kavanaugh down\n\nFacts be damned the truth be damned\n\nIt just taking Brett Kavanaugh down the facts be damned the truth be damned that's a a that's a victory like me to who would be proud of that\n\nAnd ah Brett Kavanaugh\nUm\nHe he does not matter here at all does he see clearly what where understanding more and more and more here and this headline\nReveals that more and more and more here it's clearly not about Brett Kavanaugh and what he might have done thirty five years to go\nTo any woman it's clearly not about that again from the meat to perspective\nIt's all about being able to say in general that women are good there to be believed men are bad they're not to be believed\n\nIt's not about this case ... that headline makes clear no matter how this thing turns out me to baby the me too movement one\nJust taking down another man\nThat's what this article in the Washington Post today is saying just the act of taking down another man whether that man\nDeserved to go down or not whether that man did anything wrong or not none of that matters\nAt all I guess the me too movement is all about just taking men down\nPeriod period\nCabinet Brett Kavanaugh collateral

whether we're going to believe all women are not this Brett Kavanaugh saying\nIt's about whether we are going to believe all women are not and I I think I screamed at my TV no it's not it's about whether we're going to believe a doctor Christine Ford or not\nIt's about whether we believe her or not period it's not about whether we believe all women one man\nIt's about whether we believe her or not period it's not about whether we believe all women one man has been accused of doing something\n\n[noise] eight five five six for two fifty six hundred\nAnd I I guess the point I'm trying to make here is that what you and I think as fed up as we are with this whole freaking situation\nAt the end of the day you and I know it's it's about it should be about whether Brett Kevin I did what he was alleged to have done thirty five years ago\nNow I I Know like I don't even care about that and I know most to you don't either I'd confirmed me should be on the Supreme Court right now but if you did care about it all you care about is did he do it or not did he write did he do it or not\nAbsolutely plain and simple when you make it more difficult for a cop to do his job crime goes up\nAnd

Scott Walker's fine he'll get reelected in Wisconsin we don't have to worry about Walker\nYou know we got our governor race we got our election problems down here in Illinois and there are other Republican governors around the country who are in trouble but not Scott Walker well yeah Scott Walker is in trouble in fact he's down right now\n\nAnd I don't think it's because of anything bad Scott Walker's done right I think the reason Scott Walker is fighting for his political life right now has everything to do with what this political year is right now\nThat's all that's all\nThree one two six for two fifty six hundred or give me a call let me go to Greg Greg you're on with Joe\nHey how are ya I'm good man the thing I don't understand\nIs maybe the psychology of the Wisconsin voter I Know things are better there and I know you you have a bunch a rabbit Democrats that are going to come out and vote against anything even if it's in their economic interest it shouldn't\nYou know to do so yeah um but I\nOr that it's it's the it's just the average Wisconsin's voter apathetic that do the the that we've come a long way from where we were and\nWhere are you asking a city that I I just guess I Know you know a little bit psychology\nYeah you know it's you know it's interesting so much my answer to you would be you're right\nA Wisconsin's doing pretty well right now Wisconsin's doing pretty damn well under Walker so to me when I look at this stuff and this is similar to other polls I've seen around the country it tells me it's got nothing to do with what we're about\nTo have you know you know what a great it's like\nHey Greg thanks so I'm going to hang up you can listen to my answer because you've got about ten different things going on there it's got it's got nothing to do with Walker it has to do with the climate right now and we are in a climate right now that has one side extremely fired up\nLike I think I think these polls coming out of Wisconsin make clear that there are a lot of Democrats in Wisconsin who are getting a vote in November who don't ordinarily vote in midterms\nI I Want to remind everybody typically more Republicans vote in the midterms than Democrats Democrats tend to come out in presidential elections but I think because the Trump right because the Trump Trump Trump is he's he's fired up our\nSide Andy's\nFired up the opposition now the advantage the opposition has\nUp our side Andy fire up the opposition now the advantage the opposition has is they're angry this got nothing to do with Walker\nGot nothing to do with Walker it has everything to do with the climate we're in right now and that's the point I'm trying to make that's why to me this is a wake up call for Republicans and conservatives have male\nYes you're right about the climate\nIn this country um but the truth I was reading I look at those polls are like you said you can't look at when you got to look at all of them together yeah and one the skewed to the left or the other shoe to the right but you try to meld them together but the two things that they stand out\nAre women with college degrees yeah you can go heavily democratic and the other foreign in this according to this hour recalls looking at the big picture that help from was the agricultural community\nOr with the terrorists now in China they're hurting and the Democrats are banging on the door with these these terrorists and they gave specific example\nYeah which is a big ... how do we how do we get another one having a big menu and they're they're being ... out of European China because terrorists than people in there that that means just hitting that and the guy and thanks for listening to me I really appreciate you got a great show\nNeal thank you man thanks thanks for checking in let me quickly get to Bryan before I hop hey Brian you're on with Joe\nHow's it going I'm good man okay so I'd have to say that it's a combination of Republicans out being strong enough right now and\nSo Democrats are fired up yes here in Illinois most certainly around or has been as weak as anyone can get and that's why you see J. B. Pritzker almost twenty points ahead of him\nYeah you know Brian suffice to say we have our own unique issues and problems here in the state of Illinois that's why I wanted to put Scott Walker in front of everybody Scott Walker right now is in the fight of his political life\nUm that should wake you up to the fact that our side had better get moving we got three to four weeks to turn this thing

I go on him to cater to the Democrats have you go what they're doing and he should have\nBeen accused of of of being wrong then defeated gone down there and paid more attention instead he showed leadership you do what you were supposed to have the ... or ... you were suffering because\n[noise] so I see a red wave in our area I don't know of any Democrats are going to be elected year I'm I'm just like\nMy own ... like you got to ... to the right thing on Kavanaugh I mean\nHe that would have been a real kick in the stomach of conservatives if he hadn't voted for Kevin ... so that's a good thing\nI'm going to look at the glass half full here because that's the only way you can go forward or the Federal Reserve though I Trump is I was going to do a segment on this last night on the show and we we we were so jammed up we couldn't do it or going to do it tonight on the anger mangled so tuned in ten pm eastern Fox News\n\nFund starts to move indoors with friends and family so make sure your most important home improvement project is handled with select winds dot com interior designers agree that one of the easiest ways to improve rooms appearance is by upgrading your old blind shades and shutters\nAnd of course now as Donald Trump doesn't care about the victims\nYeah which is which is nonsense I mean it's very clear that the\nPresident and his entire team had been working very closely with the governors of Florida Alabama and Georgia and I think it inappropriate time the president will go down to visit but as you know\nA head he tried to go down last night it would have been a nightmare because that would divert all ... all of the various workers away from what they should be doing to trying to take care of the president's fate so he'll get their president but I also wanted to be just whatever Donald Trump does\nHe's gonna be attacked these people don't like him they wake up in the morning they say I Know what he's done something terrible what is it and that's kind of their approached everything right now and it makes them frankly a little bit nutty\nWell and I think that uh again the the theory and the friends the ah has gotten to a point I knew that when I was talking to folks yesterday who were in Washington in the Nineteen sixty eight riots after Martin Luther king and Robert Kennedy uh both assassinated\nAnd they were saying that they hadn't seen anything is is angry and frenzied since then do you think that's accurate\nAnd they were saying that they hadn't seen anything is is angry and frenzied since then do you think that's accurate\nYeah I think I think basically you had extraordinary intensity up through\nWatergate you had a memory at a million people surrounding the Pentagon at one point or you had soldiers who found that they couldn't go through airports that are being harassed a man who is a very bitter very divisive time\nUh but I think after that\nUh we became sort of more normal for a while and uh now we're drifting back\nA because this is a genuine a cultural civil war I mean you know [noise] what Hillary Clinton said it wasn't inaccurate that shot some people but she's basically right or when we're point or somebody like a justice cabin on\nIts because we want to return to a constitutionally based court system\nThat uses the American system is this model not some European or South African or other kind of system and as a result if your a left wing a Democrat we we we are the end of your world ... you know they had hope desperately\nTo change America and now the American people are responding and saying no we don't want to say we liked Being American and I think that has become just an enormously good or blow for the\nPeople who who thought up into election night two thousand sixteen they were ... Hillary Clinton who's gonna win think about the two justices you've got\nAnd he'll or even ... oh my God you know they they'd be so far to the left and so so unwilling to look at the American constitution that it will really been a very dramatic difference compared to where we are now\nOr I Want to play for you I'm Larry ... who of course famously bombed in his protections for twenty sixteen but nevertheless has this production for the midterms\nIf there has ever been an abnormal presidency where he had it\nAnd the Trump is violated so many of the rules of politics in so many of the norms of politics a red wave ain't gonna happen it's just a question of how big the blue wave is they can be sued ami it could be a middle sized way they can be a small way it's going to be a blue wave\nOr what is your reaction thought\nWell maybe he's right but it probably isn't I'm In the first question I asked is how come we just won a you a state Senate special election\nIn Texas state Senate seats in Texas were bigger than congressional seats eight hundred thousand people along the border sixty three percent are Hispanic or and we won the first time in a hundred and thirty nine years what's his explanation\nOr how come a mix Sally the Republican nominee and Arizona's now ahead or how come that er Kramer the Republican candidate in North Dakota is ahead by maybe fourteen points or in his in ah\nTennessee as people begin to realize the British and actually the Democrat actually wrote a book explaining that Obamacare didn't go far enough and explaining how you could get to a government run health system ... starting to fall apart mhm antennas she is going to end up affecting reprogram Germans getting a sense of\nYou know somebody out of self sabotage and say oh where's the where's the blue wave in the Senate I don't think it exists\nNow and of course we see these races and\nWhere is the worst of the blue wave in the Senate I don't think it exists\nNow and of course we see these races\nAnd some of these governors races the one that I'm really watching is the Andrew Gillum versus Ron I'm a scientist because for me and for so many of watch the growth of Florida and\nHow well it's been a run by Rick Scott and and to the idea of turning that state over as critical as that state is that a country electoral politics\nTo a guy who is basically a socialist is just that just cannot happen\nThen yeah he's got millions and millions of dollars nude from all the usual suspects\nCharlie Chaplin I mean you'll um is ah\nThe latest great hope because you came out of nowhere as a radical Democrat uh he won an upset victory or eat the key temporarily looks very good\nI think you'll be fading day by day as this goes on but ... but when you say governorships remember that there's a study that just came out the ten most popular governors in states\nAre all Republican every single one of the ten highest rated governors or Republican or the governor of Massachusetts hardly a red state is gonna win in a landslide the governor of Maryland hardly a red state is gonna win in a landslide\nAnd the reason is exactly why uh we're building a majority in the country they get results\nThey don't just have resistance are they actually have things that work they don't just have fantasies and strange ideas\nAnd I think we have to be prepared to wage a campaign that drives home again and again and again the difference between a the kind of left wing fantasies that are not you can't afford them you can implement I'm ah in the long run they're not going to work\nAnd I think that's one of our key jobs this campaign is to draw the distinction between results and resistance and certainly the attorney General Holder was a perfect example of the resistance as the alternative\nYeah I I really think and again we'll see how it translates into turn out I think those images of the protesters banging on the Supreme Court doors completely out of control\nA I think that's I I don't think people like that they might not like everything Trump tweets or they might be annoyed at some of the things he says are exaggerates crowds I what I get that but I think the\nThis frenzy people want it all to calm down they just want things to come down they want to come down on both sides\nAnd I so I think the Democrats made a really bad miscalculation on this ... thing and\nI think it puts them in a much more vulnerable place in a midterm cycle that they thought they you know they were going to just roll right into with you know fifty seat pickup ah so that's my sense of it in holders comments\nMaxine Waters I don't know I think all of it is it gives people a bad feeling\nWell and I think you can draw the contrast you mean here you have an economy which is booming at a level people said was impossible your jobs being created yoga lowest black on unemployment in history the lowest Latino unemployment in history or you have\nA remarkable achievers would deregulation you have solid conservative judges being appointed so every time you turn around right now you're seeing genuine results\nAnd then you have as you point out uh people who seem crazed uh I mean is this ...\nBut now you're seeing genuine results\nAnd then you have as you point out uh people who seem crazed\nUh I mean is this really the America you want you really want people who come into a restaurant to harass people and drive them out when people banging on the Supreme Court doors are and I and I think in some cases of course we know the George stores and others actually pay for them or which doesn't you know does that justify him\nBut the whole system that the left to try to create I think is in the end or not a sustainable systems\nNewt I Know you're doing a lot of uh of events before the midterm elections and there's one on October fifteenth or where\nYou can register to attend an evening with Newt Gingrich and you'll be able to hear you talk about\nWhat's in store for the country what's at stake for the country in the mid term so how do people end up uh attending this do they do and\nAnd and let me let me just say also that we're we're very excited they can go to\nAn evening with Newt dot com or just repeat the an evening with Newt dot com Leo beep and I are going to be they're talking about our American stories and I'm going to take questions and frankly let the audience to direct me I'm going to let them sort of pick what other topics we should talk about", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Joe Walsh Show", "city":
