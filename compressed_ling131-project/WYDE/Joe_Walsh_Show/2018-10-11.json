is all about\nThe truth doesn't matter that's exactly what that Washington Post headline said this morning the truth it does not matter\n\nAnd you know what slaves me is the or the left Democrats rightly accuse President Trump of having a problem with the truth the does\nWell it seems to me that\nThe me too movement doesn't care about the truth either\n\nThis is a victory for me to\n\nJust taking Brett Kavanaugh down\nThe facts\n\nIt just taking Brett Kavanaugh down the facts be damned the truth be damned that's a a that's a victory like me to\nWho would be proud of that\nAnd ah Brett Kavanaugh\nUm\nHe he does not matter here at all does he see clearly what where understanding more and more and more here and this headline\nReveals that more and more and more here it's clearly not about Brett Kavanaugh and what he might have done thirty five years to go\nTo any woman it's clearly not about that again from the meat to perspective\nIt's all about being able to say in general that women are good there to be believed men are bad they're not to be believed\nIt's not about this case\n... that headline makes clear no matter how this thing turns out me to baby the me too movement one\nJust taking down another man\nThat's what this article in the Washington Post today is saying just the act of taking down another man whether that\nMan deserved to go down or not whether that man did anything wrong or not none of that matters that all I guess the me too movement is all about just taking men down\nPeriod period\nCabinet Brett Kavanaugh collateral damage big what he he got

whether we believe all women one man has been accused of doing something\n\n[noise] eight five five six for two fifty six hundred\nAnd I I guess the point I'm trying to make here is that what you and I think as fed up as we are with this whole freaking situation\nAt the end of the day you and I know it's\nIt's about it should be about whether Brett Kevin I did what he was alleged to have done thirty five years ago now I I Know like I don't even care about that and I know most to you don't either I'd come from them you should be on the Supreme Court right now but if you did care about it\nAll you care about is did he do it or not did he did he do it or not\nAnd involved in most of these major cities we're talking about black on black crime we're talking about black lives being

going to do that weren't going to do the same thing now will it work well I don't know I don't know but it may here's the thing it may fire up their voters for this November\nAnd that's what I mostly concerned about let me go to Matt ...\nIt could be like Oh thank you so that's why I'm not concerned and what else we sleep at night time I tried to discuss politics in front of my customers and family and friends but I should say over the last six months a lot of folks\nWho have been heard Democrats supporters and for many votes very good reasons and they're all our in\nOur abandoning ship or they're shooting the games that are taking place and you're transpiring and I do believe there is a Red Sea that's rising and there is a little slow good conservative I'm Wally intact Christians still um you know a stand by their beliefs and a lot of folks are empowered by the U.S\nAnd just like a presidential election they're going to be out there where the silent majority we aren't being Paul\nI'm I'm On social media and constantly on Instagram and Facebook are encouraging folks to go register to vote coming up and I enjoy your show it was so social media sites are playing games on a giant pools are folks talking about how they're going to come over to the conservative side of folks say\nVote yeah because yeah because we're playing yeah are are are unrealistic\nGod Bless you Matt from your lips to God's Ears let's hope you're right right let's hope there's a giant red wall that will hold in this blue wave but Matt here's the way I look at it I don't want to lose so I'm expecting there to be a blue wave I don't want to dismiss it I'm expecting that the Democrats are going to be fired up\nI I I'm assuming they are\nIt's like when you're a candidate you assume you're ten Fifteen twenty points down so that you run hard to the finish line I Want every Republican in every conservative to come out and vote and knowing and believing that the Democrats are coming out and vote and and get a vote in huge numbers maybe that will get us fired up\nTo do the same it should be easy but we got to get our folks out\nThe data so far since the whole Kavanaugh saying how to summarize it it's fired Republicans up ended also fire Democrats up it's fired both bases up show what you were seen is you're seen especially in the Senate most people believe that Kavanaugh saying\nWe'll help the Republicans keep the United States Senate and may help the Democrats\nTake control of the house because the base that Kavanaugh saying\nFired up the Republican base and most of these critical Senate races are in red states where you got a lot of Republican base voters so you're seeing states like North Dakota and Tennessee\nAnd Indiana are beginning to come home Republicans in base voters begin to come out\nThat's a good thing now the flip of that is your\nAre beginning to come home Republicans in base voters begin to come out that's a good thing\nNow the flip of that is you're seen in a lot of ... in a lot of house races especially house races in the suburbs you're seeing that seemed to more blue because you've seen a lot of women\nA move away from Trump since the Kavanaugh sang let me go to mark hey mark\nHow are ya I'm good man I'm a I think one thing that that I'm fifty three years old and I I never uh and I'm a pilot and I've never seen a president after an election go through like a checklist and and and just pick up things on at the end of that he ran for his campaign\nAnd let Frederick today everybody at the last caller did about the lack of buying the Republican Party but for me to the solidarity that is that they shown the gamut of calls to support on\nThe ah the sport a half an hour yeah many other things that and basically the lunacy that's
