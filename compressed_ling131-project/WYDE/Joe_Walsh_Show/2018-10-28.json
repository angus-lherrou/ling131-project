[noise] do you do thirty Seventy ... Birmingham W. B. J. C. H. D. to Birmingham\n[noise]\nThere are [noise]\nYou [noise]\n[noise]\nI'm ... years region now the\nSame man [noise] read\nEach and every one of us has a way that we can make a difference sometimes we don't even realize what we have within us until we face those special challenges the merchant voucher talked to was a tragic accident\nAnd found within himself the ability to overcome and also encourage and inspire other people\nWho I'm Talking about is Thomas Stephenson and now he's with tenacity tenacity is an organization that he has founded along with his wife to try to help others when they're in a accident that they need physical therapy\nAnd Thomas is doing something really special this weekend as he Raj then that just trace for twenty four straight hours and welcome to the show Thomas\nThank you glad to be here glad you could join me on the ... show and I appreciate your time and your effort if you would tell us your story about the accident and what happened to you and maybe even tell us just prior how things were before the accident as well\nSure sure so uh so it was December let them twenty fourteen hours a day of the accidents um I was Twenty one years old so you know everybody can do the math figure it out to answer day but uh\nUh you know prior to that I'd been a an athlete my wife by play baseball and basketball my whole life or my dad was an avid runner and cyclists and so I was a cycle from a young age and and the road my bike a lot and that was one of my biggest fashioned her life\nAnd ah you know I I I Would\nI I was never going to be a college athlete or a professional athlete but uh you know I played sports bonfire wife\nAnd you know at at Twenty one years old I think most of us are very bright eyes and and have the whole world in front of us and a lot of possibilities for a future and\nUh obviously a lot of that change on December ... ... ah I was planning to go visit my best friend in Charlottesville, Virginia I live in ... station Kan city right below Nashville\nAnd uh I was preparing for a ten hour trip Charlottesville\nAnd that was on the interstate eight forty thousand natural some sports are probably familiar with\nAnd uh you know like a lot of people I was driving probably the safest I've ever driven I my wife goes six am I ready for a long road trip so other\nMeeting or doing anything crazy all over the last line of the interstate at ... cruise control and and actually our number is is found that you know the only way I Know how to describe it as it is without a bit of explosion a and\nAnd to the next thing I remember is is the sound that you know the only way I Know how to describe it as is the sound of an explosion uh and uh I remember looking down the hood of my truck as it was political and the air um and the next\nThirty seconds or so a pretty blurry um but I kinda came to a when my truck was laying on the passenger side door on the side of the interstate\nAnd a gentleman on the in the oncoming lanes uh and the other direction and had had a blowout and he had a tire blow out on so called lost control and came across the grassy median and just due to the heart of my truck and uh the debt with a grassy median uh I never saw combat\nOr and he hit me head on and about Seventy five miles an hour ... and when he hit me I'm a fuel line in my truck burst or an immediately but my truck caught on fire and my trip down the interstate about the links with the football field before it came to rest\nOn the passenger side door so when I kinda came to you know I I had that moment where\nI wasn't really sure what had happened I knew I had probably been in a car accident but like I said I never saw him come and so I had no idea what what had just occurred but I seem to be okay I didn't see any blood I didn't feel any pain and see anything sticking out a anywhere\nAnd so I thought well I'm just I'm just going to stay in my truck in and wait for held like somebody can tell me what had happened or this point I was too foggy to know that my truck was on fire\nAnd it was about that time that that I I heard a voice a shouting at me and I looked at my windshield and there was a man running towards my truck chatting that I had to get out there that my truck was on fire until I told him I said okay you know no problem I'm I'm not hurt him good\nAnd so I Am buckled my seatbelt or what's going to attempt to saying my passenger side door and kind of pull myself up out of the driver's side window and a collapsed no and that's when I\nRealized that I was not it was okay as I thought I was a so I was able to grab the steering wheel a thankfully my arms were not broken a grab the steering wheel myself up right and that's not what now than and realize that I'm much my lower body had been pretty mangled a an accident\nAnd uh you know thanks a lot of adrenaline old feeling much pain but that I told them gentleman I said to you know I'm I'm a little more damage than I thought I was I'm going to need your help get now and so thankful he he saved my life that day or help pull me out of the truck\nAnd uh as he carried me away or you know before I could not walk or I look back at my my truck was fully engulfed I was a thirty seconds to uh minutes away from being trapped in my truck or as totally burned well what was that gentleman's name\nOr his name was Tony Cooper actually talked to any occasionally and and keep up with them and he came and spent some time with me in the hospital so a great guy and and obviously a I have I have him and and the good lord to for a long life today so [laughter]\nUm so do they go a long story short I would lie flooded the Vanderbilt University medical center\nA and that's where I kind of found out the extent of my injuries um I had snapped my left femur in half or the top part of my femur had been driven up into my hip and costs and damage him by hip\nI completely crossed my work for an ankle a book just about every bone in them a broke my ankle and more places\nAre both my call ... ... I had a pretty serious concussion and bleeding on my brain or in the most significant other injuries was I had a four British fractures in my a spinal column which um\nUh and the most significant other injuries was I had a four British fractures in my a spinal column which I'm In my surgeon kindly put it as my vote away exploded on impact just due to the speed of the accident and so\nThe series of about eight hours I did not have a lower back uh with my ... had completely shattered and were floating freely and my my spinal fluid a than an injury that not many people are able to walk away from and and so thankfully\nAre on I was able to walk a but it was you know about forty eight hours of a a fear on my family's all that I made up a walk again\nA slight underwent surgery to fuse my spinal column or to insert hardware into my femur my hip and my knee or those were two separate surgery so it went on a about three days apart from each other and then uh I had a two reconstructive surgery on my feet\nI'm the first of which hearing that first stint in the hospital and then the the second approach about a year later so\n[laughter] uh so I spent about a month and a Vanderbilt and then a month and a rehab hospital a ... you know the part that I tell everybody was kind of a wake up call was you know about a week into it I I was able to\nUm be very conscious I guess in a hospital you know obviously in that situation you have a lot of medication they're trying to keep you out of pain and so first week was pretty blurry but uh the second week of my my surgeon came into my room\nAnd he thought it was my dad and and he told me that control everything I wouldn't be able to do it again and I'm you know I it it feels um\nFeel selfish to feel bad about these things considering that I I Lived and I can walk\nThe things that he listed were all the things that I did before my accident um you know I Would never be able to run again I Would never be able to jump I Would never be able to play any kind of sports again a very little a lateral movement or needed to play sports\nI'm lying lower extremities we're going to swallow every day for the rest of my life just due to the damage to them\nUm I was going to walk with a noticeable and significant lent or the rest of my life obviously deal with back pain on a regular basis um my ability to stand or walk for extended periods of time or what's going to be painful\nAnd uh was never going to be able to do any kind of manual labor again\nAnd so um you know that was that was a pretty hard thing to hear because that was a total departure from what my wife looks like and uh I was young I had a lot of life ahead of me right and\nAnd make sure that people knew about suicide the ripple effect is coming back to North Alabama so people can come even from central Alabama and come and watch the movie and have a profound effect on their life so if you would when they start out with your story and tell us about your son what kind of guy was he\nAnd uh and then the story of him taking his life and what that what that did to you to change that it may\nWell my son air Alexander he was Nineteen years old he has just started his career in the military and the Army National guard and he loves the militaries he loves history he actually\nCared at the veterans me than the Huntsville veterans me Sam\nAnd he loves being there he was learning how to work on tanks and he called at this church and um he loved his family um he just was a wonderful person and a wonderful son\nHe did also have trouble uh where when he would get upset about things um he would really be a fat and you know everything was horrible [noise]\nI didn't think that it would and and the result that it did [noise]\nBut on July tent um two thousand sixteen like you said um he took his life and\nUm\nHas changed I mean nothing will ever be the same again\nAnd um\nEverything has changed I mean nothing will ever be the same again\nAnd um\nIt's hard for people to talk to me about my son\nAnd it's really frustrating because my son was here and I'm very proud of him and I want to talk about him I Want people to tell me things that they remember about him and who he was so\nKind of started out that way because I was like well people aren't going to talk to me about air and so I'm kind of for some [laughter] and um you know so I started doing things I did um I have amazing errands filters and\nUm I had seen the trailer for a suicide the ripple effects with Kevin Hi and [noise] and I found out that you could cap and I'm a screening of the movie and\nSo I decided that um because on that I don't particularly like the tenth of the month anymore [laughter] so I\nDecided to do one in honor of Aaron and we had our first one in ... so we had ...\nAnd I mean I just started emailing everybody and said you know this is my son this is what happened um I don't want it to keep happening you know as a mother\nI don't want another mother to live like a two day\nNo longer I talk about it the more I get upset but then I I get back sorry you're um\n[noise] but so um you know I just started ... emailing everybody and [noise] I mean so many people got involved and um you know anti did come on your show and ah with spirited warriors and talked about it and\nConnie came with this crisis services of north Alabama um they have the\nGrief support groups there for suicide survivors and she wanted to have one in Decatur so I said well I'll I'll help [laughter] and so we've got the one set up\nIt's out the AMC and the Decatur mall I actually went up there before I came here and and that was the manager and everything and um they're gonna have it set up we'll have a tables out\nFront in the lobby so people are are able to see the other sponsors that are involved we have of\nUm crisis services of course will be there bearded warriors hospice of the valley there actually located indicator and they have a bunch of um support groups grief support groups available there\nUm crisis services does have a Decatur services and that was one of the reason my kind of wanted to have it there [noise]\nWe also have speak is going to be there or um [noise] we have a nominee of Huntsville they're a really good\nResource for mental health um work and a half of 'em there's to mental health association in ... county um and also\nI'll I'm working on a on the heirs to mental health association in ... county um and also um [noise] my therapist as EMT are and there's an association I'm the at different therapists that ah\nOffered the EMT our service and it's time for people that are familiar with it it really is to help reprogram\nA memory they use it a lot for P. TST\nUm so they have a an association that they'll be there to let people know about the services they provide and\nSo we kept their cars and then you start to seven thirty and we get there about six thirty and half everything set up so people coming and can see you know\nThe services that are offered because it's so important for people you know\nThat are contemplating suicide ... that they know that there are people out there that want to help them and are there\nUm people that have lost someone to suicide there are services um and we're trying to get the word out and you know because we do have some that we need more ... you know\nWill and I'm hoping that the show will help each other people for you and you realize yourself after losing your son Aron that there is a ripple effect of suicide and what that ripple effect actually means to every one that was around Aaron every one that\nThat was a friend to him every one that was a a family member affected it as an impact that it has on your life and obviously that's why you're sitting here today is because your son made that decision\nAnd you didn't have any say so in that it was something that he did and and you want an opportunity to share that story but also to encourage other people just last week I had you know brand her and she lost her son so ... as hospital and she has her T shirt for those you have a T shirt on the says it's OK to not be OK suicide prevention awareness\nAnd so we want people to understand that there are going to be times when\nYou're going to be down and out and struggling and maybe struggling really hard you made me in a very very dark place but it's okay to not be okay as long as you reach out and and found a way to try to help yourself and found that out\nThat there is it's ... it exist for everyone there is hope for everyone and we don't want people to get up and went over to disable my life's not worth anything and nobody cares about the obviously you cared about Aaron yes his mother\nAnd somebody who would have done I I Would imagine you would have move mountains if you could have if you could have saved his life and kept him down through them when he did and and and it is a shame that uh the subject is taboo\nWhere people don't feel comfortable talking about special look one thing that they care much about because at one moment does not define Aaron\n... other other you know from from his childhood for being a toddler you know to the to the joys he had as a child because every child has special experiences that you remember as a mom and and just to make that his defining moment\nYou know there's a whole legacy for each person that takes their life that that moment is just something that that they decided in the choices they made and then their life is over but prior to that what they meant to other people and what they did for other people in a life that they live and I know you have we have stories to share about air and then that in that area too [noise]\nWhy not the whole thing is that I mean the reason that I have gotten involved in suicide awareness aside prevention is because I don't want other people to die\nIsn't that I have gotten involved in suicide awareness aside prevention is because I don't want other people to die [noise] um\nI I talk about that that's the way my son did die but that's not who he was caught it's not as life is life mattered and who he was mattered and\nI'm not ashamed of him I'm not ashamed to talk about him or truly was and um so you know I don't want other people\nTo feel that way either and you know the more people that have lost someone to suicide the more they talk about it and reach out to each other and it helps people and I mean that's what we're here for that's what we're supposed to do so\nI Know there's a camaraderie camaraderie and the unity\nThat is between those who lost loved ones just like beer to warriors what they provide for those who are suffering from the TST currently\nThey sent me a phone call they've spent may hot to cover up my head when I had no hair they have great for me it is just a a a humbling experience and so my teen years ago\nWe started the with early ribbon run\nAfter my diagnosis is actually an ape we'll see how many years Nineteen years ago I started with early breast cancer bond at Huntsville hospital foundation at the time you talked about the story tellers over in Athens are going on this weekend festival\nI was invited to church group sent a civic groups and they invited me to speak in the middle of my chemotherapy\nBut I was going to be about my experience with breast cancer or young woman undergoing mother and my thirties with two small children and I was diagnosed with under glass a form of breast cancer called triple negative breast cancer there's nothing positive about that so I was going to tell my story and I would say the least get a mammogram it will happen\nIf breast cancer can happen to anyone if you have breath man or woman\nOr they would start handing me money [laughter] something you want me to do with it\nAnd they said keep that you will come out so I thought about it I prayed about it and I went to the hunt for hospital foundation and basically open an account I said I don't know what we need to do with the money\nBut please can I open you know can I thought a fun so we started to fund and it became very clear what North Alabama needed\nAnd that was a dedicated breast health Center for women to go because it took me about two weeks to find out everything I needed to know about my breast cancer gray it only takes a woman a day or two days so it's one of years it has completely turned around because the money is\nFrom that fund and now from the ribbons on all our finals and to the Huntsville hospital breast cancer and now also the battles and hospital preference her so now we have the disease and in my opinion the best breast health centers and the state of Alabama\nThat is great and speaking of your experience next week because of course October is breast cancer awareness month but he continues on for people in November and December and January and February March doesn't stop and I've got run to my kids act\nFrom heart so going to come on the program next week in the month of November and talk about her experience but if you would there are those out there there's women and men to like\nThat are not getting checked 'em and there's also people who've been checked and they found that they had cancer and what is your message to them all the people who haven't yet gotten chicken in the ones who who just found out they had breast cancer\nWell first of all I Want people giving is what a month away yes I Hope people will just think about this as they're gathering around the table this may be the one time in a year that you will see\nAsk Mary and grandma and everyone else in the family gather around\nYou're going to be talking you're going to be giving at stake may I suggest one of the topics that you bring up is how are you doing how are you held quite liquid talk about family history but see what's changed in people's lives\nOver the last year\nAbout whether it be whether it be heart disease no matter what it is\nI think we need to open the channel a conversation I think\nBut whether it be heart disease no matter what it is I think we need to open the channel a conversation I think young people need to hear from the older generations start truly taking votes\nThat may be the only time you see that that may be the only time you have that conversation so take note if someone's been diagnosed with cancer and they're in their thirties\nSo let me just aren't paying attention and that's something they come up from grandma who says oh yeah you remember the uncles no had this and then this than than than us and so you start putting the family three together of health concern yes so I Want to tell everyone to go ahead and have that conversation take notes\nIf you find that you suddenly you're seeing a pattern\nGo ahead and go your family physician and have that conversation and start getting checked for what ever the element may be that may be suddenly you're noticing runs in your family so get the appropriate test at the appropriate age ...\nIf you're at higher risk for breast cancer you find that like you got one two three course strictly relatives and they were all young you should be getting checked ten years before\nYour closest relative was diagnosed\nSo that the real key with women and and breast cancer so women needless are getting their mammograms by at least age so I Would say get a baseline but between thirty five and forty and then every year or every other year after that\nIf there are no buddies to do that if you're under insured or uninsured Alabama has the Alabama breast cervical cancer detection program we call it the ABC program all you have to do is go on line of work is distributed by the Alabama State department of public health\nGo on there and see if you qualify to get a free mammogram also if you find that you're at high risk there are five counties in Alabama participating with Hudson alpha Institute for biotechnology\nAnd Carlos genetic where women and men ages twenty eight to thirty two can have free genetic tests that it's called information is power if they just Google that they will find all the information that's available again that information is power\nNow were they were free\nTo men and women ages twenty eight to thirty two who live in Madison Jackson limestone Marshall\nAnd Morgan county if you're outside that age group where if you're outside of those five counties for free for all others ages Nineteen and over the test is only a hundred and twenty nine dollars so that's really\nI I say information is power that is really key because it will give you\nAn idea as to whether you are at risk for not only breast cancer\nBut thirty two other genes that are on the specific panel\nThat would give you a heads up on perhaps what you need to be looking for and what you need to be talking to\nYour family physician about\nLast year I'm about Seventy five percent of the participants were winning in that particular program twenty five percent were men\nAnd the people who never thought they were at risk suddenly believe it or not a good many of them found out that both work because they carried\nA genetic predisposition run again I go I I wanted to spread the spread the information that's available out there you know you can't afford a mammogram or you know if you don't think you can go on the ABC\nDot org website on the Alabama public health find out if you\nYou know if you don't think you can go on the ABC dot org website on the Alabama public how to find out if you believe that there may be some genetic component in your family after you talk to everyone and say okay I'm I'm seeing some patterns here ... you just want to know\nGoing look at information is power because truly it is\nA is an amazing tool for the future\nYou bring up a great point and of course this show is to educate encouraging and smart\nAnd there is a lot of education out there and and knowledge is power and also want to talk about the encouragement aspect you have been an encouragement and of course as I mentioned at the start of the segment this is the ... good deed segment name from my grandmother she loved the point where I talked about the good deeds that people are doing\nAnd I wanted to personally thank you Liz for first off\nYou went through breast cancer but you decided that you wanted to mothers and you've been an inspiration to a lot of people and that's an important part that I that are trying to reach out to people in my show is that we go through a lot of adversity there's challenges we face once we do that\nWe've made in our torch bearers for encourage other people and being an inspiration others because they're going to go through similar circumstances and I wanted to thank you for what you've been doing to help others\nWell you're very kind mark but honestly think about it for the last thirty five years in Alabama between my great aunt in Huntsville I've been asking other tell their stories\nEvery single day as the TV news anchor as a reporter it was only\nRight it was in my bones to tell my story right which ended I think the biggest story of my life and I wanted to show people what it was like Twenty years ago to go through aggressive breast cancer all aspects of it\nFrom the diagnosis that the high desert chemotherapy through the bilateral mastectomy the hysterectomy there's a whole nine yards and whatever happened on the other side I wanted them to witness that so they would be educated\nAnd by doing so I bet so many wonderful people along the way and it has been my honor to be able to answer the phone calls or to help navigate\nA path for so many other women who were just like me\nYou know it came out of the blue this diagnosis you never got the diagnosis of breast cancer\nEspecially when you were working full time you're an active mother you have to tiny kid and\nYou're just you know you're just going going going and then suddenly the break up with our life right and so I came out I was very very blessed to have the support of the entire community the medical community a great God my family and\n\nColeman blacks were listening super ...\n\nW while ... there'll be ...
