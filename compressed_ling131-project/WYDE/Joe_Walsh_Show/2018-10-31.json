I I Do believe the country needs a debate on birthright citizenship I Do believe the country needs to revisit this notion of birthright citizenship\nI Do believe this country needs to end the practice of anchor babies of people coming into this country illegally and having babies on American soil so that those children can garner a American citizenship that's not right to me that's wrong and that needs to change okay boom they're done you know where I'm coming from\nBut this thing up of Trump's this morning this is just a political stunt to get you out for the midterms\nTrump a week before the midterms\nComes out and announces I'm going to use my pen and my phone executive order I'm going to get rid of the fourteenth amendment I'm going to get rid of birthright citizenship look my fatal flaws I'm just can tell you what I think\nTrump brought this up to date because\nThe Republicans are really close to losing the house of representatives and he's trying to get Republicans out to vote\nHe's not gonna gonna um our law birthright citizenship via an executive order he's not going to do that he just said he was to get you out to vote to get his supporters all\nWound up love ya love your show but this is a political stunt and oh by the way if Donald Trump tomorrow I tried to outlaw birthright citizenship via an executive order\nA about a minute after he did it he'd be taken to court and it would take probably a couple of years to ... work its way all the way up to the United States Supreme court show we would go into effect until that depending on what the Supreme Court said he can't outlaw\nTo the United States Supreme court so we would go into effect until then depending on what the Supreme Court said he can't outlaw birthright citizenship and I am no fan of birth right citizenship\nBut Trump can't outlaw it be a an executive order I just think I I think you need to be smart both ... and everything that Trump saying right now and everything the Democrats are saying right now\nYou can't believe them because it's all about the midterms\nThey're trying to blow smoke up your you know what 'cause they want you to vote so they're throwing their supporters what they want to hear you want to have a serious discussion will we argue because the whole concept of birthright citizenship is really problematic\nIt's not an you can't ignore it um ... they all work together ... and they dominate our schools the left dies they dominate the media the left\nDoes they dominate big business they dominate popular culture and they work together and they create the narrative they tell us the language people can use in the language people can't use they dictate the rules and ever since last week the horrible stuff that happened last week\nThey had been working overtime to try to get the whole country to believe\nThat there is only hate on the right and oh by the way right if I'm rapping Trump upside the head for a political stunt today bringing up birthright citizenship that is what it is look the media is doing the same damn thing the media wants to Democrats to win in the midterms", "show_name": "Joe Walsh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "31"}
