G ... GM forte who's running for ah for Congress out there in Montana I'm ... how does this Walsh with you\nDoes this negate the mobs somehow up there a swarming Capitol Hill in your community in marches and rallies breaking windows antifa\nThat whole ah explosion of violence and hate we're seeing\nThe congressmen in a disagreement with a reporter who slams them down equate with these mobs were saying by the way that happened back months and months ago\nAnd is Trump side comment I I think it's just a joke I and and to add to this\nNot unlike Lesley Stahl which we we ... a demystify that interview written decompose that we broke it down for you last week earlier in the show\nAnd Lesley Stahl unwittingly I Believe no was really used by the president as as a stand in for the rest of the media\nAnd I think when ... when the media begins its echo and they stop having original thoughts but begin to echo one another the public utterly tunes them out in fact this is why I Believe so many Democrats gave the president a second look\nBecause they said wait a minute wait if all these people are against him and they're all saying the same thing what is this guy really doing and they looked closely\nThat may be what's happening now as we approach these midterms I see some of these polls everything tightening up that naturally happens in the mid term or will there be a Trump effect let's go to cliff New Jersey what do you think clue what move do you what is moving you to the polls what's the issue\nWhat is ...\nWhat do you think ... what move do you what is moving due to the polls what's the issue\nWhat is unique to the polls is better than the crash I Believe are behind this march and drink at all you talking heads should find out who's paying for their ... who is trying to treat him\nComing north and you're going to find out Democrats and then publish it and that total change\nMhm you're talking about the caravan which we're going to get into in a moment Pat Buchanan joining us uh yeah that caravan as moving up and look I'm there is certainly\nA an\nEcosystem let's put it that way there is an ecosystem of support for this caravan individuals who fund the housing the food the legal services for members of this carbon and not only that Caribbean but more\nI I don't know if you saw the story the other day Lutheran refugee services as well as a ... a Catholic migration refugee services came up with a statement demanding that we'd be more welcoming to not only these ... but anyone seeking to come to the United states of course they get\nHundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants every year that had been stymied by the Trump policies\nYou see as his contract that the number of refugees allowed into the country their coffers of emptied\nSo they have a material financial interest in this and\nIt's hard to think that these dramatic displays of people crowding the border and that's what's happening now by the way\nApart from the caravan we're seeing a surge of the border and it's not individuals' it's families because they know that's their ticket in you have a kid it's a ticket into the country and they can't refuse you and I can't separate you\nSo you have a catch and release policy happening where they're coming across the border we're taking their names are releasing them into mainland American\nYour thoughts on that is that a concern at all\nWill get into all of that with Pat Buchanan cliff thank you very much for the call out will also share some other uh reports with you here of how the Republicans might be able to hang on to the house it's close but it's a possibility Raymond ... sitting in for Laura Ingraham we're right back stay there\n[noise]\nBill O'Reilly here my new book and the killing series is killing the assets the hunt for the worst war criminals on earth\nGovernment and presidents have very limited powers in purposes and it really is to ensure mostly our security and then to give us a playing field where we can rest opportunities and\nUh and and grow into prosperity as a as a country that's the primary job\nAnd when we start looking to the side issues or whether it be you know a Trump said something you know saluted a guy who body slammed a journalist and he's he's now equal to the Saudis cutting a journalist to ribbon you up on on that the emotional play\nThat the Democrats are trying to use in these midterms might not be effective given the tenth out there\nWell I think my ... in my view\nThe Democrats have no agenda mainly economy isn't very good shape extremely good shape unemployment under four percent and but when the economy is good the economy is usually not the issue something else becomes issue\nA and I think that the that the Democrats are really they're pushing this ... thing\nAnd the the murder of him and this tremendously alert tale of murder and the consulate in Turkey I think too you know they're they they have no agenda and their season upon this and tried to attach it to to Trump but this is a what exactly for him and [noise]\nYou know they're they they have no agenda and they're seizing upon this and tried to attach it to to Trump but this is a what exactly for him and\nHis the Democratic party's great agenda what is their contract with America what are they going to do or pretend they're going to do since the only house they can get I Believe is the one house of representatives what is their agenda they don't have one the big issue in this campaign is Trump\nRight no that's all they have I mean this is the he is he is the centerpiece and I'm ... now you're seeing some pollsters saying by internal polls\nAre the president's approval ratings are surging and that the Republicans could squeak out just enough seats to hold onto the majority if that doesn't happen if the Democrats take control of the house even by a slim majority what do you think happens what will the next year look like ... [laughter]\nI'm sure to hell [laughter]\n\nBut noted veteran gay shouldn't you know as far as the eye can see anything\nThat can enact anything they can't you know we revise Obamacare and send it over to Republican Senate\nThen send it down through if President Trump at the White House so they can't do anything so they're going to investigate everything they will be looking into his tax returns are going to be looking into any financial connections with Saudi Arabia that go to get the Boulder report W looking into alleged\nYou know alleged obstruction of justice and the Russia investigation all of these things in New York\nThe southern district of New York will be investigating and the grand jury here in DC so I think that's all that they've got going for the you know but they don't want to raise the real issue you've wondered if you ask him deeply what you believe it ought to be they would say you know the goal here is impeach Trump and lock him up\nBut you go ahead and announced that is your goal\nAnd you shrink your base your democratic base down to it's hard core which is insufficient to win the house of representatives\nTo the degree that you rally those folks in the Democratic party on that issue you don't get the broad based sort of the ballots and you live over in northern Virginia you know they've got a fighting chance on this congressional district here right if you did something like that it would kill it\n... I Want to play something you you just mentioned the impeachment of the I word impeachment uh last night ... go to bed oh three James a beta Rourke um who is Ted Cruz's challenger in Texas did a town hall meeting and he had this this thing [laughter]\nAnd eat that into a lie that you would as a member of the house right now voted to impeach hadn't changed your mind I haven't according to the constitution that mean that the president has committed a crime that tree than primer bribery or a high crime and misdemeanor which one of those do you think the president has committed\nI wouldn't like in an impeachment to an indictment there there is nothing there to proceed with a trial for a full vetting of the facts and to make the best informed decision in the interests of this country and our future\nYour reaction to that pat does that help him and helped democratic candidates across the\nGun it still didn't hear the charge was the exact opposite [laughter]\nDoes that help it doesn't help better over work and it was in a and veterans got his own problems he's nine or ten voyage down with sixty two million in the bank I think but I you know no I don't think it helps him I think we're\nBetter off work it seems to me he's running short of heart\nSixty two million in the back but I you know no I don't think it helps them I think\nWe're better off work it seems to me is running short of heart left or very far left for Texas a course in Harlem for the Democratic party I'm beginning to wonder if he doesn't see himself as Abe Lincoln lost the Senate race and Eighteen fifty eight and came back to win the presidency in Eighteen shifting\nYeah well aside from height to there's very little commonality there that I think you I I don't remember honest Abe on a skateboard but maybe I missed that trap or a ...\nYou'll find a lot about it I don't know what I'm gonna I'm gonna corner you and put you on the record here do you think the Republicans\nHold the house and Senate going into these midterms where do you think the populace is right now you know the the the people out there who are elected from\nI think the I think over all that you would have to say that the Democrats are probably going to get to twenty three votes to take a house I mean that would be a dramatic victory over the Republican and I think the Republicans are favored by even more to hold onto the shut\nUp they've got to lose a number of races where they're at right now to lose the Senate and so I Would say it's going to be a Republican Senate dealing with Supreme Court nomination appellate court nominees and it could be a Democratic House with all these investigations over his but I don't necessarily believe\nThat it's a bad thing to have Nancy Pelosi's crowd and in charge of the house and doing all these things with the American people I don't think you're going to be enthusiastic about it especially if they've got great foreign domestic problems\n... ... you can always great to hear from you thank you for joining us and we will be in touch OK your ticket as he ran back you fat and er into all of you listening what is driving you to the\nPolls this November are you is is there an issue it was the one idea\nThat you could not lose and you felt you had to to move on um I keep hearing it was cabinet all others say they're concerned about the border still others say this mob mentality or you know we're going to play you a little bit\nIn a little bit what the president said during that rally last night what the challenge really is stay right there eight five five forty Laura we'll\nGet to all of your calls Raymond ... sitting in for a ... say they're the Laura Ingraham show\nHave you ever taken your car for an oil change in your mechanic find something wrong and surprise\nYou're a hit with a huge repair bill\nAnd what happens when you're not covered by the manufacturers warranty\nYou're paying out of pocket to fix it that's why I recommend extended vehicle service protection\nFrom my friends that car shield if your car has five thousand to one hundred and fifty thousand miles car she'll can save you from paying for high repair bills replacing your engine or even a simple sensor can cost thousands and when you're protected by car shield you can have your favorite mechanic or dealership fix your car\nIt's your choice ... also provides twenty four seven roadside assistance in a rental while yours is being fixed or free\nGet covered by the ultimate and extended vehicle service protection from car shield called eight hundred cars sixty one hundred and mentioned the code Laura or does it cost she'll dot com and use the code largest have ten percent that's car she'll dot com or call eight hundred cars sixty one hundred and use the code lord saved ten percent deductible ...\n...

Irish college football it rarely saw well you're the fighting Irish and we're the pansies I think they have little\nViolets divide the bobcat so I think they were they had bobcat but all the ... and all the posters at NYU there were all these little these little violence ... violence so\nWe we drove recently called them the pansies anyway um tell me where we stand in these midterms Matt\nUh when you look at the polling data a real clear politics has the the generic ballot Republicans down seven points does that mean anything when we're this close at this late date\nYeah it does is it's a great question um you know basically that generic ballot has been as high as fourteen Fifteen points a CNN had a poll\nDays ago or ... or so that showed that that why is that what you're seeing is that in almost all the polling that they are now that's a that's a common trend that a generic ballots start off very bad for Republicans because their car a lot of big cities and quite frankly they're calling a lot of people who aren't at work which\nDon't tend to be Republicans a and as you get close election they got a better idea of actually going to vote or whoever raining in the mid term it's like you know roughly twenty five percent of the people vote so determined he actually going to vote is that's the real tricky question\nYup well here's here's the thing I'm there is this other CBS battleground poll\nThat has Democrats up three in the toss up districts now if you're only up three and the tossup districts that's within the margin of error and in the Trump total era I I I have to look at that and say this could go anyway this this is yeah I like to call right\nI was in Florida for a speech this week I had a woman came up to be in the lobby the hotel I've noticed as a clean story don't worry as you said um she said\nHey I I just want you to know I never voted in the mid term I'm so mad about the angry opposite treatment capping off I'm voting for the first time it it it ... this is this this is the silent vote are not going to get picked up in these old I think it's absolutely a dynamic in two thousand Eighteen\nSimilar to how it was in two thousand six teams there's a lot of Democrats who are looking at their own already\nYou know a Gallup poll came out rate is at fifty seven percent of Democrats are comfortable with the idea of being a socialist party the Democratic party is shifting becoming much more radicalized and that means that in the swing districts that you're talking about that um you know the the the whole question about electing socialists\nPeople like or cause you Cortez et cetera uh it's really wake you a lot of people up a normal folks countries say maybe ...\nAnd I I I also think when you see these explosions as we just played from uh NYU last night attacking a of a statesman like Henry Kissinger he's Ninety five years old\nAnd when you see people yeah quite mental that is what I thought you were going to tell me about the woman who came up to in Florida Man I thought she was going accuse you of being a war criminal uh you know when you see that kind of crazy explosive behavior toward people a that's a ...\nAnd I thought she was going accused you of being we're coming up you know when you see that kind of crazy explosive behavior toward people that's a big turtles in middle America and really anywhere in America I think I think it's a huge journal tell me about the Trump effect he\nIs he is dumping all over the country including in Arizona tonight we're going to be covering that live at ten pm on Fox um\nWhat is the Trump effect has he nationalized what was a local race a few weeks ago\nWell first of all its historic better president would stand by a nominee like Kavanaugh end its historic that our president\nWould basically go all over the country it's aggressively in a nonstop fashion to campaign for all these candidates and I do agree with you I think it's nationalize that they can the era of trumps\nEverything is about Trump even if they try to make it about Trump he's too big of a personality he's too big of a player in our politics so yes it's about chocolate Republicans run from it because they don't like a portion of what he does or making a mistake\nOf voters that difference that Donald Trump is a one of a kind of guy they don't think that every Republican his truck they know how Trump is and I don't know why some of these Republicans have so much trouble just be yourself be who you are authenticity is on the rise in politics and that's a good thing\nIs the reality the Democrats don't have any stars with Trump's magnitude they really can't\nCompete and there's no leader and there's no articulated governing vision that's the other problem with these people um what are your concerns though Matt should the Democrats wrest control of the house what will that look like\nWell they're going to start persecuting people like my wife worked for Donald Trump they're going to go after every White House staffer they can\nThey're going to try to bring people down to their age this whole idea of the mob mentality that take it over the Democratic party will turn to gavel power house and it'll all be about trying to get air quotes corruption Trump corruption\nAnd everybody that associates themselves with Trump they're going to try the same strategy\nHillary tried which Donald Trump his agenda is so obnoxious and toxic that we have to destroy anybody associated with it and it's going to be a very\nVery harmful and long two years for the country I feel like we're at our wits end already I don't know what's gonna happen if the Democrats dispatch which they will have to choose because as you said there is no which at the other than stock trunk that is the agenda\nWhat ... what is your got tell you man where does this and I'm a lecture and I did I what do you think happens\nMy gut tells me that we're going to have a fantastic night the Senate I keep things to be picked up in the Senate from fifty one I actually can be higher than that I actually many of these races like Claire McCaskill even Montana West Virginia with Joe Manchin I think the Democrats\nAre totally vulnerable I think the Republicans have a great chance of picking up the seat I think in the house of the coin flip\n'em I think I think Republicans do have a chance to hold onto the house but it's\nA tension you could be paying too much for your health insurance new two thousand Eighteen health insurance laws have lower costs dramatically you may be significantly overpaying open enrollment is now and it's the best time to maximize your savings you may be able to save as much as forty percent\nDoes not permit order\nAnd promotes chaos that was at the heart of what he ran on so this cuts\nI think uh his way as these midterms heat up and they get they are very close now most of the polling still shows democratic victory in the house but there is a path\nFor the Republicans to hold the house it would be extraordinary it's very rare for president after his first you know middle of his first term they usually lose seats it just the natural political pendulum but\nTrump has beaten expectations in the past David South Carolina you wanted to say about\nFor reasons I'm voting Republican Maxine Waters polo see Feinstein and ...\nI'm a registered Democrat and let me tell you I've never been more embarrassed for the hatred that comes out of their mouths and I'm not alone down here in South Carolina\nRegistered Democrat and let me tell you I've never been more embarrassed for the hatred that comes out of their mouths and I'm not alone down here in South Carolina there are a lot of people because of those poor people and the vitriol that comes out of their mouths were voting for Republican down here\n[laughter]\nFascinating thank you David that's that's insightful and I'm going to be down in Texas in Houston\nMonday with a camera crew for Fox and um we're going to be chronicling what people there are saying\nAbout these midterm elections I think there are there are veins running through this election that uh I think the the polling is not picking up on and certainly\nThe people reporting news have no concept of I live in New Orleans I sit in coffee houses I go to lunch spots and let me tell you that as a swath of America\n... where in New Orleans we're kinda shoulder to shoulder with everybody we don't have these lily white enclaves or old black enclaves are all Hispanic enclaves like I found in northern Virginia when we lived here frankly you there are parts of places you you you know\nI I guess you could go never see a black person\nNever see Hispanic faced in some of these restaurants the ... the northern Virginia for whatever reason it carbs up that way\nIt it it's a very wealthy place and people are very divided live separate lives not in New Orleans we are side by side we share a music we

Trump is nationalizing this election and trying to keep his agenda and his voice at the center of its Terry Alabama does that work for you and what do you focused on during these midterms\n... exactly

D G A GM forte who's running for ah for Congress out there in Montana um does this Walsh with you\nDoes this negate the mobs somehow out there a warning Capitol Hill in your community in marches and rallies breaking windows antifa\nThat whole ah explosion of violence in hate where she does a congressman\nThat whole ah explosion of violence and hate we're seeing does a congressman in a disagreement with a reporter who slams them down equate with these mobs were saying by the way that happened back months and months ago\nAnd is Trump side comment I I think it's just a joke I and and to add to this\nNot unlike Lesley Stahl which we we decompose ... or ... or a D. mystified that interview written decompose we broke it down for you last week earlier in the show and Lesley Stahl unwittingly I Believe no was\nReally used by the president as as a stand in for the rest of the media\nAnd I think when ... when the media begins its echo and they stop having original thoughts but begin to echo one another the public utterly tunes them out in fact this is why I Believe so many Democrats gave the president a second look\nBecause they said wait a minute wait if all these people are against him and they're all saying the same thing what is this guy really doing and they looked closely\nThat may be what's happening now as we approach these midterms I see some of these polls everything tightening up that naturally happens in the mid term or will there be a Trump effect let's go to cliff New Jersey what do you think ... what move do you what is moving due to the polls what's the issue\nWhat is your meat to poll is after the Democrats I Believe are behind this march and drink at all you talking heads should find out who's paying for their bathrooms who's trying to treat them\nComing north and you're going to find those Democrats and then publish it and that photo change\nMhm you're talking about the caravan which we are going to get into it a moment Pat Buchanan joining us uh yeah that caravan is moving up and look I'm there is certainly\nA an\nEcosystem let's put it that way there is an ecosystem of support for this caravan individuals who fund the housing the food the legal services for members of this carbon and not only that carbon but more I I don't know if\nYou saw the story the other day Lutheran refugee services as well as a ... a Catholic migration refugees services came out with a statement demanding that we'd be more welcoming to not only these ... but anyone seeking to come to the United states of course they get\nHundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants every year that had been stymied by the Trump policies you see as his contract that the number of refugees allowed into the country their coffers have emptied\nSo they have a material financial interest in this and\nIt's hard to think that these dramatic displays the people crowding the border and that's what's happening now by the way apart from the caravan we're seeing a surge of the border and it's not individuals it's families because they know that their ticket in you have a kid it's a ticket into the country and they can't refuse you\nAnd I can't separate you\nSo you have a catch and release policy happening where they're coming across the border we're taking their names of releasing them into mainland America\nYour thoughts on that is that concern at all\nWill get into all of that with Pat Buchanan cliff thank you very much for the call out will also shares\nIs that a concern at all\nWill get into all of that with Pat Buchanan cliff thank you very much for the call out with also share some other uh reports with you hear how the Republicans might be able to hang on to the house it's close but it's a possibility Raymond ... sitting in for Ingram we're right back stay there\n[noise]\nBill O'Reilly here my new book in the killing series is killing the ss the hunt for the worst war criminals on earth\nYeah well with this economy which we're going to get into later I mean I you know I think sometimes Americans\nA government and presidents have very limited powers in purposes\nAnd it really is to ensure mostly our security and then to give us a playing field where we can rest opportunities and uh and and grow into prosperity as a as a country that's the primary job\nAnd when we start looking to the side issues or whether it be you know a Trump said something you know saluted a guy who body slammed a journalist and he's he's now equal to the Saudis cutting of a journalist to ribbon you up on on that the emotional play\nThat the Democrats are trying to use in these midterms might not be effective given the difficult tenth out there\nWell I think my ... in my view\nThe Democrats have no agenda mainly economy isn't very good shape extremely good shape unemployment under four percent and but when the economy is good the economy is usually not the issue something else becomes issue\nA and I think that the that the Democrats are really they're pushing this ... thing and and the the murder of him and this tremendously lurid tale of murder and the consulate in Turkey\nI think too you know they're they they have no agenda and their season upon this and trying to attach it to to Trump but this is a what exactly for him and\nHis the Democratic party's great agenda what is their contract with America what are they going to do what they're going to do since the only I was thinking God I Believe is the one house of representatives what is their agenda they don't have one the big issue in this campaign is Trump\nRight no that's all they have I mean this is the he is he is the centerpiece and uh now you're seeing some pollsters saying by internal polls\nAre the president's approval ratings are are surging and that the Republicans could squeak out just enough seats to hold onto the majority if that doesn't happen if the Democrats take control of the house even by a slim majority what do you think happens what will the next year look like withdrawal [laughter]\nI'm sure it'd help [laughter]\n\nBut now you're generally gauge as far as the I can\nSay anything that can enact anything they can't you know we revised Obamacare and send it over to Republican Senate\nThen send it down through President Trump at the White House so they can't do anything so they're going to investigate everything they will be looking into his tax returns are going to be looking into any financial connections with Saudi Arabia that go to get the Boulder report there'll be looking into alleged\nYou know alleged a obstruction of justice and the Russia investigation all of these things in New York\nThe southern district of New York will be investigating and the grand jury here in DC so I think that's all that they've got going for the you know but they don't want to raise the real issue you've wondered if you ask him deeply what you believe it ought to be they would say you know the goal here is impeach Trump and lock him up\nBut you go ahead and announced that is your goal and you shrink your base your democratic base down to it's hard core which is insufficient to win the house of representatives to the degree that you rally those folks in the Democratic party on that issue\nOur core which is insufficient to win the house of representatives to the degree that you rally those folks in the Democratic party on that issue you don't get the broad based sort of the ballot and you live over in northern Virginia you know they've got a fighting chance on this congressional district here right if you did something like that it would kill it\n... and I want to play something you you just mentioned the impeachment the I word impeachment uh last night ... go to bed oh three James a NATO Rourke um who is Ted Cruz's challenger in Texas did a town hall meeting and he had this to say [laughter]\nAnd you said in July that you would as a member of the house right now vote to impeach hadn't changed your mind\nI haven't according to the constitution that mean that the president has committed the crime that tree than primary primary or a high crime and misdemeanor which one of those do you think the president has committed\nI wouldn't like in a impeachment to an indictment there there is enough there to proceed with a trial for a full vetting of the facts and to make the best informed decision in the interests of this country and our future\nYour reaction to that pat does that help him and helped democratic candidates across the gun it\nStill didn't hear the charge what\nShe exactly yeah that\nDoes that help it doesn't help that are over ... it was in a and veterans got his own problems these nine or ten voyage down with six million in the bank I think but I you know no I don't take it helps him I think\nWe're better off work it seems to me he's running short of heart left or very far left for Texas a course in Harlem for the Democratic party I'm beginning to wonder if he doesn't see himself as Abe Lincoln who lost the Senate race in Eighteen fifty eight and came back to win the presidency and Eighteen shifting\nYeah well aside from height to there's very little commonality there that I think you I I don't remember on a stay on a skateboard but maybe I missed that chapter ... you'll find a laundromat put him in a corner you put you on the record year\nDo you think the Republicans hold the house and Senate going into these midterms where do you think the populace is right now you know the the the the people out there who are elected from\nI think the I think over all that you would have to say that the Democrats are probably going to get to twenty three votes to take the house I mean that would be a dramatic victory over the Republicans and I think the Republicans are favored by even more to hold on to the Senate\nThey've gotta lose a number of races where they're hit right now to lose the Senate and so I Would say it's going to be a Republican Senate dealing with Supreme Court nomination appellate court nominees and it could be a Democratic House with all these investigations all the rest but I don't necessarily believe\nThat it's a bad thing to have Nancy Pelosi's crowd and in charge of the house and doing all these things with the American people I don't think are going to be enthusiastic about it especially if they've got great foreign domestic problems\nMhm have you can always great to hear from you thank you for joining us and we will be in touch OK you take it easy Randy\nThank you that and er into all of you

I think there are some industries lagging Steve and um I thank you and appreciate the call I I ... and here's the thing that I Would say and you're right\nNow is the time for the president to back off the the bruise or if you will and start being the the the salesman Trump and selling the great things he's delivered on and that are already underway\nUh we do have great economic news the the industrial output the manufacturing output the the the unemployment\nBut at the same time Steve there are people like you who aren't feeling the full effects of this and need to know that the a he's doing everything he can be the president is not a wizard or a magician\nHe doesn't fix every body every aspect of every life\nThe only things as I mentioned to Pat Buchanan the two things that the people want from a president our security and prosperity and prosperity is best gained by\nHaving an even playing field where you're not owners sleep tax to regulate it out of business and where you can you can grow a business and grow a family that's what the president should be about and I think that is what he's about but that's a very limited he's powers are limited\nAnd I think the media and

regimes all over the damn world Cuba China North Korea or some of our allies\nWe can't control Saudi Arabia there were rogue regimes all over the damn world Cuba China North Korea or some of our

politics problems that would be best advised us that has not have any interest in moving in these ...\nYeah well it's an ... that's beyond the presidents of of capabilities and frankly beyond his purview he did what he could and what he did was he sent Mike Pompeo to question them we should be concerned and I had been concerned about four years about human rights religious rights abroad\nWe have to protect those and use the might of America to push these regimes toward greater freedom and liberty for their people but that said we're not we don't have dominion over those countries all you can do is suggest push agitate and that's what the president did enough\nEnough but ah the media I can prove it to\nMSNBC and CNN all last night and the night before ran on this or a ... story okay the journalists that may have been mutilated dismembered in a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey okay we've got two problems here turkey and Saudi Arabia\nOkay neither of them have particularly great human rights records in fact they don't\nBut we can only call them out MSNBC and CNN lead with this for two nights they lost the ratings by double digits Fox had more viewers than both of them combined\nNo one is interested in the short and it doesn't change one American Life and it doesn't affect our policy with presidents the in the least and it'll have no impact on the midterms so\nTo

are probably hire president might be more right than some of the others let's get back to something that's\nYeah the numbers are are probably hire president might be more right than some of the others let's get back to something that's a little bit Alabama oriented this is the article over at PJ Media that I like to touch shown every so often\nYou listen to the show for a while or you followed me at all when I was in the state legislature I was one of the few guys\nWho actively opposed Alabama signing onto Common Core standards\nOne of my greatest regrets was leaving the legislature without being able to kill all the common core when I still had a good bit of cloud as soon as I made it public that I Would not be returning that hurt me greatly and that's one of my disappointments\nIs not killing off Common Core\nPersonally I Believe if Alabama had remained with the standards and the way it was doing education at the time and we were\nActually improving education if the rest of the country decided to run their little carts off into the ditch we might actually be ranked one of the highest in education in the country if we had continued on the path we couldn't do that\nWe had to get on board with everybody else we had to do what the U.S Chamber of commerce said we had to do what the Obama administration said we could not be left out in the cold everybody else was going to do this new and great thing that was not proven anywhere in the world\nHad not been used anywhere in the world was not more rigorous standards was not all the dribble that we were told and people like myself are out there\nAnd most Alabamians agreed with a few of us who were trying to stop this disaster this was an\nArticle about Paul or Bali yard from two days ago published at PJ\nMedia the creators of the ACT test you know the tests that your kids have to take and it's actually been kind of changed around through the years but it's your college admissions test and some of these things we're supposed to be fixed\nWhere you wouldn't be able to tell how bad the results were they were supposed to all be aligned and hooked up and and some of us said hey wait a minute\nIf you change the the test on the outcomes didn't\nYou got to kind of say oh there's no problems here that's what that was the concern I still think that occurred\nBut even with that the creators of the icy ... see the test announced on Wednesday\nThe scores for the class of two thousand Eighteen or the worst reported in decades\nMath scores remember my ass remember how what is Common Core math why why is my kids using dots and dashes and all this stuff why could not help my kids with math why are we not doing\nLong division what what are we doing as a parent can even help my child remember all that math scores in fact\nAre in freefall among ACT tested us high school graduates following falling to their lowest mark in for teen years according to the condition of college career readiness twenty Eighteen the ACTs annual report\nThe report includes ACT test results from all fifty states and the district of Columbia the percentage of ACT test it\nFor includes ACT test results from all fifty states and the district of Columbia\nThe percentage of ACT case did graduate who met or surpass the ACC college rating is beach Martin note the college readiness Common Core was called college and career ready\n\nSuggest you they're ready to see the first year college algebra class failed to its lowest level since two thousand and for the report acquired that only forty percent of two thousand Eighteen graduates make the benchmark down from how I'm forty six in two thousand in twelve\nTwo thousand twelve\nMe six years ago my little boy is in sixth grade\nI stated do the committee in the\nAlabama State Senate my child my youngest child ... calls this policy decision that they were making a mistake school board was making that we would not overrides my child would be fully and completely one of the children do the core\n\nIt's down from forty six percent back six years ago they only forty percent the average score on the ACT math is drawn to his lowest in Twenty years twenty point five\nDo the children in this day and almost in every other state around the country the promise of a little bit more free money\nAnd now our test scores are even worse it kills me I'm mad about it and one level\nBecause people wouldn't listen to common sense our state leaders wouldn't listen to common sense from the legislature to the state school board would not listen to commonsense they're not mad about it for what we did two children in general in this day\nAnd then I'm really ticked off about it because my kids had to\nGo through it my understanding now is there is a big effort to try to fix it\nAre we gonna when are we going to hear hey this was a monstrous screw up and you are we going to hear that maybe we are\nWell anyone anyone be held accountable winning

make me happier so actually I can stop the comic or what is done deal are test scores are worse\nAnd I've already told you I I I'm convinced they tried to adapt the test so this would not be the result and even the adapted test were scoring worse All right well that's pretty bad real fun did a little bit to make sure it looks like a feel good and we still fail\nWell you know but you you heard
