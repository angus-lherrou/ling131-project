may be there in LA all human rights to an presumption of innocence until proven guilty\nNow that's just a basic precept that we all used to agree on this was not something we had to debate about this

on\nUnsubstantiated allegations and just because someone a man or woman makes an allegation\nDoesn't mean it is true\nDoesn't mean necessarily we've seen big cases of the media is elevated over from the Duke lacrosse case to the UVA rape case and they were false and everybody had egg on their faces Jennifer and Indiana line too\nHigh I was calling because I I'm a white woman here in Indiana\nI'm I'm just tired of being categorize I'm tired of white women I listen to your show and the poll they've been giving I think these pollsters are dead wrong and I think they're going to be shocked in

does the\nAsked me to join them in prayer to you know to pray for healing and in progress of this country and I have no doubt that's been part of is how you doing\nThanks for having me on a of Savage Tim relentlessly and shamelessly and morally and what's going on as a microcosm of the the existential struggle we're in with the left today\nAnd it's why I Am so happy that we have a a general in charge and Donald Trump because he fights back in all these purists\nHe's never Trump purists who who think that he doesn't have the right manners\nThey sit on the sidelines expect us to be passive and meanwhile the country's being taken from us by these relentless people on the left\nAnd and just the Democrats are just so shameless and they're almost a parody of themselves they said they want to the FBI investigation it was never about Kavanaugh's character is about his judicial philosophy they don't want any arrests\nAlready themselves they said they want to the FBI investigation that was never about Kavanaugh's character is about his judicial philosophy they don't want any originalist on there they want somebody who will preserve their judicial manufactured right to an abortion so\nThat they become a parity that they demand more time they never were going to accepting the pre announce that they would reject them and it's despicable I'm sick of\nOur side or some people on our side accommodating them and falling for it and flaking out so I'm hoping this'll put the nail the coughing on this thing and get Kavanaugh confirmed because as you said he's one of the most qualified and and and one one of those things is worried people\nFind judicial temperament that we've ever seen nominated\nWell I think again this could be a very big gift for the Republicans going forward David because that they're Democrats or the party of resistance and intimidation rabble rousing in chaos and meanwhile Trump\nIs slowly but surely delivering on these promises he made he still you know we don't have the wall which is it Congress this fall but we did read it NAFTA\nHe's getting the NATO nations to pay more of their fair share he got that tax reform through again it's not everything we wanted the economy is humming he's gotten a I think now he has more than a seventh of all federal judges are Trump appointees\nUh and obviously if Kavanaugh gets confirmed and I think he will be confirmed that means they'll have to ... amazing justices on the court which will of course they will live long past Trump's administration and have a profound effect on the judiciary going forward\nYeah and and some people say well the reason you guys want Trump is just because a gorgeous well\nNo not just because of him it's because all the other judicial appointments his foreign policy is the economy it's taxes\nAnd its regulations it's better trade deals that say it's standing up to the left and finally we have a warrior in there to fight with the same relentless this has left us fighting and we don't have to be dirty like they are we just have to fight with the same intensity\nAnd realize that we're in a in a serious battle to preserve our values and our freedoms so I'm I'm feeling really good about what's going on I don't know where Jeff Flake is and where the casket and all the others are columns but I'm hoping with this FBI favorable report and we're hearing it's favorable that they won't have the\nThe audacity to vote against him at this point\nUh David you have immerse yourself in religious history and the history of the Christian Church in your new book a Jesus has risen Paul in the early church continues um\nUh you're you're writing and you're you're you're you're really ... ... ...\n... in in many ways newly are emerging as a thinker on the religious underpinnings\nOf our society but it's really important for people to understand how the early church was formed how unlikely it was that these followers early followers of Christ or we're going to you know basically drop everything and devote their entire lives and and give their lives or to this\nAh this new phenomenon and Jesus Christ or tell us about why this book was you know it was so important for you to write at this point in your own life\n[noise] ah well I'm I'm going through the New Testament when I when I became a Christian I was on fire for the Bible cause I realize for the first time in my life it was the word of God I was holding in my hands and I started\nInhaling everything I could about learning about it wishing that I had something some some books and guides and ... that would help me understand\nInhaling everything I could about learning about it wishing that I add something\nSome some books some guys and ... that would help me understand it better and be less intimidated so as I've\nStudied this for Twenty years I wanted to give back and start writing books that would help explain the Bible and so the last book I wrote was about the gospels and ... put it paraphrased in and stay to most of the versus the gospels in chronological order and also running commentary and this book\nJesus as resin is about the book of acts the history of the early church which follows the gospels and then six of false Thirteen of pistols their letters that he wrote to the early churches that he formed that he planted and they were they were dissipating from the the true gospel they were following falls teachers\nAnd he would write letters and they're very heartfelt human and personal letters\nUrging them back to the true faith and they were experiencing the same kind of of adversity an opposition and secular influences corn and it was a hotbed of sexual immorality and I'd dollar tree with the ... the pagan influences and Paul would say don't follow those people don't\nMix and sinker ties their religion with our religion Jesus Christ as the son of God to follow him and come back\nAnd we see the same kinds of things occurring in our society today they're happening in the Catholic Church and the Protestant Church there's there's the conflict in adversity from within trying to dilute the gospel which is faith then Jesus Christ alone\nTo salvation and we see people mixing that up and mixing that message to the detriment of all potential converts and so\nWe want to hew to the truth and and encourage people to understand what the Bible really says some might the goal in my books is to help people\nUnderstand what the Bible is about and encourage them ultimately to read it for themselves\nTell us about the most unlikely of Christ disciples Paul\nYes Paul was a a an observant Jew and and he was steeped in the Jewish law the mosaic law\nAnd when and he was a great persecuted of Christians because he didn't just believe that the Christians were new competing religion but that they were perverting the religion of God and\nAnd it was Judy as was a religion of God's ... and ... there's nothing a false about that but Paul was outraged that they were doing this Jesus can't possibly be them aside because they expected the Jews expected a military\nOr political uh deliver from the the forces that the authorities at the time\nAnd they didn't expect someone to be humiliated and die on the cross anybody who was\nA hung on a tree was a curse according to the Old Testament law Jesus not only didn't deliver them victory he didn't even raise their hand in his own defense and he was killed on the cross\nAnd so he can't be the messiah and then so he's in St Paul's going around ... rounding Christians that in fact he was on his way to Damascus and under authority of the St ... to pick up Christians and bring them back to\nTo punish them and when Christ encountered him on the Damascus road blind them with light and converted him to from the ... the greatest persecute or to the greatest evangelists So Paul\nThen long story short went around throughout the Roman empire Asia Minor all around and that in that periphery of the Roman empire and establish churches and they were as if they were his new\nBorn babies he wanted to nurture them and write them letters and make sure they stay true to the faith as I mentioned a minute ago but he was the least likely person to become the greatest evangelist because he was the greatest persecuted but God picked him the Bible says before he created\nA minute ago but he was the least likely person to become the greatest evangelist because he was the greatest persecuted but God picked him in the Bible says before he created the universe and I think he did it because he had those qualities he veers intellectual relentless and determined and ultimately a follower of got\nThe part I think this is Mike around two fifty seven in your book um\nWhere you talk

people into the kingdom when we got to be a little different than we are in politics but\nYou know you you don't want to be too strident and\nHe what he said he he will be all things to all people not meaning he would be a hypocrite and compromises values\nHe would never dilute the gospel message but he would not sweat the small stuff so when he was around Jews who would adopt their practices when

I think they're just ... they don't know what to do at this point they thought one of these things is going to pan out I mean they the stall ...\nI think it's good news for Republicans I really do I think now Republicans are more United than they've been since the day after the election maybe even more United and they'd been since nine eleven that's what I said last night and that's why I really believe ... let's go to a JC Florida on line one ... the\nLaura I just wanted ... say like most on the right I'm really happy and grateful that Lindsey Graham said what he said and continues to call up all left but\nWe've grown so accustomed to our representatives not really doing their jobs and pushing back not fighting left on a consistent basis so when one of them simply does their job and says what needs to be said all of a sudden we're treating them like a hero you know this should be the norm and not the exception\nSo this is what Lindsay and the others were sent to Washington to do and we're all wedding ourselves with excitement because someone did what they were hired to do and that's a shame\nThat they would do that\nA great point you know I think you know when I when I think that when people tweet around things like look man helps an old lady\nThat's a great point you know I think you know when I when I think that when people tweet around things like look a man helps an old lady across the street\n[laughter] you know or look ... look a uh uh uh someone helps an artistic kid in the in the seven\nEleven or the other video of helping him stock things which it's nice but that's what we should do right that's humanity that's humanity it's that that is what we all should be doing\nSo I guess it's better to celebrate that than just keeps saying negative things around people so that it is nice but it's kind of an all I'm saying is it's kind of sad that we have to we have to note that when someone is doing the right thing instead of as our caller said that's just what you should be no apple\nSadly like so many representatives and senators they don't reflect the will of the people so when they do it you have your job on ... and Lindsey Graham the other day he walked through a Fox out of the green room [noise] people who are applauding us he's walking down the halls\nAnd hands shaking him like he just came back from war but he made a speech and the committee defending the nominee that's what he did\nBy the way the Durban letter just quickly it says no where there's a Dick Durban to ... a Senator Grassley\nNowhere in any of these six Kevin ...

Laura I'm much time we have James Earl right when they're thirty seconds are coming out Mark Penn uh he's going to give us a snapshot unaware the mid term election cycle is and I'm gonna ask him whether the Democrats\nPlayed this game way too long of delay and whether you know they really they just overplay their hand is overplay their hand here and extreme do they look too extreme\nFor the American people now and how will that affect our mid term election turnout if at all a five five forty Laura\n\nThis is Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new Jenny cell sunspot correct her she says she loves it it should go to product every day she has sunspots an age spots of can see a definite difference in her skin since using it watcher sunspots age spots and even read inflame patches of vanished right before your eyes\n[noise] so I see that the American public is pretty sensible or as you suggest you do they say well look we saw this testimony\nWe believed Ford and we believed Kavanaugh also\nAnd so what really makes the difference well does the FBI find cooperation are not well what we find in the polling is that sixty percent said well look there's no collaboration them\nIn fact the nomination should be confirmed and that included eighty six percent of Republicans Democrats or do you\nLook Democrats even after there's no ... sixty percent of Democrats [noise] you know would oppose the nomination but you see that sort of the center\nOf the country says hey if I could see that there is no cooperation I'm going to be fair here I'm not going to ruin a this guy's life on the basis of two people who testified who I think are fair if there is no collaboration in that certified by the FBI\nThe Atlantic has a piece out um here's why white

support Faye Faye focused her remarks on college educated white women forty four percent whom of whom voted for Trump saying chastising them for wanting\nTo go back to watching HGTV and forget about the election you can't look away she said\nWell now a it looks like some women are taking that to heart a morning console political poll found that President Trump net support\nAmong Republican women had dropped by Nineteen points oh that's a huge drop if that's if that translates into people voting for the Democrat Party that could be a disaster for the ...\nWell I think that is the the biggest both change in the electorate concern for the Republicans and and victory points to the Democrats so far which is that the cost of what I Would say the closet conservatives in the country are actually independent\nSuburban women [noise] who voted twenty points for Romney who voted probably Thirteen fourteen points for ah for for President Trump a and they've been up for grabs I think the Democrats than making very good kind of momentum with them I don't think\nThis cabinet nominations never hope that I always thought that a woman nominee who even a woman nominees for what might have been more conservative would actually have been the right strategic choice here\nI I think the Republicans have held on to the working class voters Trump took but those are the voters are up for grabs and I don't see anything coming out of the Republicans to women back\nYeah well the again you would think the economy which is of course on fire women care about prosperity and security and all those issues that Trump is\nFocused on 'em but nevertheless at twenty September twenty six us see uh LA Times poll\nCounted twenty ... or ... percent point advantage for Democrats among all women a twenty eight percent advantage among married white college educated woman women a group along tied to the G O P the Republicans now lead by only five points they had a much bigger\nOr they had a much bigger lead among that group of women before but now those are low as well um this is this this is a substantial block or the married college educated women and that's a substantial block but\nAmong all women I mean I I think a lot of this might be tone you know Trump's tone women like things calm they like things to be calm down and I think they they they sense that things are chaotic and they seem to be blaming the Republicans for that maybe this stuff for the last couple of weeks my change that I don't know\nBut they're also more skeptical about the economic progress if you look men are like wow this economy is through the roof women whom as you rightly pointed out typically are even more concerned about the economy\nAnd its effect on them and their family or less understanding of an improved economy and that's another area where the Republicans have really failed to drive their message what every day every day that the the national question is is she\nA rapist or not\nThere's a day that do but it's focusing on the economy I mean you've seen the last day or two incredible jobs numbers ... come out and the focus is primarily you know on the cabinet issue and it's going to stay that way at least through you know middle of next week probably\nYeah and that's um I think that's why I'm Mitch McConnell wants this vote to happen as soon as possible this is what my barnacles said this morning on MSNBC let's listen a lot of ...\nI think that's why Mitch McConnell wants this vote to happen as soon as possible this is what my barnacles said this morning on MSNBC let's listen\nA lot of Republicans have come home and the state of Florida and the Gillum racing was comfortably ahead you can go to other states that show\nAgain the races are tightening\nIn do you think that they perhaps Donald Trump is seen data that shows that this is driving conservative and conservative voting base up back home of course he didn't do\nPlays exactly to Donald Trump strength the one thing he is an expert in is resentment and specifically in this case white male resentment\nMale resentment um I think the white privilege discussion is driving even\nMore men now to the Republican Party I think people are really getting tired of this identity politics I'm Mark I I think that the Democrats have gone way too far in a\n... ... as you do a for a long time I I've been against both class warfare and the density politics\nAs a as a moderate Democrat\nYou know I've always been against those two in favor of current or the right kind of you know social policies and balance I think what's really happening here\nIs that the Democrats were completely energize they were looking for an opportunity to vote against Trump and the Republicans without a leader without a particular message\nWe're incredibly disorganized and I do think this thing has awakened the Republican base you know in a in a way that it's backfiring on the Democrats unfortunately uh [noise] I think they still have an edge but I think they probably could have had to wipe out the way this thing was heading\nAnd and now I think you're going to see it kind of a balance among turn out here\nBecause the stakes of this election have been just raised you know so high now\nYeah and I I Do think that again you see what the Republicans are capable of when they stand United with the exception of the\nThree I'm more liberal Republicans who you know are are dragging their feet on the on the nomination or the party when it's United is pretty formidable I mean even a bunch of older white [laughter] it's a pretty formidable ... never seen Mitch McConnell so\nYou know so good as he's been in the last week just as a political matter\nWell but see that's ironic thing that I think you'll see this in the Senate races and I think you see a lot of the Senate races\nTightening up because the Republicans are coming home and there's no question that this Kevin ... is a highly partisan ice vote and if you're in a state that voted for the courts for Trump you know there's no question that it's going to be a large percentage more way above a majority that would want to see confirmatory in the Senate this has\nDone a lot I think for the Republicans you know in the house you know not so much you know Ryan quit his job and I didn't leave there's no leadership there is no message we're we're McConnell or as you say has stepped up maybe some people think rightly maybe some people\nYou know what I think too harshly but as you said you stepped up you've got the message leading in the house there's nothing\nYeah I had a house is run or less it's rather lists and at the Paul Ryan should have left if he's going to retire should have left to let this thing it'd be taken over by somebody wants to fight for these issues Paul Ryan's basically not even a factor right now I'm Mark Penn thank you so much for joining us that's always great to talk to you on radio and on the angle\nWill take a break eight five five forty Laura do you believe that this uh the politics of rage that we're seeing right now I think people said Trump was embodied the politics of rage uh but now it seems like the Democrats have\nIt's a rage that we're seeing right now I think people said Trump was embodied the politics of rage\nUh but now it seems like the Democrats have taken on that role at least during this Kavanaugh issue\nHow does that translate in November are you voting have your vote are some people have already voted you voting early encouraging others to vote or you got to spread the good news if you believe in going forward in this economy and you believe in the basic principle of fairness and as mark said if you really shy away from my identity politics\nA political correctness used as a cudgel to silence people you've got to go get a get out there and vote and vote Republican don't go away\nA\nRepublican year will be a Democrat and Republican\nYou been able to do something my friends on the other side I could never do you not just party\n\nThe Laura Ingraham show [noise]\n\nMilk juice or in the midst of perjury [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have made this

morning we have\nThe Facebook Live stream going yet again you can check it out you can go you can find me on Facebook just type in Baylor I'm the first name that pops up\nWe've got something really important to talk about the day that I'm really excited that came as a result of a conversation that I had yesterday right it was a ...\nFirst name that pops up [noise] we got something really important to talk about today that I'm really excited that came as a result\nOf a conversation that I had yesterday right it was a conversation that I wasn't expecting that I didn't know what happened um and then it ended up happening and it it really changed the way I looked at things and it was based on the conversation that we had yesterday right we have this conversation yesterday\nAbout going going for your goals specifically going for the success that you want in this life and in doing so also you know finding that balance finding what you what you need to do what you want to do but you\nYou have to find that balance and and finding that balance you have to not care what people think about you as a whole part of finding that balance is again not caring what people think\nAnd so in having this conversation which dream to live on Facebook we did it on the radio and\nI got a very moving response in a conversation ensued right and I got permission to read this on air I won't give the person's name I'll just say the name is Glen and we talked main Glenn talk for a little while\nAnd so Glenn sent me this message yesterday\nHe said I listen to your broadcast earlier I'm fifty five I work at a job I hated for twenty five years I took early retirement to take care of my parents I feel like I've spent my whole life in service to others and I keep thinking when is it going to be my turn\nI Know in the end I Will have no regrets being the responsible child and taking care of my parents I just wish I'd follow\nI'd followed my dreams and hadn't been held back when friends talk about their exciting trips I see photos of their homes and I think I could have had that and that's discouraging\nAnd so Glenn basically brought up this idea of\n... you know the deeper message behind that I think is how do we define success because Glenn basically saying I've been serving my parents and I've been serving others my entire life my parents my kids\nAnd I still don't feel like I'm successful because I see other people posting these photos right and they post these photos of trips and cars and houses and we see these people and they're doing really well and what the world is defined as successful and they're making a lot of\nMoney and therefore they can afford to go on these lavish trips to buy these four storey houses to buy all of these things all these things that money can buy\nAnd so we talked about success a lot on the show and we talked about success a lot on social media I mean if you follow me on social media at all you know that that's something I talk about quite a bit and it really got me thinking\nHow do we define success what specifically the biblical way to define success because before I tell you how I think the Bible define success I wanted to tell you how I Would define success and this is through a biblical worldview right\nI think that Glenn who sent me that message is more successful than most of the people\nRight than most of the people that post about the cars and houses and the trips I think that Glenn is more successful because of this idea that Glenn could have gone out and worked in done all this stuff\nWe worked to provide a wonderful experience for all his come through our doors if you'd like to start loving your job go to a wind ... dot com slash careers for\nGoogle when create jobs and

one of the worst tornado outbreaks in American history as bad as that day was\nBoy do outbreaks on a lesser scale occur frequently here in the south hey this is Michael hard and most of the Michael\nHearts or you know as deadly as these storms can be there is no way to protect our families when disaster strikes and that's why is the ball tornado season approaches\nI'm looking to partner

um\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysically what specific story this is I find that during the next break if Henry doesn't know but there's this man that was believed to be a demon inside of them and nobody talked to and everybody said that guy's crazy we we were not going in there we're not doing that he lived amongst the tombs right our modern day version would be he lives in a graveyard\nExcept he didn't live in a graveyard he lived in the way tombs used to be set up er tombs used to be in this cave like structure right you've seen them you've seen pictures of them even if you haven't gone to a place where they had a structure like this you've seen the idea that you used to walk into this thing and it was covered place and they were just bodies on top of bodies on top of bodies\nThat were in these little things it's it's a similar concept of what we have in big cities where the there's these big buildings and they essentially pull out a drawer and once you're dead you get plopped in the drawer enclosed like that\nJust as a side note I never want that to happen I don't want to be in a drawer my whole life\nThat I don't want to but that's a side note Jesus went and he talked to\nThe guy living down there every once and it was crazy that nobody wanted to talk to\nCan you imagine that\n... and look at the lessons that taught us look at what we do we go and we talked to the people who are the most hurting or of the most broke or the most afflicted and our society\nWe have a whole groups of Christianity that are dedicated to going to prison and talking to violent felons not just people that you know the stole or ah or had drugs or something like that was talking to people who committed murders of three or four people\nMurder five people six people some people you have people that dedicate their whole lives to going into the jail it's following that teaching where he went into a place where this guy was afflicted by demons and she walked in he looked at the guy and he essentially said this is obviously a paraphrase he's a demon get out\nDeem and leave him\nAnd if I remember correctly the demon went into a group of pigs that were nearby and then the pigs ran jumped off the cliff\n\nJesus want is wanting to drive that thing out of you write\nJesus cause you to help drive that thing out of others\nThat makes you want to do with things that aren't productive for you right he wants to come and he wants to teach he wants you to teach and\nI think successes defined by following his teaching and then going out and sharing those teachings in changing the community in that way and driving the demons out that way it doesn't have to be a literal demon can be a metaphorical name and\nWhat are the demons you're facing what are the demons your parents are facing what are the demons your kids are facing what are the demons your brother is facing what are the demons that anybody in your family is facing\nAnd how do you drive them out right isn't that what successes have you known that somebody's been struggling with something and you\nJust said look I got a lot going on I'm just going to stay over here I'm going to work on this worldly success you can't take the money with you\nCan't take the stuff with you\nCan't take a Lamborghini whether you'd be really cool if you could jumping that Lamborghini and drive all the way to heaven but guess what you can't\n\nBe really cool if you could take that private plane and fly it all the way to heaven but guess what you can't and guess what it also doesn't does that that plane that car that house you can't sell them and then turn that money and to get to heaven quicker to get to have it on a more extradited route to get that\nCan't and guess what it also doesn't does that that plane that car that house you can't sell them and then turn that money in to get to heaven quicker to get to have it on a more expedite around to get to heaven maybe when you don't deserve it\nThe only way you get to heaven is they're following Jesus Christ\nAnd when you follow Jesus Christ and when you believe in what the Bible says you followed these works right true faith produces actions a tree that is alive bears fruit\nTree that is alive and healthy doesn't bear nothing right the tree that is alive and healthy bears fruit and that fruit is not only the fruit is the spirit but it's the first success because when you're following Christ and you're following what he says to do\n\nYour being successful by the very definition that David gave Solomon again it first came to three do with the lord God commands and followed his teachings obey everything written in the law of Moses then you will be a success no matter what you do or where you go\nNo matter if you're the top of the mountain\nOr in the cave where the bodies are with a guy that's crazy are considered crazy by this world the person the steam inflicted\n\nNo matter where you go or what you'll do he'll be successful if you follow God I think that's a really really powerful message we're going to get your calls when we\nThe lake and came up to him and and I told the legion to leave him there was a legion of a varmint of la\n... what we call them are uh some new your spirits are they are falling angels mhm and there were seven thousand of those and and him alone ... he called himself a legion of legion averages about\nThe reason why I say seven thousand is because there's only one group other than saying that is Satan is by name will perish burn from within his guilt twenty eight ... you can read and how he his demise goes but now in the fall in angels there's several thousand\nAnd they immediately once crush the hit now our\nSeven thousand men fall into the streets of Jerusalem ...\nThat's the seven thousand that will come where say in and they roll the of course they don't mix with the uh\n... what did you play the iron in the ... ... feet do not mix so you know uh they're never going to be friendly to each other they have no liking for as they hate us you know dangerous all they want to do is have sex with women and thank goodness there won't be any children born up because they won't be here long enough ...\nYou know a lot of people than she was seven years which was short and the the short and I want to get to the fact of pleasing God I'm going to be I don't want to get off on our let others that are going to have stuff is not going to tell you too much and but once you learn a lot more you can get into stuff like that yeah but\nWhat are you every day you should bless God and he will bless you that is one thing you want to do right never never acquire ill gotten gain or else you're not going to go through that needle gate\nThat needle ... is that gate that they had it was a smaller door inside of the two main doors and the camel had to crawl through on his knees and everything on that camera all had to be taken off of him so he uh he had to be unloaded so you've got to unload\nAll of your ... games before you even get in the habit well why\nIs your works mhm you're right just acts you want your works works\nAre the only thing is we take what is this and you are judged we are judged by al works were not judge by a phase\nWe're judged by our works and those works make up our clothes are crispy white linens and I plan on having a little bit more than some are boxers [laughter] hopefully I'll be doing it right but you know on the uh laws\nLately I I Am an area than I Am curious I Do have a question uh what do you think about the idea a then that people say or my faith not by site by um my faith not by works they did now\nThat is something that I've heard that's been precinct Christianity are often amongst a variety of sex and Christianity\nUm and I was wondering why there seems to be a difference in what they're saying and what you're saying don't misunderstand the ... next time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill cause you to live a little bit longer or have a a crappy help that's our bodies were not changed\nAfter he gave those laws that our bodies are the same as they would have been now the condition of the earth is different we have a heavier atmosphere the earth is uh a lot different than it was when ... lived to nine hundred and sixty years old so you know and he ate ... God told them the\nAnd that's why one of the reasons why any live that long plus we have the ability to to live that long so remember the laws they never change ... Christ centered and change one ... that that's a\nThat's a tutor was a a a mark on the Hebrew where it changes the pronunciation of\nUh from uh are to from car to calf\n... you know can be a cat three main [laughter] you know I mean it it has a line over that yeah it'll ... any way that ... you know the laws not change many people are really messing up a lot of good Christians who are going to win the first\nChrist times we're gonna run like germs thinking they're gonna do all these great things but they don't really know he's the anti Christ and he's gotten a promise everybody's gonna fly him away no such thing\n... you're ... you're going to put on the body armor and you're going to get in the field doesn't work then you better stay in the field at work until the real crisis get here and if you're going to put on the body of water you got to be ready to fight right with saying you have that she had all the truth and you'll be in the um the the\nThe shield of ... that the head\nArmor of truth to shield of of uh oh gosh I'm forgetting now but that one gets rid of his fire instructs you drink kids poison and well then the other ... enemies poison ... we could drink to poison and we can handle them as they are the papers they are\n... so ... that's another false and it's a it's a ah idioms it's uh he brands and these people get a good teacher I I met one day I might teach about my my wife wants ... just for herself\n[laughter] we always appreciate your calling in and helping us out and ...\nYeah well just you know you don't have to believe me but studying yourself\nYou know that the law statutes and ordinance every blood ordinance\nFrom putting a a um an all through your nose or your ear ... uh to remain a slave in the house ... big part of the family ... mean say that's part of the family and then uh circumcision is up the heart of the flesh any more All right I'm outta here on your entity that uh\nSomebody was probably a shame you gotta get outta here ...\nSuch ... shut him up [laughter] you can't ... shut up when there's\nNever ... that would never have ... rather well you have a good day man\nYou have a great day always lottery she had eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three again that's eight six six buy buy one Ninety nine thirty three live from ... studio ...
