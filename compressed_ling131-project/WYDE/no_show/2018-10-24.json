Supreme Court justices\nThat or a McCaskill isn't just terribly out of step\nWith the state of Missouri of what the people that voted for and that's why we're going to record\nSo right now uh this issue of this migrant mob I don't like calling in a caravan of does not now that doesn't really [laughter] it doesn't really capture it in my view or what are the people of Missouri thinking about like a crush like this on the border I mean it's a ... it's going to\nNow that doesn't really [laughter] it doesn't really capture it in my view I one of the people of Missouri thinking about like a crash like this on the border I mean it's a it's going to be a crash and it's gonna it's gonna cause a huge problem for immigration officials and it's for the national guard\n\nThat I think that the people in Missouri really worried about it I mean I as I travel all over the state I have I have people talk to me about it especially the last few days and they just yesterday every stop by made all over the state people asked me they said what is going on and they what they say it thank goodness but we have a president\nWho is strong and who was willing to take steps to defend the country\nOn like the Democrats unlike Claire McCaskill who they're open borders policy of course are what encourage this kind of lawlessness in this kind of threat to the country about a half Claire McCaskill up based this threat sponsoring an open borders bill\nI I just can't think of anything worse I Can't think of anything all week\nCan't think of anything that's more dangerous for my state or for the country\nWell when you I'm Josh look at um the rest of\nAmerica right now it seems that the\nSupport for Donald Trump is growing you than his highest point in his presidency which is stunning given how perpetually negative press is I mean it is a negative drumbeat coming out of almost every mainstream media outlet even with that he's at forty seven percent which is higher than bronco Obama was\nA how important is the president\nIn this race for you\nTo report and you know Missouri voted for Donald Trump by almost twenty points\nOn that though that is a huge huge margin in Missouri which is still a swing state and that's because people wanted what I Want a stronger America I mean people voted to rebuild our country that's what they were voting for my state\nWhen they voted for President Trump and his policies\nAre rebuilding the country under good from Missouri You know we've got our lowest unemployment rate it decades in the state of Missouri\nJob growth finally hitting new high we've got blue collar economic growth job growth of the highest point in the Nineteen eighties in the state rural unemployment slow so we're finally starting to get those jobs back from overseas your wages grow but\nHere's what scared folks is that the Democrats Claire McCaskill want to take all that away throw it all and reversed reverse all the games and then go back to the policy of weakness overseas weakness on our border and the you know we just can't have that that's what this election is about\nJosh how has these all these undercover videos of Claire McCaskill Harris her and her staff is that resonated at all what the voters where people are are saying that worked for a while we have to kind of line of the voters we can't really say what we really mean about\nA various issues\nI think it's been usually resident and you know the people to pay to to have a politician especially lifetime politician like Claire McCaskill the one thing to their face in the open up behind their back into the sea Claire McCaskill on tape saying\nThat she wants to take away the second Amendment rights you know he's a constitutional rights\nBut the belong to people by virtue of our constitution to hear her talk about I was to take those away from all five of citizens here her staff talk about\nConcealing the donations from Planned Parenthood and other extremists abortion groups to talk about the fact that well you know the McCaskill really agrees with Brock Obama on everything but she won't say that publicly because you know Missouri voters are are so close minded I mean that's essentially her staff was caught thing over and over and over again\nIt's it's really the condescension the contempt\nFor everyday voters is really remarkable and people are tired\nSince ... staff was caught thing over and over and over again it's it's really the condescension the contempt for everyday voter is really remarkable and people are tired of that they want somebody who believes in the state who is not ashamed of our way of life and the state and it's going to go represented\nA Josh or when you look at the makeup of the Democrat Party today the perpetual mob mentality that seems to be encouraged and even celebrated or by some of their top leaders\nOr how does this you know and it seems like maybe it's just a big cities and this is happening it's not so much and\nAnd you know in in places like Missouri but if it's covered a lot in certainly certainly at Fox and other networks is that on people's minds the president says mobs not jobs ah and it seems like people just want things to calm down and government work for them\nYou know I think that's absolutely true in Missouri or you know I I think that what the Democrats have on offer what Claire McCaskill's offering it's\nChaos at home and weakness abroad and this this model behavior it it is chaos than it is ...\nAnd I think with folks watch mobs driving people out of restaurants screaming them down and public\nBanging on the doors of the U.S Supreme Court and shouting obscenity is I mean this is not the United states of America or this is not a civil democratic discourse I'm all for strong disagreement that's great that's the first amendment but\nTo try and shut down speech and her last intimidate and even use violence against people I mean and have Hillary Clinton as you say Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder out they're encouraging it as Claire McCaskill you know she is she's going right along with it I mean she is happy to see these ... employed\nThat is not what the people in my state voted for that that is not who we are as Americans\nAre Josh I'm the concern I think a lot of I'm a conservative religious voters\nHave is the social\nTransformation of the country and the\nThe idea that gender is something that is changeable and ah that you know that we should really celebrate these things in public schools and and obviously the conscience rights and the religious rights of many say that's not what we believe we love all people but that's not what we believe\nHow ... how are the social issues playing in your state this election cycle\n[laughter] you know the Missourians are leaving the constitution and they believe in the first amendment First Amendment guarantees the freedom of religion\nOr to churches to individual you know this was something where I spent the most of my career I've only been in politics for two years\nYou man the ... and I know you're doing a lot of girls out there [laughter]\nYeah yeah but most of my career as a constitutional lawyer\nAnd as a religious liberty lawyer and the you know the people said they are a fair minded people ah they you know we don't discriminate against anybody based on their religious views but you know what we believe in the importance and value of faith and we believe in the importance of value\nA family and community and do things built around faith in churches in our houses of worship and we want to see those protected and I think they have the again the left wing agenda which has become so hostile\nTo people of faith a so hostile to religious liberties just like a tall so through our Second Amendment rights just like it's become hospital to free speech what do you think about it what what the the left wing agenda really offers as\nA you know you agree with us or you shut up into that is just not what the people by state law at the people in this country\nI'll tell you Josh why I think that Missourians are going to do the right thing and vote for you of many many reasons obviously substantive\nBoulevards they want people to this country\nI'll tell you Josh why I think that Missourians are going to do the right thing and vote for you of met many reasons obviously substantive reasons when you have the right views on critical issues from crime to the economy and immigration\nSo forth but I'll tell you why I think\nYou're going to win is because the New York times is already writing ridiculous articles about about your office in turmoil first of all you show me an office that doesn't have personality conflicts and and uh and people moving in and out and departures and so forth\nBut if this is the best that they can do with you that oh well we had a a a surprising number of purging departing staff from the attorney general's office I started

trying to show at these rallies or you're trying to make the case that if these migrants somehow get into a country where to find that many of them are with MS Thirteen the violent gang or that we're about so much he says\nHe even said quote unquote middle Easterners or among these migrants [noise]\nYou are listening to the Laurie from show a five five forty\nLaura I'm [noise] did did we have any sense of like [noise]\nWanted to use box cutters to take down planes before they did so I mean I guess we\nCould have picked up some intelligence and they wanted to fly planes into buildings but we didn't really think about it\nI always think it's better to just have a\nSmart approach to law enforcement\nAnd constantly reexamine\nYour vulnerabilities as a country given the threats that are out there [noise]\nSuitcase nuclear weapons\nRadioactive um dirty bombs or\nI mean I guess we can just pick a flyer and risk it to say well we hope everybody who comes into the country is going to be economically self sufficient bringing no uh you know bringing no problems with diseases not be a burden at all in our\nSchools our health care I guess we could just hope for the best\nSee that's what the Democrats want they want to hope for the best that's why they're all for the most part they're either silent on what to do with this caravan they don't want to talk about it\nThey know this is a radioactive issue for that may not speaking radioactive they know this is a terrible issue for the Democrats reporters worth their salt should force Democrats\nTo ask questions was should we do with this caravan what should we do with all these people do you think they should all coming to America do you think they should all be released into America including women and children just to show up at a later date which they don't do\nWho do you think should pay for their health care do you believe that a free schooling is what what needs to be done for anyone who gets a foot hold over the border though the Supreme Court ruled that that we have to do that\nBut when is enough enough when when is when is the human tragedy of all of this both inside and outside the United states going to be enough for the Democrats\nI think it's important to stop this caravan impart to send a signal to the rest of Latin America no you're not going to be allowed to come in and in part because in the process of stopping if we're going to learn a lot about the laws of need to be changed\nAnd frankly Congress maybe in the lame duck session audibly challenged ... not to the most comprehensive reform let's say ten dumb things let's just fix one step at a time and begin to make it possible to manage our border\nAs usual Newt Gingrich is one hundred percent correct\nDo not allow politicians to get away with these glib generalities oh we're ... we all were for border enforcement what does that mean you can't enforce the border that's being crushed by fourteen thousand people at one time can't do it so what do do they mean when they say they're for border enforcement\nDo they think the asylum laws as as they exist they shouldn't be changed so anyone who lives in fear of crime in their home country should be able to come here\nOr anyone that just wants a better life should be able to come here\nMatter what that's what the standards going to be so\nThey should be able to come here or anyone that just wants a better life should be able to come here no matter what\nThat's what the standard going to be so we better get ready to double and triple our population really quickly and all that entails environmentally with infrastructure with new schools that need to be built a with massive changes demographic changes to our country we better be ready all that entails\nI don't think America wants to any part of that we want our country to be an orderly uh to be an orderly place a safe place a clean place where\nFreedom and liberty is guaranteed by people who are informed about our history and our founding\nWho don't consider America just a place to go to get a to get a better job that's just an economic migrant we can't we cannot\nKeep our country unified as if it's just that the people as a country period if that's all it becomes a place to make money [noise] do you agree eight five five forty Laura is this what are the important issues on your mind don't go away\n\n\n\nIf you suffer from E. D. and you've seen your doctor about the little blue pill you know it can be expensive and seeing the doctor and waiting at the pharmacy can be a hassle\nA Senator Paul there needs to be significant changes made to our asylum process or to the entire system of immigration admission into the United states given what we're saying we had a thirty eight percent increase in family units crossing the border month a month\nOr in in August or September I'm an excuse me thirty percent year over year and it was among the highest crossing right we had since two thousand fourteen disaster\nBecause people now if they bring a child then there'll be a release or because you can't keep you can't keep them longer than twenty day so there'll be released together and then they never show up so it is the Senate and the is finally going to agree to move forward to change us otherwise we'll have a caravan every week\n[noise] [noise] yeah I think we ought to scrap what we've been doing there shouldn't be a lottery system people who end of the country should be based on merit we should be selective on who comes to the country with regard to those who come across the border\nI Would say look you want to keep people together and keep families together do it through it within twenty four hours and send them back and the thing is is we have an immigration office apply to come in as far as refugee status what we've done is we've taken away all the rule\nClaim to be a refugee none of the rules apply so typically if you come in here and you can legally immigrate there are some decent prohibitions on getting on welfare and on getting on government assistance\nIf you're a refugee apparently all those things go out the window so everybody knows that when you come he claimed to be a refugees you can get on welfare and get into government housing and this is something that should change I'm fine with\n... we can absorb people if they want to come and more\nEach year\nPeople that we can emitted into the country and how many we need and will make that decision each year but uh we can't allow just people just to to come across the border by the thousands\nUm we're talking to Rand Paul here on the lower Ingram shows Senator Paul what can you think um are the most important issues facing the country today given everything that we're seeing all the great\nAdvancement we've made in the economy the Republicans are leading by a historic margin in the handling the economy Seventeen point advantage in trade and the new NBC Wall Street Journal poll\nA those two issues are are massive plus it's for the Republicans and in a tough midterm cycle cycle normally so what do you see especially coming from the Kentucky perspective\nI think the good news is overwhelming at all scared by the media you know the ... and being carried away with all the Trump to arrangements said or the good news is overwhelming we have an economy growing at just an amazing pace over four percent annual growth unemployment at historic lows\nThe main thing I see is I go round Kentucky when I talked to plant managers is they said we have a shortage of workers a shortage of people who are drug free with work ethic and so the answer here is this is a time before but this is a time when we should convert or work program\nWorkers a shortage of people who are drug free with work ethic and so the answer here is this is a time before but this is a time when we should convert or work programs that are on welfare programs to hey there's a job down the street programs and I think if we were able to do that\nYou know we have a great future coming ahead and most of it's because\nThis is what Republicans off in the Washington don't get they keep calling it tax reform and the president directs them no it was a tax cut a significant tax cut will return money to his rightful owner leaves the money in the private marketplace and guess what the\nPrivate marketplace will boom when you leave money in the private marketplace and so all of that has been great and I don't think we can emphasize that enough and I think in the election if they come to fruition that not only the cabin all the other side of the Republican base but there are reports that early voting in seven out of eight states that are reporting\nWhere people can uh decide how many a Republican and how many are Democrat the Republicans are are in a big upsurge with oh you're voting\nYeah which is is is you know music to my ears because Tom Styron sorrows and others have really funneled an enormous amount of money into voter registrations on college campuses which are overwhelmingly I'm moving to the Democrat Party or Senator Paul why shouldn't Americans\nCare about this Saudi killing of this Jamal ...\nWho ah was living in the United states he was or was he he was previously a kind of a sympathize with the Muslim Brotherhood and he you know he was mourning the death of bin Laden although he thought bin Laden went off the wrong track and\nGot to radicalize spent media had been tied up on this story for you know a couple of weeks now\nI Would say that ah the killing of cars showed me by the Saudis is just one more instance of things that they do that are not good for America they spent over a hundred billion dollars over the last several decades a supporting the ... around the world that teach hatred of Christianity and Judaism and Hindus\nThey're over ten thousand madrassas in Pakistan supported by them the ... network which is a group of a bad actors in Pakistan that attack our soldiers in Afghanistan they all the leaders of it went through in the process funded by Saudi Arabians\nSaudi Arabians fund madrassas in Indonesia as it used to have a relatively moderate form of Islam is a big Islamic nation\nBut there there's a growing faction of of those who now believe in violence against civilians\nTaught by the Saudis so the Saudis are bad they have been doing this for decades and we sort of turn a blind I'd say it's all Iran Iran Iran we have to support the south is I'm not so sure that the Saudis are less evil than the uranium to tell you the truth\nThe war in Yemen is going to drag us into another war in the middle east\nThousands of civilians are being killed so the killing of the journalist I Would say is just one more item\nOf bad action by Saudi Arabia but Saudi Arabia sent arms by the hundreds of tons of it into Syria to al ... an al ...\nThey they they supported the worst and most extreme elements of the Sunni extremists in the Syrian civil war so no I Can't think of a reason why we shouldn't be hopping mad about this\nBut what I've advised as we should quit selling them arms or should quit aiding and abetting them in what they're doing throughout the middle east and the world\nWell the administration and the president himself yesterday said you know they're and they're important partners of ours so in the middle east is that not the case I mean they've actually assisted American interest in the middle east is specifically obviously when Iran which still is the largest state sponsor of terrorism [noise]\nI mean they've actually assistant American interest in the middle east is specifically obviously when Iran which still is the largest state sponsor of terrorism\n[noise] yeah but I Would call the Saudis the largest state sponsor of radical Islam you know they really teach it throughout the world the people who came attacks on nine eleven weren't a rainy and they were Saudis\nIf you really look at worldwide terrorism it's the Saudis and therefore McGuire ... is that is being sent an export around the world so uh as far as arms they buy some of our I'm sure but I don't think the armed our military arms are or something like any other private entity like widgets or whatever\nOur armed or something unique we paid for by the taxpayer F. sixteen is not something that\nWe could get jobs by selling up six team to China or Russia I Would still be against it because I'm not I don't see our arms trade as jobs program it's about our national defence and I think selling arms the Saudis\nActually puts it I said at greater risk it increases or risk that Yemen's going to devolve into chaos and like Libya before it in Syria and Iraq before that\nChaos is where terrorists breed so if we want to stop terrorists we need to quit aiding and abetting the Saudis and creating chaos\nI Know Jim ... who's the Saudi foreign minister responded to your uh view on the show you down and he said that\nI find that very surprising that some of these thousand miles away can be with us in the oven and miles away no access to information and intelligence services holding the phone and this is not just based on the notions of the things you\nTake a swing it that\nA lot too excited to be lectured by some autocrats from a dictatorship you know the Saudis have three thousand people in prison right now without trial\nSo he says oh we shouldn't presume the crown prince to be innocent until otherwise proven\nWhat about the three thousand people in your country that you have locked up in jail and you don't give a trial too so I think it's pretty galling for him to take western standards our western standards of presumption of innocence and say oh you need to presume the crown prince to innocent\nIt's a dictatorship nothing happens over there without the crown prince being involved the Fifteen people that were involved with killing and dismay and bring this journalist\nApparently many of them are henchmen there travel with a crown prince when he travels it goes up to two people who their punishment now has been being fired\nTo chop ups or to the topping up and the ... member him and other journalists and you get fired\nMy guess is they're uh they're banished met will be in royal exile somewhere with lots of money the lower level people they will probably executed an outlet talk to anyone because they would probably implicate the crown prince and this so now I'm not too excited to be lectured by these people\nA Rand Paul here on the ...

just came up Paton December eleventh and that seems to be greedy and that's in the little blue pills no available and generic form available to you get thirty dollars for a month supply that's a big discounts\nAre at the front of the group uh that were already in place in a big shift area where they were feeding some a Red Cross a health and uplifting brought that I was also there it's a nicer you to say that but they the group's\nVery well connected with what's happening on the ground here and what I did have an opportunity to do with with me and speak with all the people that were cutting through mostly young men are a lot of Thirteen I saw as well as just a village or farmers\nAre able bodied working men who joined it this group in Honduras as it made its way through and what I can tell you is that\nAbsolutely the information that I was getting on the ground based on what they were carrying their backpacks and everything the very well coordinated they had a coordinated message a very\nVery very few of them beard off that message because there was leadership within the group you know I speak Spanish so I Know what's going on around me and and and think\nSpeak Spanish so I Know what's going on around me and and and thank God I Do because\nYou know you will catch people in the line okay move this way don't talk to the reporters right now we're moving forward chat this say that and I said well you told me a minute ago you didn't have a leader in the group but demand up ahead is actually telling you guys what you know so I'm assuming he's leader\nOh no no no no we don't have any leaders we don't have any leaders I go up and talk to the gentleman no no we're just trying to keep moving forward\nI said well you guys have matching backpacks you have\nYou know the flag of Honduras at the front of your group nobody in the group actually looked that tired or hungry um I was told by one of the people in the groups that they did have some bussing\nThat people were in the villages and they heard it by word of mouth or that they heard it use uh that they were coming to America to look for jobs this is about poverty so\nVery well coordinated effort according to the intelligence officials on the ground there are groups actually organizing this I'm In Honduras\nUh remember there's and you know a lot about this or there's a big battle here in a politically between the various a conservative or a government and uh the socialist government\nSo there is some suspicion that a socialist groups in Honduras along with a no open borders society and others there's a lot of talk about that here\nHave been coordinating to do this march so that it would coincide with the U.S a elections a mid term elections and create a lot of a political fodder to the United states and here in Central America\nOne thing that I I find to be very disturbing or the or are those who are facilitating this dangerous situation for children and women along the way a and these are people with flatbed trucks\nOn these groups in the United states who are sending immigration lawyers down to coach these are individuals or they did that in the last caravan ah they're doing in the ... and the other one in and others as you pointed out on their way\nOr if something is done to stop this there will be well they're not a Sarah a group of thousands every week coming in tore into our borders ...\n... absolutely Lauren this is not stopping I mean what I was down at the border and it was a very precarious situation you know there were so many men it was it was it was it was a bit dangerous I mean there was some concern among the intelligence officials there\nAre you brought up such a great point\nUm that the women and children that were a part of these caravans the first wave and the second wave that were put in the front of the lines are basically for the media are in danger are in danger every second that they are traveling with these groups\nAre according to what a mall and officials apparently a child a baby\nWith trampled on when they first the first part of that second wave rushed through uh the border and the baby was killed now remember their intelligence apparatus has people embedded in these caravans to\nTo try to gather information to find out what's going on here who is coordinating this they talked about this baby that died that was trampled to death when his mother was knocked down to the ground a the baby was buried apparently asked by some of those leadership within the group to take the baby away and buried the baby so that\nThe Guatemalan government we didn't have any access to the body or one of the ...\nTo take the baby away and bury the baby so that\nThe Guatemalan government we didn't have any access to the body\nOr one of the reasons or the government wanted to know and obviously wanted to bring justice to the child's life with so that they could charge people that were coordinating this group with either manslaughter or murder or because it's just becoming a really dangerous situation for the people that are moving forward\nAnd for the United states and our us southern border this is extraordinarily dangerous a big problem for us because some of the people within these groups\nAre not just regular farm workers are people for villages that are hard working people um there are good people in these groups I think they've been used and they're being used by these coordinators but there are some MS Thirteen gang members there is some pretty bad guys in these groups to\nUm we know that from seeing their tattoos from talking to them while\nI was down on the border I'm definitely gang affiliated people so we're we're not what we're seeing here is people being abused and use\nBy these organizers by these governments and I I'm telling you there are people within the ... I'm Honduran government socialist political activists political groups that are helping with this coordination and they're presenting a huge problem or not just for for for\nOur country but for their own people as they make their way down here I Know there's more ways that people are ready to move forward because remember once they get this thing started once the ball yeah rolling\nThere's no way to stop it it's a snowball effect and people will just all of Eric ... going to let us into a their country and they coached them my coach them on credible fear\nCredible here this is what you need to say when you get to the border this is how you stay in America\nAnd it's just a it's just a game I mean it's just you say a few lines and then you were released with a piece of paper\nAnd a judge shows try and hold women and children separately you can't keep it keep them longer than twenty days and then they're off to the races and it's and it's pretty much over and I think a lot of these democratic socialist organizations in the United states know that once they get into the country\nThose new you know temporary you know migrants or whatever the provisional status they get\n... feel like a debt of gratitude to the left and be ... Democrats if they ever get amnesty that's what they want then there is a demographic shift in the country that his ear retrieval both for Republicans in irreversible because of the sheer numbers\nA great point I mean which is the reason we've seen some of those reports coming out of California and other parts of the country where we've seen that illegals have voted right\nUh and and there was a shift and there's a shift in if they become citizens of course there's another shift a one of the interesting things I spoke with a subsidy for immigration and Customs Enforcement of the United states and part of what they're seeing is is that for example men will take young girls\nYou know the ... the the under Eighteen or children and the women will take the boys because once they reach the border and if the you know as as a mother says well I don't have the father they can't really separate\nThe child from the mother so that they just released them into the U.S with a return to court date\nSo we're seeing the catch and release it still on going\nWe have men who have little girls they know they can't put them in a holding facility with other men because they've got to a child they can't separate them so they release them so we're still seeing the same problems that we've seen for years happening right now and the president you know President Trump\nIs is very adamant about the fact like look you guys can't control your borders work in a pool aid or the ... the complexity here is that okay we understand\nAbout the fact like look you guys can't control your borders\nWork in a pool aid or the ... the complexity here is that okay we understand that but our borders are being overrun too so I think the most important thing we can do for\nThe United states where the Guatemalan government even with in Honduras right now for the hunter and government that's working against some of the socialist a\nA aspects of their uh their country at political apparatus is to actually find out who is funding this is any with money from us aid going to find these groups\nThat are coordinating the separate than we really start pulling the funding and we really need to hold people accountable because what we have is a caravan of people may as well with children and women although those numbers are a lot smaller uh from what I've seen than the men that are coming across and saying\nWe're going to charge you were going to find a way to stop this we're going to pull that funding from\nFrom USAID a groups that are that are actually assisting and that's a caravan and we're going to hold people responsible for the people that guy along the track because believe me young women are being raped\nA there is a lot of concern with ... with children\nAre being uh exposed to this type of a brand new with care of that this walk being put on the back of card so people should actually be charged for this and held accountable if they're not I'm afraid that this is going to continue we really need to expose doing this and what's going on\nOut well again ... follow the money someone's paying a fuel for these trucks someone's paying for the uh the food the accommodations not everybody's sleeping on the floor every night you don't you can't move this ... this number of people without an organization behind you you cannot just\nSo they can get [noise]\n[noise]\nThey don't ...

already well I'm just I don't know you I've never I don't think I've ever met you but uh I I'm just so excited that Illinois has a chance to actually send someone to the U.S Senate who has a sensible pragmatic view of the role of government which obviously Claire McCaskill does not have\nWell I mean that's that is for church or about Claire McCaskill or I mean he has to be totally out of step with the state which is the third by the way right next door but\nUh how am I saying Illinois I'm this is a top rating I Know slave\nI'm Sorry about that of course\nI'm a whip yeah fourteen days to go in this campaign and uh we're at the state of the campaign hours seven days a week it is but\nListen here's the bottom line and in this campaign is that Senator McCaskill has been in politics thirty six years that's about as long as I've been alive she's been in Washington for twelve long years it's become a party line liberal I mean whether it's immigration where she's sponsoring the open borders bill with diet fine dies\nOr whether it's the judges you voted no on justice Kavanaugh was all for the terrible smear that her party carried out she voted no on Gorsuch ... Supreme Court justices\nSenator McCaskill is and she's just terribly out of step\nWith the state of Missouri of what the people at the state voted for and that's why we're going to replace\nSo right now on this issue of this migrant mob I don't like calling in a caravan it does not now that doesn't really [laughter] it doesn't really capture it in my view\nI one of the people of Missouri thinking about like a crash like this on the border I mean it's a it's going to be a crash and it's gonna it's gonna cause a huge problem for immigration officials and for the national guard\nThat I think that the people in the very really worried about it I mean I as I travel all over the state I have I have people talk to me about it especially the last few days I mean this yesterday every stop I made all over the state people ask me they said what is going on and they what they say it thank goodness but we have a president\nWho is strong and who is willing to take steps to defend the country on like the Democrats unlike Claire McCaskill who they're open borders policy of course are what encourage this kind of lawlessness and this kind of a threat to the country and now to have Claire McCaskill of base of this threat sponsoring\nAn open borders bill\nI I just can't think of anything work so I Can't think of anything all week I\nCan't think of anything that's more dangerous for months tutor for the country\nWell when you I'm Josh look at um the rest of America right now it seems that\nThe support for Donald Trump is growing you said is highest point in his presidency which is stunning given how perpetually negatives\nThe press is I mean it is a negative drumbeat coming out of almost every mainstream media outlet even with that he's at forty seven percent which is higher than Brock Obama was\nOr how important is the president in this race for you\nTo important\nYou know Missouri voted for Donald Trump by almost twenty points\nOn that though that is a huge huge margin in Missouri which is still a swing state and that's because people wanted what they want a stronger America I mean people voted to rebuild our country that's what they were voting for my state\nWhen they voted for President Trump and his policies\nAre rebuilding the country under good from Missouri You know we've got our lowest unemployment rate it decades as a state of Missouri\nJob growth finally hitting new high we've got blue collar economic growth job growth but at this point since the Nineteen eighties in the state rural unemployment slow so we're finally starting to get those jobs back from overseas your wages grow but\nHere's what scared folks is that the Democrats Claire McCaskill want to take all that away throw it all in reverse\nOverseas your wages grow but here's what scared folks is that the Democrats Claire McCaskill want to take all that away throw it all in reverse reverse all the games and then go back to the policy of weakness overseas weakness on our border and the you know we just can't have that that's what this election is about\nJosh how has these if at all these undercover videos of Claire McCaskill\nHarris her and her staff is that resonated at all what the voters where people are are saying that worked for a while we have to kind of lie to the voters we can't really say what we really mean about a various issues\nThough I think what's been usually resident and you know the people to pay to to have a politician especially lifetime politician like Claire McCaskill the one thing to their faith in the open up behind their back into the sea or McCaskill on tape saying\nThat she wants to take away the second Amendment rights you know he's a constitutional rights\nBut the belong to people by virtue of our constitution to hear her talk about I was to take those away from all by your staff talk about\nConcealing the donations from Planned Parenthood and other extremist abortion groups to\nTalk about the fact that well you know the McCaskill really agrees with Brock Obama on everything but she won't say that publicly because you know Missouri voters are are so close minded I mean that's essentially what our staff was caught thing over and over and over again it's it's really the condescension the contempt\nFor everyday voter is really remarkable and people are tired of that they want somebody who believes in the state who is not ashamed of our way of life and the state and it's going to go represented\nA Josh or when you look at the makeup of the Democrat Party today the\nPerpetual mob mentality that seems to be encouraged and even celebrated or by some of their top leaders or how does this you know and it seems like maybe it's just a big cities and this is happening it's not so much and\nAnd you know in in places like Missouri but if it's covered a lot in certainly certainly at Fox and other networks is that on people's minds of president says mobs not jobs ah and it seems like people just want things to calm down in government to work for them\nYou know I think that's absolutely true in Missouri or you know I I think that what the Democrats have on offer what Claire McCaskill's offered this chaos at home and weakness abroad and this this model behavior it it is chaos than it is ...\nAnd I think with folks watch mobs driving people out of restaurants screaming them down and public\nBanging on the doors of the U.S Supreme Court and shouting obscenity is I mean this is not\nThe United states of America or this is not civil democratic discourse I'm all for strong disagreement that's great that's the first amendment but\nTo try and shut down speech\nAnd harassed intimidate and even use violence against people I mean and have Hillary Clinton as you say Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder out they're encouraging it as Claire McCaskill you know she is she's going to ride along with it I mean she is happy to see these ... employed\nThat is not what the people in my state voted for him that that is not who we are as Americans\nAre Josh I'm the concern I think a lot of um conservative religious voters\nHave is the social\nTransformation of the country and the\nThe idea that gender is something that is changeable and uh that you know that we should really celebrate these things in public schools and and obviously the conscience rights and the religious rights of many say that's not what we believe we love all people but that's not what we believe [noise]\nAnd liberate these things in public schools and and obviously the conscience rights and the religious rights of many say that's not what we believe we love all people but that's not what we believe how ... how are the social issues playing in your state this election cycle\n\nYou know the Missourians are leaving the constitution and they believe in the first amendment First Amendment guarantees the freedom of religion or to purchase to individual you know this is something we're supposed to look through my career I've only been in politics you years\nYou've met in the background I Know you're doing a lot of girls out there\nYeah yeah but most of my career as a constitutional lawyer and as a religious liberty lawyer and the you know the people said they are a fair minded people\nOr the you know we don't discriminate against anybody based on their religious views but you know what we believe in the importance of value face and we believe that the importance of value a family and community and those things built around the churches in our houses of worship and we want to see those protected and I think they have the again the left wing agenda\nWhich has become so hostile\nTo people who have a so hostile to religious liberties just like a hostile through our Second Amendment rights just like become hospital to free speech what do you think about it what what the the left wing agenda really offers as a you know you agree with us or you shut up\nInto that is just not what the people of ice they want people to this country\nI'll tell you Josh why I think that Missourians are going to do the right thing and vote for you of many many reasons obviously substantive reasons I mean you have the right views on critical issues from crime to the economy and immigration so forth but I'll tell you why I think you're going to win is because the New York times is already writing ridiculous\nArticles about about your office in turmoil first of all you show me an office that doesn't have personality conflicts in in a and people moving in and out and departures and so forth\nBut it's this is the best that they can do with you that oh well we had a well you know of a surprising number of purging departing staff from the attorney general's office I started reading this today and I'm screaming laughing because it's just like they could say that about pretty much everybody I Know his office\nWell you know we are definitely getting the Donald Trump treatment I Love your time's up from the liberal state and\nI

part they're either silent on what to do with this caravan they don't want to talk about it\nThey know this is a radioactive issue for that may not speaking of radioactive they know this is a terrible issue for the Democrats reporters worth their salt should force Democrats\nTo ask questions was should we do with this caravan what should we do with all these people do you think they should all

no you're not going to be allowed to come in and in part because in the process of stopping we're going to learn a lot about the laws of need to be changed\nAnd frankly Congress maybe in the lame duck

Gingrich is one hundred percent correct\nDo not allow politicians to get away with these glib generalities oh we're ... we all were for border enforcement what does that mean you can't enforce the border that's being crushed by fourteen thousand people at one time can't do it so what do do they mean when they say they're for border enforcement\nDo they think the asylum laws as as they exist they shouldn't be changed so anyone who lives in fear of crime and their home country should be able to come here\nOr anyone who just wants a better life should be able to come here\nNo matter

need to be built a with massive changes demographic changes to our country we better be ready\nAll that entails\nI don't think America wants to any part of that we want our country to be an orderly uh to be an orderly place a safe place a clean place where freedom and liberty is guaranteed by people who are informed about our history in our founding\nWho don't consider America just a place to go to

D. and you've seen your doctor about the little blue pill you know it can be expensive and seeing the doctor and waiting at the pharmacy can be a hassle\nA Senator Paul there needs to be significant changes made to our asylum process or to the entire system of immigration admission into the United states given what we're saying we had a thirty eight percent increase in family units crossing the border month to month\nUh in in August or September I'm an excuse me thirty percent year over year and it was among the highest crossing right we had since that two thousand fourteen disaster\nBecause people know if they bring a child then there'll be a release or because you can't keep you can't keep them longer than twenty days so there'll be released together and then they never show up so it's in the Senate and the is finally going to agree to move forward to change us otherwise we'll have a caravan every week\n[noise] [noise] yeah I think we ought to scrap what we've been doing there shouldn't be a lottery system people who end of the country should be based on merit we should be selective on who comes to the country with regard to those who come across the border\nI Would say look you want to keep people together and keep families together do it through it within twenty four hours and send them back and the thing is is we have an immigration office apply to come in as far as refugee status what we've done is we've taken away all the rule\nClaim to be a refugee none of the rules apply so typically if you come in here and you can legally immigrate or some decent prohibitions on getting on welfare\nAnd on getting on government assistance\nIf your refugee apparently all those things go out the window so everybody knows that when you come he claimed to be a refugees you can get on welfare and get into government housing and this is something that should change I'm fine with\n... we can absorb people want to come and we're\nEach year people that we\nThis is something that should change I'm fine with\n... we can absorb people if they want to come and more\nEach year\nPeople that we can emitted into the country and how many we need and will make that decision each year but uh we can't allow just people just to to come across the border by the thousands\nI'm Talking to Rand Paul here on the lower Ingram shows Senator Paul what can you think um are the most important issues facing the country today given everything that we're seeing all the great\nAdvancement we've made in the economy the Republicans are leading by a historic margin in the handling the economy Seventeen point advantage in trade and the new NBC Wall Street Journal poll a those two issues are are massive pluses for the Republicans in in a tough mid term cycle cycle normally\nSo what do you see especially coming from the Kentucky perspective\nI think the good news is overwhelming at all obscured by the media you know he often being carried away with all the Trump to arrangements said grow\nThe good news is overwhelming we have an economy growing at just an amazing pays over four percent annual growth unemployment at historic lows\nThe main thing I see as I go round Kentucky when I talked to plant managers as\nThey say we have a shortage of workers a shortage of people who are drug free with work ethic and so the answer here is this is a time before but this is a time when we should convert or work programs that are welfare programs to hey there's a job down the street programs and I think if we were able to do that\nYou know we have a great future coming ahead and most of it's because\nThis is what Republicans off in the Washington do get they keep calling it tax reform and the president directs them no it was a tax cut a significant tax cut will return money to his rifle owners leaves the money in the private marketplace and guess what the private marketplace will boom when you leave money in the private marketplace and so\nAll of that has been great and I don't think we can emphasize that enough and I think in the election they come to fruition that not only the cabin on the side of the Republican base but there are reports that early voting in seven out of eight states that are reporting\nWhere people can uh decide how many a Republican and how many are Democrats the Republicans are are in a big upsurge with early voting\nYeah which is is is you know music to my ears because Tom Styron Soros and others have really funneled an enormous amount of money into voter registrations on college campuses which are overwhelmingly I'm moving to the Democrat Party or Senator Paul why should Americans\nCare about this Saudi killing of this Jamal ...\nWho ah was living in the United states he was or was he he was previously kind of a\nSympathize with the Muslim Brotherhood and he you know he was mourning the death of bin Laden although he thought bin Laden went off the wrong track and got to radicalize but media have been tied up on this story for you know a couple of weeks now\nI Would say that ah the killing of cars showed me by the Saudis is just one more incidents of things that they do that or not good for America\nThey spent over a hundred billion dollars over the last several decades a supporting the drop is around the world that teach hatred of Christianity Judaism and Hindus\nThey're over ten thousand madrassas in Pakistan supported by them the ... network which is a group of a bad actors in Pakistan that attack our soldiers in Afghanistan they all the leaders of it went through in the process funded by Saudi Arabians\nSaudi Arabians fun madrassas in Indonesia as it used to have a relatively moderate form of Islam is a big Islamic\nSo they went to them the draw of funded by Saudi Arabians Saudi Arabians fun madrassas in Indonesia that used to have a relatively moderate form of Islam is a big Islamic nation\nBut there there's a growing faction of of those who now believe in violence against civilians\nTaught by the Saudis so the Saudis are bad they have been doing this for decades and we sort of turn a blind eye and say it's all Iran Iran Iran we have to support the Saudis I'm not so sure that the Saudis are less evil than the uranium to tell you the truth the war in Yemen is going to drag us into another war in the middle east\nThousands of civilians are being killed\nSo the killing of the journalist I Would say is just one more item\nAbad action by Saudi Arabia but Saudi Arabia sent arms by the hundreds of tons of it into Syria to al ... an al ...\nThey they they supported the worst and most extreme elements of the Sunni extremists in the Syrian civil war so no I Can't think of a reason why we shouldn't be the hopping mad about this\nBut what I've advised as we should quit selling them arms or should quit aiding and abetting them in what they're doing throughout the middle east and the world\nWell the administration and the president himself yesterday said you know they're and they're important partners of ours though in the middle east is that not the case I mean they've actually assistant American interest in the middle east is specifically obviously when Iran which still is the largest state sponsor of terrorism [noise]\nYeah but I Would call the Saudis the largest state sponsor of radical Islam you know they really teach it throughout the world the people who came attacked us on nine eleven ... Iranians they were Saudis\nIf you really look at worldwide terrorism is the Saudis and their form of ... and that is being sent an export around the world [noise] so uh as far as arms they buy some of our I'm sure but I don't think the armed our military arms are or something like any other private entity like widgets or whatever\nOur arms or something unique we paid for by the taxpayer F. sixteen is not something that\nIf we can get jobs by selling F. sixteen to China or Russia I Would still be against it because I'm not I don't see our arms trade as jobs program it's about our national defence and I think selling arms the Saudis\nActually puts it I said at greater risk it increases or risk that Yemen is going to devolve into chaos in Libya before it in Syria and Iraq before that chaos is where terrorists breed so if we want to stop terrorists we need to quit aiding and abetting the Saudis and creating chaos\nAnd Jim ... who's the Saudi foreign minister responded to your uh view on the show you down and he said that\nI find it very surprising that some of these thousand miles away can be services on citizens of miles away no access information and intelligence and this isn't going to send it to the\nPhones and this is not in fact it seems to be on the notions of the nation\nI take a swing it that\nLot too excited to be lectured by some autocrat from a dictatorship you know the Saudis have three thousand people in prison right now without trial\nSo he says oh we should presume the crown prince to be innocent until otherwise proven\nWhat about uh three thousand people in your country that you're locked up in jail and you don't give a trial too so I think it's pretty galling for him to take western standards our western standards of presumption of innocence and say oh you need to presume the crown prince to innocent\nIt's a dictatorship nothing happens over there without the crown prince being involved the Fifteen people that were involved with killing and dismay and bring this journalist apparently many of them are henchmen there travel with a crown prince when he travels it goes up to two people who their punishment now has been being fired\nApparently many of them are hench bend the travel with the crown prince when you travel it goes up to two people who their punishment has been being fired\nTo chop ups or to the chopping up and the December meant other journalists and you get fired\nMy guess is they're uh they're banished met will be in royal exile somewhere with lots of money the lower level people they will play executed an outlet talked to anyone because they would probably implicate the crown prince and this so now I've got to excite it'd be lectured by these people\nA Rand Paul here on the ...

driving past campus Sanford university looked like a song that we all know [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nSee I was sitting there thinking if every light in the house is on and it kind of looks like a runway like what is going on I was about to pull up and I was about to relate to the show because I'm like I was a police chase going on or something\nI'm here I Am ready I'm not kidding you I think every light on that campus was on so if you're driving past today just looking just looking because usually it's dark you\nCan drive past and it's like the campus was waking up with the rest of the city all you can hear all the college students some of them are sleeping some of them are throwing up because they're hung over but nevertheless you can hear the sounds and smells and vomit of the campus\nYou can't hear smell but you can hear the sound smell the smells and experienced the vomit says the campus but every\nSingle light was on and I don't know why and honestly it was kind of frightening Dylan\nWere you involved in a police chase over there earlier a earlier this morning I don't make it that far you don't make it the oh in your police chases you just tend to stay in your area is that what is that what I'm hearing\nWell I frequent are huge kind of knew it'd be camp is not the same print area UAB is like right next to Sanford it's like a stone's throw Sanford is closer to here than UAB is but basically yeah they're like ten minutes part\nThat is true but I'm saying is still Sanford is close to UAB all I'm saying is is this was the olden days right and we was talking about oh Jesus is speaking at UAB we could make a walk\nIt's not like it was going to be a four day walk you don't think we can make a walk you it'd be I'm not saying Jesus is speaking at five thirty am we're going to make it there but I'm saying Jesus speaking at five PM I think we can make that what we can finish the show and make that walk\nThat's like an hour and a half walk between those two

[laughter]\nWe're having to listen to vote no Dillon said you talked about the Titanic you know what's coming so I'm the one that did something wrong I'm Sorry\nAh we're suffering for your since\n... okay sorry about that [laughter] yeah you know they do cruises to uh to and through Alaska and all that yeah Browne now around icebergs yeah yeah so\nAs far as that goes I wouldn't have an issue with free tracing the route of the original Titanic but what was interesting about that ship ... is\nThe way that they designed and built it it was one there is not the first ship ever should be a chamber so to speak in ... in other words you you get close off each room that they created you know court orders and stuff\nAnd you had a hatch yeah that you could ah secure that would stop a rap interstates stopped that's great yeah anyway um if he had hit that\nIceberg head on ... ah the ship\nWould never sunk in it either could have returned to port or kitchen completed the journey and a minimal people would have been injured but what he does he turned ...\nAnd it could have returned to port or ... or completed the journey and a minimal people would have been injured\nBut what he did he turn hard writer and when they did that scraped and they go long haul right at the water line yikes down the side of the ship so it it basically ruin the uh in in ... water tight integrity of all those doors and whatnot\nAnd open the ship up to massive flooding\nYikes that's I I did not know that I knew the basics of the story but I I'm not big into ships or anything like that I don't know how any of that work so that's really interesting\nAnd that they were having communication problems and if I remember correctly I don't know the visibility was necessarily the best either they really need it they should they knew better than to go through that particular shipping lane at that time of year yeah and uh plenty of ships out there were already broadcasting\nThat there was a lot of iceberg\nMoving around so that whole thing could have been avoided and uh\nSounds like he uh or the other one down here it sounds like a similar story that goes to ... that went down where uh\nIt was just um the uh what is it the pilot that was trying to get too close the captain that was trying to get too close to shore trying to show off\nThey they did all the work to design it so there's only one place you can go to try to figure out a problem yeah but it seems a little girl is to me is it going to be like the love boat you know um\nAnd I just noticed that there is a disco cruise leaving like in November or something I or January I don't know\nOr ... Cruz disco cruise yeah where they're going to have the mirror ball everything and the\nThe the guys that saying uh well I Am see a\nA million dollars yeah ... those guys and I'll tell you mine it on our board whether we crashed or not [laughter]\nThen I I imagine it's got to be you know this is what brings people out to a platform that is not a it's not a well it's a ship that doesn't move unless you get some violent weather\nI don't understand why people want to yeah I guess some people get sick just looking at the water move but ah you know that's the most horrendous thing I should tell your stories about\nSome of the prettiest girl you take a short and all of a sudden they just become which isn't monsters it's just unbelievable what a human body is capable at once you that boat starts moving around ...\n... ... I don't know what intrigues people or maybe it was a shakedown cruise you know to get to buddies out I Would probably go on it then\nI saw it I agree ...\nYeah shakedown crews like I I've been on a few of them are you going to the shipyard you pick up the ship we just a purchase one for three and a half million dollars a ...\nIt's under five hundred times but it's a it's a fine vessel but you know what we're going to still have to put like a million and a half into it\nAfter you get it out of the shipyard in the first thing you want to do once you get that thing in the water you got to shake you got a shakedown cruiser you got to get the bugs out\nAnd uh you said all the electronics and most of it's already done but that that that is you know what it says boring as it is right now the shakedown cruise you just basically want to know how fast it goes and whether or not or all of the things that they said they were going to sell you are on there I'm In\n[laughter] yeah I hey if I ever if I ever won the lottery I Would definitely buy me a couple of vessels and you get into the business\nI you're telling me oh you didn't win the five hundred thousand dollar jak bought last night\nWell I I cannot tell you a hundred\nMillion [laughter] hundred billion we had done in my ear you sit down and five hundred thousand eight you sit down and when you're ... or early yeah five hundred million after taxes like\nWhat one point four million ... million airs when I'm looking for a ... I'm Sorry\nYou add up Powerball with that and you have like to point three billion dollars in lottery winnings yeah why can't we do that in Alabama Mm can't we make it as popular as that one that where people are buying tickets like that\nIn fact they tried to make it more inclusive for winters like everybody's going to get a better chance at winning you know why can't we do down in Alabama all we have to do is make it private\nUnderstand 'cause it's a moral and people like the government telling you what you can and can't spend your money on actually ... philosophy\nThe moral and people like the government telling you what you can and can't spend your money on it's actually ... philosophy\n\nOr ah I don't know it sounds like a person who's just mean and oppressive and watched a commander of life instead of you they think they're that you're too stupid to brush your teeth in the morning and so they built journal electric toothbrush and with a handle on it or when I'm In biblical cord to their hand it it gets ridiculous\nThey let a government employee brush my teeth for me in the morning [laughter] like I ... I feel like if I'd be like good morning Jerry come on in you know my tax dollars go to it\nHave you ever heard the phrase close enough for government work good enough to have 'em at work close and now that\nYeah close enough like grenades yeah and and AIDS and government work [laughter] it's about the best things\nWas an I definitely have a smiling DMV employee come in and help me brush my teeth in the morning I think that'd be fantastic\nOh only like ... and get another government work\n... you better not braces complain says it's about their job is not an odd job description you know ... you know I and I I was curious about what\nYou're talking about all the lifespan or maybe a lot of people are cameras campus that actually saw the Halloween movie and just to scare the term lights out\nMaybe but I heard that new movie that was released it supposed to be like a remake of the old Halloween movies I don't watch scary movies I think it's pointless to pay money to get scared but the ones with the mask right with the guy that's running around with a knife I Know it's a really have is when I heard the remake was awful I have friends that worked out of it\nWell it seems that ah the media like the news at all CBS ABC there touting this movie as you know top notch a big bucks a a mega movie it obviously the house and yeah of course why did they say that because ABC owns Disney\nYeah yeah there is now we're seeing the Turin\nExactly so it's always connected with the money yeah yeah um\nYeah [noise] I I again I I ended up back in my mind even though I'm target the suffering that must be going through with this migraine is always in the back of my mind I Can't help but think about that actually affects the way I think right now because when I see a person\nOr know of a person that suffering from a migraine\nYou know it it it just hurts me to the quick right now because uh so much of that suffering as needless for one of our pay attention to your diet and uh you know take maybe go to a you it'd be and find out what they've got down there to take care of renting migraines a long as you don't have to take a pill or something I Would\nI Would probably get into it ... yeah\nWell hey it's most likely I'm from a caffeine deprivation because ... yesterday I had normal amount that I have in the morning and then I had ... more caffeine after I got off around ten o'clock\nSo it might be from that don't worry I had them in the head during the next break\nUp man [laughter] [laughter] that's not violent that's what I mean [laughter] that is just me\nOkay I'll only the minute I'll hit him in ... and then they'll stop thinking about it that\nWell we're going to set you on the Titanic to\nSee I'm telling you that arm all take me down the Titanic anytime\nYou're the only ... and I was covering all the bases you were just\nA it's a road Jack Jack in the movie yeah I uh I like tobacco road that reminds me when you played that song immediately thought back to back or road rules and that era of a music you know just so great telling stories today is just yelling holler\nBacker and that era of a music yeah just so great telling stories today is just yelling hollering and then some of the stuff I Can't even understand the word is like not even in the English uh\nI agree that mumble rap and starting to feel like my father and I'm like turn off that rap crap and I'm like oh my gosh when it turning into my mother and my mother\nWas a little too much rocket rye yeah I don't know if you've ever drank and ... a big chunk of a of a what do they call it's a big chunk of this rocks sugar\nYeah I Know talking about yeah yeah and you can say you know in a bar a ...\nA man that make you just and that'll give you a migraine at a pet\nWell I gotta run Henry 'cause I got to help build it out with his migraine it's OK we'll take it back to the knee during the next break\nWhile you keep it under four forty man and a dog get outta breath\nAll right sounds so that was bad and I saw it gets you never quite the favored by\nBy over ... billion you know I'm not going to hit you during the next break right it was a joke I feel like I Can't make jokes anymore I feel like where we live in a culture where if you make a joke it's game over\n\nI didn't care if it was a joke or not by my reaction is going to be I'd like to see you try\nA game on game on now it's got series a pick five five one Ninety nine thirty through because David on line one David how're you doing\nHow's it going very good how about yourself\nOn thank God never shown on TALK you know he talked right Jean something minute\nI'm told by using my hours long and his comment I was ...\nI was wondering why when he did his poverty freshman he sounded like he was having severe dysentery\nNow [laughter] [laughter] but now\nOnly on the migraine saying yeah those things are total mystery to me because of scientific proven fact that the human brain itself does not feel pain so how people can have migraines\nThe only thing I can narrow it down to it must be something to do with the nerves the ... yeah they are playing like nerve you know ... you know in your in the evenings I'm you're not or is it can't be solved in the brain itself because\nYou know it doesn't feel planes so I'd\nDylan's just making it up so that will fight during the next break it it it it's a mythical concept in his case I'm not saying that ... and his case it's a myth\nWell and I met the south's gonna know Eighteen minutes out of my brain [laughter]\n[laughter] we love it or we love in yeah\nI'm just just run the ball you know it's just one of the nobody everybody's just now getting on the road or a Kathleen I'm In a way to get my two cos morning coffee yup hey man I'm sure you
