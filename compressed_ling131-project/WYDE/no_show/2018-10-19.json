be interested in letting us rent that whatever for a event to have all the statewide candidates they're like a meet and greet type thing or when I walked in someone recognized me and asked the

yard signs a week I gave him one and then another gentleman entered the conversation and ... it was a back and forth didn't\nSeem any thing to be worried about the ... at the time I someone said something to my right and I was talking to that gal over there\nAnd the next thing I knew he he yelled out a political statement was something to the effect do you believe in people don't give a bleep about the middle class and he was a sucker punch me I didn't see a comment and I was sitting in a higher tolerance chair and I went flying back and once my head hit the ground that was all I remember\nOh my gosh that and I could tell you is a very big guy\nDid\nOr did he have returned it and um they did catch up with them two days later I'm found them he\nBasically told them that are the ... the deputy asked him whether or not I said or did anything to provoke him and his answer was no\n... the deputy asked him did you give them any warning prior that you were going to hit him his answer was no and then the deputy asked him do you know where you hit him and he said yeah right in the right knee I\nSuddenly the arrested for assault\nHad been arrested in New York charged and yet they're waiting for the uh to determine the level of the charge or waiting for the medical report\nAs well as the video surveillance\nAnd you're obviously going to testify against them\nYou've already given ...\nYeah they came out they took pictures of the the bruises on my body and um my eyes which was you know the way to my I was like had to I don't know was all red mhm and uh now now it's the concussion side I've learned that the sun is not my friend\nOh my goodness Shane would any down with the ... sorry go ahead ...\nAbout the biggest thing is that what you mean the there's the civility seems to be gone and and I mean I I didn't get the the the the sense that we weren't uh like minded going into it I guess are up until that point but\nAs soon as you know wail somebody in the head and send them flying is as I said before it's not something I was signing up for\nWell Shane a first of all the left is trying to intimidate good Americans like you've from running for office they're trying to frighten people scare them\nThat doesn't work physically attacked them out of a race physically prevent you from running\nAnd this is being encouraged by the Democrats at the highest levels\nEven those who claim over not for violence of course we're not for violence then where are they why are they supporting this caravan approaching the U.S border that is lawlessness complete and utter lawlessness they embrace lawlessness if the ends are in their minds justified noble\nSo that means are justified excuse me at the end is noble and the end is electing Democrats or you can bring more of a a ... social spending framework enforce that on the American people of all the goals of of of more of a democratic socialist approach to governance if those\nOr can enforce that on the American people of all the goals of of of more of a democratic socialist approach to governance if those are noble goals and you can\nGet there by any means necessary including a sucker punch of someone that gives them a concussion and messes up there by a and this is why conservatives Republicans of all backgrounds you must ensure that these people are prosecuted\nTo the fullest extent of the law I Would file a civil suit against him a and I would I Would I Would move on that stuff I Would sue him\nFor what he did and I hope you I Hope you do that you know anything about his background\nI really don't um I I I I've heard a few things since the I guess there's some he's in the trades of some sort that is what I've learned but beyond that I don't really know much about him ... are you familiar with apparently big guy to\nBe on that we have Democrats are in the state spoken out against this\nYou know I I actually know so like both of our senators are Democrats and neither one of them to my knowledge as of yesterday anyway had come out and publicly denounced it um [noise]\nI Will say that my Congressman Tom emmer he did call me as soon as you heard about it the first time they've ever called me but it and you know give me as a condolence has the support and all that I was you know but but\nOther than no none of none of our representation or higher up people have come out and said that to the to the last I looked at me way imagine if you were to be the ... the the thing that is the norm now it just you know go out and like you said getting their face kick them when they're down whatever the comments or I got tore up for using that exact lining up Facebook response\nOf calling out the comments from Hillary and Eric Holder and Maxine Waters and and if somebody actually starting a local publication as my understanding that how would how would their their comments have any influence in rural Minnesota I don't know if they don't think we don't have a radio and TV oh here it\nWas [laughter] yeah so Eric Holder if they go low we kick 'em Hillary Clinton if they go low we hit harder or whatever it is she sent a right\nYeah well and of course it doesn't affect I mean I don't know about this guy I don't know what his deal is but of course it has an effect and\nIt's meant to intimidate it is a type of political intimidation and its physical intimidation and up to the point of committing crimes\nBut again they they they attempt to dehumanize entire groups of people like if you're a conservative in Minnesota and you run for office and you and you call it that it is they have to call you a racist you they have to say that you're anti women\nAre and you might imagine what they would have done Shane if a a liberal female Muslim candidate for instance\nUh was brutalized or hit by someone else a woman as let's say so concerned about just give the gender that is a conservative woman hitter said you don't you're not you're not representing my interests you imagine\nAnd I wouldn't my first one ... I'd be the first one out there to condemn that physical absolutely tax\nWell I could say I certainly wouldn't wish this upon anybody I don't know and and and I you know I grew up my mom was extremely liberal my entire life my dad was a totally opposite very conservative they were thought about it in fact that they would tease each other you know let's go Catholic voters vote I mean\nI guess the the this doesn't need to be everybody's everything where if you don't agree with me I it's it's all out just throw it out and battles it's just it's it's a sad place when we become actually\nA shame how does your race look\nThrow it out and battles it's just it's it's a sad place when we become actually\nAh Shane how does your race look\nAh in theory I'm going to Seventy thirty district so conservative speaking so it's a it's a strong Republican district that with the unfortunate part as we do have an independent that sought the GOP endorsement and ran as an independent but\nBy that but the downside of this is a I ... the doctors have told me or you got to lay low you have no idea what this says I tried to tell them I only have three with the campaign left and I ... I went out and get a new banked on Tuesday I paid dearly for yesterday so weighing low is probably the more important thing right now\nWell you got to get surrogates out there for you you got to get friends in surrogates out they're few and events because you've got to win the seat you got to win this house seat\nI'm not just that's that's a must so you got to get friends out there to help you what's your website Shane\nShane back one dot com and neck limited spelled M E K e LAND\nShane ... dot com okay Shane I'm going to tweet that out\nOkay got five million people follow me on Twitter almost so I'm In a tweet that out\nOne day I\nI I Will say there there has been an unbelievable amount of support people have called me from all over the country they've texted me they emailed me a a lady called me yesterday because her daughter had a concussion and she was really she heard the story was so concerned\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] maybe\nThey don't\n[noise]\nMy family I mean I live in\nFront of an odd to children in the army [noise]\nFailing to make a lifetime\nLearning I'm\nW YDF I'm Coleman W.

under Obama are coming out of that you know horrible recession we've got all the stimulus son of stimulus all\nI'm just wondering like where where were these deficit hawks\nDuring the eight years of

was\nPolitically time they see the Democrats think this is a good issue for them I think they made a mistake horrendous mistake it's a terrible issue for them the Republicans must stand with the

talking about being up on a roofing roofing that's more of a young person's job but you know what I'm Talking about the idea that America has to import uh foreign workers to do every American job is lunacy\nI when I grew up we didn't need that probably didn't have that problem when I when I was growing up Americans did all sorts of jobs from picking a tobacco which my brother did to picking fruit which I did\nWho I mean all of us did all of this work in yeah if you have to pay more to get Americans to do these jobs good you should pay more and I told you when I was in Switzerland it was really interesting to talk to the Swiss about a Swiss jobs they don't do this big importation of laborers in Switzerland they don't do it\nThey didn't actually people who do everything from sweeping the streets to caring for children they get paid for doing that work eight five five forty or let's go to Evie in Florida heavy\n[noise]\n[noise] Hi Laura I again I think on on with this than an American state situation as far as the order but at the you know an American citizen here I I don't want to just think that this voting is going to help what more can we do\nWell the border the border has to be enforced the president's right if these other countries won't enforce their borders we need to put a we need to put some thought into how we're going to better do it here and he's got to ... and if it's a national emergency the president has extraordinary powers\nAnd drugs guns or criminal element of gangs we've already caught them trying to get into the country and we've already arrested people who are within the so called migrant population\nWho are only coming into the United states to hook up again contacts we brought you story after story about that\nAnd this president understands that they this president gets this like no one else\nHow many have you saw the frightening the frightening display last night on the ... it was called meet the chairman you remember that movie made the parents\nSo it was called meet the chairman and I went through chapter and verse what would happen to various committees and the house of representatives\nOr if Republicans lose control of the house and let me tell you something forget the new Jamie Lee Curtis rendition of Halloween the movie the most frightening thing you can imagine is what's\nGoing to happen to the financial services committee the house ways and Means Committee the Appropriations Committee the intel committee the energy committee\nIf the Democrats have their way eight five five forty Laura let's go to Eric in Michigan Eric go ahead\n[laughter] so I Believe that the easiest and quick solution to the border problem would be to open the home studying act to all of the federal I Am for rounding border and as you can make a structure dwelling a part of\nUh being able to get into the home studying act you could just as easily make it that they need to put up a barricade or something\nYou know part of being able to get into the homestead act\nYou could just as easily make it that they need to put up a barricade a fencing or whatever and with the ah that's already having a priority on any old studying act to open up your could wind up with a lot of our vets host study which would be helping the American and at the same time\nPut one hell of a wall dollar\nAh that another interesting idea well our our callers have more interesting ideas and most Republican or Democrat congressman Democrats just want an open border open borders open markets don't go away\n\nThe following is not an actor but a real life story from trinity debt management and\nI had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't pay me down I was feeling so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and contacted trinity\nOr other countries don't do this we we did this to ourselves\nBut now it's got to stop joining us\nNow Michael ... of course former Trump campaign advisor Republican political strategist he's involved in some of the key races\nIn New York he also has a great a podcast called still standing radio dot com to just go there are still standing radio dot com\nAnd you can listen to Michael who has a finger on the pulse of what's happening in this mid term cycle Michael it's great to talk to you I think the Democrats made a huge miscalculation and embracing these caravans of people who want to storm the border I think most people from all walks of life life across this country fine now this is all a bridge too far\nIt is and I got to tell you I saw that ... a prime time last night she Cortez as a warrior ... for the president he really is you know he he's a Latino and his president or his parents\nCame here legally and he indoors so much defending the president's policies including his immigration policies on CNN it's just amazing to me you know I appear on CNN often as well but I looked at as a model he I Know when I get off CNN after defending the president\nI get so many threats some of them death threats I'm certain ... gets the same kind of feedback from CNN viewers and yet he goes on every day swing and for the fences I'm so proud of him and you're right um but the Democrats signed up for this and I think they're going to pay for it\nI think that again people who work hard for a living try and take care of the kids just you know they don't have the money to send their kids to fancy private schools\nThey're just out in the country and they're working and they'd like to take a vacation every now and that and they see that the economy has improved so much on the president's leadership and then on the other side they see chaos\nIdentity politics constant cries of racism\nOr embracing the illegality and and now open borders which is you know it's been the case for some time but now it's literally they want to open borders its it's beyond clear\nAnd I think it I think this blows up in the Democrats faces morning noon and night if the Republicans do the right thing here and hold on to this issue and actually pass legislation to stop this this is an emergency what's happening to this country\nTo learn the now with ... income and toward the border and I think the president\nIs standing tall you know I I've been in politics since the Reagan Era and do you have to we first met in Washington\nBack during the Reagan years and you know I worked for Jack Kemp and it was people like Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan stood up for this country\nAnd and had backbone and unfortunately over the years we really haven't had a president\nLike Donald Trump and have backbone and would never have stood up to these caravans coming up against the border would never have stood up for justice Brett Kavanaugh and you saw what happened when the president just said simply nope I'm not looking at another another nominee you're going to have to approve\nAnd confirmed Brett Kavanaugh we saw spines grow and senators we didn't even think Adam anymore and Lindsey Graham was the hero of German Grassley a hero Susan Collins a hero in all emanates\nFrom the strength in the White House and the immigration issue you know he has not backed down you remember when he came down the stairway in Trump Tower and then his\nFrom the strength in the White House and the immigration issue you know he has not backed down you remember when he came down that stairway in Trump Tower and then his speech which shocked everyone he promised starts the word and they tried to conflate like you mentioned\nUh illegal immigration with immigration and they've tried to do that\nOver and over and over again and they're still doing it today but it's not working because the average man and woman working every day in America you know taking their lunch bucket to work\nYou know dropping their kids off at school they understand the difference between somebody who jumped the border fence and somebody who comes here and stand in line and does it legally\nAh you're listening to your health the radio addiction eight five five forty Laura every poll that's been done the last few years on immigration has chosen that most people want legal immigration\nEither to remain the same and that's a million people a year it's a lot or or to be decrease so it was like thirty seven percent want it to remain a saying that the Gallup poll from June\n... thirty seven percent want the level to remain the same I'm Talking legal immigration twenty\nNine percent want it decreased okay twenty eight percent wanted increased now that's legal immigration\nAnd that those are the convenience factor the inconvenient fact that people like Chris ... they don't want to deal with because when you live in a you know a doorman building in New York you don't have to worry about illegal immigration doesn't affecting your life your kids go to the best schools your kids or you know probably driven to work\nOr in a given a school excuse me but you don't have to deal with illegal immigration and you don't have to call in with a a legal immigrant for for a job and find that wait a second they're doing the IT work I used to do for thirty percent\nLess so ... you know people don't want that\nYou're right I live out in western New York where it's a it's very blue collar area and ah in recent year a year or so we've seen\nYou know truckloads of illegal or legal immigrants arrested or the seven eleven on their way back from a construction site where the or were they were working we've seen a chain of Mexican restaurants\nIn and uh and west in Buffalo or wherever they pulled out of a whole load of workers where the owner of the restaurant was housing them and paying them cash on he just got a found guilty the other day of this kind of crack down needs to continue because I'll tell ya in western New York\nAnd buffalo where we used to be a strong steelworkers town were not anymore we're we're starting to come back under the leadership of president Donald Trump\nBut men and women here need these jobs need these jobs and and they they know who's taken the job they know what illegal immigration is all about and the Democrats in the mainstream media spend their time trying to gas light them on this issue\nTalking about how important\nA ... immigration is to the United states when they're really the issue that they're they're they're complaining is illegal immigration for president isn't against immigration is against illegal immigration\nAnd I think the American people see through you know my wife is an immigrant we went through the whole citizenship process is the first the immigration process and then the citizenship process it's difficult it takes time and if it got to hire a lawyer it's expensive but my wife will tell you it's really worth it\nYou know and the problem she sees is it the surrounded by people were all surrounded by people\nAre here illegally some of them are now over ... etc it's an it's an\nSees as if she surrounded by people were all surrounded by people\nWho are here illegally some of them are now ... says etcetera\nAnd since it's infuriating [noise] and again I say this repeatedly\nYou ... if you can't even blame you can't blame the people who are trying to get here because they've been given a green light probably from their own governments and in one way shape or form\nA and they've been told you can come and stay so people who are just want to come here and work I don't even blame them but they it can't happen because because well without a border you're not a country Reagan said that he was completely\nRight a border exist to help you maintain your sovereignty and to protect your own people an orderly process of immigration is what we need but look the chaos at the at the border\nIs is not dissimilar a Michael to the chaos that we've seen in the streets and the ... and the aftermath of having a a and the Democrats prefer that because if this chaos you need more government\nGovernment grows government gets bigger and the Democrats are never happier than when the government is growing and growing and growing that's what they want\nIt's true and if your listeners white what they saw during the month long confirmation process of justice Brett Kavanaugh the screaming in the hearings the the uh the people running down the uh the always the basement of the United states Capitol screaming at senators\nThe the people trapping senators in an elevator illegally and screaming at them for the cameras\nThe mobs of people outside the capital and after he was confirmed that people trying to literally rats with their fingernails through the metal doors of the United States Supreme court building\nIf they liked that they're going to love twenty Nineteen if the Democrats take over the house of representatives and you know or if the election were held today we would lose the house the Republicans would lose the house because\nA lot of people who were not measure well by the polls and twenty sixteen they\nCall us deplorable right that people who hadn't voted in recent elections because of their frustration with issues like illegal immigration thinking that their vote didn't matter at all they found a champion and Donald Trump someone they fought a non politician could make change for them\nAnd you know in in a midterm election\nThose kinds of folks to tend to think well I got my guy and\nI'm going to go ahead and sit this one out and they don't take their lunch break to go vote they don't drop their kid off early at school so they can go vote on the way to work or they don't you know a skip the ... the birthday party after work to go vote on it and and that this time around they better do it because\nThey think the part of the

but I'm telling you something Marty is the person you all have to get out and vote for in Pennsylvania seven he joins us now and also\nIs an avid cyclist was in the two thousand uh Olympics is attract cyclists does a lot of ah incredible stuff for his community and it's going to support the president's agenda on the economy immigration\nTrade all the rest of Marty it's great to have you on tell us what you're finding out there what issues to the people care about most as you're approaching this all important midterm fight\nLower first of all thanks for having me\nYeah you know covering every corner this district which is now a new district Pennsylvania seventh district or it has everything from the urban core of Allentown Beth I'm an east into the cause of farming communities in the northern tier work district what we call this late dealt\nA region ... what we're seeing and what I'm hearing is that people are happy people are happy with this economy they're happy with what our president's been able to accomplish\nWe're seeing there's a lot of jobs out there people are making more money and we have a you know as a rather nice buzzing economy right here in this district and people want to see that continue they don't want to see this come to to a screeching halt so I think right now\nA lot of voters are getting very very much engaged and they realize what is at stake if they flip the house on a ... in in Congress\n[noise] what what uh when when you see the redistricting that well obviously a it is is being done in many cases to add a urban voters to what is traditionally a blue collar or a more conservative district\nIt makes the Republicans jobs in in in a way more difficult to are trying to run for Congress for the first time or run for reelection\nBut on the issue of for instance immigration when we see a thousands of people now are being funded clearly to rush up to the border or even in rural districts where you know they do need some agricultural workers and so forth\nPeople don't like the chaos and lawlessness are you finding that as well given the news on this new crush at the border\nYeah I think that's really on a lot of people's minds is just the radical a resistance we're seeing from the less\nA rash of people to the border again we we we we read this chapter before we've seen it happen um most people I'm Talking to him to the majority of the people I'm Talking to understand that securing our borders a first step towards a workable immigration platform\nUh we need to secure our southern border and there's no question about that and everyone I've been talking to was in support of that I'm so immigration up here in ... valley in seventh district although we're not a border state uh it is something that's it's a on people's minds\nA and Marty's Susan Wild is they they ... they hope that she's part of the what they are going to call the year the woman\nOr because the me too movement the woman's march and so forth so\nThey they ... they hope that she's part of the what they are going to call the year the woman or because of the me too movement the women's march and so forth are so ... what would\nThey tried to pass or off as a moderate a Democrat in in your district\nWell that's what they're trying to do but that's not who she is a she ran in her primary or somebody on the ... are left now she's trying to move to the center but a her\nResults speak for themselves or you know she she's she's for radicalism she's from a welfare she's for no borders and sanctuary cities she's for bankruptcy and bureaucracy\nYou know for teaching the president in teaching Kavanaugh but she won't say that in any commercial she wants to say that any public forums but at the end of the day that's where she ran on in the primary and I'm sure that's what she's going to govern as if she's elected which we cannot let happen\nMarty when I see the uh the amazing economic growth has been made possible by this president's focused uniquely on the American\nWorker the American people it's hard to imagine that people would want to halt that or go backward\nI I've been watching some of your a campaign commercials in advance on line\nAnd the people in your district they're smart people they want to go forward they don't want to go back they don't they want they want happiness\nAnd calm they don't want chaos in the streets and people were in black masks and smashing car windows and in a in raising the flags of other countries in America they want America to be a a safe prosperous nation where security\nIs paramount in our our virtuous freedom a is always you know upheld and raised high and I think it's jobs not mobs we want jobs we don't want mobs I think it's as simple as that\nI think it's as simple as that and you're right a lot of voters in my district agree with you a hundred percent now the other side it's got a small little motivated base of folks we've seen that the results we've seen in the primaries they're very vocal uh you're right they show up and mobs uh we uh we announced a campaign uh our our\nBrand opening of arcane campaign headquarters the night before they threw rocks to our windows uh you know so this is the type of stuff we're seeing even locally here in the seventh district which\nIn my opinion I was born and raised here my family's been here five generations I've always called at home I never saw it like this before in my life I'm relatively young man I'm forty seven years old but what you're seeing right now the resistance from the other side is is is it's it's really quite alarming\nAnd funded funded Marty by socialist billionaires who don't like the fact that America standing strong for national national economic growth and so forth Marty no stain or might Marty Nothstein I Can't wait to see you in Congress\nThe following is not an actor that are real life story from trinity dead management\nMy story began with that and a lot of debt credit card debt and I heard a commercial for trinity I gave them a call\nIt's already happening federal services to illegal immigrants soaring across the United states\nBecause of corrupt judges court cases creating writes in the constitution and creating rights to this er rights that birthright citizenship\nAll of it it's a it has fundamentally already transformed entire states in the country or the commonwealth of Virginia this was a conservative blue collar military a lot of veterans and now if if\nI were Comstock loses in Fairfax County Virginia and she's behind them is a congressional race reelection\nIf she loses I saw some on TV say I guess it was Charlie hurt yesterday on the Fox special report panel it'll be the last time we ever have a Republican Congress person in this Fairfax County district which is right\nNear DC so this is now been transformed because of immigration illegal and otherwise and liberal policies\nFollow always liberal policies always follow wear\nA mask crush of illegal immigration has moved into a community that's why the ah African Americans and Latinos in poll after poll will tell us that\nImmigration has adversely affected their communities\nBecause it has I'll give you that a stat and just a moment a doctor my Christian is with us or he is the director of the global faith Institute former Muslim Sunni who converted from Islam to Christianity and he's been following the media and their use of manipulation\nSome Sunni who converted from Islam to Christianity\nAnd he's been following the media and their use the manipulation of this story from turkey wearing a Saturday counseling a Saudi journalist or who wrote for the Washington Post or is or was murdered and apparently it's not Donald Trump's falls\nDr Christian good to have you with us or what how do we need to look at this story mid term voters I don't think they're focused on this this is not something that they're you know it just affects their daily lives but the media are using this story to do what\nCigarettes for having me editor for the ship the local community and and you were right when you have a party that is run by by them and uh uh you know all of those old ah guards it's it looks like they are often from inside when I I I think actually this um\nYou know story about a ... a reporter and everything else is going to have an impact on\nThe election if we are not going to get the truth out and and the reason of that has this when you know many people actually don't understand you know that she shouldn't between the states and Saudi Arabia\nAnd try to point out that the Trump is a you know he's a cozy to um you know the Saudis and that the cubs and and also to dictators and so forth which is far from through if you listen to Trump in his last quarter on his before this incident broke out\nEmbarrassed at the Saudi Government publicly at least four times and that was a huge big a media thing going on in the whole Middle East\nSo uh when we look at this incident I think people need to understand that Trump is not\nI'm backing up the Saudis because he loves loves the dictates of his old for personal gain because this is nonsense he's doing this because the Saudi Government the current government is doing a good work that helps them not states and he's in America first\nUn American interest a president which is different from bite and then Obama and all of those previous president with a lot states and why I'm saying that because you and you look at what the current um come prince and the south the government is doing\nTheir head think in many fronts the number one is\nThe author hunting by defending the Islamic movement by looking in house arrest more than five hundred moms in Saudi Arabia and all\nThe fighting the Muslim Brotherhood in the country and even in other countries they are helping the states um when they are fighting Iran and its aggression in the middle east there hunting big time they get on the Iranian sanctions are and how Trump is putting those on\nBy living oil prices in an all the stuff also the current administration will kind of leadership in um a Saudi Arabia is hurting usher in a peace treaty\nThat never ever be imagined before and Donald Trump is about announced that are very very soon what is going to be involved in Saudi Arabia and and but it's an Egypt and Israel which is gonna be eliminating the danger of this conflict has been going on for seven years so Donald Trump is supporting um you know the government\nA leadership in Saudi Arabia because of those reasons and those reasons unknown and all of those\nHead for the United states not that dictatorship and so forth plus adding to all of this we believe in this country that everybody's innocent until until proven otherwise so when we are dealing with this issue as when we have to\nFollow the due process to go to the investigation and find out what's going on you know I I tend to believe that I Am American inside out since I'm a great in the states but still ... over there in my in my home brew which you know nothing happened\nLeave that I Am American inside out since I'm a great in the states but stimulate which is all part of that and my ... in my home rule which\nYou know nothing happens by coincidence when uh the president of turkey is very much over the place about this you have to understand that this happened at the same time after the Trump Administration embarrass him publicly and the whole Muslim world by arresting a the the\nThe faster and the release of the pasture happened right here at the same time all of this incident going taking place excellent point\nWell I think again mark America\nIn ... and the American voters\nIf they're given the proper information and not the talking points to the left the which again it's it's ... it's so sad and it's so predictable they always go to racism they always go to a phobia\nThey this is all they have it's it's women are oppressed in the United states or every minority group is a pressing the United states the president loves autocrats the president ...\nI mean it's so predictable that it's almost boring to talk about\nBut meanwhile the Democrats are giving the big thumbs up to thousands of people\nWho are about to cross into America unless we do something about this thousands and thousands of people many of them this is an adult men or young military age men who are have joined this caravan and are being supported by someone or some organization\nTo storm into this country to try to change this country electorally\nThat is the goal here the goal is to replace the American voters who elected Donald Trump with a new class of voters who have no background or understanding of the American story that's what's happening and it's outrageous and Americans have to stand against its total lawlessness\nA die hard and what are your what are your thoughts on the immigration issue I think the Democrats have made a big mistake thinking this is going to help them in the midterms\nWhen the Democrats and the left and the media that supports the left is a crazy and they have gotten ideas which is why they always go to this year's men and all the kinds of ideas that they talk about that means absolutely nothing\nBut when I pay attention to the media and what's going on number one is in the last two days they start talking about how the Hispanic votes are not going for the Democrats but goes for Donald Trump\nAnd an historic on weight and then right after that they start talking about the curve and marching to the old that of the United states and what they are trying to do is to try to do wired and to try to uh make the Hispanic\nVotes jump into the vote a boost and try to vote for them so this is a very well organized a by the media and I have no idea how they do it\nBut I have no doubt that everything is it the night you pay attention to the states you talk about it for three days how the Hispanic is voting for Trump in a historical way and then all of a sudden\nWe have an a you know a problem on the on the border and then we have to figure this out and do not Trump's days we're not going to let that happen and I think Hispanic votes water in Americans\nCan see through this because I trusted that when you come to this nation and you believe in that and we understand that they'll give you that you have you're not going to receive the by the uh the bidding filthy or works of the left and what they are trying to do every day or two American the American fabric\nA mark Christian

for the better betterment of the American uh people sometimes we have to do that and don't keep your eye and the ball people because what marks that is exactly right this is calculated\nAnd and it's
