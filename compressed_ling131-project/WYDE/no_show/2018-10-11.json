on last night about what is consensual and not consensual on college campuses as far as a sexual contact and what's happened with the title mine that Obama rewrote\nReally interesting story at UC Davis a well we'll get into that we don't have time to do it now or the Chuck Grassley is going to be joining us coming up how he won the Kavanaugh battle and what's in store next don't go\n\n\nThe following is not a doctor but a real life story from trinity debt management\nMy story begins with debt and a lot of debt credit card debt and I heard a commercial for trinity I gave them a call\nWhen we protests yet we're shouting out we have signed we're saying what we think we'll get to the public and we are not saying we're going to tell anybody we gonna hit anybody oh we're going to cause anybody harm that's a lot in the way that they're trying to redefine protest\nIs is that correct I mean what are your thoughts on that\n[noise] well my thoughts are this that public officials and and I I'm not a perfect public official but I think we all ought to set an example of civility and so for a center say get in their face\nFor congresswoman like her to say getting your face and then what happens is uh the president's press secretaries and Senator Cruz or pushed out of restaurants\nThat are surely that is encouraged by what are these congresswoman and senators are saying and it's wrong a I Believe in a freedom of association freedom of speech freedom to demonstrate\nBut it ought to be peaceful and you shouldn't do anything that's going to encourage violence because even if or a congresswoman doesn't intend violence\nThere's some people that are going to take it one step further than she intended and she needed to back off about ... steps and a and not surely not be in your face\nTake it one step further than she intended and she needed to back off about ... steps and a and not surely not be in your face if you're going to have a democratic and representative government function properly\nUh I got to be a ... you know a few feet away we got to have a a discussion a dialogue I got to have respect for people that disagree with me and she ought to respect for people that disagree with our\nBut in your face is in a way to do\nWell she said a year ago that she was going to take Donald Trump out\nA and what does that mean I mean she's at this I'm lesbian or gay algae Beatty dinner and she goes in and take him out that she wasn't saying take 'em out for dinner and she's like take him out and\nTelling people that get harassed in restaurants and it seems like that that message really has terminated the permanent protest\nA mentality in the Democratic party senator and and my concern is that someone's going to end up getting hurt we already had Steve ... shot you would have thought that the that the Democrats would have calmed everyone down after that\nUh but when you have Susan Collins been cornered in an elevator\nIt's one thing when Jeff Flake is cornered an elevator but then you have poor old Susan Collins people being screened data centimeter from their face while they're trying to walk down a hallway I mean what can be done about this\nWell ah obviously for those of us that are in public office and in\nIn public places and we're confronted with that and they're doing it under what they think is First Amendment rights the only thing you can count on it as a police protection we have\nBut then you can't have police protection for four or five hundred and thirty five members of Congress every place they are spread throughout the United states even relying upon local police\nOr you can't do that as well so are are are I've come to the conclusion and this repetitive of\nWhatever kind of already said to you but are\nA democracy will be a stronger a whiz respectful political discourse as opposed to what is happening or when you hold on quote get in their face\nWell but what senator what responsibility does something like a Dianne Feinstein or Cory Booker or Kamala Harris have to to speak against this type of\nHarassment and intimidation this isn't just carrying assigning and chanting some things this is cornering women in elevators this this is something and we have\nWe have people threatening to kill Kavanaugh teachers in Minnesota I mean people are taking this all the hard if you if you say someone's like a combination of not seeing a sexual predator enough times\nSome whack a noodle is going to you know take take matters into his or her own hands got help it so what responsibility does the Democrat leadership have here\nUh I don't think they're going to exercise it but they gotta they gotta responsibilities Reno ...\nNo I Would I Would I'm waiting for that ah I'm waiting for that undergrad there\nGo ahead no wait a long time I think\nSenator Grassley are the lessons learned from this Kavanaugh saga of many of us thought that in the beginning when we had to put up the hearing and and kick it off from the Thursday vote initially kick it off to Monday and then it got delayed because of the Ford allegations any thoughts\nTo solidifying the rules so you can't extend hearings pass the the close of the original hearing date so these kind of anonymous allegations\nSo I too solidifying the rules so you can't extend hearings past the close of the original hearing date so these kind of anonymous allegations can't drop and make a difference again\nWell I've read your tweets when you took me to tears called me for for not calling for a whole but but you can't you can't you can't use\nIf I call the vote today you on that we went along we we weren't all yeah tend to tend to rely on and so you got to have some respect for people that are on the job here are doing it\nAnd so we we waited until we had the votes\nNow now I corrected myself after that I didn't delete the tweet because I set it on but I corrected myself and then you and you and McConnell both\nHindered handled this master fleet in the face of incredibly difficult and I think ...\nI'm a highly emotional highly charged atmosphere\nAnd when people say that Dr Ford was disrespected which is a guest on my show said last night she was disrespect and I said oh my gosh Senator Grassley said what if you need something repeated or you know if you are you okay do you need anything I mean you couldn't have been more solicited of Dr Ford I I Can't imagine how you could have been frankly\nYeah well it reminds me of how I was confronted by Iowans because uh in the Thomas hearings because I was so mean to Anita Hill and I never ask a single question but I was sitting beside specter that did are questioning and everybody thought I was factor [laughter]\n\nOh my goodness I'm Senator Grassley a there was another moment that\nI have to get you to react to um this is Heidi Heitkamp of course Democrat in North Dakota undecided divide vote against having a a lot of people have talked about whether the\nCourt remains legitimate you heard Hillary say that it's a shame that things happen as they happen because the court always was respected and this is what senator high camp then\nYou're obviously in the midst of a very tough reelection fight and I know you you feel voting the way you did was the right way do you worry are you concerned that it may have cost you your sentences\nAt the end of the day still have to look at yourself in the mirror and think about\nWhat your future holds compromise something like this based on politics and I I Believe the yes vote would have compromised um my true belief that um this person did not have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court they're still repeating\nThat the temperament issues Senator Grassley\nHe listened this gets back to what I already told you you got twelve successful years on the DC circuit the second most important\nA court in the land he's been college all or even people like Garland a said that he had that sort of\nA approach to judging and that means judicial temperament and not only are you have a personality\nThat is a temperate you also leave your personal views out of out of a decision making you look at the law and look at the uh uh get facts of the case and just to use those two things to go by\nSo consequently uh ... what what she said Sandra Hi Kim said plus your question brings me to a history of Thomas\nOr is it going to hurt the Supreme Court I listen to the same thing twenty eight years ago and then I look at twenty eight years record of Thomas on the court and I've never seen any retribution on his part towards anything that was\nHere's record of Thomas on the court and I've never seen any retribution on his part towards anything that was set against him at that time and he was mad when he said he was going through our high tech\nHigh ... or something like ...\nYeah so so uh you know after twenty eight years of listening to the same thing about Thomas not seeing it I think that I got great confidence that Kavanaugh's going to bring great prestige and knowledge\nAnd academic background and more importantly his work on the second highest court\n... court and it's all positive\nNo it it's it's one of the most qualified people period of time to sit on the court a Senator Grassley the uh the Susan Collins hum situation in main course all these leftist billionaires promising to flood\nOr the her opponent whoever that ends up being a with lots of money you want to raise three million dollars for Susan Collins and I know Mitch McConnell has said the

chugging down the tracks but you got to turn out and vote in the midterms are you got to turn out and vote my friends you cannot be complacent because the left is banking on your complacency how have you have already voted early voting is starting already how many of you've already voted our plan to vote early I don't like like voting on election\nI don't like early voting is is is is designed to help the left because they're more lazy and they don't want to go to the poll well but but think about this if tomorrow something today something ruined his happens where I don't know uh your candidate opens fire into a crowd or at a baseball game\nYou have no way of turning your vote that you can't reclaim your vote I think you vote up until the election that you vote on election day so you have all the data not this early but I Know people who they vote the a month before the election two months it's ridiculous\nYou know I uh\nI think the early voting is a little much I mean it's just against like motor voter all that motor voter early vote I Know the next to vote on the Internet oh there's no fraud possibility there not at all it's not going to be any gaming of the system was that\nI was upset to learn motor voter wasn't drive through I thought it was dry I dropped out and\nSee I'd like that because then I could get my drive through ... and my vote done at the same time maybe at the same play it is and that would be very that that's an attractive possibility to the doctor\nHas to be seals when you get the drive through ... well no it has to put a top on it and they

coming up congressman Jim Jordan I bet he wants to document redacted are too don't you think so go ahead\n\n\nYou guys have heard me talk about a product for months that has changed my sleeping habits for ever it's called my pillow\n... um I mean I I'm like you I Love Senator Grassley a and you know he's been tough on this whole Russian if of course the ... but that was funny [laughter] [laughter]\nIt keeps it at one death ... what's the ... which I like when he was upset it's like one level it was like\nHey [laughter]\nI Love 'em he did a fantastic job and I thought I mean ... what about you know I I've always really liked it All right congressman what is going on now we had you had a Trump flying with all Rosenstein\nOr the other day down down where the heck with a sign of Florida yeah and I saw rod at the White House at the cabinet thing and I said well yeah wrinkles and pick the dust on the president what'd you do you think some of your best friends what what what's the theory there congressman\nUh I I don't know but I still know the facts are facts and then you have to give it McCain memos that we subpoenaed there are all these stories out a earlier this week that talk about how serious they took the alleged comments Mr Rosenstein made about actually recording the president in the oval office wearing a wire\nOr tape recording in whatever they are a phone recording whatever they want to do\nUm and there's the fact that it now looks like Mr Rogers by not going to show up tomorrow so we don't do that for sure but we're starting to hear rumors that he's not coming to talk to Congress like he was supposed to uh tomorrow or in a in the Judiciary Committee so\nI think that because he has a good relationship with the president now he doesn't have to\n... well maybe maybe or maybe it has something to do with the stories that were written that said you know what you said this to a uh is that the stories that said he said there's been a tape and this page and then when I talk to Mr Baker so um what will uh will\nHopefully he'll hopefully he'll take change his mind that will be there tomorrow so we could asking the questions that I think American people deserve to have the answers to\nCongressman joined explain James Baker the or the man who is the attorney at the FBI and why his involvement in all of this and his contacts are so important to the narrative of how this whole Russian investigation was started\n'cause he's the chief counsel when you're the chief counsel the FBI and you're the guy in the middle of the two biggest investigations run by all these key players struck page McCabe call me a\nThat is important and when it's now now being recorded that uh he was he taught to both McCain and paid shortly after this meeting took place with Mr Rosenstein ... and that he understood it to be a serious comment made in that meeting that's why we need to talk to Mr Rosenstein and never forget the fundamental facts\nWhen have you ever seen this happen at any federal agency James Comey fire director former direct FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe light three times under oath fire Jim Baker chief counsel first demoted then left the FBI we used to page FBI council demoted then left and of course Peter ...\nThe counter intelligence demoted then fired top people the FBI demoted or fired all the people who ran the Clinton investigation and then now as we know launched and ran the Russia investigation until Mr Rosenstein named Mr ... to take that investigates\nAnd the other night when people were fired up to that alternate hotel and a ... good as it was being attacked by the left I think a lotta people are beginning to see that the left is going completely crazy we did a tweet the other day I had more people come out and we said today's left a plot Kaepernick destroy capital\nAnd that's today's left ... they they embraced of radical you know ... when he respects the flag embrace Cuomo when he says\nAmerica was never that great cheer on Maxine Waters when she says go out and harassed people who support the president or an old by the way will destroy capital to prosecute I mean that's today's left and I think it is beginning to fire up conservative voters are Republican voters I Hope it is staying over the next twenty six days and that we can keep the majority now\nDo you look over your shoulder more now with ah with what's happening out there\n[noise] yeah I mean I think you have to uh none of us are just as you are but like ... ... where we're at a back in June literally two days after Maxine Waters did her first rant and we got what I what I called the treatment from a lady were\nOut and she started wearing a line of people get moving into the theater and um she just started\nYou know yelling shame and evil and Jim Jordan terrible all this stuff so I mean it's ridiculous we we would never do that the people who were on the left but they seem to want to do that all the time now so you do kinda just watch a little bit or\nYou know um look I Wish they wouldn't do that I don't think it's appropriate but despite about and argue about the idea is let's not let's not make it personal let's not run people at restaurants and do all the things that they're\nThat they're going to do that they found to do it and say yeah it's it's what they have now they're holding onto the anger by the way there was an interesting thing that you forgot to ask you earlier congressman\nAndy McCarthy the former um to send U.S attorneys southern district of New York he made this point on my show last night about Rosenstein and why the president may not end up are removing him as deputy AG let's listen\nI think president realizes that if he were to get rid of\nA Rosenstein at this point it would be like firing Comey times three and it would give more reason to extend the investigation why would he want to do that I mean it looks like now\nThere's not going to be any charges they're stepping down they've transition to a lot of these cases that they brought to other components of the Justice Department this is about over\nWhat do you think about that yeah I mean I I it seems like things are pretty quiet some they must be writing the report Korea\nYeah I I Hope so and I think that that's probably a ... that can be right and I obviously respect the Mitch McCarthy I'm In all the things he's written about always done so I look at all is going to be any changes made the Justice Department till after the election until after ... I think that that's obvious it's obvious that\nI'm the president wants that a new attorney general and um I think that that will happen at some point too but I don't think that's going to happen until after the election it until after the special counsel's at work is finished\nA Jim Jordan always great to talk to you congressman buried scent of Ohio congressman thanks so much will take a break close out this hour a lot more to get to Michael Savage is also going to join us stay there the Laura Ingraham show [noise]\nI suffered my fifth concussion did you know that over a million athletes suffer concussion each year that includes boys and girls every age\nEvery time the level of sport\nIt isn't always clear that a player has had a concussion so parents athletes and coaches need to learn about concussion signs and symptoms the American Academy of neurology recommends athletes thought to have a concussion be immediately removed from place\nAnd not returning to assess buy health care professional trained in concussion this isn't just about sports [noise] about your brain when in doubt sit it out [noise] learn more an A.

blew a third mhm the only person got closer was Alexis who said the ... ... or did it was later but I I had a dream that it was a girl after having thought it was a boy the whole time and I don't know that was why would I Dream that it was weird so I told her and she said you did you had a dream I said well Raymond ...

Minnesota non binary gender identification on driver's license approved by state okay and that was uh when was that just last week right last week\nAnd and so ... this is a there is a trend here now these are grown ups in the case of Minnesota on their driver's license saying I Am now identify as whatever okay\nYou're an adult you can identify as whatever you'd like\nBut a baby at birth should they be allowed to the parents have the option of redefining the sex of the child on the birth certificate okay Brent Pennsylvania you wanted to say what\nPrint yes I kept\nA threat to their co Hi this is what does bring you I'm from New York pay what the uh gender identification I Want to know if I can identify as a rose Bush because I Am pretty do I still have to pay taxes\n[laughter] I that I don't know but uh ... be careful with that they might clip you\nKnow take your ... your print for the call 'em let's go to Bob Bob or you're in Minnesota right\nYes\nNow your state just passed this law where people can define whatever sex they'd like on their driver's license so you're ... you're really in the middle of this experiment\nWell I I think the whole thing is is the the socialist the Democrats are are following Solomon's he's eight roast radicalism and they were trying to remove God from the ...\n... and we'd like this country was built on God's press falls a male female husband wife we let it happen and we wonder why this country has gone in the ...\nYeah well I've looked at certainly in the Bible and in in classic Christian believe a ... ... it is it is held that God created the male or female but let's put that aside for a moment\nThere is something called objective fact\nNature itself that corresponds with this idea so the notion that this is some invented gender hierarchy\nInvented anything it's a fact of life like there's a tree and their eggs and there are sperm and they're all you know these are these are objective facts built into nature that religion and man have acknowledged and embraced\nBut when you when you try to redefine the thing at its origin that is concerning my problem is people are looking away from reality from science from the ... the the sex of the child itself and I'm not so sure we should give parents the right\nTo shift or bend the sex of their child or or not to find that at all on a birth certificate I think for the purposes of the state that's a bad idea that has many many uh uh ramifications\nThanks for the call 'em let's go to Kay in Iowa you wanted to say what can\nI think you've just said part of that what I Believe this is is the spirit of deception [laughter] yeah I think it's spiritual deception and confusion because it just is the last man said he got out of everything so now it without the gender identity with all this\nSection and confusion because it just is the last man said kicked got out of everything so now it without the gender identity with all of a stab at least in the book of genesis you're right he made them male and female\nSo now let's try to change what God did so that's all part of another idol it's it's something that is against what God created and that's why we have this it's deception and confusion if the spirit behind it just like everything else that's going on in our country people just becoming hysterical and radical\nScreening I heard ... the other day it sounded\nLike an insane asylum the\nSame hollering that you would hear that would come out of an asylum we were in a bad place right now and I'm only God can help us\nOut of this and that's what they want to kick away from us\nWe have to be fighting for it\nThank you get a this story just two days ago published\nA Utah on men a well a person in Utah becomes one of the first in the state to recede non binary ex markers on birth certificate and driver's license now did this person we're going to look at the story but I think what they did was go back and\nA re classified themselves in the birth in the birth certificate right retroactively so they went back and you know again defied themselves ... was a female but it's now identify as acts your thoughts on this\nEnd where this could lead we're going to take a quick break eight five five forty ... we'll be right back Laura Ingraham show\nAnd I think I think again [noise]\n[noise] it made me sell\nSomething and they don't hang on\nHang on right now [noise]\nFamily got me how I learned how to live in the\nYou can find it odd children in the army\nOr leaning to make a lifetime\nNow on the dot\nW.

heard a commercial for trinity I gave them a call\nOf senators and sort of getting rate in someone's face as a means of protest and she said this\nWhen we protests yet we're shouting out we have signed we're saying what we think we'll get to the public and we are not saying we got to tell anybody we gonna hit anybody oh we're going to cause anybody in a home that's a lot in the way that they're trying to redefine protest\nIs is that correct I mean what your thoughts on the [noise]\nWell my thoughts are this that public officials and and I I'm not a perfect public official\nBut I think we all ought to set an example of civility and so for US Senator say get in their face for congresswoman like her to say get in your face\nAnd then what happens is uh the president's press secretaries and Senator Cruz or pushed out of restaurants\nThat are surely that is encouraged by what are these congresswoman and senators are saying and it's wrong or I Believe in a freedom of association freedom of speech\nFreedom to demonstrate but it ought to be peaceful and you shouldn't do anything that's going to encourage violence because even if or a congresswoman doesn't intend violence\nThere's some people that are going to take it one step further than she intended and she needed to back off about ... steps and a and not\nSurely not be in your face if you're going to have a democratic representative government function properly\nOr I got to be a ... or ... you know a few feet away we got to have a a discussion a dialogue I got to have respect for people that disagree with me and she ought to respect for people that disagree with our\nBut in your face is in a way to do it\nWell she said a year ago that she was going to take Donald Trump out and what does that mean let me see that this I'm lesbian or gay algae Beatty dinner and she goes in and take him out that she wasn't saying take 'em out for dinner and she's like take him out and\nTelling people that are getting harassed in restaurants and it seems like that that message really has terminated\nThe permanent protest a mentality in the Democratic party senator and my concern is that someone's going to end up getting hurt we already had Steve's at least get shot you would have thought that the that the Democrats would have calmed everyone down after that\nUm but when you I'm Susan Collins been cornered in an elevator\nIt's one thing when Jeff Flake is cornered an elevator but then you have portals Susan Collins and people being screamed at a centimeter from their face while they're trying to walk down a hallway I mean what can be done about this\nWell ah obviously for those of us that are in public office and in\nIn public places and we're confronted with that and they're doing it under what they think is the first Amendment rights the only thing you can count on his police protection and we have\nBut then you can't have police protection for four five hundred and thirty five members of Congress or every place they are spread throughout the United states even relying upon local police\nOr you can't do that as well so are\nBut you say are spread throughout the United states even relying upon local police or you can't do that as well so are are are I've come to the conclusion and this repetitive of whatever kind of already said to you but are\nA democracy will be stronger a whiz respectful political discourse as opposed to what is happening or when you a quote unquote get in their face\nWell what what senator what responsibility does something like a Dianne Feinstein or Cory Booker or Kamala Harris have to to speak against this type of harassment and intimidation this isn't just carrying assigning and chanting some things this is\nCornering women in elevators this this is something and we have we have people threatening to kill Kavanaugh teachers in Minnesota I mean people are taking this all the hard if you if you say someone's like a combination of not seeing a sexual predator enough times\nSome whack a doodle is going to you know take take matters into his or her own hands God help us so what responsibility does the Democrat leadership have here\nUh I don't think they're going to exercise but they gotta they gotta responsibilities ...\nNo I Would I Would I'm waiting for that uh I'm waiting for that undergrad say there go ahead\nNo wait a long time I think\nSenator Grassley are the lessons learned from this Kavanaugh saga of many of us thought that in the beginning when we had to put off the hearing and and kick it off from the Thursday vote initially kick it off to Monday and then it got delayed because of the Ford allegations\nAny thoughts to solidifying the rules so you can't\nExtend hearings past the close of the original hearing date so these kind of anonymous allegations can't drop and make a difference again\nFor all I read your tweets when you took me to\nTears called me for for not calling for a whole but you can't you can't you ... if I call the vote today you on that we went along we\nWe all tend to tend to eleven so you got to have some respect for people that are on the job here and you know doing it and so we we waited until we had the votes\nYeah no I corrected myself after that I didn't delete the ... because I said but I corrected myself and then you and you and McConnell both\nHindered handled this master fleet in the face of incredibly difficult\nAnd I think I'm a I'm a highly emotional highly charged atmosphere and when people say that Dr Ford was disrespected which is a guest on my show said last night she was disrespected I said oh my gosh Senator Grassley said what\nIf you need something repeated or you know if you are you okay do you need anything I mean you couldn't have\nBeen more solicited of Dr Ford I I Can't imagine how you could have been frankly\nYeah well it reminds me of how I was confronted by Iowans because uh in the Thomas hearings because I was so mean to Anita Hill and I never asked a single question but I was sitting beside specter that did are questioning and everybody thought I was specter [laughter]\n\nMy goodness I'm Senator Grassley a there was another moment that I have to get you to react to um [noise] this is Heidi Heitkamp of course Democrat in North Dakota undecided divide vote against calving off a lot of people have talked about whether the\nCourt remains legitimate you heard Hillary say that it's a shame that things happen as they happen because the court always was respected and this is what senator hide camps then\nYou're obviously in the midst of a very tough reelection\nSame that things happen as they happen because the court always was respected and this is what senator hide camps then\nYou're obviously in the midst of a very tough reelection fight and I know you you feel voting the way you did was the right way do you worry are you concerned that it may have cost you your sentences\nAt the end of the day still have to look at yourself in the near and think about\nWhat your future holds compromise something like this based on politics and I I Believe the smoke would have compromised um my true belief that this person did not have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court they're still repeating\nThat the temperament issues Senator Grassley\nHe listened this gets back to what I already told you you got twelve successful years on the DC circuit the second most important\nA court in the land and he's been college all or even people like Garland a said that he had that sort of\nA approach to judging and that means judicial temperament and not only are you have a personality\nThat is a temperate you also leave your personal views out of out of a decision making you look at the law and look at the facts of the case and just to use those two things to go by\nSo consequently uh ... what what she said Sandra Hi Kim said\nPlus your question brings me to a history of Thomas\nOr is it going to hurt the Supreme Court I listen to the same thing twenty eight years ago and then I look at twenty eight years record\nOf Thomas on the court and I've never seen any retribution on his part towards anything that was set against him at that time and he was mad when he said he was going through our high tech ... what\nDo you hike or something like ...\nYeah so so ah you know after twenty eight years or less the same thing about Thomas not seeing it I think that I got great confidence that Kavanaugh's going to bring great press stage and knowledge\nAnd academic background and more importantly his work on the second highest court\n... court and it's all positive\nNo it's it's ... he's the one in the most qualified people period and sit on the court or Senator Grassley the uh the Susan Collins hum situation and mean of course all these leftist billionaires promising to flood\nOr the her opponent whoever that ends up being a with lots of money you want to raise three million dollars for Susan Collins I Know Mitch McConnell has said the same thing how was that looking\nWell we're just getting started at that but a conservative even though a lot of times they disagree with

you already voted early voting is starting already how many have already voted our plan\nTo vote early I don't like like voting on election I don't like early voting is is is is designed to help the left because they're more lazy and then I Want to go to\nThe poll well but but think about this if tomorrow something today something ruined his happens where I don't know your candidate opens fire into a crowd or at a baseball game you have no way of turning your vote back\nIt happens where I don't know your candidate opens fire into a crowd or at a baseball game\nYou have no way of turning your vote back you can't reclaim your vote I think you vote up until election day you vote on election day so you have all the data not this early but I Know people who they vote the a month before the election two months it's ridiculous\nYeah I uh I think the early voting is a little much I just can't take motor voter all that motor voter early vote on the next to vote on the Internet oh there's no fraud pops possibility there not at all it's not going to be any gaming of the system with that\nI was upset to learn motor voter wasn't drive through I thought it was dry dry out and see I'd like that because then I could get my drive through ... and my vote done at the same time maybe at the same play it is and that would be very that that's an attractive possibility to the doctor\nHas to be seals when you get the drive through ... well no one has to put a top on it and they give you the straw yes they give you the straw because you're just transporting\nSinking and no no oh you'd never do that never you're driving a back seat that the people a back seat of going there ... they had the last run those during the last ... [laughter]\nBut it is ridiculous my favorite is when you see these people they take the gallon ... from the window [laughter]\nYou know they've got all those solo cups and the car all that stuff I used to drink that stuff in college I Do love decker is they are like they're basically jar bucks smoothies ... sugar and grand I Will watch worst\nSugar is I'm Sorry but sugar causes cancer you know it does that process food is the worst don't get that ...

tonight\nI'm hungry that's the gray gray is out there right at five five forty laundry many times and very quickly I Can't hear jam\nAll right All right a five five forty Laura are coming up congressman Jim Jordan I bet he wants to document redacted are too don't you think some go uh\n\n\nGuys have heard me talk about a product for months that has changed my sleeping habits for ever it's called my pillow\n... um I mean I unlike you I Love Senator Grassley a and you know he's\nBeen on this whole restaurant and if the court to you but that was funny [laughter]\nHe keeps it at one death ... what's the word ... which I like when he's upset it's like one level it was like\nTo me [laughter]\nI Love 'em he did a fantastic job and I thought I mean I Would I be about it now I I've always really liked it All right congressman what is going on now we had\nYou had a Trump flying with all Rosenstein or the other day down to where the heck when they find a Florida yeah and I saw a rod at the White House at the cabinet thing and I said well yeah wrinkles and pick the dust on the president what did you know he's probably your best friends what what what the theory there congressman\nUh I I don't know but I don't know the facts are facts and then you have to give it McCain memos that we've subpoenaed there are all these stories out a earlier this week to talk about how serious they took the alleged comments Mr ... died made about actually recording the president in the oval office wearing a wire\nOr tape recording in whatever they are a phone recording whatever they want to do\nUm and there's the fact that it now looks like Mr Rogers by not going to show up tomorrow so we don't do that for sure but we're starting to hear rumors that he's not coming to talk to Congress like he was supposed to uh tomorrow or in um\nSo we don't do that for sure if it were starting to hear rumors that he's not coming to talk to Congress like he was supposed to uh tomorrow or in I'm In the Judiciary Committee so\nI mean I think that because he has a good relationship with the president now he doesn't have to\n... well maybe maybe or maybe it has something to do with the stories that were written that said you know what he said that you are or is that the stories are said he said it's been a tape and this page and then when I talk to Mr Baker so\nI'm look will or will hopefully he'll hopefully he'll take change his mind it will be there tomorrow so we can asking the questions that I think American people deserve to have the answers to\nCongressman Jordan explain James Baker the ah the man who is the attorney at the FBI and why\nHis involvement in all of this and his contacts are so important to the narrative of how this whole Russian investigation was started\n'cause he's the chief counsel when you're the chief counsel the FBI and you're the guy in the middle of the two biggest investigations run by all these key players struck page McCabe call me a\nThat is important and when it's now now being reported that uh he was he taught to both McCain and paid shortly after this meeting took place with Mr Rosenstein and that he understood it to be a serious comment made in that meeting that's why we need to talk to Mr Rosenstein and never forget the fundamental facts\nWhen did you ever seen this happen at any federal agency James Comey fire director former direct FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe light three times under oath fire Jim Baker chief counsel first demoted then left the FBI we used to pay jeopardy I counseled demoted than left and of course Peter ...\nThe counter intelligence devoted than fired top people the FBI demoted or fired all the people who ran the Clinton investigation and then now as we know launched and ran the Russia investigation until Mr Rosenstein\nNamed Mr ... to take that investigation over so that's why this is important and that's why Mr Rosenstein needs to be in front of us so we can asking questions about all\nYeah he's not going to show there's no way I don't think I might make it either no no he's he's not going to he's not going to come I I just\nI I guess I don't understand why that he they claimed it was a joke and it maybe I just don't have the sense of humor I really thought I had but I don't think that was all that funny like I'm going to wire myself we get wired go and take the president and then get the twenty Fifth Amendment go I I don't understand why is that funny\nI agree with you I agree with you completely Laura you shouldn't be joking about it about matters like that in front of the ordinance made that is this is the guy who in effect is running the Justice Department and whether it's sarcasm or joke or what it should not be set\nUp particularly remember the time that this was done this was when the whole stinking town was all spun up this is between may ninth twenty Seventeen and may seventeenth twenty Seventy may ninth as a date Rosenstein writes the memo that the president uses to fire call me may seventeenth is when Rosenstein names\nAre lower as the special counsel sometime in between there and it looks like it happened on may sixteenth is one this alleged conversation took place so even joking about something in that timeframe when that whole city was all spun up about all the special counsel and obstruction of justice and all those issues\nAt all the more reason why you should not be saying something even if it was a joke\nAgain the the main question that is on the table I think as a mother is gonna do among there's going to do but the main question on the table is why did you serve email an American citizen\nBased on information you received from and paid for from the opponent of Donald Trump\nAnd if that's the other hand are now you can you can start surveilling someone because\nThey traveled to Russia and said hello to uh\nDonald Trump and if that's the lander now you can you can start surveilling someone because they traveled to Russia and\nSaid hello to a a government official at some point and years ago you he was questioned and the poor Carter Page mean where does he go to get you know his reputation back and what if you go to get here legal fees paid I mean he's just twisted knowing for years\nNo I'm a ... it's good you brought that up 'cause we sometimes it's important is to go back to the basics\nThe Clinton campaign the DNC paid curtains carry it off or who paid fusion GPS who hired a foreigner\nTo go talk to Russians and put together a document that was completely false totally bogus totally uncorroborated in that document became the basis we're going to a secret court to get a warrant to spy on Mr page because he was associated with the other party can claim\nThat is what happens here and ... and and they used the press to get all kinds of information flooding the FBI so so fusion GPS is Nelly ... works for them\nShe get the information to her husband just end funnels it to the FBI so she gives information to resort to Justice Department official so you've got all these sources sending the lie\nTo the FBI which gives it more credibility I always say the more people talking about the live Egypt allies to believe and that's exactly what took place you are but it's still a lie\nAnd they use that to go spy on the other campaign it's\nWhat Iran is the um what's your what's your sense about uh the mid term elections I mean do you think Kavanaugh the energy from that is going to sustain the Republicans to cut maybe some of the Democrat gains that there are still predicting in the house I'm well how do you see this playing out\nYeah I Hope so I Hope so and I was I was in or out and about across our district and lived in Florida the other night when people were fired up that that our Senate how tough\nAnd a ... a good manager was being attacked by the left I think a lot of people are beginning to see that the left has gone completely crazy we did a tweet the other day I had more people comment on this we said today's left a plot Kaepernick destroy Kavanaugh\nAnd that's today's left that they they embraced the radical you know ... when he disrespected the flag embrace Cuomo when he says\nAmerica was never that great cheer on Maxine Waters when she says go out and harassed people who support the president or an old by the way it will destroy cabin on the prosecute I mean that's today's left and I think it is beginning to fire up conservative voters are Republican voters I Hope it is staying over the next twenty six days and that we can keep the majority now\nDo you look over your shoulder more now with ah with what's happening out there\n[noise] yeah I mean I think you have to uh I I don't know if I started to fewer but like ... ... where we're at a back in June literally two days after Maxine Waters did it or first ran and we got what I what I call the treatment from a lady were\nOut and she started we're in a line of people get moving into the theater and um she just started\n... you know yelling shame and evil and Jim Jordan terrible all this stuff so I mean it's ridiculous we we would never do that to people who are on the left but they seem to want to do that all the time now so you do kinda just watch a little bit or\nYou know um walk I Wish they wouldn't do that I don't think it's appropriate let's just fight about and argue about the idea is let's not let's not make it personal let's not run people out to restaurants and do all the things that they're\nThey're having what they're going to do that they found to do it and it's safe yeah it's it's what they have now they're holding onto the anger by the way there was an interesting thing actually I forgot to ask you earlier congressman\nAndy McCarthy the former um since the U.S attorney in southern district of New York he made this point on my show last night about Rosenstein and why the president may not end up uh removing him is deputy Asia and let's listen\nI think the president realizes that if he were to get rid of uh\nYou not end up ah removing him as deputy AG let's listen\nI think the president realizes that if he were to get rid of\nA Rosenstein at this point it would be like firing Comey times three and it would give Mahler a reason to extend the investigation why what do you want to do that I mean it looks like now\nThere's not going to be any charges they're stepping down have transitioned a lot of these cases that they brought to other components of the Justice Department this is about or\nWhat do you think about that yeah I mean that's pretty high it seemed like things are pretty quiet some they must be writing the report card yeah\nYeah I I Hope so and I think that that's probably a ... that can be right and uh obviously respect because I'm In all the things he's written about always done\nSo I look at all is going to be any changes made the Justice Department till after the election until after about ... I think that that's obvious uh it's obvious that I'm the president wants that a new attorney general and um I think that that will happen at some point too but I don't think that's going to happen until after the election it until after the special counsel's work is finished\nA Jim Jordan always great to talk to you congressman you bet right set of Ohio congressman thanks so much will take a break close out this hour a lot more to get to Michael Savage is also going to join us stay there the Laura Ingraham show [noise]\nDid you know that over a million athletes suffer concussion each year that includes boys and girls every age\nEvery type and level of sport\nIt isn't always clear that a player has had a concussion so parents athletes and coaches need to learn about concussion signs and symptoms the American Academy of neurology recommends athletes thought to have a concussion be immediately removed from place\nAnd not returning until assessed by healthcare professional trained in concussion this isn't just about sports [noise] it's about your brain when in doubt sit it out [noise] learn more at\nA.

I I don't know what that's called but they tried to corral it into the little area where they can lock it up\nUm I feel like that's where my head goes and like it just it cannot be corralled it's very seldom that it can be corralled but excited to have you joining us again this morning this was fantastic I I'm I'm In a fantastic movie because I get more sleep and I've gotten and probably six months last night\nTried to take a nap at five PM and I'm Glad I set my alarm just in case because I didn't wake up until it was time to wake up this morning so I slipped from five pm to three thirty am this\nMorning I didn't get home until eight thirty last night yeah I didn't leave campus until eight last night yeah\nOh I Know\nI I Know this is not normal eleven hours of sleep who what working person can say they can get eleven hours of sleep but don't get me wrong I totally blew off stuff that I was supposed to do like I had a lot of things to do and I just thought you know a a school projects really aren't that important but sleep is important because your health\nYou can't learn if you're not healthy\nThere's that logic right there eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three is the number to join the conversation so Dylan did you see the coverage of this hurricane Michael yesterday\nOr last saw a lot about it\nIt was absolutely crazy I mean just some of the images that came out\nUm yesterday had just unbelievable amounts of damage and the there were some videos of like the wind I remember one specifically out of the panhandle where there was like you know there's clusters of palm trees in certain places right so there was this cluster of palm trees\nAnd it was getting hit by I Believe the eye of the hurricane in the trees were almost being ripped out of the ground\nLike tall palm trees that are very very hard to move or almost being all blown over to where the top was touching the bottom of the tree it was just\nThursday Michael was about twenty five miles east of Macon Georgia and it had maximum sustained winds of sixty miles per hour so it\nIt is now just a tropical storm and no longer a hurricane and it's headed up through Georgia and it's going to continue that pat eastward and it doesn't look like it's really going to affect much in Alabama I Believe we have a thirty percent chance of winning a of rain here in Birmingham\nAnd uh for Huntsville you have a zero percent chance of rain so\nLower Alabama was definitely affected by hurricane Michael and we send our thoughts and prayers all those in a lower in southern Alabama that were affected by this storm um but as for central Alabama and the Birmingham area and northern Alabama Huntsville area doesn't look like we are going to see many effects of this storm\nBut we will continue to bring you more updates on this as we see this I'm looking for\nIf we have any idea as to what the effects of the storm were\nRight and so it's it's approximately two hundred and eighty eight thousand homes and businesses were without power in Florida forty ... forty thousand in Georgia in forty one thousand in Alabama so already forty one thousand people in Alabama have lost power because of the storm\nUm it's ... the article goes on to talk about Michael is still losing strength over eastern Georgia and so there is there and then there's\nArticle goes on talking about Michael is still losing strength over eastern Georgia and so\nThere is there and then there's\nReports about um the deaths that are being attributed to Michael I'm honestly for what how bad of a storm this was\nTheir only or two deaths attributed to Michael right now which I mean two people dying is never a good thing by any stretch of the imagination and our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of those who were affected and hurt and killed by the storm but when you look at the numbers of comparable storms like Katrina\nRight it to only two people having been killed by the storm seems to be a blessing in disguise because there is that it had the potential to hurt a lot of people a lot a lot of people\nAnd\nNow I mean there's just continued video rolling in from what happened um yesterday and the trees snapping it's just it's absolutely unbelievable eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three is the number to join the conversation again that's eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three that's going to Keith on line one Keith how you doing this morning\nI'm a pretty good key okay after people yeah that\nWeighs a lot for a lot of people show work that did not ladies area yeah uh just favor minded as some of them are financially and I've always\nAreas or one hundred and ... area yeah and\nI'm One of them I say why I'll tell you off the air yeah but had I been living down there I Would have been able\nTo ... yeah uh and so a lot of people I\nKnow I had a concept of hey you know like how you go and now I find myself\nIn this position where if there was an evacuation route from my area ... I Would just have to say darn and ...\nYeah so and there are certain ... ... yeah\nYeah there there are some services that ah it's false five\nYeah hundred percent understand\nSo just a just be careful you know about about staying there and some of it for just you know a way I'm going\nOh yeah and I and I think that's the case most of the time I think there always are going to be the people that just stay just because the defiant and being like nope I'm not leaving but\nI feel like a lot of people that stay are because like you said they're financially or physically unable to leave and that's why those shelters are opened up in the area and um what are considered incredibly stable structures\nJak guy thank you for your time no right I appreciate you keep God Bless you okay thank you All right\nEight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three is number to join the conversation yeah that is something that always startled me is I see it because governors ... I Believe it was Governor Scott Walker is that correct they issued a warning for people to evacuate and I did see um you know here on this program we we said you know\nPlease listen to that warning and you know knowing full well there are some people they can't listen to that warning but the majority of people please listen to that warning but I have heard pundits another host and things ... things of that nature not necessarily on this station but just from around the area they always you know\nA warning but I have heard pundits and other host and think that things of that nature not necessarily on this station but just from around the area they always you know\nTend to make light of when somebody stays for the hurricane now don't get me wrong if you're thrown a hurricane party\nAnd you're just stocking up like I saw some Facebook posts where somebody said I'm not leaving I'm staying here I got a couple of gallons of water a couple of gallons of wine and I'll be All right and that's what they said I'm like okay you're an idiot like have a lot more water yeah exactly but to have a lot more water but [laughter]\nDylan [laughter] but this and if if you're unable to leave that's a completely different story so when I hear pundits that go out or or even just basic commentators radio hosts et cetera they go out and they kind of make a mockery of that like\nI just it kinda rubs me the wrong way because Keats is exactly right there are people that are just entirely enable to leave that area whether it be financially physically et cetera but I Will say if you stick around to have a hurricane party let me be the first to say on record\nYou're an idiot like seriously or if you just straight up choose not to leave when you have the ability\nTo exactly because and I mean it's the claim that we've talked about a lot what\nWhat what is your life worth right are you willing to risk your life for a couple of beers and watching a a storm rolling right 'cause that's what a hurricane party is how about you go how about you drive and stay in a cheap hotel that's out of the radius where the hurricane is going to be as detrimental and have a couple of beers and watch the rain rolling on your TV\nLike ... no argument other than physically or financially able for me really hold any water as to why no pun intended as to why people can't leave the area I did not\nDo that actually that was just twist of fate [laughter]\nSo I have a a power systems class yeah on Monday and Wednesday night so I had it last night ... five to six Fifteen PM yes later class yeah\nThe instructor for the class actually works with Alabama Power okay who was southern company and there are several uh students in the class with me that also work in southern company yeah and the hurricane came up as you would expect oh yeah\nAnd one of the ... one of my classmates I started to look it up on his phone and say I've asked and they can look that up but in Gulf Power at around five Fifteen pm last night yeah there were sixty three thousand breakers tripped\nAnd somewhere over a hundred thousand a\n\nLocations without power wow so you're getting some inside information here in the wake up call that they will not release that info proud and that's just the Gulf Power that's crazy that's not all of our power that's not Georgia Power that is\nJust the Gulf so I thought Alabama Power had somewhat of a monopoly on the market but there are other power entities I guess towards the coast more they're all part of southern company okay so yeah so they do have a monopoly it's just they try they put them under different names to try to make you think there is not a monopoly but if southern company owns all of the power in Alabama\nThey have a monopoly on the power in Alabama where you can't really consider a monopoly when you consider that it's a utility\nThat's true that's true\nBut there's not enough room for competition that come in so I feel like you could consider a monopoly because I get your argument it's a utility utilities are weird when you started talking about monopoly well I I'm not talking from a legal standpoint right I'm not saying we're going to come in with the anti trust laws and trust bust up in their early and I'm not saying any of that but I'm saying that\nA monopoly well I I'm not talking from a legal standpoint right I'm not saying we're going to come in with the anti trust laws and trust bust up in their early and I'm not saying any of that but I'm saying that from age just basic standpoint if you own all of acts in one area right\nYou are in and of itself a monopoly and so like ... and when I say a monopoly I mean they have the right to set their own prices right every business does but there's no competition to even them out there is no free market competition it's just southern company in the state of Alabama and there's nothing else like there is not like\nSpectrum power or something like that to help kind of even out that burden likes like southern company could just say we're going to raise rates are ex unless the legislature stepson and goes we're not going to allow you to\nDo that which sometimes they do there are parts of northern Alabama that are close enough to\nThe border between Alabama Power and the TV age where they can choose I Believe yeah but it's there's nowhere else Alabama where do you have that option as somebody that comes from Tennessee I can tell you one hundred percent the TV a has a monopoly in the state of Tennessee no question\nIt seems like a really weird way to do things like I get it you can call it not a monopoly because of the state by state thing right that's how the powers regulated but I feel like at some point\nCompetition will be introduced to the market be is competition with just allow your rates to potentially be better and it could also allow your power capacity to be better so that's always something that's\nCivil but what I'm Talking to is the leftist here the leftist that came out of the Obama administration like\nEric Holder and like Hillary Clinton you haven't been civil in a long time you drum up these talking points that I have no basis in fact whatsoever that are all about how you feel inside unless somebody brings facts to the table it tends to hurt your feelings well I got a message for you right now\nI don't care about your feelings I Will continue bringing facts to the table the Republican Party will continue bringing facts to the table and leftist can sink to this point of incivility but when the history books look back at this\nAnd see the incivility that's being brought around\nBy leftist institutions and by mainstream left us such as Hillary Clinton the former Democratic nominee for president of the United states\nAnd Eric Holder the former attorney general for the United states under Brock Obama the history books will show\nThis was the time were left us some to their lowest in your progression towards democratic socialism towards socialistic tendencies we will not falter just because your perception of the world is so\nFlawed we will not falter\nWe will not fail to continue to do what we've done and we will continue to bring economic progress I mean just look at the numbers after eight years of sheer incompetence under Brock\nObama and the economic just pet\nThat we were in at that point don't get me wrong I Know what people are about to say he took over for George Bush he took over during a time of crisis he took over during the housing crisis you're a hundred percent right\nBut we never saw the growth under Brock Obama in any of his eight years that we've seen under Trump and his two years in office that's just the fact and so when you come at us with these claims of incivility that were threatening your way of life we're not threatening your way of life we're making your way of life\nBetter the only argument point that you have is\nAbortion that's what you keep going to and all these main arguments Republicans aren't talking about abortion at the moment roe v Wade can't be overturned I don't know how many times I have to sound like a broken record player and repeat this\nThe only way that can come about is through the Supreme Court a process that would take years\nYou've ran out of ammunition you've ran out of Russia Iran Stormy Daniels you've ran out of Brett Kavanaugh we're talking about sexual assault\nWhat's next Well Eric holder tells us what's next when they go low we kick them well\nAbout you look inward what happens when Dianne Feinstein doesn't turn things into the committee on time what\nHappens when she allows weeks ... weeks of it the advise and consent process to go on without turning in relevant information and then comes out with a dirty smear campaign right is there are about to go vote when your own party goes\nIn relevant information and then comes out with a dirty smear campaign right is there are about to go vote when your own party goes low what do you do when Hillary Clinton realizes she's about to be caught\nAnd delete thirty thousand emails when she goes low what do you do when Anthony wiener comes out and gets caught sending pornographic images to a child\nWhat do you do when they go low what do you do ...\nHypocrites that's all you are eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three Eric Holder there's a reason you're not in any public office anymore 'cause nobody can stomach rhetoric like this 'cause it's just that ignorant we're going to go to Henry on line one Henry how you doing\nYou got to give him and I'm doing just fine and a glad to hear you're going to go ahead and work another day\n[laughter] ...\nYou know you know you've got to get a hold their credit though he did have Obama's back\nYeah you know yeah he did it he went as far as a contempt of Congress ... member yeah hey if this was ... that that was that the like Batman and Robin man they were the dynamic duo ...\nAnd are are older you know you try to kick me in the face up take your foot off dude [laughter]\nAnd that's exactly what he means you kick us in the face\nBut you know why and I'm I'm getting the vibe from the left\nThat day realist cannot stomach I think even here in the Republican fights back and we that's why Trump got elected Republicans were tired\nOf fighting out here ... ... you know and and the\nRoutes and crevices of this nation trying to win elections from superintendent of schools are up\nAnd here we are being kicked down and told were every living\nOh God the thing that exists under under the sun by these people and they truly have always believed that they believe what they say when they call it I was seeing a probe the problem of ... and every other they truly believe that you know what\nI Am truly believe that that's what their hearts are in thinking they truly are they don't care about women they don't care about children they don't ... care about granny being thrown off the cliff\nAnd then I got I got I got to stop myself because I don't want to get upset by these people they have no idea what a real job is you notice that all these people that are in office not in the Democratic party and I'm probably repeating myself from yesterday and it would but\nThere is no one in the Democratic party saying hey let's get some civility maybe we should come back from the brink because we're going to do something and cause\nSome real trouble but you know I I Believe that they think they can with the news media in their pocket they can turn anything that's done to them into the ... of the Republicans for this nation so I Hope Republicans know that\nAnd that they won't fall into the trap or there's there is because that's what they do the wicked set traction stairs for the righteous\nYeah and well we only only I I Will say the only\nPerson that has come out and has gone against this would be a Heidi Heitkamp which who is a red state Democrats she said in response Hillary Clinton's comments she said quote that's ridiculous I Can't imagine how you get anything done if you don't bring the civility back into politics and that goes for both sides so\n... what he was calling out\nIs I Can't imagine how you get anything done if you don't bring back as civility back into politics and that goes for both sides\nSo ... what he was calling out Hillary\nClinton yes but did she just nudge in and that goes for both side yeah she did that as well\nYeah but you know what is that what's really in our heart because these are pro sleek profusely\nLying people didn't live to keep their standings they lie to keep their jobs if I had to keep that\nLives in I'm with you when you talk about Hillary Clinton that way but I got to say I think that's just politicians in general I think ... ally and tell you exactly what you want to hear here's what I'll do because it's exactly what you want to hear now go vote for me\nYou know and you're right about that 'cause I really think people want to be Barbara Streisand the death yup they surely [laughter]\nI've never put that way I Love that\nWell it's better than saying the B. S. word just Barbra Streisand\nBackyard and undermine [laughter]\nThese people are they are the kid and you know why I never believed that I Would be speaking this way about people but they have shown their true colors who is one son that song\nThey're true she does commercials I forget\nSome a British girl on girl just like to have fun I don't know hinder you belong on it\nI Can't remember the about got offered to that but I Want to say I am an idiot okay I ever see that shut up and you're enjoy hearing that that sort of separate myself\nHenry Hey we'll have lost some entirely but we're about to run to break buddy\nOh man I've been through a to land canes through the eye okay they kind of been that bad to survive and one in ... at sea but what's worse than the hurricanes the north Atlantic\nUnbelievable minutiae wall or water Seventy feet tall coming over your back out of a of a navy destroyer you get a profound respect for her Mother Nature\nOf how to read you guys doing OK yeah look good morning and a great day by day or a you\nHave a great morning or eight six six by by one Ninety nine thirty three the number to join the conversation\nWe're about to head out the break we'll get more into this Eric Holder situation when we come back and it's not just the Democratic party in the Democratic party officials like Eric Holder that have done away with civility there was also CNN hit\nProbably one of the racist moments most racist moments in modern history that I've seen televised\nHappened yesterday have you heard about this yet CNN one of the most racist moments that I've ever seen it's hard to talk about because of language we they used and we're not sure if we can hear it but I'm gonna check it with ... and we'll see right when we come back don't go anywhere there's a wakeup call\nYou're listening to the wake up call\nAnd raised in Alabama educated and John Carroll Sanford university you a B and Birmingham School of law you see my face on thousands of billboards but did you know that over twenty five thousand of your neighbors have trust to me when they needed help the most", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "11"}
