let's listen\nHere sixty three thousand who people who are being forced to go through unnecessary hurdles to prove their bona fide ease the second is that you have a hundred and fifty nine counties thousands of volunteering paid poll workers who are going to be asked to substantially verify that these ideas are sufficient and the challenges there is this this is the subject is standard\nIt would

matching from a licenses driver's licenses to voter rolls\nThey claim that us secretary of state are disenfranchising or suppressing the ability of especially minorities to vote in the state your response\nWell I Know this will shock you lower but on following state law that we have in Georgia for clarification process because we believe in we should do not support this that we should clarify\nWho individuals are before we registered to vote that's why we have a stick or a citizenship check this flight we have when you get your driver's license in our state\n... this is a manufactured crisis they did the same thing before the two thousand for reelection governor Nathan Deal\nThey did the same thing before the presidential election of Donald Trump and they're doing the same thing now we had record turnout Donald Trump was elected in Georgia the most votes ever cast in our state so I don't see how that spoke suppression\nRight before this outrageous claims came we announced that we had or people on our voter rolls than ever before the state of Georgia\nBecause we have things like online voter registration up push the general assembly and implemented a secretary of state ... years ago we have eight thousand more people on our roles now than we hit had when I took office she voted against on line voter registration she does not support our common sense\nPhoto out the law she voted against our citizenship to the counties are the ones that are flagging these individuals because the information from hurt local groups is not properly\nThe ship to the counties are the ones that are flagging these individuals because they have permission from hurt local groups\nIs not properly filled out on the form and by the way all these people have to do to be able to vote is the same thing that I Would or any other Georgia citizen that his own our roles they just have to go to their polling location\nShow their photo out the most likely their driver's license and they can vote so that is not a hot hurdle for people to do but they can't blame me on their own canvassers can't fill out proper pipe or register someone to vote\nAnd if they use our own line system they never had any of this problem to start with so she's blaming me for a problem she created a and she's blaming me for following state law and that's why I think\nGeorgia voters are a lot smarter

breaking through with that message in a big way it's not been the defining issue of the mid term elections\nAnd the hard line immigration policy hard time\nUh breaking through with that message in a big way is not been the defining issue of the mid term elections and so there is this sense and you see it with hard liners as a sort of regular feature American politics now that they feel like they were more outrageous we do something that the more offensive or controversial maybe that will create a ... that\nTime [noise]\nAh because he really is in touch with people on immigration\nRight it's not a big issue [noise] let me give you some facts here before we get to our guests are the Gallup\nPoll the latest a big poll on the top issue for us voters was back in July or twenty two percent of Americans in July said immigration is the top problem for the United states is up from fourteen percent in June and is the highest percentage naming that issue in Gallup history\nAnd asking the most important or when they asked the most important problem question uh again mentions of immigration as the nation's most important problem have averaged only you know five percent of the last Seventeen years the Gallup as an asking the question\nOn generally a monthly basis immigration is the top issue in the United states slightly edging out the economy okay\nAnd goes on and on about this uh a Reuters poll found that Fifteen Percent of registered voters said said immigration is their biggest concern topping economic performance and healthcare immigration and the writers ... was the top issue for voters in the election\nOr that number is higher of course among Republicans with twenty six percent of the G O P voters citing immigration as their major concern just seven percent of Democrats said the same\nUh but listen to this forty five percent of black voters in forty four percent of Hispanic voters each said that immigration has had a negative impact\nOn their community now why is that the CBS Hugo poll why is that\nBecause of course they live in the areas where immigration has a profound effect on the public schools the healthcare system or in some cases crime a housing the list goes on and on\nThese are the facts Donald Trump is more in touch with the American people on immigration than pretty much any politician alive today he understands it\nJoining us now I'm delighted or he is with US Congressman Tom Garrett Republican from Virginia is fifth congressional district\nOr he's going to give us a the latest because he sits on the all important House Homeland Security Committee as we see these caravans up and running again with the mass migration from Central America coming into this country because they know there'll be caught an ultimately released\nCongress men I can tell you my listeners are infuriated by this they want Congress to act they want these loopholes closed what can you tell us about what Congress could do in short order to prevent this nonsense off from continuing\nEvery time we passed the omnibus bill or something massive funding stopgap measure will yank the rug out from underneath the president wants to keep its promises of securing the border your lead and bumper where\nThe gentleman that I use the term loosely talked about hardliners on immigration is symptomatic of the fact that the left as co opted the lexicon changed the meaning of words and I'd like for something that explained to me when defending your national borders and sovereignty became a hard line stance\nBecause essentially what they've done is that if you don't want to open borders than you are mean\nAnd the American voting public needs to think hard enough to understand\nWhat they've done is that if you don't want to open borders than you are mean and the American voting public needs to think hard enough to understand that very ridiculous underlying assumptions that I Am all for a robust and help the legal\nImmigration system is I think you are but at what point did securing the border has become controversial\nAnd and and and why is it that Republicans cut the rug out from underneath the president as a relates to keep his promises on security our borders I Can't figure it out um and and that\nWell let me tell you about something that happened Congress man this was this is very concerning again to my listeners and viewers on Fox\nAh this was a earlier this year when we had the opportunity terrain and these ever broadening asylum categories meaning domestic abuse and fear of gangs\nOr what have been included in the credible fear\nA categories as as affecting social groups in a particular country so a bad effect on certain social groups Jeff Sessions comes along as attorney general and says ... no no no no no a domestic domestic abuse and gang membership that's that's not part of what constitutes credible fear\nCongress sadly David Yoder a congressman from Kansas and a a ... a democratic ah in ah North Carolina both acted to remove that\nFrom the ongoing congressional action on that so that was gutted by Congress that's the kind of thing that is going to make it more difficult to hold the house of representatives Republicans it's it's insane that they took they they decided to got what Jeff Sessions wanted to do their\nWell look Kevin Yoder and Kansas has got himself in a tough fight and Republicans always think moderating on the message that got him elected in the first place is some sort of magical formula for reelection\nI disagree dance with the one who run ya um and and so you find yourself in a terrible catch twenty two nobody's listening right that's a joke but I'm I'm a ... if we lose the house and maybe we'll actually get up off our butts during the lame duck session and keep some of the promises we made three or two and a half three years ago\nI mean I got to the upside you know\nThat the Republicans might act like Republicans\nWell I think again this is the most important issue for most Americans are who are answering these polls immigration is either number one number two and these caravans come into the country if Republicans lose the house it'll get worse not going to get better it's going to get worse but\nWhen I said ... except maybe we'll get some some courage right UC UC leader McCarthy now talking about border security and I'm ... I'm Glad he is but I mean why now\nI fear that there's a political motivation which is a shame\nWell again I I'm not I'm not understanding really why Paul Ryan is still in as speaker of the house I think if you're going to retire or they think Paul Ryan is going to turn out to voters and in twenty Eighteen I mean God Bless all around I like um a lot but I\nYou know there's going to turn out to voters the guy who's flying all over the country right now Donald Trump\nAnd Congress I'm telling you\nCongress is going to rue the day that they didn't get the money for this law they did an appropriate it and they didn't change the stupid asylum laws that allow people to be gaming the system and then caught and ultimately released because we do not\nHave the facilities to house them seven hundred thousand people in immigration backlog now ... court backlog claiming credible fear another client that's absurd\nThat's prosecuted for the better part of a decade and domestic violence as a scourge upon any nation but it's hard to prove domestic\nOf ... uh uh this uh\nThis weekend I spoke at an end to affirmative action Rawley with Edward Blum he's the president of students for fair admissions which is suing Harvard or basically diversity has become a justification for racial discrimination against Asian Americans and whites at Harvard\nAccording to Harvard zone admissions data or they reduced Asian American Roman for forty three percent\nTo Eighteen percent uh through a complicated ... a diverse if a\nDiscrimination scheme I in fact Harvard zone admissions data shows that\nA an eternal team who they were discriminated against Asian Americans and they bury the report that's on trial right now and uh one important point I Want to make your audience today is that\nHarvard received billions in federal government money they're literally taking your heart or tax money and using it to discriminate against you\nWell how am I so they take all this money they have billions in an endowment I mean they they could basically get free tuition to almost every student and still be a be you know swimming in money ah but this would mean the federal government is subsidizing racism title racism\nOr you know uh affirmative in a more but it's it's not just Harvard more than a hundred universities publicly endorsed racial discrimination in the Supreme Court's Fisher decision a you know affirmative action is a nationwide system of government funded state sponsored racism\nUm and it it she has a huge impact on missions\nSo what what do you um what do you think is going to happen in this court decision I mean the the the belief that diversity is the founding principal of America\nOr is I mean I bet if you pull people in colleges and universities pulled the students most would would cite diversity is a founding American principle of course America's founded on liberty\nNot founded on diversity is founded on liberty but they they think that's sacrosanct the colleges always\nList that as a compelling interest and there are a lot in their defense these lawsuits are that diversity should be a consideration I think the court has said it can be one consideration but it can't be the Supreme Court and the Michigan affirmative action case but it can't be the only consideration correct\nOr you're you're absolutely right but you know I I kind of this is the point I Want to one of the points I made when I spoke at the rally was I I had the opportunity to go to UCLA after I got into medical school and dropped out\nUCLA is a school that doesn't practice affirmative action in admissions and\nI learned that it was possible to have a diverse class of African Americans Hispanics Asian Americans had whites without practicing racial discrimination and missions so I don't want anyone to believe that affirmative action is essential for a great\nQuality of education you can have a great education you just let people in based on merit because there are smart people\nOf all races religions colors and creates\nWell the uh the opposition um to your point of view and say that you know you're merely your your goal\nFirst and creates well the uh the opposition hum to your point of view and say that you know you're merely your your goals would merely penalize those who have been systematically subjected to racism so there's historical racism in the United states\nA vast we must give a leg up or special consideration to those who come from that class of Americans so that it is fair than because historically they were subjected to this type of a systemic racism\nOr I Would argue in many ways it is the ultimate form of racism to assume that blacks and Hispanics Native Americans on my dad\nCan't compete ah based purely on racial grounds I think that all races can compete on a fair playing field and UCLA and UC Berkeley and uh the University of Michigan and other schools across this country which don't use affirmative action or living proof of that\nYeah well this genie park who's Harvard Asian American alliance president was on MSNBC and made this point\nLaughing is not about protecting American is brought by\nAn anti civil rights activists had were well mine rights activists who was trying to bring down Mary and civil rights protections in American society town and O'Malley about his goal to bring down and says the mission\nThat is actually designed to increase fairness increase opportunities increase their Murthy make education\nBetter for everyone which is good for Asian Americans found\nA your response to that [noise]\nAh affirmative action is racial discrimination against Asian Americans all of the statistical evidence shows that it is much harder to get into college in graduate school as an Asian American for every student who graduated from Harvard clause like her who is a harsh shoot at Harvard\nOr who was an Asian American there was an equally qualified Asian American student somewhere in America who got rejected because of the schools racially discriminatory affirmative action policies those Spiegel spoke at the Asian American coalition\nA for educations Raleigh a just a couple of days ago so they're speaking for the few who got it right there was a massive number who are victims of racial discrimination from schools like Harvard\nHow do you think this is going to turn out this court decision and then you can never guess depends on the judge you get depends on a lot of different factors but how do you think this is going to come down\nUh it it it comes down to a ... it it comes down to ... for the first time in our nation's history we have an anti affirmative action majority in the Supreme Court\nAh we have a Justice Department who was on our side who sees this as racism or a President Trump has been our greatest ally\nIn our fight to end racial discrimination against Asian Americans and whites in the form of affirmative action uh so because we have this powerful ally who is a champion for equal access to education for Asian Americans and white people uh I think that India and we may prevail\nGoing to be there this is probably going to go on for some time on the federal district court level the new court of appeals and ah if they determine the circuit split on this to the Supreme Court um VJ this is fascinating ah we've got to get you on TV you

talent and individual merit aid five five forty Laura your reaction to this and a lot more coming up [noise]\nWhether or not you're for or against affirmative action it's still important to see how

she didn't take anything she gets to try to make a difference in her campaign uh but the Democrats feel like is it if they can turn\nGeorgia to fully a silly blue then that will be a wall against Trump in twenty twenty what's the key to turning out your voters and getting them to see the great a danger of a Democrat takeover of Georgia\nWell I think they're waking up now is one of the things is concerned about a third base wasn't as motivated Democrats were but with the cabin on the confirmation with states statements like these people are finally realizing the real Stacey Abrams you know somebody is going to\nHaving fundraisers in San Francisco\nThirty days out from the election you know doing fund raisers with Cory Booker made she said this crazy statement about the undocumented folks being part of the only way if she was with Elizabeth Warren of all the overall bugs in the state of Georgia campaign for governor\nPeople are realizing that that is not our values that is you know we're we're literally in a battle for the soul of our state for our future and it's not only about me and twenty a pain it's about our state it's about our country\nAnd we're going to die hard I

know it it's going to cost billions to do all these\nRadical things that Stacey Abrams wants to do and she's going to raise taxes on artwork or just for and people are tired of that are waking up turning out we're going to put that ... but we need conservatives across the country to join the bike like others are doing to help or\nYou know drive the socialist radical liberal agenda go to jail

your focus is to care for the people of Georgia people of of this country and we cannot be good to anyone\nIf we'd dilute what we have\nWith a porous border and absurd immigration loopholes that essentially results and catch and release which is what the president is so frustrated about uh Brian I have to play for you something that Stacey Abrams\nIs a beating on pretty hard which is the claim of voter suppression despite the large voter registration record levels of voter registration in the state uh which of course can play both ways but ah we're going to a place and get your reaction let's listen\nYou have fifty three thousand people that are being forced to go through unnecessary hurdles to prove their bona fide east but the second is that you have a hundred and fifty nine counties thousands of volunteer and paid poll workers who are going to be asked to substantially verify that these ideas are sufficient and the challenges there is this this this is an objective standard\nIt would be much easier if he actually did his job and process people in a proper fashion and we did not have the slot exact match system\nAh your reaction to that uh the the law for managing matching from a licenses driver's licenses to voter rolls they claim that us secretary of state are disenfranchising or suppressed\nHis driver's licenses to voter rolls they claim that us secretary of state are disenfranchising or suppressing the ability of especially minorities to vote in the state your response\nWell no the ... law but I Am following state law that we have in Georgia for verification process because we believe in we should do not support this that we should clarify who individuals are before we registering to vote that's why we have a stick or\nA citizenship check this flight we have when you get your driver's license in our state\n... this is a manufactured crisis they did the same thing before the two thousand fourteen reelection of governor Nathan Deal\nThey did the same thing before the presidential election of Donald Trump and they're doing the same thing now we had record turnout of Donald Trump was elected in Georgia most votes ever cast in our state so I don't see how that spoke suppression\nRight before this outrageous claims came we announced that we had or people on our voter rolls than ever before in the state of Georgia because we have things like online voter registration are pushed through the general assembly\nAnd implemented as secretary of state ... years ago we have a thousand more people on our roles now than when we hit had when I took office she voted against on line voter registration she does not support our common sense\nFederal out the law she voted against our citizenship to\nThe counties are the ones that are flagging these individuals because the information from hurt local groups is not properly filled out on the form and by the way all these people have to do to be able to vote is the same thing that I Would or any other Georgia citizen that his own our roles they just have to go to their polling location\nShow their photo out the most likely their driver's license and they can vote so that is not a hot hurdle for people to do but they\nCan't blame me on their own canvassers can't fill out proper pipe or register to vote and if they had used our own line system they never had any of this problem to start with so she's blaming me for a problem she created a and she's blaming me for following state law and that's why I think\nGeorgia voters are a lot smarter than she gives them credit for they're going to see the smoke screen this all they're doing this to drop their base out but it's working in reverse cause the Republican base that conservative base\nAnd hard work and Georgia's are

election of a referendum on hardline immigration policy hard time\nUh breaking through with that message in a big way it's not been the defining issue of the mid term elections and so there is this sense and you see it with hard liners as a sort of regular feature American politics now that they feel like if we're more outrageous we do something that's just more offensive or controversial maybe that will create a rather I\nOr because he really is in touch with people on immigration\nRight it's not a big issue let me give me some facts here before we get to our guests are the Gallup\nPoll the latest a big poll on the top issue for us voters was back in July\nOr twenty two percent of Americans in July said immigration is the top problem for the United states is up from fourteen percent in June and has the highest percentage naming that issue in Gallup history and asking the most important or when they asked the most important problem question\nA ... again mentions of immigration as the nation's most important problem have averaged only you know five percent of the last Seventeen years the Gallup as an asking\nThe question on generally a monthly basis immigration is the top issue in the United states slightly edging out the economy okay\nAnd goes on and on about this uh a Reuters poll found that Fifteen Percent of registered voters said said immigration their biggest concern topping economic performance and health care immigration and the writers ... was the top issue for voters and the election\nOr that number is higher of course among Republicans with twenty six percent of the G O P voters citing immigration as their major concern just seven percent of Democrats said the same\nUh but listen to this forty five percent of black voters and forty four percent of Hispanic voters each said that immigration has had a negative impact on their community\nNow why is that the CBS Hugo poll why is that because of course they live in the areas where immigration has a profound effect on the public schools the healthcare system or in some cases crime a housing the list goes on and on\nThese are the facts Donald Trump is more\nI'm a in some cases crime a housing the list goes on and on these are the facts Donald Trump is more in touch with the American people on immigration then pretty much any politician alive today he understands it\nJoining us now I'm delighted or he is with US Congressman Tom Garrett Republican from Virginia fifth congressional district\nOr he's going to give us a latest because he sits on the all important House Homeland Security Committee as we see these caravans up and running again with the mass migration from Central America coming into this country because they know there'll be caught in alternately released\nCongress men I can tell you my listeners are infuriated by this they want Congress to act they want these loopholes closed what can you tell us about what Congress could do in short order to prevent this nonsense off from continuing\nWell every time we passed the omnibus bill or something massive funding stopgap measure will yank the rug out from underneath the president who wants to keep its promises of securing the border your lead and bumper\nWhere the gentleman that I use that term loosely talked about hardliners on immigration is symptomatic of the fact that the left as co opted the lexicon changed the meaning of words and I'd like for something to do explained to me when defending your national borders and sovereignty became a hard line stance because\nEssentially what they've done is that if you don't want to open borders than your me ...\nAnd the American voting public needs to think hard enough to understand that very ridiculous underlying assumptions that I Am all for a robust and help the legal\nImmigration system is I think you are but at what point did securing the border has become controversial and and and and\nWhy is it that Republicans cut the rug out from underneath the president as it relates to keep his promises on security our borders I Can't figure it out um and and that\nJust well let me tell you about something that happened Congress man this is very concerning again to my listeners and viewers on Fox\nAh this was a earlier this year when we had the opportunity terrain and these ever broadening asylum categories meaning domestic abuse and fear of gangs\nOr what have been included in the credible fear a categories as as affecting social groups in a particular country so a bad effect on certain social groups Jeff Sessions comes along as attorney general and says ... no no no no no\nA domestic domestic abuse and gang membership that's that's not part of what constitutes credible fear Congress sadly David Yoder a congressman from Kansas and a a ... a democratic ah in ah North Carolina both acted to remove that\nFrom the ongoing congressional action on that so that was gutted by Congress that's the kind of thing that is going to make it more difficult to hold the house of representatives for Republicans it's it's insane that they took they they decided to got what Jeff Sessions wanted to do their\nLook Kevin Yoder and Kansas has got himself in a tough fight and Republicans always think that moderating on the message that got him elected in the first place is some sort of magical formula for reelection\nI disagree dance with the one who rung you um and and so you find yourself in a terrible catch twenty two nobody's listening right that's a joke [noise] um but I'm I'm a ... if we lose the house many will actually get up off our butts during the lame duck session and keep some of the promises we made three or two and a half three years ago\nI mean I got to the upside you know that the Republicans might act like Republican\nThe lame duck session and keep some of the promises we made three or two and a half three years ago I got to the upside yeah but the Republicans might act like Republican\nWell I think again this is the most important issue for most Americans are who are answering these polls immigration is either number one number two and these caravans come into the country if Republicans lose the house it'll get worse not going to get better it's going to get worse uh but\nWhen I said except maybe we'll get some some courage right you see you see leader McCarthy now talking about border security and I'm ... I'm Glad he is but I mean why now\nI fear that there's a political motivation what you're saying\nWell again I I'm not I'm not understanding really why Paul Ryan is still in as speaker of the house I think if you're going to retire or they think Paul Ryan is going to turn out to voters and in twenty eight teen I mean God Bless par and I like um a lot but I you know there's going to turn out to voters the guy who's flying all over the country right now Donald Trump\nAnd Congress I'm telling you\nCongress is going to rue the day that that didn't get the money for this law they did an appropriate it and they didn't change these stupid asylum laws that allow people to be gaming the system and then caught and ultimately released because we do not\nHave the facilities to house them seven hundred thousand people and immigration backlog now ... court backlog claiming credible fear another client that's absurd\nWhoa that's prosecutor for the better part of a decade and domestic violence as a scourge on any nation but it's hard to prove domestically it's it's real hard to prove when the claim emanates from El Salvador oh that is why they're saying here I can fear alien abduction but that doesn't mean that it's actually happening\nYeah well again I think that you and you seemed ... you understand this congressman Garrett but the American people or you know like we we got cities with with the homeless a villages temp villages we got a veteran veterans on the street we have people who never were able to get back on their feet after the great recession or our opioid addicted\nWe need help for those people we cannot we cannot be the saviors of the entire world we can do our best but\nAt some point ... we got to say you know we're here to focus on the American people and I hope that\nYou take this message back to your colleagues in Congress because I'm telling you people are ... are are a light with if with rage about the situation a congressman thank you so much for joining us would definitely do on TV sound will take a break a lot more to get to including an outspoken advocate\nUh against affirmative action don't go to\nBill O'Riley here my new book in the killing series is killing the ss the hunt for the worst war criminals on earth\nOf ... uh uh this uh this weekend I spoke at an end to affirmative action Rawley with Edward Blum he's the president of students for fair admissions which is suing Harvard uh basically diversity has become a justification for racial discrimination\nAgainst Asian Americans and whites at Harvard according to Harvard zone admissions data or they reduced Asian American Roman for forty three percent to Eighteen percent a to a complicated ...\nA diverse if a discrimination scheme I in fact Harvard zone admissions data shows that\nA an internal team who they were discriminated against Asian Americans and they bury the report that's on trial right now and one important point I Want to make your audience today is\nThat Harvard received billions in federal government money they're literally taking your heart or tax money and using it to discriminate against you\nWell how am I so they take all this money they have billions in an endowment I mean they they could basically get free tuition to almost every student and still be a be you know swimming and money uh but this would mean the federal government is subsidizing racism title racism\nOr you know uh affirmative in more but it's it's not just Harvard more than a hundred universities publicly endorsed racial discrimination in the Supreme Court's Fisher decision a you know affirmative action is a nationwide system of government funded state sponsored racism\nUm and it it has a huge impact on missions\nSo what what do you um what do you think is going to happen in this court decision I mean the the the belief that diversity is the founding principal of ...\nWhat do you think is going to happen in this court decision I mean the the the belief that diversity is the founding principal of America a is I mean I bet if you pull people in colleges and universities pulled the students most would would cite diversity is a founding American principle it's of course America's founded on liberty\nNot founded on diversity is founded on liberty but they they think that's sacrosanct the colleges always\nList that as a compelling interest and there are a lot in their defense of these lawsuits are that diversity should be a consideration I think the court has said it can be one consideration but can't be a Supreme Court and the Michigan affirmative action case but it can't be the only consideration correct\nOr you're you're absolutely right\nBut you know I I kind of this is the point I Want to one of the points I made when I spoke at the rally was I I had the opportunity to go to UCLA after I got into medical school and dropped out\nUCLA is a school that doesn't practice affirmative action in admissions and I learned that it was possible to have a diverse class of African Americans Hispanics Asian Americans had whites without practicing racial discrimination is missions so I don't want anyone to believe that affirmative action is essential for a great\nQuality of education you can have a great education just let people in based on merit because there are smart people\nOf all races religions colors and creates\nWell the uh the opposition hum to your point of view and say that you know you're merely your your goals would merely penalize those who have been systematically subjected to racism so there's historical racism in the United states\nA vast we must give a leg up or special consideration to those who come from that class of Americans so that it is fair then because historically they were subjected to this type of a systemic racism\nOr I Would argue in many ways it is the ultimate form of racism to assume that blacks and Hispanics and Native Americans on my dad\nCan't compete a based purely on racial grounds I think that all races can compete on a fair playing field and UCLA and UC Berkeley and uh the University of Michigan and other schools across this country which don't use affirmative action or living proof of that\nYeah well this genie park who's Harvard Asian American alliance president was on MSNBC and made this point\nLaughing is not about protecting American brought by an anti civil rights act of that scene and we're well on white when rights activists who was trying to bring down marrying someone writes protections in American society town and ultimately about his goal to bring down\nSome of the nation that is actually designed to increase fairness increase opportunities increase the make education better for everyone which is good for Asian Americans as well uh your response to that\n[noise] ah affirmative action is racial discrimination against Asian Americans all of the statistical evidence shows that it is much harder to get into college graduate school as an Asian American for every student who graduated from Harvard gloss like her who is a harsh shoot at Harvard\nOr who was an Asian American there was an equally qualified Asian American student somewhere in America who got rejected because of the schools racially discriminatory affirmative action policies those vehicles spoke at the Asian American coalition\nFor educations Raleigh a just a couple of days ago so they're speaking for the few who got in ...\nAsian American coalition offer education's Raleigh a just a couple of days ago so they're speaking for the few who got in ... there was a massive number who are victims of racial discrimination from schools like Hartford\nHow do you think this is going to turn out this court decision I mean you can never guess depends on the judge you get depends on a lot of different factors but how do you think this is going to come down\nUh it it it comes down to a ... it it comes down to ... for the first time in our nation's history we have an anti affirmative action majority in the Supreme Court\nAh we have a Justice Department who was on our side who sees this as racism or a President Trump has been our greatest ally\nIn our fight to end racial discrimination against Asian Americans and whites in the form of affirmative action or so because we have this powerful la ... who is a champion for equal access to education for Asian Americans and white people uh I think that India and we may prevail\nOh it's going to be that this is probably going to go on for some time on the federal district court level than to a court of appeals and ah if they determine the circuit split on this to the Supreme Court um VJ this is fascinating are we going to get you on TV you got to come on TV with us soon\nA v J in them now his book almost black the true story of how I got into medical school by pretending to be black\nOr what do you think about this the the it's racial bean counting and the words of some it's contrary to what we hope that we would achieve a colorblind society a and does it encourage more resentment among various a minority groups and others\nI instead of just respect for talent and individual merit aid five five forty Laura your reaction to this and a lot more coming up\nWhether or not you're for or against affirmative action it's still important to see how feminine action has negatively impacted Asian American groups and you can be for affirmative action in Saudi critical high rate in the sense\nThat the Laura Ingraham show\nNoxon options trading and bumps financial risk

expansion and how it could be covered and that took us into the lottery which took us down a dark rabbit holes that we shall not soon forget\nBut [noise] we have overcome such rabbit hole and now we are back on the topic of Elizabeth Warren and some of the topics of day\nNow if you have\nLived under a rock you don't know what happened with Elizabeth Warren\nBut if you've gone out in public or let alone just entered a room with more than one person in the last twenty four hours you know exactly what happened with Elizabeth Warren she released a DNA test saying it proved she was\nA Cherokee Indian it proved that she was one one thousand twenty four may be\nNative American that the stand in for the example was something from a South American country and not an Indian after all and then if we continue to go further down the list the Cherokee Nation came out and just bashed Elizabeth Warren and now this is where we find ourselves\nAnd of course she'd been requested a million dollars for from President Trump because the claim\nThat was made back during the twenty sixteen election where he said something like if you can verify\nThat you are a Native American I'll give you one million dollars and cents she could only verify\nThat she was one one thousand twenty fourth Native American I say that he gives her one one thousand twenty fourth of a million dollars which is nine hundred dollars\nI like Ben Shapiro's approach of getting one of those publishers clearinghouse checks and bringing it up with nine hundred dollars and just presenting it to her but we'll get into a little

we\nGot some other stuff to talk about specifically where I Want to start today are my favorite story that's come out in a long time so\nGovernor Ivey has a PR team that's just swinging for the fences these days and sometimes they do phenomenally\nA and they release really good ads and other times they release the ads that are kind of funny and I think this one was supposed to be kind of funny but I'm going to be honest the first time I watched it I thought that it was a spoof I thought it was a parity ad and it's\nKay Ivey she released this on her Twitter I Believe it was yesterday let's check that date yes it was yesterday she released it on Twitter yesterday afternoon she said after God Country and family there are two things I Love the state of Alabama\nAnd my dog there and so we've got the audio from that right now just because it's so beautiful and if you need to laugh to start your morning well here's where you'll find it\nAfter God's Country and family there are two things at the state of Alabama my dog\nBear I go to work every day looking to grow jobs improve education my doubt buyer\nAnd make Alabama anyway acting\nBecause just like bear\nYou like family to me right mayor the mayor says yes\nI'm Kay Ivey and I'm proud to be your gum in a chaotic ...\nSo there are ... that makes me laugh first and foremost it's definitely the part it I've watched this ad probably a hundred times at this point the the ad has about two thousand seven hundred views and I'm probably one hundred of those views because I've watched this over and over and over again\nAnd it's just so funny\nBecause the first thing she says rate is I Love I Love God and country and my dog buyer\nAnd that's kind of funny you know she said she could she sounds really southern there that's fine we all sound southern we live in the state of Alabama it just comes with the territory but if we continue to go further down my favorite line is you can't see it but she perks up\nShe starts smile and laugh and she goes by her says yes and there is nothing funnier to me\nThat there are a few things funny to me in this world than that but I Do want to say the the ad itself was funny because that let's go back to the ... my favorite part\nTo come home Dylan helped me out that audio man\nThings out of the state of Alabama my dog\nBear I go to work every day looking to grow jobs\nShe said I go to work every day looking to grow jobs and they cut to video of a factory cool works ... got it\nImprove education improve education they go to a classroom got it\nUm and they are you serious we have never

that try to take over the world\nYou see that's what I was thinking well one's called pinky than it had some makeup tested on it right and it turns pink and one's called the brain than it had like some some human genome serum or something shot into it to make it a little bit smarter and then there's where we find ourselves in that cartoon\nYou got to check it out it's it's hysterical [laughter] but I also want\nTo add that uh I Would I agree with you I Would like to see gay I Me out and about more in that community yeah but that that is that is the way things are going to either all or not\nWhich is an how it's supposed to be but it definitely is driven by the times and it's kinda sad to see there\nThere were the days where okay even if she doesn't debate you know she's out in the community making speeches every other day that's how it's supposed to be but that's just not how it's been it's just kind of like we're going to vote for somebody that's behind closed doors and we're going to listen to what their PR person says\nYeah well I just wanted to say thank you all keep you know what you're doing love y'all have a good day\nHave a great day as well Chris appreciate and love you\nWell I just wanted to say thank you all keep you know what you're doing a lot of y'all have a good day\nYou have a great day as well Chris appreciate and love you to God Bless eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three is the number to join the conversation eight six six by five one\nNinety nine thirty three\nDo and you got a hair cut I Can't focus on the news you get a haircut yeah last like four inches of here I Know you did it do you feel lighter because you look lighter like not that you looked heavy before because you didn't look heavy\nBut [laughter] I'm digging my cell phone and I I I'm not calling you fat man I'm saying when somebody has a lot of hair it's a little more weight that's put on them\nRight right right 'cause when you're not at all often have you ever see um sweeping up whenever you're going to regret\nThat is nasty and then they have like a full head of hair on their unlike a bald guy could use that but it's like all different shades and so that that ... hair and another of it is like ... like a horse hair\nDonnelly no sense of my hair is really sick rather dry\nWhen they think he's the only K. or a Q\nYes yes okay and it's ... it's also very ... very wire or yeah or efficient once it gets dry and the uh the hairdresser actually made a comment that as much as hair she cut off she can make a small rabbit [laughter] well\nYou look like you love from white man and that's what as soon as I came into the first thing I recognize because it looks good it looks good but it also is a hundred thousand times shorter\nThan it normally is and I don't know it just you look I'm not calling you heavy I wasn't saying your fat before even though that's by far my favorite word ... English language heavy not to fat shame it's just a fun word to say\nTry it heavy say it with me now ... is the one more time heavy it just feels great but if you're heavy [laughter] [noise]\nBut it did look like you had a lot of hair cut off any look you look kind of older which is weird because usually when you cut a lot of hair off whether it be on your face or on your head usually makes you look younger you look older with this or that\nYou're getting my hair cut short makes me look older you shave my beard off on the other hand makes me look like Twenty years younger\nYeah but you look like you're coming in and you're about to ask you if I Need help with my taxes like that's how you look right now you looked like solid thirty five at this point\nI mean I Can't help you with your taxes good\nBecause I have no idea what I'm doing eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three will start to these phones is go James on line one James how you doing\nA pretty good uh independent voter mhm but you know the Democrats tissues socialism and stuff like that I've been voting Republican running you know all the time if I was ... you know I\nVery shows for socialism or as a candidate I probably ... or\nA mental I I think that all of the study that happening anytime soon\nYeah neither do I I'm In the same boat as he though James\nBut uh I heard you say you know you're up mhm\nIn one town\nFor air steps is there that are you there are a ... in your Republican\nYeah if I said that's not my typical phraseology I like to say but I lean right on most issues that you typically choose policy over partisanship and I tried to serve it up and not Republican because I think there's okay smokers are\nGood of an actor to watch\nPolicy over partisanship and I try to sort of urban not Republican because I think there's okay smoke or\nThat good a band I could have been and what you said as well I don't know it's been a while but yeah but the thing is\nKay Ivey issues I crochet issues are conservative Republican yeah\nYou know that's why she claims to be in a and you said are you on that are just started getting on TV and Miller and tell her water agenda is my thing is we're stating that she's a conservative Republican I mean pretty much tells you what her ...\nAh that's that's not true because there are specific issues that she needs to comment on I mean does it tell you where her bases yeah but does it tell you what she feels about certain like specific tax policies no tax code I mean health care and we can continue to go on and on and on education\nLike education that's not really conservative or democratic topic at this point it's how are we going to improve it and so far I've heard her\nQuote plan to improve it but all it seems like it's something her PR guy wrote up\nWell I just think the government and they stay out of education about well you know ... my personal opinion of where the board of education handle education on the government should be patient comical or anything else my opinion you know\nAnd I know you're in the majority there are a lot of people feel that a government pushes education programs and they just push it from you know ... high up there on the hill and they really don't know what the results are in the education board is going Common Core isn't working but they're basically saying we don't care looks good on us right\nYou know the biggest problem with the Republicans ... standing together I mean they really do you know the LA one little thing a and I'm a little thing\nYou know say well you know I Can't vote for this person and I'm just not going to vote or they'll say ah I Can't vote for class or something of a bad ... vote\nYou know and you know you ... ... ... stuff and with that you know I if the people in our house is divided ... they house can't stand ... I'm In you know and that was a white guy that\nDoug Jones is elected that without power for all that salt had around alone is what got Doug Jones elected\nI wouldn't say alone but does that not pattern definitely did contribute to it I I Do think really more with like our Hillary Clinton was one of the worst candidates to run 'em in the ... passed\nA ... so the mad or Iraq because he didn't win because our dirt dug up Halloween I personally out all day but a lot of dirt was even true but you know over the last\nI think he was the perfect candidate if it was for those problems that arose works\nAnd what we can agree to disagree I I don't think so but I mean that's just personal qualms with them but on your main premise you're right you know a house divided can't stand\nBut it is an interesting point because you're a hundred percent right there but when at what point do you have to cause division because you know there are people that are getting behind a in the Democratic party right we looked at the other side that are standing behind candidates like Elizabeth Warren\nOr like Maxine Waters that comes out and says that the Trump Administration should be assaulted in public at what point do you disavow those you know because a house divided cannot stand\nBut nevertheless sometimes there are people that you should not back\nI agree one hundred percent\nYou know because a house divided cannot stand but nevertheless sometimes there are people that you should not back\nA hundred percent on that but there are\nMajor issues mhm issues\nOr this or so ago that go up for Joe the less with a hardcore ... set it up for jobs because of the ... so a ... you know he lost his job because of its okay\nMhm and uh you mean rhyme or a big deal yeah\nBut you know for me that's that's just how do you know it all\nChanged the aspect or who he is eighty eight years or ... well\nI think a lot of people look at elections right and they see these candidates and they say okay we got two candidates here and I'm going to look for the one that I agree with on every single issue and that's never going to be the case it's going to be there at all they're going to be the case of the lesser evils and so if the Republican who doesn't support democratic socialism is willing to\nGoing in essentially a character assassinating a man with no evidence and pushing this mob rule\nThan if I was still registered to vote in Tennessee I may vote for Bredesen over Blackburn because those of us who lived in Tennessee lived under Bredesen know that he is really really good at what he does\nBut now when I'm sitting here looking at it I'm going to look he could be phenomenal and eight other than nine out of ten areas and I may disagree with them in one area but I'm not giving them that vote in the Senate because it's obvious even for red state Democrats like Doug Jones\nThey're not going to vote the way that their populace elected them to do they're just going to be a Chuck Schumer puppet\nExactly on that set it very well probably better than what I can say and I appreciate that because you understood what I've been trying to say I don't understand\nWhy and again I'm going to reiterate what I said ah it ... back in March or April ... and I'm going to say exactly like I said it you're going to get my thirty seconds but I'm sure the Democrat Party has done there was a lead title wave what's your nominee comment we're gonna take\nGoing to win and we're going to keep winning the problem is the same place shut the Democrat ... go on the Republican Party is headed that way too yeah because you you got 'em\nCall and call him rhinos whatever you want not conservatives ... listen capitalism what is the en route of capitalism well you have some people that don't get rich I Am sorry for them we can help them what is the end game of communism and its socialism what's the endgame\n... allegedly equality of outcome but oh it leads to despair because it doesn't work in a anything other than a utopian society due to human greed sorry that was the textbook answer but\nI Know but the the the fact is that you end up with a hundred million dead yup the men\nAnd and the communist socialist state you always have to get rid of the little people to fund that those who are living the socialist dream ... and you know you got you got to weed out you got an ... which you know in some cases\nAnd I hate to say it but in some cases it may be needed because look good shuts Friday Saturday the first thing after the election\nPeaceful transfer of power they all claim that the ... the very next day the electric you didn't even hear anything about Hillary and the first thing out of our mouth is autumn glow the resistance\nCome on people yeah you know it's like talking to the deck they don't want to listen to the facts they don't want to face the truth and all they want as a bunch of Barbra Streisand I'll say it again and again and again why do people want to be be asked why didn't want to be lied to\nName one politician running on on the Democrat side that is not lying to win the election\nUh you know uh every one of them are what's that guy that it runs that organization I hate taped a bunch of Democrats\nAnd every one of them is for gun control a gun bans getting rid of their for their all all the things that you know and I know that are for but they refused to stay and they purposefully lie running as moderates to get the\nAll the things that you know and I know that are for but they refused to say it and they purposefully lie running as moderates to get the independent and the middle of the road voters ... the line oh yeah they ... why why is nobody's saying hey you're wire\nI Walk I Walk\nPeople to go ahead and call them out as the liars they are we need to get off of our oh we just got to be nice who's being nice today\nJust the Republicans and why is it getting them shot on the board ball field truck you know they're trying to assassinate yelling health care to try to change the outcome of an election because they don't like it so they want to stash in a U.S Robert recreational ... on a ball field come on\nThis is the real enemy this is the real people that you and sadly your neighbor\nShould I mean are they going to vote for a Democrat because then you have to mark them as jobs just to mark nice people want them you know you can always do so much with an enemy and once they say they were gonna destroy you there's nothing left to do\nYou ... you know the truth they leave you know showing it ... they leave\nYou know ... I've agreed with the I've agreed with a lot of what you set up until now but I don't think\nIt is conducive or productive for anybody to label anybody in the political process as the enemy I actually think that furthers us farther down the road where they will never be any bipartisan work ever I get what you're saying that basically we're too far gone but I don't agree with that conclusion I think we're in a slave artisans\nHuh I'm sure they are who needs bipartisan there's you know what the conservative values the conservative believe they're conservative ideas will raise this country and then everybody could tag along\nDo not fall into the trap that somehow or another we got to get along with somebody who wants to destroy you even Hillary Clinton instead of air so the only factor\nI Know but I I Know in Henry I usually respect what you're saying but you're reiterating hinder your reiterating Hillary's claim you're making the same claim you're saying you can't be civil with those who wish to destroy\nLife and we had a Miller and certainly has it's wrong then why can't we say when the Republicans\n... ... they were the enemy has declared war they have said that no matter what we do they allowed to destroy us\nAnd I think that that is progressive I don't think that that's all Democrats yeah\nWell since the Nineteen seventies I've listened to Iran or earlier in the forties called Persia\nThey declared war on the United states over and over we fail to listen or people are being\nBlood on the battlefield and everywhere that to me and Iranian with their eye days there Bob listen the American people have no idea that the Iranians declared war on the great Satan in the Nineteen seventies\nAnd they live their daily lives while this enemy a fitted just and you see parts but now that the guy that just got killed or murdered or whatever it over and turkey he was part of the Muslim Brotherhood\nThe Muslim Brotherhood was in all Capitol building with Obama\nWe got to wake up you know I I I Know I may not be the best bring or the or the information maybe I should be able to speak more elaborately where people would understand ... knowledge the fact that we're war\nI I disagree with that premise and I don't think it is a I I don't think it is a good analogy to equate what's happening with the Democratic in the Republican Party to Iran where people are we're Americans\nI think it is a I I don't think it is a good analogy to equate what's happening with the Democratic and the Republican Party to Iran where people are were American Soldiers are getting shot stabbed him and I am D's I mean I I just don't think that it is a a an accurate\nComparison ... who are the American soldiers over there were acting like it's all conservatives over it it every race read religion ideology\nConservative Democrat they're American lives over there\nSo that's what I they're they're Americans and that's right and it can be in this country we've proven that\nHistory ... Rehman them out of hand with the Americans but if we say we're waging war on other people then we will never ever reach that bipartisanship that at one point at various points throughout this nation's history we have had\nReally when Lincoln was a became president seven status walked out of the Senate and you know it was written in the papers back then the same thing that you see every day we don't learn lessons\nWe don't learn from history they declared war on Americanism on the very idea the premise that makes America America\n... even even our immigration has become a racist a value where they want to change the collection of the country into power only to gain power\nThat is against every believe in America you know you shouldn't be a job opening in this country with twenty million thirty million it'll eagles there should be every job should be built but it's not about making the country great it's not about filling jobs it's about gaining power to oppressed people\nTake the money and then do it more so that you can acquire power for ever I ... I don't understand why nobody sees the bigger picture\nThey declared war not us we walk by ... ... ship we've bucket Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham's trying for years he works with him and did all he could now look where he stands today he's realizing exactly what I'm saying now and he's in the Washington bubble is that we're\nA ... like um McCain used to say about Obama he'd my brand\nI he's my brand he ... you know and I'm just like got\nTo live their lives on the left\nWe all know or at least most conservatives no that Hillary Clinton put out the ah both her and she put out a picture of Obama in Muslim garb her\nCampaign that to win an election you say if they're going to do that to their own and then say that somebody else but we created it ... what are we doing what\nI'm hearing Henry there's one flaw in this argument that you're making every body you're pointing to rent\nIs a politician I'm not disagreeing with you that the politicians in Washington are have not gone to separate sides of their boxing matches or their boxing ring in our swinging I'm not disagreeing with you at all I think there is an all out assault on either side", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "17"}
