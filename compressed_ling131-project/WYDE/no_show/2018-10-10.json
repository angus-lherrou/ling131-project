that's better if it means that China eclipse as the United states but we as a country are more socially liberal then that's okay by them really that's that's how bad it it doesn't even having to a Trump\nIt has to do with their upset that the American people have rejected what they're doing\nAnd if they lose the courts the court is their agent of change for the most part the court gave them a of course same sex marriage that Obama campaigned against\nAnd Clinton said he was against and Hillary said she was against until of course the court found the right to gay marriage in the constitution now that's done and they want the court to do other things like that\nAnd push the country ended his direction that the country wasn't going to for the most part most states are going to vote for at least not then see I think it's better to let things percolate naturally through the Democratic process then you have less to malt\nWhen you short circuit big issues and big decisions like you saw the roe versus Wade in Nineteen Seventy four and in Seventy three ... short circuit of the abortion issue with short circuit meaning the court took the power from the people and decided it for themselves and then they force it on the rest of the country\nWhat happens\nYou know all these years later decades and decades later the country still totally divided about abortion because the issue was taken away from the people you can't do that\nSo when I talk to Steve Bannon coming up on the left is rapidly camping up its base how many of you believe that the Republican Party has the jolt now than it needs going into election day or is there still complacency out there\nOr because he didn't get everything you didn't get the wall built yet that we're not gonna you know we're just not going to show up all if if that's your attitude and you can kiss this country goodbye you have to show up\nYou have to do it you have to vote for Republicans and they don't they're not perfect they don't get everything right all the time but I'm telling you take out take a look at that crowd over the weekend\nBecause we'll have Maxine in charge Mazie Hirono Cory Booker Kamala Harris and that whole crowd oh I'm Sorry Nancy Pelosi alright a five five forty Laurel talked to said man and a lot more coming up\n\n\nOr your word your identity could be held hostage you should be because rents from where does exactly that loses Tom Kelly studio of lawyer deter Mickey and every American suited for from the effect of our do served as a tall order but that's my goal so here's it to the best thing you can do to help protect yourself from ribs and we're just a buck up your computer often\nLook you're a constitutional lawyer you been a clerk you know at the highest levels how how much that he was gone or help decent these people are across the board it's it's outrageous you know the judge Kavanaugh has never been looked at it I don't think it's as cutting edge social conservative\nArea of the law he's very much show what I called the construction industry to state is really a a a a second horses harness what's what Judge Gorsuch and that's the point it doesn't matter\nWhat their what they did with judge Kavanaugh is the politics of personal destruction they want to destroy people that stay in their work and I think it was very evident of what they did they try to destroy him and his family and it doesn't matter to put a moderate Republican up there and they will try to do this\nWell and again this San ended up showing us that you know when it when it ... when when it's needed you can have Mitch McConnell actually stand up and fight and when the Republicans are unified\n... they can do anything I mean that would be nice if they were that unified on the wall and all these other things that the president wants to do\nMaybe this is the irony of this is maybe it's the first woman as your listeners know law a bit of a crowd of being at the cutting edge of this kind of anti establishment\nA effort I've I've no battle Mitch McConnell for many years we disagreed on on just about every topic but we got to you know he he stood tall normally Republicans cut and run the first down to the gunfire from a social justice warriors they will run because they're afraid of being afraid of being called racist\nRepublicans cut and run the first down to the gunfire from the social justice warriors they will run because they're afraid of being they're afraid of being called racist they're afraid of all these false accusations Mitch McConnell with the president stood tall\nAnd actually shut the distance or and I think it was a seminal moment and inflection point in the Republican Party and now I think we've got everybody unified shut nothing but great things about the actual ... for the last three or four days and the reason is he deserves kudos\nHe really show real leadership and did not cut and run a judge kept if they've gotten ... judge cat the fight for judge Kavanaugh his confirmation was a proxy fight on the Trump presidency\nAnd I think it it it it who's everybody to really understand that the Republican establishment and the populist movement and the grassroots conservatives and the Tea Party efforts and all the you know all the evangelical groups all pulled together and that's that's why we want\nAnd that's what it's going to take this November and quite frankly I take that going forward so hopefully law this is the beginning of people saying you know we've got to work together this is what happened and six to ... you know when I stepped on the campaign in August\nWe were quite fractured everything pulled together and wasn't me it was ... was it was many many people that can be together to bought the grass roots together people like you with your show that brought the grassroots effort together with the establishment and we won in ... that's the lesson well where's the night it\nPut a different says all the other side we can defeat the Democratic party and here's the stakes are so high look at what happened at and look what happened at the vote objects capital on the floor of the United States Senate\nLooking they people have given their lives to this country to defend with the rule of law and we have that that behavior of those protesters were just unacceptable and what happened afterwards which is really kind of model that's coming so if you want to make sure that the like the senators were harassed\nOr an attack in the Senate and if like Ted Cruz and his wife were basically a costume or by people at a restaurant and the chase down an ally if that's what you want the future will be built up\nBut if it and by the way you may have to vote for somewhere and it was in your district maybe a congressman that you're not particularly enamored with it doesn't matter right now it's all about the Trump program it's all about President Trump and going forward and that's why we got to pull together\nWell we're talking to Steve Bannon here on the ... show the ah the generic ballot has shrunk somewhat but these distill the Republicans' biggest hurdle Steven these house races seems to be women voters\nWomen strongly are still supporting Democrats than some of these key races this about a four point lead\nIn what I'm ... the post Washington Post in ah the shower school and they pulled a and this is districts as of August twenty fourth a lot has changed since then\nBut apparently it's about a four point advantage Democrats hold I think that's actually good news and it's only four points\nI think it's great news is really down from ... audience just keep in mind when\nPaul Ryan decided not to run you were talking about sixty votes or than it was fifty I went on Sean Hannity on the hundredth day to go ... I was saying it's thirty five to forty we're now within\nThe kill zone this is very winnable this all of that she was an agency even the postal read today's a little dated because it doesn't really talk about what happened after capital I think what we're going to see as a member of President Trump won a white female voters fifty two forty eight which done Hillary Clinton\nWon a high school educated white voters who you know go to space sixty nine thirty one some enormous number President Trump does resonate with women who who understand national security and women who are concerned that law and order a woman who are concerned about the economy or jobs so I think we have to get those female voters out and I think they will come out\nWho are concerned that law and order a woman who are concerned about the economy will jobs so I think we have to get those female voters out and I think they will come out I I Love is look at the trend is in our favor it's trending it's trending to to our stopping this blue wave\nAnd and people have to understand if we stop the blue wait\nThe Democrats are going to turn on each other in a vicious wave between the Clinton Wall Street hunter and these kind of social justice a basic cultural marks on the left tear each other apart and I think lead us to a massive victory of two thousand twenty that's why it's such urgency\nFor people really the focus on his house districts in the in the coming in the coming three or four weeks that we really this is all about\nYou know one of the great things I Love about being a conservative Republican Laura is that people understand it's about self reliance inspect getting up and doing something this is a hundred percent in\nOur our zone right now to to turn this around I think you can look at every number the trend is that our favor\n... uh I certainly hope so see before we let you go let's talk about what's happening in Europe\nI Know you have the movement it's called uh in Europe uh you've done some more akin to Italy we see some beanie there\nAre and other leaders I saw Lappin was meeting with so many yesterday the day before a into trying to again recapture the European a\nCultural understanding that it's been so threatened by poor leadership mass migration et cetera and where do things stand in in Europe I Know it's mhm every country's different but where things stand now\nBut you know this kind of populist nationalist revolt a ... year ahead of where we are in the United states that's what great it kind of came up before a brings it\nAnd the two thousand sixteen victory Donald Trump are inextricably linked just seeing the same thing and\nIn Europe where now ... basically what it is it's the same kind of Tea Party grassroots revolt\nYou know ... ... evangelical Christian revolted just soon over in Europe what you're saying is people that want their sovereignty back to their countries are tired of the ... he was really a global ... organization has tried to take their their national sovereignty and take the value of their citizenship away from that whether it's on migration economics a whole host of\nOther issues and you're seeing leaders like Le Pen in France or the alternative ...

like well that's not why my people in my district are saying they're not saying that they're clamoring for impeachment of Kavanaugh see I thought they actually tried to do that because it'll just me

September seventeenth during the cabin\nAre crush\nDisowned hit Nikki Haley's plan for a un meeting on Iran\n... September seventeenth during the cabin are crush\nThe Trump Administration is disarming a plan presented by UN ambassador Nikki Haley for President Trump to hold a meeting at the un that was next week a couple of weeks ago focused on Iran according to diplomats familiar with the meeting Haley had announced that Trump\nWould share a meeting on the world's biggest diplomatic stage quote to address Iran's violations of international law in general instability Iran so throughout the entire Middle East region\nFocusing the meeting on Iran drew immediate concerns from us allies who believe that the topic would expose sharp disagreements among the U.S Britain and France\nOver the twenty Fifteen Iran nuclear deal which Trump unilaterally withdrew from in may other U.S officials also voiced concerns that an article of UN Charter would allow Iran to participate in the meeting because it's quote a party to do this to the dispute under consideration\nRaising the prospect of an awkward in contentious stand up between Trump\nAnd representative of Iran\nSeems like the Trump Administration was right about this one stay there [noise]\n\n\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments\nBut very few organizers will Congress and I do think that organizers operate differently it's a different kind of strategy and what it is really about organized all and and really thinking about that word organizing segments where people will strategic in their\nActions or we're in bringing together a coach who said strategy of putting pressure on the chamber instead of only focusing on the pressures inside there's really a ...\nThat's a really interesting thought okay I don't know what she just said we played a shorter version of it on TV Now wishing we played the whole thing because it's funnier\nCan you can you can you\nUsing her phrase can we segment some of that James so I can listen to it again I mean I'm just a little ... right now because I haven't slept enough maybe I'm just a little tired last night was a big night\nNo it was a very I mean I'm going to I I had to put the champagne glass down and then go do my show last night\nAnd we were celebrating at the White House it was fantastic everybody who helped Brett was there all the justices were there everybody was there who\nYou know who who really was instrumental in helping the nomination this confirmation his law clerks his old law clerks who helped it was great great to see everybody and maybe I'm just a little tired so I Can't follow the brilliant and incisive logic of costs the court says\nWell I think a lot of it has to do a changing our strategy around got our hands you know there's a lot of inside baseball and inside the beltway as you know you always hear that term thrown around\n...\nOkay these just asked you what are you going to do and she answers\nWe're changing our governance strategies inside baseball\nI'm a forgive me but she at least what I've heard she seemed like a very attractive\nPerson and maybe she's a very nice individual I'm sure she's a nice person she got people to go out and vote vote for her she probably a nice person I don't understand what you're saying we need more organizers okay you'll be in government you will be in there\nBut you see all goes back to what I'm saying they have NO PLAN for how to improve this economy it's all about creating the new social construct to lay on top of the u._s. understanding\nAs it has to be like all abortion all gender fluidity higher taxes open borders legalize everyone legalized drugs pot all\nAll of it has to be voice it on the American people [noise]\nSo like Obama she never really will leave the organizing world\nThere are very few organizers and Congress and I think that organizers operate differently is a different kind of strategy\nYeah they they're they have enough money for mommy and daddy to just walk around with these profane signs and whale and moan and claw at things\nThey're they have enough money for mommy and daddy to just walk around with these profane signs and whale and moan and claw at things like the Supreme Court big brass door\n\nThat Supreme Court video how many have you thought it was as funny as I did so last night on the angle every time I ticked off a Trump agenda item winning agenda item every time I did that\nWe played a snippet of of the protesters clawing at the door to make a point the better things are getting in America the more than happy they are\n\nBut the ... I just found that to be a scream by the way they are a lot of different\nAngles that people got with their cell phone videos of the protesters clawing up the door so you can see like the the hundred and twenty pound guy looks like he's wearing skinny jeans he's banging then you go and you see the woman\nThere's like this ... this liberal woman who's like trying to pry open each these doors if I Walk through them enough times I Know these doors probably way their their ceremonial doors\nThey probably way I don't know four hundred pounds their giant\nClawing at the door is trying to open them\nThis is kind of a metaphor though isn't it for what they're they're trying to their clawing in banging at the more traditional understanding of America [laughter]\nShould America down\nThis is not shutting the traditional understanding of America down about ... ... they know they're not going to shut the Supreme Court down scores of course going to go on I heard oral arguments this morning they continue to go on\nBut it's about shutting down you your voice intimidating you so you got your back in the corner of an elevator it's about shutting down this idea of traditional families\nIt's about shutting out the idea of understanding of American history shut it down pulling statues down with ropes in the middle of the night it's all a piece of what they are and what they've become\nAnd its public schools it's private schools it's colleges it's indoctrination it's the mass migration of the country of people who are here legally who are not brought up to understand what makes this country so great in our in our history\nTo understand why this is so important to preserve our country you really do have to understand why how it was so hard to founded this country the American founding against all odds we founded this great republic\nIn the term rent tremendous sacrifice of our framers the original are signatories of our constitution great sacrifice they made\nBut if you don't understand any of that then\nYou kinda just arrived here in America it's yeah it's you can make money here boys is so great can make money\nIn China make money and you know Qatar and make\nMoney a lot of places and why is this place so great why\nIs it why is it special so we can see what we saw over the weekend protesters\n... protest is is is welcome under our First Amendment I'm Talking about the way you protest the weather it's digging\nProtesters fine ... that protest is is is ... welcome under our First Amendment I'm Talking about the way you protest the weather it's dignified or undignified now we're not seeing a lot of Rosa Parks out there today we're not seeing the classic\nNon violent\nClassy way of protesting this is a ... approach to protest\nTo run senators out of restaurants go to their home is that going too far\nI think that is just rules that there are a lot of people who are very very much ah I'm motivated so what is going on this is what happens yeah because ... and all that and this is what's her come forth in our country and\nShe went to the Alexandria Ocasio Cortez school of logic apparently or her on her own uh went to hers are Alexandria went to her own knows I Can't tell which so in other words Mazie Hirono God help you in Hawaii Mazie Hirono wants more of this people people are upset\nThat I keep saying this but I'm going to say it again imagine if conservative activists cornered\nKamala Harris James imagine what would happen Kamala Harris gets cornered in an elevator with conservatives pointing and screaming at her and she's she's backed up into the corner of an elevator imagine what they would say what's the life what do they say it was anti women it was intimidating it was harassment\nThey want to claim that all Republicans who didn't denounce that type of\nOf ah of behavior and conduct that you were anti women and it would be a thousand percent Trump's fault it would be you know you think you'll be all Trump's fault in this case why don't we hold Democrat leaders are responsible for these type of protest they should be held responsible they're not condemning it\nAnd and they had their\nMoment where they said well maybe Maxine Waters went a little too far that lasted for like five milliseconds but they hold Trump responsible for Charlottesville I say they are responsible the Democrat leadership are responsible for the less the is running the asylum\nIn these protests in ... and all of it\nEight five five forty Laura will take a break a lot more to get to Nikki Haley resigns as the UN ambassador Trump and Haley ah are going to be speaking of just a matter of moments will bring it to ... stay there and\nFor what it is really about organized ... and and really thinking about that word everything

there's a couple of things that are funny my wife works with\nWell it's interesting I mean you know it it it's in saying\nOh well there's a couple of things that are funny my wife works where the progressive woman and at some point I don't know bill Mars name came up and\nMaybe he was gonna retire or something like that and she uh now wait a minute he's like the only one on our side and I thought\nYeah Bill Maher and everyone on late night and all the news outlets and MSNBC and CNN it's it's weird that hey it's it's funny to have simultaneously almost everyone in the news you what\nHannity Tucker in a handful of other people excluded or the exception but almost everyone is on your side and you're claiming we have no voices on our side\nIt's interesting and then also here's how effective it is I work with a lot of young people and I don't mean young twenty five I mean you know thirty five and ... one one of the guys who worked with me who's intelligent enough guy\nSays to me yesterday as it pertains to Kavanaugh he goes look I don't\nGet it why don't we just why didn't they just get rid of him and get another guy and get rid of the guy who has all the baggage on all the paths and just get a guy in there with a you know a clean record and move forward I don't understand why they didn't do that like\nYou don't understand why they couldn't do that you know what do you mean all the baggage all the stuff that got hooked up in the eleventh hour all the stuff that wasn't substantiate it all and said allegations from high school they're going through your book I said what do you think that we're due to the next guy but he literally thought\nWe'll just get a new guy in there and then he'll get a fair shake everyone moves forward\nI think that any other president would have probably drop Kavanaugh um\nAny other and most I think of other guys who ran against Trump and the twenty Eighteen twenty sixteen primary\nHow many of them would have stuck it out and fought for this nomination I don't think a lot of Trump knew that this was something you could not backed down from he wasn't going to apologize and I think Adam though and we really find out what really happened here it's going to be a lot more sinister than we know right now with the with these accusations that came forward\nWell I agree with that but this is just your average citizen who is a good guy who just watches\nCNN and MSNBC and NBC and that's where he gets as information and he legitimately wants to know what's what's wrong with Kavanaugh mhm and that's to me\nWhere the real battle is this isn't a bad guy and he's not even a particularly political guy he just watches\nNBC and MSNBC and CNN and he gets all\nThe information\nAnd it's all going through the filter and so ... what choice but draw these conclusions he could no he couldn't draw any other conclusions you wouldn't either that's the only place you got your news\nYeah man you didn't have parents or anyone else kind of guiding you to the right well at least an objective kind of understanding okay this this is Kevin honest opinion zero three hundred he was a Bush guys in the Bush White House for seven years\nWas Justice Kennedy's Locklear commend is not some fire breathing person's going to burn down to the Supreme Court's got yeah but you're right that that's not what they're interested in they're interested in dominating the discussion Adam to the point that\nThe Supreme Court's got you know but you're right that that's not what they're interested in they're interested in dominating the discussion Adam to the point that people are afraid to speak out and now those images and those video clips of people like Susan Collins being cornered with her back against the law and the elevator\nI mean I think they would have to walk through that crowd on Saturday I don't know if she would have survived it frankly\nWhere you know it's interesting because I grew up around it I grew up in the seventies I had a kind of a hippie ... and it's so funny because when you think of sort of hit the or progressive no one says hippie anymore but\nSort of progressive sort of tree hugger piece lover I'm going to take my daisy and I'm going to put it in a barrel of the garden\nOf the national guards men just but nice that been near is rage it's so funny it's almost an aspect Haitian to hide the rage the hippies were some of the most angry people I've ever met when I was a kid I figured that one out\nMy mom was kind of a hippie but she was also kind of rage fall and I think it's a compensation for the anger that's in them\nNote a picture a Rosie O'Donnell remember the old Rosie odonnell with the ... to ... to ... club member her daily\nTV show from the nineties was there ever a

tree hugging\nA three lovers I think there's rage and it's funny because they've always painted the right as the angry war mongers Gore so Rangel but look at all the rage on the left\nWell there there again their anger is completely\nDisconnected from the overall mood of the country so as long as long I mean literally had Hillary in there and we had seven percent unemployment and interest rates

doesn't embrace open borders open markets gender fluidity and all that comes along with it so if it means more\nAmericans have to be poor but at least where and bracing all those things then that's better if it means that China eclipse as the United states but we as a country are more socially liberal then that's okay by them\nReally that's that's how bad it it doesn't even having to do a Trump it has to do with their upset that the American people have rejected what they're doing and if they lose the courts\nThe court is their agent of change for the most part the court gave them a of course same sex marriage that Obama campaigned against and Clinton said he was against and Hillary said she was against until of course the court found the right to gay marriage in the constitution now that's done and they want the court\nTo do other things like that and push the country into this direction that the country wasn't going to for the most part most states weren't gonna vote for at least not then see I think it's better to let things percolate naturally through the Democratic process then you have less to ...\nWhen you short circuit big issues and big decisions like you saw with the roe versus Wade in Nineteen Seventy four and in Seventy three ... you will short circuit the abortion issue was short circuit it meaning the court took the power from the people and decided it for themselves and then they force it on the rest of the country\nWhat happens\nYou know all these years later decades and decades later the country's still totally divided about abortion because the issue was taken away from the people you can't do that\nSo when I talk to Steve Bannon coming up on the left is rabidly camping up its base how many of you believe that the Republican Party has the jolt now than it needs going into election day or is there still complacency out there\nOr because he didn't get everything you didn't get the wall built yet that we're not gonna you know ... what is not going to show up ... if if that's your attitude then you can kiss this country could buy you have to show up you have to do it you have\nWe're not going to have you know what what is not going to show up well if if that's your attitude then you can kiss this country could buy you have to show up you have to do it you have to vote for Republicans and then they're not perfect they don't get everything right all the time but I'm telling you take out take a look at that crowd over the weekend\nBecause we'll have Maxine in charge Mazie Hirono Cory Booker Kamala\nHarris and that whole crowd oh sorry Nancy Pelosi alright eight five five forty Laurel talked to said ban and a lot more coming up\n\n\nAre you worried your identity could be held hostage you should be because ransomware does exactly that this is Tom Kelly studio of my id care making every American safer from the effect of R D theft as a tall order but that's my goal so here's a tip the best thing you can do to help protect yourself from read somewhere that tobacco up your computer often\nLook your constitutional lawyer you but\nLook your constitutional lawyer you've been a clerk you know\nAt the highest levels how how much that he was going on how decent these people are across the board it's it's outrageous you know a judge Kavanaugh has never been looked at it I don't think is as cutting edge of a social conservative area of the law he's very much about the show so what I called the construction industry to state is really\nA a a a at the second horses harness what's what Judge Gorsuch and that's the point it doesn't matter\nWhat their what they did with judge Kavanaugh is the politics of personal destruction they want to destroy people that stay in their way and I think it was very evident uh of what they did they try to destroy him and his family and it doesn't matter if you could put a moderate Republican up there and they'll they will try to do this\nWell and again this San ended up\nShowing us that you know when it when it ... when when it's needed you can have Mitch McConnell actually stand up and fight and when the Republicans are unified\n... they can do anything\nI mean it'd be nice if they were that unified on the wall and all these other things that the president wants to do\nMaybe this is the ... the irony of this is maybe it's the first woman as your listeners know law I've been at the I I buy the crowd of being at the cutting edge of this kind of an anti establishment a effort I've I've you know battle Mitch McConnell for many years we disagreed on on just about every topic\nBut we got to you know he he stood tall normally Republicans cut and run the first down to the gunfire from the social justice warriors they will run because they're afraid of being they're afraid of being called racist they're afraid of all these false accusations Mitch McConnell with the president stood tall\nAnd actually shut the distance or\nAnd I think it was a seminal moment inflection point in the Republican Party and now I think we've got everybody and it's like I said nothing but great things about the actual column for the last three or four days and the reason is he deserves kudos\nTo really show real leadership and did not cut and run a judge kept if they'd cut and run judge kept the fight for judge Kavanaugh his confirmation was a proxy fight on the Trump presidency\nAnd I think it it it it who's everybody to really understand that the Republican establishment and the populist movement and the grassroots conservatives and the Tea Party efforts in the you know all the evangelical groups all pulled together and that's that's why we want\nAnd that's what it's going to take this November and quite frankly I take that going forward so hopefully law this is the beginning of people saying you know we've got to work together this is what happened in six to ... you know when I stepped on the campaign in August\nWe were quite fractured everything pulled together and wasn't me it was ... was it was many many people that came together to bought the grass roots together people like you with your show that brought the grassroots effort together with the establishment and we won in ... that's the lesson well where's the night it\nPut a difference is off to the side we can defeat the Democratic party and here's the thing the stakes are so high look at what happened at and look what happened at the vote objects capital on the floor of the United States Senate\nLooked at many people have given their lives to this country to defend the rule of law is not what we have that that behavior of those protesters with just acceptable and what happened afterwards which is really kind of model that's coming so if you want to make sure that the\nLike the senators were harassed or an attack in the Senate and if like Ted Cruz and his wife were basically a costume or by people at a restaurant in the chase down an ally if that's what you want the future will be built up\nBut if it and about what you may have to vote for somewhere I Know it was in your district maybe a congressman that you're not particularly enamored with it doesn't matter right now it's all about the Trump program it's all about President Trump\nAnd ... in your district maybe a congressman that you're not particularly enamored with it doesn't matter right now it's all about the Trump program it's all about President Trump and going forward and that's what we've got to pull together\nWell we're talking to Steve Bannon here on the ... show the ah the generic ballot has shrunk somewhat but these distill the Republicans' biggest hurdle Steven these house races seems to be women voters women strongly are still supporting Democrats and some of these key races is about a four point lead\nIn what um the the post Washington Post in ah the shower school and they pulled a and this was districts as of August twenty fourth a lot has changed since then\nBut apparently it's about a four point advantage Democrats hold I think that's actually good news and it's only four points\nI think it's great news is really down from ... one polar audience just keep in mind when\nPaul Ryan decided not to run the we're talking about sixty votes than it was fifty I went on Sean Hannity on the hundredth day to go ...

hit Nikki Haley's plan for a un meeting on Iran\nDisassemble September seventeenth during the Kevin crush\nThe Trump Administration is designing a plan presented by UN ambassador Nikki Haley for President Trump to hold a meeting at the un that was next week a couple of weeks ago focused on Iran according to diplomats familiar with the meeting Haley had announced that Trump\nWould share a meeting on the world's biggest diplomatic stage quote to address Iran's violations of international law in general instability around so throughout the entire Middle East region\nFocusing the meeting on Iran drew immediate concerns from us allies who believe that the topic would expose sharp disagreements among the U.S Britain and France\nOver the twenty Fifteen Iran nuclear deal which Trump unilaterally withdrew from in may other U.S officials also voiced concerns that an article of UN Charter would allow Iran to participate in the meeting because it's quote a party to do this to the dispute under consideration\nRaising the prospect of an awkward in contentious stand up between Trump\nAnd representative of Iran seems like the Trump Administration was right about this one stay

going to talk about everything has to do with Brett Kavanaugh situation I'm going to talk about a couple of things that I saw over the weekend that I thought were\nInteresting so before we get into any of that I have to ask Dylan it's been a while\nIt's been about five days I I mean I think that's the longest break we've ever had from each other you're you're you're getting to see my beautiful face for the first time in a long time and I know you're sitting there going yeah yeah sure\nWhatever but\nHow are you doing this morning I'm doing pretty good day off yesterday it was amazing and much needed day off yesterday so you just didn't come in yesterday now oh that's fantastic that's fantastic\nWas it like one of those things where you're like hey I'm not coming in or wasn't one of those things where you calling last minute near like\n[laughter] I'm sick\nWhile I put it in the ... corps for the past two days back on friday yeah so like I had the option of the passage is not coming in Monday I got here right around when the show is ending a been that way I always hear from Michael show yeah and I was able to get jacks the better back ... breakfast\nAnd then uh yesterday out I planned on doing the same thing but that ... that alarm went off I looked over at it\nNow said no\nI absolutely love it we you know everybody deserves a break everybody needs a break and so\nIt was really nice to have those two days off really put a lot of things in perspective for me a thought about a lot of things to watch this Kavanaugh situation unfold if you follow me on Facebook or you saw what I was talking about if you don't you should because that's how you get a kept up with me over the weekend\nYou type in Baylor cook on the first thing that pops up you can type than on any social media platform but\nI did a live stream on Facebook I'm On I Believe it was a friday or because on friday\nThe the vote\nTo pass them through the vote on cloture right was that friday and trying to remember the timeline correct the I Know the official though was Saturday\nYes friday was the culture of it that's what I thought so the cloture vote was friday and I gave my thoughts prior to the cloture vote saying essentially that what we're seeing right now is on the parallels and will break down as to why that is but if you don't follow me on Facebook you definitely should be because\nI'm going to be putting content up on their continuously over the weekend in times when I'm not in Studio Baylor coach type it in the first name\nThat pops up so we got a lot to get into\nAnd I want to save some of the cabinet suffer a little later in the show we're going to go live on Facebook when we do that\nBut before I Do that I Do want to give you an update on the hurricane Michael's situation so this is probably the biggest story of today\nAnd honestly I don't really think it's been covered that well I didn't really know that much about it until yesterday afternoon and I was checking a weather patterns to drive back but hurricane Michael or is this is according to the weather dot com hurricane Michael is just hours away from a catastrophic\nThe Michael harsher right here

E. dot com\nCountry station superstition ...\n[noise]\nScream\nComfortable arising [noise]\nIn\nSome way around\nNa na\nNa\nNa na na\nNa na na na I\nSaid oh\nCrawling around on [noise]\n[noise]\n\nIf you are a weather channel junkie please call into the station this morning because we are just getting through this just any person would by reading a bunch of articles about trying to understand\nExactly what's happening so [noise] hurricane Michael ... has been called quote extremely dangerous again and it's a category for storm just hours before making landfall so let me jump over to another article that we have this is Michael has already had\nMaximum sustained winds of one hundred and forty miles per hour early Wednesday\nAnd it's expected to get stronger prior to landfall\nIf it makes landfall as a category for again it will be the strongest hurricane hit the Florida Panhandle in recorded history only three major hurricanes only three major hurricanes category three or higher have struck the panhandle since Nineteen fifty eh Louis in Nineteen Seventy five\n... in Nineteen Ninety five in Dennis in two thousand five the national weather service describes Michael as extremely dangerous saying it'll bring life threatening storm surge and hurricane force winds and heavy rainfall along in the north eastern Gulf Coast\nAnd here's what you need to do as a six am it was only ... eastern time it was one hundred and twenty miles out\nFrom Panama City Florida three point seven million people are under the hurricane warning in Florida's panhandle and the Big Bend region along with parts of south eastern Alabama in southern Georgia tropical storm warnings cover eight point five million people in several states\nAnd six airports in the Florida Panhandle of closed in anticipation for the storms impact in emergency officials in Bay County Florida where Michael is expected to make landfall were already reported reporting rapidly deteriorating conditions as early as Wednesday morning\nFlorida governor Rick Scott describe this as a monster storm and urged people\nTo get out of the way I mean\nCannot stress to you and that's the reason that we're kind of repeating ourselves here we can't stress do you how much damage this storm could potentially have we can't stress that enough to you if you are in the path of hurricane Michael\nYou need to get out of the way this is going to be one of the worst storms we've seen in a long long time\nLike the last one that we saw was really bad this is expected to be double that just just take that into consideration I Believe the last one the made landfall as a category too so I'm not mistaken this one is a category for\nDo not take this lightly do not take it lightly\nSix six five five one\nNinety nine thirty three is the number to join the conversation ... eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three so we get a lot to get into the other than a hurricane might\nA recession again is eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three so we get a lot to get into the other than a hurricane Michael we're gonna talk a little bit about Brett Kavanaugh situation we're going to talk about Nikki Haley resigning\nThat was a big deal that happened yesterday we'll talk about that and when a resignation goes into effect and all that stuff and we're also going to get into right now some stuff that I was thinking about 'em and kind of came to the realization of over the weekend\nSo over the weekend we talked a a last week we talked a little bit about this idea that you know I was going home for fall breaking this concept really struck me that I got a call from my grandparents early last week\nAnd they said you know we haven't seen you that much\nAnd ah we we talked a lot about on this program the idea of where you spend your time and where are you allocate your time or you know you you have all the time to do all these other things you have the time to watch the game you have time to go to the bar you have the time to do this and that and the other but are you keeping up with the relationships\nAnd your life that are really important so I made good on my word I don't just say these things and then get off\nA work and go do something completely different I made good on my word because I was like look I'm not keeping up this relationship with my grandparents as I should be so when I went home for fall break my presence on social media was noticeably less\nI I made a concerted effort for times when I was with family to be present in that moment and to be present in those relationships so didn't turn off my phone but just put my phone to the side didn't look at it didn't check it and his dad was in the moment\nAnd so when I was talking to my grandparents we were\n... they they are the best people to give advice because you know I always think it's funny\nWhen you go to somebody that's a millennial\n... I I even say under thirty\nRight under forty even and you ask them about something or you don't even ask them about something you were just talking about a situation in your life and they want to come up and they want to try to give you advice and not just advice they want to bridge that gap of advice and then go as far as to tell you what you should do\nAnd I'm sitting there thinking like in all that wisdom you got you know they don't have the life experience\nNow some people can have the life experience that some people can go through horrible tragedies at a young age and know how to talk about those things some people have gone through certain experiences and can talk about those things and some things you just need to research right there are some things that are just black and white factor feeling and you can talk about\nBut there are some things that just necessitate experience on how to handle and a lot of those things are things having to do\nWith life and how you live it not about policy\nNot about politics not about anything like that it's just the way you choose to live your life in your mind set on a lot of these things so instead of me thinking I had it all together which I'm well aware that I don't I went to my grandparents and I said hey\nI I have this situation right and Dylan I'm curious if you've ever been in the situation I feel like we've all been in the situation of time or two but I got this friend and he's making choices but I don't necessarily agree with but I don't know how to approach it\nBecause again like I've never made those choices I've never walked in his shoes but I Know what he's doing is detrimental to himself and we'll be detrimental to his\nAgain like I never made those choices I've never walked in his shoes but I Know what he's doing is detrimental to himself and we'll be detrimental to his future so I wanted to address it\nBut I didn't know how and so I brought that situation to them and it was just like please somebody tell me\nWhat to do because I'm not going to go to twenty year old I'm not going to go to the twenty five year old am I going to go to a thirty year old I'm going to go to somebody who has a life experience and I think if you're Ninety five years old you're able to say that you as a life experience to speak on something has there ever been a time doing where you've\nSeen somebody doing something in your life or in their own life it was detrimental to them\nAnd you wanted to say something but it didn't know how or didn't feel like it was your place in needed advice on what to do in that scenario\n\nSo yes basically uh\nI did call the friend out on it because prior to him ... getting into the period of his life where he is making these decisions we came to an agreement where if either one of us saw the other doing something stupid does detrimental to ourselves or to others\nThat we would just call each other out on it yeah well\nHe didn't want to listen because it was I was up say how bad go it it was a direct cause of some of the relationship things said he was going through all the time which were rather negative ...\nBut uh he eventually came around and [noise]\nHe says if you try to live everyone else's life it doesn't work\nAnd I stopped for a second I said\nShe said that one more time and he said if you try to live everyone else's life it doesn't\nWork\nAnd I said what do you mean by that and he was like look you can tell somebody that you don't agree with the choices they're making but at the end of the day they're still making those choices\nThose choices are still their own in higher early under their control\nAnd nobody else really has any bearing on those you can talk to them about what they should do\nYou can potentially tell somebody what you think in your subjective view they should do\nBut you can never step in their shoes and do it for them and he said this is a lot this is what ruins relationships a lot of times as people are making choices that you don't agree with and therefore you want to live their life for them you want them you want to tell them what they should do when\nAt the end of the day it's not your right and you can't you can tell them what you think\nThat the end of the day it's their choice for a reason\nI thought that was really impactful because I Know I'm always under the auspices of hey if I see something that isn't right then I'm going to go out and I'm going to say something about it but\nWhen I Am I looking at something that is entirely subjective\nRight entirely a choice entirely and opinion looking at something and then instead viewing it through my subjective lens and saying that's not right am I calling it not right out of subjectivity route of objectivity\nAm I calling it right because of my opinions on it\nOr because it's defined as not right like\nIs there are two different scenarios we can all look at murder right we can all look at the taking of another human life with free meditation\nAnd say yeah that's bad that's not right that is objectively wrong\nBut can we look at this idea of hey maybe they're doing this right they're choosing this path right they're they're choosing a career opportunity and they're taking it and I think they're going to be unhappy in the long run and I don't think it's\nThe best for them who are you to say what's the best for them right you can't live everyone else's life for them it just doesn't work\nI heard that it completely stopped me and my tracks because how many times have I tried to tell somebody\nIt just doesn't work when I heard that it\nCompletely stopped me and my tracks because how many times have I tried to tell somebody what they were doing wrong right how many times have I tried to tell somebody what\nI thought about what they were doing\nIs just a very very interesting comment because it really puts a lot of things into perspective because you see people doing this all the time and it's ... it\nKind of leads me into the topic another thing that I saw over the weekend that was bothering me and there are a lot of times where there are people\nAnd I got some messages about this on social media over the weekend and it was really heartbreaking it was people who were being told what they were doing wasn't right maybe they were being told what they were doing was specifically wrong by people from a religious lens right from a Christian\nLens and they're telling them that they're not doing what a good Christian would do and it's making these people feel like they're not enough\nIt's making people feel like they aren't and could never be enough\nAnd it just couldn't be farther from the truth\n... says I see a that because I mean when we see in the Bible is just flat out fair essay ethical\nIt's a fair a sea looking down and saying I'm religiously superior in the way that I follow the Bible so I'm going to tell you how you should act and how you should live\nThere's a lot of that\nIn the church currently I'm not afraid to say it there's a lot of it and how do I know it's not just stuff that I've seen with my own eyes it's I've had people come to me and literally send somebody that they've never met before on social media\nLike three pages worth\nOf just their thoughts about how they're being judged from a religious perspective and they are trying their best and because of the judgment that they're receiving\nNot advice not\nPotentially help not a not a hand to help pull them out of whatever circumstance around but judgment saying you know what you're doing is wrong how you're living your life is wrong\nThey just feel like they're not enough and it drives them away from religion\nAnd so that inspired me to say something over social media this weekend that went viral and it was part of it's kind of shocking that went viral but part of it's not shocking and I want to talk about it in the last Fifteen minutes of this five o'clock hour\nAnd it's this idea that being a Christian doesn't mean you have to be perfect being a Christian means you've acknowledged you're broke and this and you're overwhelming need for a savior\nAnd I said whoever started this idea that Christians have to be perfect\nWas wrong were all broken and we all need Jesus I don't want to talk about that a little bit on the other side\nBecause I Do think that I see a lot of judgment coming from the church\nAnd the judgment isn't saying hey you're living or you're you're in you're necessarily not living right let me help you it's judgment just saying\nJudgment isn't saying hey you're living or you're you're in you're necessarily not living right let me help you it's judgment just saying oh you're living wrong and I'm not going to have anything to do with you\n\nDoesn't the whole life of price they do the opposite of that will get into that on the other side of eight six six by five one Ninety nine thirty three number to join the conversation again
