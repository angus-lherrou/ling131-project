tasted for myself never have enjoyed for myself\nUntil now and let me tell you it is delicious [laughter]\nSomething called the four twenty nachos and I'm not entirely sure what the ... stands for I

bit later on and we're going to have some fun with it a couple of headlines here a heavy [laughter]\nHave you seen Donald Trump and Kanye West there bro man they had going on in the White House or this week in the oval office um I Love it I have not the biggest fan of Kanye and if you\nHear me on superstation summertime you know I'm not the biggest fan of President Trump either but I appreciate that both men\nHad the courage to speak their minds and uh and they wanted to do that it was it was amazing seeing the [noise] the video of a all these [laughter] all these\nCameras and reporters gathered around taking photos you've got President Trump sitting behind a desk you then have um\nWest sitting there he's got his make America great had again on and he is good to go a funny stuff watching coverage on cable news the last twenty four hours or so or the left not real happy with Tonya but again you know he's talking about alternative universes and\nSpeaking your mind and not being able being afraid to do so so I applaud him for that meantime we've got a Trump junior and Michael ... the a lawyer for Stormy Daniels currently in a cat fight they're challenging one another tune in a brawl\nSort of thing and the octagon um I've never actually paid for a U.S see about I'm not paid for [noise]\nA boxing match since probably the days of Tyson and Evander Holyfield but I think if I could see Michael I have an oddity\nAnd Trump junior square off\nI Will be willing to pay for that even if a all the more if we knew that some of that money was going to charity I Do like Trump junior I was not familiar with him really until the\nConvention a couple of years ago but ah yeah I think that would be good we're also going to get this weekend the millennia Trump interview I guess it'll be on ABC they've been promoting that's all\nThat would be good we're also going to get this weekend the millennia Trump interview I guess it'll be on ABC they've been promoting that's all week and uh she seems like an immensely likeable person we don't know much about her she had a recent trip to Africa that's when the interview was\nFilmed the ah the report will be aired later latest today a that we've got that going on other things in the world on Wall street we have a very volatile week\nOr the down down about five percent the last couple of days early this morning reporting that said the Dow was up I I heard earlier on\nAnd we've got that we have lots of oil in demand and being pumped out a hundred million barrels a day\nOr so those are some of the things we have going on speaking to money big money being raised by Beto O'Rourke looking to take down Ted Cruz and Texas He's re thirty eight million dollars\nIn the last three months that is impressive so those are some of the things going on but really the big story that uh is capturing my interest a couple of days actually involve turkey there are different stories\nAnd this was a particular article this was a making the production that some of us will\nIn the next few years be buying what will be our last card that will drive because automation will be taking over they predict in the coming years and so I couldn't help but think\nAbout the record or that were on highway two eighty here\nAnd um and just think of the congestion that we have now you remember back a few years ago when they were trying to think about maybe having overpasses and an elevated highway that uh we're just going to get more and more congested but as I think that there's a possibility that our kids or our grandkids may never drive a car is odd for me to think about\nYou have a coworker of course what my children are much older and they're driving now but he is younger children and he is he actually said I Hope my kids never dropped wow never have to draw on what ... what I really hope they never have to bridge that gap between the sixteen\nTo Nineteen year old learning to draw making the mistakes I really hope that technology arrives and they'll never have to to go through that\nI think about that because it's already hard enough now as an adult someone who has years and years of driving experience to navigate the road with texting and people on their phones and the distracted driving but yeah you think about being a new driver with this congestion\nAnd thankfully cars are safer but yeah my kids Charlie and Sarah ... turned twelve\nSo the next four years they're going to be learning how to drive and then driving so they were worried this past weekend like that\nI don't think I'm ever going to get to drive a car like you know we're not going to be changing that rapidly but it is possible that their kids may never there you know my grandkids may never drive a car may never know what that's like there'll be droning to work for that is true it's kind of like the Jetsons right from years ago um\nI like that idea drone erode work to work who are kind of ruining here it goes like let's say a couple of out of the headlines we've got going on here it's the hometown tour Russell filling in for a buddy at Ford the Ford faction today till three Andrew and Jessica are coming we're talking\nAbout the Donald Trump and God yeah west several man that was kind of a wild seeing if I Am working I don't know if you saw the footage of Kanye West hanging out with the president in the oval office this week that's why you got like a rat starts\nGot the the celebrity that is Donald Trump and like that is the leader of the free world and I'm not quite sure what to make of all of that does it make you feel\nBetter or worse about our country when when China is giving the president if I\nWill I Will say that I didn't see any footage of any of that but uh I'll have to just not comment\nThat he was talking about alternative universes and it was interesting I was a guy he does speak his mind sometimes\nI don't know what he's talking about but I appreciate him in his mind all the same All right mark and I appreciate it coming by your dear friend of mine and I hope that you and Carolyn enjoy your lunch I recommend the nachos I have the Rick Raul burrito\nAnd um I Know

the history of corn home I've ever actually been able to defeat a single person um I lose just about every time it is is quite embarrassing we had a Christian concerts on the uh sister station\nOr earlier in the summer and I was absolutely dreadful having to take your calls give us a call check in say hello nine four one one oh one one say hello as we continue on here at was the ones having\nWorked in the food industry for a number of years I've never been around such a innovative menu items I started out at a fast food restaurant\nI put them out of business I think my brother and I put them out of business it was called mighty Casey Brittany is here with me reading let me tell you that mighty Casey cases like a Burger King it was burgers hotdogs fries on your rang\nI was Fifteen Years old this is my first official job my brother was Seventeen and we were like the two cooks to work there we had a junior burger special three for a dollar that would like every so often\nIs these small little hamburgers are usually about a buck a piece but every now and again maybe three or four dollars a pack the crew after church would come and loaded for their family so we had to make a lot of burgers ahead of time so people could come by\nProblem was they only lasted in the window about six minutes before you had to get rid of him and buy get rid of them I mean you could throw them away\nOr you could eat them so\nThe highest integrity thing in my life my brother and I will purposefully made about a dozen or two dozen extra burgers and then watch the clock I grew up often hey we think it's about to get busy for medicine outlets make thirty seven thousand burgers\nAnd then we sell like four of them uh started off and we need to throw those away so I was staying in the corner of the mighty Casey\nIn my work Vicky like those type those type work pants and I\nJust blew through those work pants and about three months of work in a mighty Casey because I was eating the product the product not selling the product wasting the product going out of business all that to say was that we wanted to probably do well not to hire me to work here because there for twenty nachos\nAre delicious the Rick Roll sushi burrito with the steak with the spicy tuna\nChopped up to Reno isn't there rice happiness\nIt is so good sauce uh [noise] it just makes me happy they've got three locations and they've got this new one here on highway two eighty and entering as it is just up the hill from Home Depot kind of a Jason you'll see the flags\nYou'll see us you'll see our friends hanging out here on the patio\nIt is good and you will enjoy the fall time temperatures that we have it's a\nReally quite amazing it was good to wake up this morning actually be a little chilly it seemed like summer stretch from April\nAll the way into the middle of October we just completely bypass fall we're going to go right from hundred degree temperatures have felt like to freezing by the time I get to Christmas but we're just going to go just a right to past\nFault but the day is fantastic we get temperatures in the seventies we don't have rain fall day we don't have rainfall this weekend we have football it actually feels like the ball and it is nice\nAmazing thing those videos the footage of the hurricane that came through\nIs not amazing seeing those videos footage of the hurricane that came through Florida at the Carolinas hurricane Michael particularly when you're watching and if it's a place that you visited you know we seem storm coverage all the time it\nIt it it's a different part of the world like we can imagine those wins but when they're showing on television places where you and your family vacation it's like what in the world is going on and then when they say that the storm was\nThe strongest up any storm that's made landfall in the last fifty years when it was two miles an hour shy being a category five\nIt are just incredibly see parts of the panhandle underwater I did hear President Trump said he was echoing some of the meteorology said that the one good thing if it was it was so strong and strengthen so fast\n\n\nRecently on the medical literature which I I don't want him a lot of my life in the kitchen I Do but\nI Know somebody say something mind\nYou're on the same page because when I'm cooking dreaming of\nNot so many [noise] when I married my first why Richie ... data gathered and I said I don't know if I ... as she should what do you mean as long as you said to slump sacrifice a lot of\nMe [laughter]\nI remember\nThe most ... most superstitious moon but we want to do\nOn a crisp Cuomo show he had to you Kavanaugh classmates he brings him onto a stash the character of Brett Kavanaugh\nHe drank the cooking the airlines have like the new mayor among he went to ... drunk devil's triangle hands these actually if\nHe may have some [laughter] I really question any Senator Clinton had company the Lakers now and I've seen him\nEat dinner he didn't ask for a while and see around I gave him a medical examinations on what he is definitely not have a week's on account painted a stomach and then he Ralph followed by the way it in the world around the world it is funny and a lot of books for\nIs was run of the male burger place right near the station but ah I felt so bad coming back to you like big Dave I spent Thirteen dollars and you didn't even get a drink at all so I feel terrible\nIt was all good you know in his logo soon when you go back with it and we're you know it was worth\nYour while well I appreciate you being so humble and gracious and and and appreciative because there are other people in the building who would have made me they gotta pay they allowed to pay them back so they were good no don't do well certainly know that they were five dollars good\nWell rounded Jude [laughter] well let's see the good thing here about what Saudi wants is a is a fellow who runs this particular location has been in this industry for a long a long time and he knows the finest ingredients he knows what it takes to make really delicious sushi and other places\nThere's just the expectation that sushi has to cost a premium it has to come at a premium but he wanted to in his terms demystify\nThe sushi experience and so they've got a you know options here in the ten dollar range it's a lot of food is just as good as anywhere else you'll find it's in a creative presentation delicious flavors some\nSome flavors you wouldn't have expected to put together but it's really really good but it's affordable it's ah it's it's not like that five dollar junior burger nonsense and we got stuck\nWell you know and I've I've never has who's ... who's going to use it for sure I mean I Love you know other stuff but\nThis is ... is going to use it for sure I mean I Love you know other stuff but\nThe way you're talking about it\nI think it's right now\nWe got a track because here's the thing with sushi people hear it and they assume that everything's going to be wrong that you're going to be getting some sketchy stuff\nIt doesn't have to be that they got a whole selection of sushi burritos everything in there is cooked and you may be thinking well I'm not a seafood person you can get one that doesn't even have any seafood if you like rice\nYou like cheese the particular one I had to read those and it had steak is well it's got a sweet sauce it's got some heat to it they have my man we're going to just opens new avenues for you I can just feel as though the scales and your eyes are going to come off and your sushi destiny is before you\nWere you hooked me at the root of\nWhat you know that's something\nMuch like a the cue girl and Jerry Maguire you had me at hello you had me at the readers the readers that is good well we're going to be on here all after name that afternoon big day but I don't know if a are you handling the show later today for Andrew and Jessica are you off at three\nIn the building well\nWell you don't need to be in the building you need to be here or maybe you know I can bring back some of these uh\nThese delicious things that we have a that is good news All right let's get back to the news here for camp or just a little bit I Want to talk more about this a Donald Trump and Kanye West meeting that they had in the in the oval office and I even as a Google that right now I see that other entertainers are worried\nAbout Kanye West you got one rapper by the name of TI he says his patients for Kanye West is dead and gone\nAfter the Trump meeting I was watching coverage on MSNBC and they were talking about his mental illness and he's bipolar and it needs to be an intervention apparently it's you're not allowed to be an entertainer I guess a black entertainer from the perceived to be from the left trying to make nice with the president\nOn the rights or you've got another entertain attain are saying he's ashamed to be associated with gun yeah west after his bizarre White House the parents and it was bizarre\nI don't want to I don't want to act like it's not I I ah but I I have to admit they have I was amused did you have any thoughts on that encounter ... or ... [laughter]\nYou know hey did not do it for you know\nAnd I was ... or the newness Rodman ... [laughter]\nThat's pretty good comparison that is a pretty good but the\nBest of my knowledge I'm not seeing Kanye West dress up and an evening down the way that uh we didn't Rodman dress up like in a wedding dress sometime years back I Would\nBut I have\nNo ... well I've never liked him but he really didn't like him when he went up on stage is Martin ... room with\nLittle cute Taylor Swift dummy come after Taylor Swift\nYou you know I mean but\nDon't I don't go to him from a political\nYeah I'm not necessarily looking for him to a signal which direction I should go but I Do applaud anybody who's willing to speak their mind I don't have to agree\nWith what they say but I at least appreciate that they're willing to go on record and you better believe that he was going on record because they had a whole Oval Office still with journalists who were documenting everything he says or video showing their camera they're writing about their blogging about I mean what's that must be like to just imagine big day something you said\nYou're documenting everything he says or video showing their camera they're writing about their blogging about I mean what that must be like to just imagine big day something you say something I say becomes national or international news is just hard to imagine what that must be like to live that sort of life\nNumber one who should enough because in the oval office\nYeah use some foul language huh\nYeah I mean you know respect all\nRight I'll be going phones Scott nice and just dropping those kinds of bombs I mean it's just it's just not good at all so show a little risk factor I have a little ah have a little dignity already\nWell you know it just because we're America America how do we will write like me like throw up anymore and the lawyers you know but I'm One of these uh I don't look to other people for my political stuff I'll look at it a researcher so yeah\nThat's good to be spoon fed from talk radio myself that's that's what I Want to tune in for Michael art every morning he tells me what I think that's a start my day [laughter]\nThat's good to have I so he had Trump and Kanye West meeting in the oval office earlier this week you had Michael ... challenging Trump junior to an M M A style battle you know the mixed martial arts I think that needs to happen\nTo think back to our country's history in the past where lawmakers win them and they wanted to find they can have a dual it could be a fight to the death I think that's what we we need to have Republicans and Democrats going at it and just tap out there in the octagon I think that would be good\nIn November instead of us going to the polls perhaps we go to the octagon and let's just square off I think that would be great imagine Senator Grassley and Senator Feinstein both in their eighties on the Judiciary Committee back during the Kavanaugh hearings I think instead of just\nSquaring off with what they talked about I think it you put them both in like a\nYou know sparring gear and let them go at maybe like American gladiator style you know when they had the jousting to put them up on the pedestals I think that needs to happen big Dave\n... with the jails to knock each other all [laughter]\nWe need to change it instead of having the little solve ... for them to loom zone yeah district conquered [laughter]\nOh that would be bad that will be bad when or what what is meant to be there for our entertainment goes that did you see this story about the guy saw this as a day or two ago the ... the specifics of I Can't quite remember but\nHe was like a medieval performer he liked to dress up as though he was from the time of the renaissance and he was doing some sort of\nThing on his horse with his ... and I hate to say this during lunch but he impales himself himself big Dave is not good oh I Know right right through the abdomen it was not like people are watching and it's like hey let's pretend to do the job is let's do medieval times kind of stuff\nAnd something went wrong for this guy is right there in front of everybody like oh that's going to leave a mark and it was a deadly blow I have\nOne question though is the horse okay\nI think the horse is going to be fine the fella on the horse\nNot as much it's recipe filling for Ford here on the Ford faction hometown to her was that we want highway two eighty brought to you by progress bank and blunt counting tactical hope to come by here till three Andrew Jessica three to six were having fun super station one on one W.

I'm not a hundred percent sure and that's that's my take on yeah I'm I'm really ambivalent\nAbout he was there um yeah and he was there\nThe um [noise] you know he he was calling yeah and I guess that's what you back you know\nKind of does his thing yeah it's it's kinda hard to make sense of of all of that he says in in what that's a means because he's such an enigma and he does his own thing like we don't really have a a frame of reference he just kinda does and says his own thing which I applaud at least he's willing to do that\nWell it's a lot like Trump maybe but in a different arena that unpredictability you just never know where his mind going and what it's going to bring up\nThink with Trump at least as president we have a little more idea of where he's going to go because he's in an agenda mode right and he signaled what his agenda is um\nAs president and we had a little more idea of where he's going to go because he's in an agenda mode right and he's thinking oh what is the gender is I'm In that and that's a little more I don't know I take more comfort in that now than I did your yeah when he was elected because you're like what is he really\nBut I don't really follow him so I\nI don't know I mean he does seem unpredictable I seemed to have the same level of ego maybe the Trump um hajj and so they probably get along great\nIt is interesting the the atmosphere that we've reached politically where politics and pop culture collide in a way that they're almost indistinguishable from one another\nYou got Trump junior and Michael ... challenging one another to an M M A fighter like mixed martial arts and part of me thinks they're being silly but then just as easily it can be for real you know\nYou never know what part of the WWE throwing down of the uh the guy in charge of that I Can't remember riots like Mick man yeah I mean\nIt's funny to think that I and I know he didn't do so when he was as president but you think of a\nObama slow jamming the news with Fallon or doing between two ferns with Galifianakis and before that you had and that was that was why was pressing sure and I was thinking about um Bill Clinton on the saxophone on our city or ... years ago\nUm but yeah it's just I I was watching the news and we talked about Trump just about every time we're together Andrea but just seeing him it's not that I actively disliked it I Can't believe he's our president it's just wild and not just that\nI guess I keep waiting I keep waiting to wake up you know what I mean the end it's not because I'm Upset with anything he's done it's just I cannot believe we reached a place where Donald Trump is president of our country I just it's ... it feels new to me and it's almost unbelievable even though we're two years and while\nYou have you know what amazes me really\n\n[noise]\nDo you want to do just with your house to address will join us every Saturday morning we got a great shows just going to be a lot of good information on the

look at and you don't want to chase them moving one but part of me wants to only 'cause I Want to know where it's going\nThe the wondering why only because I'm not sure which one to look at\nAnd you you don't want to chase the moving one but part of me wants to only because I Want to know where it's going if you've got the one that wanders get it almost work to your advantage if you had that because I think of like you can see more than the average person in terms of just you know field\nOf vision ... going on a road trip seeing the world that's what I'm saying you don't even someone out the window you just you're always looking out the window like the panoramic feature on your iPhone I think this is a very undiscovered\nAdvantage I mean to be talked about well I think we don't have enough lazy I've in college football held a lazy I I thought the lazy I was at when it just wasn't lays you\nKnow you have\nYour ... your number [noise]\nAll right it is the hometown store here at ... ... the ones I weigh two\nEighty hope you'll come by they've got a handful of locations and we would love\nCertainly love to see you a recipe Andrea ties here as well we're having some fun and we would they get cut off their from Minnesota is pick right back up we appreciate big Dave uh in Studio ... appreciate jak here on location Brittany with us as well and [noise] um\nAnd the wind and the when the weather's good I mean I take it because it felt like summer\nWas going to go all the way till Thanksgiving I thought we were never going to go down\nI Know I saw a headline of weather headline that we've gone like a hundred and sixty days without temperatures heading down to this point okay you know since the beginning of summer yeah so it's been a long\nStretch it was kinda nice to wake up this morning it'd be a little chilly I'm not much of a jacket guy so it can be known as so probably wouldn't wear a jacket but it did feel good knowing that the sun would rise and the sun was set and I would not sweat one time today which has not been said probably since April\n[laughter] not in Alabama at the\nThat is so we we did get cut off a little bit but we were talking I'm calling you about yeah they they clash of politics and pop culture another kind of blend together and they're almost woven together I don't know how we can separate one from another\nRight I guess in at least for me uh the reaction of the media has been more appalling and shocking uh I mean did these people forget that are beyond say and Jaycee walk the halls of the White House do right they're acting like ... lost his mind\nAnd uh I don't know that he's any different that he was you know three years ago he just became politically outed himself and that's all the different ... and it's\nInteresting and I do want to be careful not to attach myself to county too much politically I appreciated his\nConfidence to speak his mind but remember back in the time of Katrina ten eleven years ago he said George W. Bush doesn't care about black people because we couldn't let him do\nThat was him complaining that you didn't do enough to protect the people of New Orleans I either before Katrina or after Katrina and he's the one who's rushed up on stage for these awards ceremonies and been upset because Taylor Swift right or I\nDo remember that yeah you have to aged her in a sort of self there\nYeah I I don't really I Would never ascribed to whatever con you may be pushing but the fact that he is breaking from the monolith of the liberal left in Hollywood and in the music industry and and in the in the media\nHe's raking away he's speaking for himself I applaud that the problem\nOf the liberal left in Hollywood and in the music industry and and in the in the media\nHe's raking away thinking for himself I applaud that the problem is the interesting part is watch everybody else just uh go into these reactions he's\nA staff make right reactions of him separating himself from them and in doing so they feel the need to you know basically do what Trump does and character assassinate him going crazy like you\nKnow it gets attacked by the Washington or New York times or the failing\nNew York right right and it's funny how he\nCould be seen as an artistic visionary and now he suffers from mental illness as some sort of intervention and we got to take on you and they're making fun of him\nAnd yeah it's okay to you know a straddle that line between the insanity and artistic like as long as it does it get political sure they'll let you go wherever you want to go on that right but um yeah you can go into religion and do all sorts of crazy stuff all in the name of artistic\nRight but don't go to the White House and uh it is interesting how\nThink sometimes as people and that Republicans are just people in general we\nOn some level seemed to be made nervous by people who think for themselves but don't we don't we need that right to somebody who they just see it's a little differently they limit it differently\nBecause she she dared to talk about this uh to these reporters and and a media outlets so uh [noise]\nSo does now does our history as an elementary school child is it protected like OSHA I mean is it are they the sort of\nAbout us off limits talent some cute stories about the kid when he's eight years old do I care I don't care if she violated his his privacy are you against it what do you say\nWell I think it's just petty and silly and they're trying to drum up some sort of insidious implication from that [laughter] you know he's weird and so the White House has weird people in there and so you should be even more afraid than we've already told you to be [noise] um yeah I you know my question is\nIf they're going to catch up with the teachers who spender which the spokeswoman said they are concerned about his his release of student information including allegations that the release may not have complied with the political laws and district ... okay so there you go there's the fish will but they're they're trying\nTo cover their own high yeah yeah I mean I get it I guess it does seem it seems a little silly so not knowing the legality of it\nAnd you have someone high profile whether it's President Trump or someone who worked for him\nCould be a celebrity it seems pretty standard and say who knew him before you know he's these this person now she's this person now as a grown up version of influence as an adult all wonder what they were like as a kid and if you're going to find their third grade teacher and they got a funny story here or\nThere that's good enough right I mean that's I'm not going to change my vote\nFor or against whether he ate glue are now and he was nine years old\nRight I agree uh I think every average normal American will look at it that when they have a laugh but where where's the accountability I guess my question is where the accountability for the people actually published this and made it a try to make it look like it's a legitimate story\nAnd I didn't mean accountability and made me chuckle if click bait funny I like um I'm I'm I'm if I'm appalled you're not appalled reporting on and I'm reporting on\nBecause it's one that got killed by the way let me\nRemind you that uh Fisk happens to be a registered Democrat edgy support causes associated with liberals according to her Facebook account right\nSo yeah there is nothing political there [laughter]\nThat political Amy of political arguments political or not it's funny\nIf let's see let's say someone wanted to get the goods on you Andrea ties was there a particular teacher or Sunday school\nTeacher whether somebody from your childhood who might have some stories that would surprise us [noise] um gosh I don't know I\nProbably [laughter] um my my family members that there'll be there'll be it would be the first to go to I think of my\nTeacher and I have a hard time remember I remember who she is she was ... cook I Can't remember if she was my eighth grade science will be my last year of middle school or if she was ninth grade science first year of high school but she's in that early ... she's in that\nRemember if she was my eighth grade science will be my last year of middle school where she was ninth grade science first year of high school\nBut she's in that early ... she's in that really your high school years and it was run around the time that I decided I wanted to figure out my sense of humor I went from a pretty quiet compliant kid\nChurchgoing kid didn't get in trouble at home and\nI never got into ugly trouble at school but it was it was kind of the first time runs out I was going to be the funny kid I was going to try to be at\nLeast oh are you saying establishing or expand I\nWould say establish I'll Try to establish it because I wasn't particularly funny then I'm not certain um all that funny now but that was the first like year part of my teenage life like I'm going to try there's a particular girl in my class I wanted to make her laugh and so I didn't I care what ms cook did to me\nI said what you said this is science so I'm I'm a I'm anticipating this involves formaldehyde\nIn a frog for ... I Would like to say so no I don't really get into crazy trouble it was simply I\nWas if there was gonna be a kid who got sent to the hallway for speaking out of turn for making too many jokes for not waiting till he was called that would have been me at that time a kind of lumps and now there there were no pranks involved nobody got their cells burned by a Bunsen burner anything like\nThat what would this teacher has to say what about your effort that that was a a might it\nMight have been annoying you know\nShe would be the only person I think she'd be the first teacher to say that I think they she was the first of many who might follow well it's clear you're gonna have to go back and reach out to her and and have her sign a nondisclosure agreement I think you know take me down I think\nIt would happen uh it's it's no good here All right let's take a quick break shall we got a big day in ... control Jessica Andrew shown up here\nAt ... here with me and we're going to be joined by a member of progress bank here in the two o'clock hour it's going to be fun they got some good things going on with their mortgages that you need to know about\nA a good time for real estate whether you're looking to buy or refinance ...

I go and you enter into a marriage you and you don't see anything\nTo tell you that this is what your marriage is going to be like for for ...\nIt you know your mind can play tricks on us and

specialist um he's been a Detroit policemen and I'm investigator and detective so he's the guy he's very familiar with domestic violence answering the calls when he was on the street\nThat kind of

weeks there's been a viral video going around about a woman who is\nIn it domestic abuse situation and she made the excuse that her dog was sick\nSo that he had to take her to the vet and he was threatening her life with a gun I'm and she made the I Need to do you use the restroom so she went to the restroom she passed the tax a note that said hey\nCalled cops helped me he's got a gun and they immediately went to action in the story of the cops coming and talking like she found a creative way right to to escape right\nSome time in and she said she felt trapped with because he had a gun he had a weapon she felt for life\nUm there are other ways\nThat you know you wish you do feel trapped there is a way that you can escape the situations right\nUm and have to be creative yeah and and then I think that's the thing because um you know with domestic ... you ... if you'd wears you down breaks you down and as as much as you possibly can and you change as an individual so you're not confident you don't know how to\nPut one foot in front of the others you know sort of I mean\nI even um my my own ... and so that the lady and\nWhile I got it and I needed to get that whole um I

called them up and none of some of those same people at the same people saying you also listen to ... now\nAnd the other people that were celebrating him are now chastising him so your point\nNo my point is I'm a ... we got don't limit coming up on the other side on this point right here\nGoing anywhere disrespected himself he disrespected Oval Office any disrespect immunity to it not disrespect the CPA Bryant oh man just see a ... a surfer this I'm OK off\nThis man went into the oval office and even though the president of the United states broke mhm that's disrespectful some ... wait a minute are and he went there and he cursing in the White House in front of the president and that is disrespect but that does the president of the United states whether you like it or not that's your friend\nMaryland Mira Wilson is my friend when I see marijuana in person what do I say sir or mayor I Do not call about first night I was there was a dog was a homeboy nothing when you and the president of the president of the United states and you representing something so important mhm\nYou want to call his men broke wants today or a black and blue like ... like can you wouldn't come and see you that's not disrespect for an Oval Office this was back in the office of the president brown\nAre you done yeah okay no no [noise]\nSo that was America's you know I mean the previous president had um dogs in the White House ankle bracelets when off um\nWho then we had a brother who ... who are we talking about\nThe ... there there was a rap no no ... and they said well there was a nasty was saying what brought that his his he was in the oval office he was only while they were ... his ankle brace it went off so\nYou want to talk about disrespect or do you want to talk about the president that hadn't gone on why you know a bunch of it is something completely different that somebody's profanity in front of the president or less in the theater you don't think that people have used profanity\nIn front of a president before navy man made me who who\nThe different that somebody is your fantasy in front of the president or less in the theater you don't\nThink that people have used profanity in front of a president before naming\nNaming who who I'm listening because I can tell you couldn't it was the last week it will I'm listening on television\nI'll tell you the Wii U when they're talking about for the reform act like use industry but when you're home boy that was back to the office of the president on any level for any rights from anybody that it will it end he banging on the old the old would offers this trying to make a point that it did not getting very signed the oval office has\nBeen banged on okay Bronx\nAlways tell me this yeah because somebody else did it doesn't ... make your right right okay I'm Talking about Kanye West yeah ... I could like ... I ... on your you could care less but he's not representing you he's not there talking about you and he as a black man he went up there talking about prison reform for the black\nSea and the ... and and then and then there's the inherent\nProblem right there was the problem is that somebody is saying that Kanye West represents somebody's skin color\nSo there is this monolithic idea that's out there and he went up there and try to talk about prison reform there is an issue you're\nWell let me ask you this question ... when president Donald Trump wrote in a white man to talk about for the ... but that's the sort of low people bringing here black people hear about anybody on the coast is just for poor he can he was there with representing go\nBlack people right but but but yeah the city I Try to tell me that he's not there for the black people rather than the present you he does not represent me but we sat in there he makes us look bad for what he had to say you know these\nGuys I mean and that sounds like Donna Brazil man sand that set back a hundred and fifty five years that's insane ... no it's not Brian ... again\nWell see that's that group my mind that that you can call us ... you know if you're black you have to fall in line with whatever narrative it's being pushed out there had been the pushback criticism against Kanye West just because he's pushing back against a set narrative and that's why you're upset\nAlmost ... almost because he's pushing against the nerve to a bit of narrative the all black\nPeople must fall in line and it's here to this certain mindset in that an individualized here have individual drop your anything\nThat's it yeah and it was nonsense to me okay Brian I said he'd disrespect the opposite of president yeah anybody the surf whether it's going to ... no one stands in front of the president and curse right know about it that this was back when you said you didn't find a different spin on because I 'cause I look\nAt it with the way that Donald Trump was looking at him and he's like okay this is going on and he knew\nWhat he was doing a lot of\nCourse Trump use a gun you with that but I'm saying\nWhen you look at it as an American citizen\nWhat ... did was this was back to the office of the president period okay you can sit there and said you know it does not matter ... I ... my son ... if he had come as you look up to this guy and the people that the kids are watching this they have\nTo know this is not the way you perform if one of the president of the United states of them I don't know anybody looks at the economy was was\nObviously a lot of people do because just like when they all live what happened Bryan, Ohio went crazy oh well that's\nBecause he got a black man who's talking to a white man and he's going against the black monolithic marriage\nSo you're saying about it can just go to encourage that I can go to the White House and create a same there because there was there that is not what the outrageous about Joe you're looking at it completely you know when I read your blood to what I'm saying\nNo I'm not you know I don't know what you're saying I just think that you're approaching a completely different than what the ... ... everybody else's selective outrage okay what is there but it's like if I read about that he's Kanye West and that he's being crazy and he's been easy\nWhat the uh everybody else's selective outrage okay what is there but it's like if I read about that he's Kanye West and that he's being crazy and he's been easy and he's going off on this diet tried that he's been going off on since he was going out there trying to make music make money\nSo so you're you're you're saying that black people don't marry him because he went on to the doctor I\nKnow I'm saying black people are mad at him because for some reason people think that if there's a black man that gets out there and says something different than the Democratic narrative that there's a monolithic mindset that out there then it's pushing back that you're not falling in line you're not respecting the brothers\nWere brought ... this is what I Love you but I'm really have to push back when you will or because you're so ms got it on\nThe oh am I because that seems to be the rally all the less every everything that I have read all the criticism CNN MSNBC Fox News every body that is what they are criticizing him out there not criticizing him because he said and after the president\nBryan they're criticizing because he wouldn't made a fool of herself always makes a flag will know so but it doesn't matter what environment\nThey're criticized for him because he wouldn't have made a fool and stuff and he's not educated own prison reform you can\nGo do do you have to be educated on a subject in order to be passionate about change yes no if you're going to talk to the president you know he wasn't given specifics about anything on that list I listened to the ten minute tirade he was all over the place yes but it was new and every ... I\nThink you know he had nothing\nTo do with it you're missing is the point you missing the whole for because you don't care about you and it's hot race I'm saying\nYou got to the White House ever name was there for one reason I\nAm going because the prison reform okay that's where he was therefore if don't like it goes up to the White House to talk to president don't know about\nPresident were for what the people want me to talk about prison reform but you knew that wasn't going to happen to let it dry and it does not matter using that and that water down the process for president will fall I'm staying in the end of the day of easiest say they're talking about prison reform and he's not talking about it\nThat means to me and a lot of other people that care about this and they're taking it as a joke like life ... ... his wife what\nShe's an advocate for prison reform she got one person really okay great I'm happy for it but then that prison that there's not a former for them or fall no\nBut it is having it continued conversation about it\nRight and I love you to do and we've got to get to these phone calls but you are totally missing the point because it's easy I'm telling you brought ... this is way deeper than going you were going to do not listen no I hear ya uh-huh I think the year off base\nAnd and and that's just the\nWay I mean we don't we don't we don't agree to disagree but yeah I care he jak I say you were going to come up to ... three three what my point here is that what you got the call and tell them you can take ... take my side do you think this was begging for any man or woman to go in front of the president and use profanity\nMoment but go we've got to go to a break is a heartbreak I got to go you guys don't go and where you see a lot to do like I said oh you got all of a [noise]\nWhy do we were we were super six of one on one there'll be ...\n[noise] do you find yourself weighing the same thing over and over how about not knowing how to apply here make a print half your feature love is what you've been looking for the last I for one on one styling for just shopping closet reconstruction beauty classes and much more to help you with your fast at work\nJust seen a secret today and take advantage of our radio only special offer call to take it for several uh Ninety five right now our heads WWW dot ...

I Am obsessed with ... but\nNot a public not on TV I Am not going to call him that word I'm not going to say you to house and we're for Donald Trump\nNow I may feel that way some of us may be saying that behind closed doors but when you're on national TV done Lebanon knows but I Want to hug with ... you can't sit on a TV show our cutting you would you you would have cut them I I got somebody because here's the thing\nWould that be the producer that you know\nIt's everybody everybody is engaged in it when you're on national TV here's the thing everyone laughed at it like it was funny like it was okay because black people were sitting there and they were saying it and it's okay let me let America no no it's not\nRun if you can't let that word to describe what happened on that catastrophe with President Donald Trump I Can't go on national TV and describe I'm telling you was in that way but then\nI mean that just goes back to what we have talked about in the past on this show is terminology needs to be removed from\nOur vocabulary ... everybody has to make that journey for themselves yeah but it seems as though they're they're you know we've talked about this move there are those within the black community that want to embrace it to a decent against everybody\nHave to make their own journey on how they use and we're not used at where I'm not here to stand up for anybody who said that it doesn't say I can only tell you what ... ... but what I can say you\nKnow wanted to go and use it on this you know what I'm going to say on national TV show no one's going to use that word because if we want to do better we got the if we want people to act better we have to do better now many different words and colorful who look over that you use\nTo describe Kanye West he could have just a black man no but\nThis young man and Donald ... very articulate\nAnd it was that word was specifically use undermined the intelligence source of the ... west\n... not just that it was used to get clicks and likes and laugh it was used for the context just like they say the M. F. to president Donald Trump they use that word for the exact same reason I'm On national TV I'm a call this out and the black community it's going to give me a heads up about it yeah yeah but the\nDifference I see in this or is it was that word with specifically used they knew as they were going in and to her response that phrase that he ...\nHe thought about that before he went on that I can tell I Do not think that I think that when Kanye West drop the profanity I think that just it just kind of came out I don't think that he intended to it just happened\nHere to saint ... see if\nI Can't say what can you ... ... and I can't say with this young man was thinking when he said that that could have just came up and that's the way he flew because if you listen to them like I said ... but they but they use the word Weiss again\nYou can't get course twice right okay so he did the first time he knew he did he did it again so again you're given him a passing a given you know no no I'm\nI'm not I'm not what I'm saying is when the environment and when you're critiquing or in Iran and you're giving whatever political advice you're going you're breaking things down heat targeted that word specifically to undermine Kanye West in the intelligence of con you well know\nAre not that I don't believe but I think he used to um a rouse the audience\nKanye West in the intelligence of con you well know\nUh now that I don't believe but I think he used to um a rouse the audience ... because that's what a lot of black folks were thinking I don't think he used to undermine because nobody cared about ...\n... it was right now and the black community nobody I mean they've been on here say who uses that word in this\nDay and age he curses in front of the president Bryan again you you give me ... pay no I'm not getting ... but you're saying this guy a ticket that he thought about it and he wanted to get out there and use it\nCut out where it 'cause it's an insult Joe it is a complete in their mind in any assault\nAnd what kind of ... there was an insult to the office of president say me they want us\nYeah but one specific thing you can tell Joe by the way the economy was going it slipped he shouldn't have said it agree no no profanity but this was thought about he ... he used\nThat word he used a lot of word now but he specifically use that word which is different than you know the gangster terminology of it ... but he specifically used that wrong word if\nYou listen to the whole interview oh I Do it right and he use a lot of ... we're um to describe Kenya where that was not the only word that will make up of media because we can talk about it and people get sensational out about it but he used a lot of other wars and the size of the house in we're okay\nTo describe Kanye West okay so here's the thing we got the I'm saying\nWhen you're talking on national TV you talking on national radio and you saying these words about people we have a responsibility ... like I just almost slipped\nInstead of the word of ... it almost came on I called my but that wasn't the word that was ... right right but I'm\nJust saying that the end of the data when we're saying and doing these different things when we send in these platforms we have to be careful of what we say and best because I don't like it was what he said ...\nGoing to give me All right Don limit or anybody else the right to call him that on national TV Now I saw him in person and that's the way are truly feel about him and I got a problem with going hey let's go ahead Iraq would you believe that when I got to say right but ... also\nIt saying well you're not stepping in line with the rest of us is you know that that that whole the whole you know if he can criticism on CNN of than your Kanye West shouldn't be out there\nPeriod Ron I'm going to say this is like me saying best to devote okay she should not be the uh education person for the United states of America she's not qualified\nIs that she's white is that she's a woman he's not qualified to be in that position Ben Carson to be the head of hood Mm very smart guy and he is not qualified to do that job okay\n... where it's not qualified to talk about prison reform that's all I'm saying that's all a lot of people to say if you're not qualified on how the qualifications what are you talking about you sound like an idiot when you come in talking about the ... the votes talk about education\nSome of the stuff she says she's not qualified to Vince if no background and she's making lows leaves me change and things and education such laws and she's just she make aren't she's thinking policy education of the department of education is Molly is not qualified\nShe is making stupid things without an accounting background information is good for you Brian yeah because the department of education needs to be dissolved\nBrian just because you have a certain feeling you have a position to fulfill ... you don't want when you vote for people you both for what qualified people right yeah OK you both for qualified people\nI Want somebody who is going to be articulate on the issues that hand and be able to discuss them absolutely\nOkay but I'm not I didn't but nobody voted\nIt was going to be articulate on the issues at hand and be able to discuss them absolutely\nOkay there but I'm not I didn't but nobody voted gone yeah well I mean this whole thing is like it's almost as if we're like\nSay okay well on us but he's been speaking on a policy for this country that can have a repercussion its own down the road if they are listening to this guy right qualify he's not\nQualified to articulate the individual aspects of prison reform I agree but\nIf he's passionate about it and he's got the president's ear and the president is going to move forward and bring in a group of people to\nDiscuss this I have no problem with somebody running a ... step\nAway over the fence cars and bring in this person do this year you we have not seen any of that stuff you just put out there we're talking about all we are we talking about what we're facing right but\nYeah I was like wait a minute blacks houses sit at the table president Donald Trump yeah ... ... ... ... said at the table when it hit about ... ... we had no but nobody else we're talking about um jump around and can you with like you always\nDeborah was Jim Brown will doing wrong because he sat Bradbury hold on what\nYou always there are many facts matter ... this is what we've seen ... okay all this other stuff you bring it up is not factual there is no think think there is no other people there is nothing\nRight now we don't know bears were not an applicant brilliant that you're waiting to Joe and what am I must ... definitely now we're not that we're not we're not seeing this of course we're not saying we don't let your line okay goodbye [noise]\nLook at the hypocrisy that you're saying right oh okay okay on who you are saying we don't know no we don't we don't know what's going on behind all and so we can't really discuss it I'm going to burn but I'm saying that if there was one to bring up a specific thing\nThat he's passionate about any in the president or whoever is willing to listen to go okay well let me look more into that you can start it conversational way out\nIn January it let me see this happen Kanye West runs for senator just like you he wins your position he is not qualified Brian how are you going to feel\nWell as the people who are like what is that how you go field well he's not qualify you more qualified for the job the\nBut he ran because he's ... where he said that he did the job he's making policy are you going to agree with that guy Brian Malow no because I Know that there was the only reason why I ran against Roy Moore because Roy Moore's unqualified\nThat's my point\nThat's my point I Want I Want somebody in there but again it regardless of whether or not you're qualified if you're passionate about something and you want it to the raise awareness were that particular issue you should\nBe able to sell only goes out is saying as you think ... was his passion about prison reform I Believe he is when we come back from break bond please tell me go to the computer goes to get to tell me what can you wasn't did in the last five years old prison reform show me his passion his music whatever please show me something\nTicket out all the way I Want and why and what\nI mean for its own owned the uh on the on on when he was talking about um the ... the anthem didn't actually now national anthem he was sitting down before the um they actually called they called it on camera then it became an issue\nHere at the same recalling ... ... well before that before that he wasn't doing anything I'm with you a hundred percent might but here's the thing I put 'em ... and Kevin you go into the two different levels not that I agree that he ... they were doing it on a plane ... more than almost they would call a governor gives right now\nHis money and a lot of his time is going back to what he's saying he's set up a foundation so he's putting his money and his time where his mouth you know it took a while but\nIt may already did how did you say let's say who who's to say that Kanye with this new passion that is clearly coming from ... you know we want to just wait a couple years over\nI Would say OK yeah until that time you're just going to criticize him like everybody criticize are calling ... calling ... to criticize him until he would he me because I see now that same thing with ... I was on the one on the microphone right you got a call economy knew it shut up ... that was the same thing up\nMike you remember that conversation I had a recall the governor gonna show\nSo I'm calling for what it is\nI think all of a quiet time now wants to waste a mentor and talk about addiction in our jails\nOne of a quiet time now wants to waste a mentor and talk about a victim in the in our jails up here okay at their you know I'm a no win situation mhm oh you didn't have a holiday holiday closet\nRight and it was true up you you you can't call me you are or whatever\nYou go to jail you might you spent six months you lose everything you guy house car is\nNot for profit right yet out for as you do it again I guess you're right back in the right way we've got the stuff in about ... what the drugs and even though\nWe've got more of recovering rehabilitation other than just the money yeah prison cells are fake money fast the privately\nExactly and I and I and I was I made a point about that with prison reform especially within the state that there is a law that if the private prisons do not meet their per capita\nThan they can sued the state in order to recoup the funds the law of the bed ... right and that's wrong I mean in in when we're talking about criminal justice reform we want to be bringing up those issues but it's not just the the um\nThe jail reform in making sure that we get recovery and making sure that we get rehabilitation it's all talking about the the the foundation that is providing the issues and it's not a singular seeing it's multi tiered issue and they need to be addressed all at once or else it's just not going to get six\nI totally agree I mean it goes all the way into the court system what color how do\nThey pay for play all day and it's got to go and color coded our time that goes I fight Marty dollars it's about the money that I Do for a fact because I go in the jails said don't ask any any rehabilitation and all that for people\nLike us to go in and mentor and try to help they will\nHave a choice you know you get out you go in and you lost your a lease on your heart in my\nBackpack and say all everything that was in your apartment you lose your car you want to try to touch the pilots to fight or wherever you get out you\nGet what you want to say if you're an alcoholic or say you want to do is they'll get a right to say that when you're on heroin or any kind of any kind of gross you want to do you use right\nBecause you have an aunt no win situation exotic did you get let out what a shirt or nearby and you don't have no Las you're lucky enough to get in a halfway house or you lucky enough to have family that sound a little money they can put you on your money I guess whatever it come to the financial\n... in the ...

but you know there's a deeper thing that we do need to get into before we get out of here prison reform a series\nIt's completely Syria and this\nIs why I'm so upset with ... because I feel like you know he came in and hijack that because that's what his wife done me when he came and went and talked to the president because he was going to be with you and he and he wanted down the process and we already been battling in the black community about prison reform\nBecause he was going to be with you any any water down the process and we're already been battling in the black community about prison reform that passes got lambasted mhm okay for going to talk to president Donald Trump about prison reform\nNothing has happened that we know of at this point or art that has come up with policies or anything from the White House okay whatever group or whatever there has been in no action says then old prison reform in the public or\nIt can I tell you something you're there is not going to be anything that can come from the White House that will fix it and here's the thing and I'm going to kind of give you a little\nDifferent perspective on the ... going in an hijacking it and why it could be a good thing because you have senators like Rand\nPaul Kamala Harris Cory Booker Elizabeth Warren um uh the late\nJohn McCain and Lindsey Graham they have all talked ... about ... prison reform and nothing gets done and they are qualified people who have been within the legislative process but they've also been lawyers and\nThey know what's wrong but nobody wants to give them a time of day ...\nAnd here comes this clown and ... ... west\nActed like a clown like he always does ... well what are we talking about right now we're talking about prison reform you may not like how it's being talked about but we're talking about it so maybe that it being in the limelight for just a little bit ... that we can get a serious conversation\nInstead of the conversation ... ... what the pastors that went up there and got land blasted you know they they criticize these black pastors for going up and talking to President Trump why should day that's what they were talking about and\nIt could be a good thing but then again it could be as you're saying that he's just hijacking and just wants to you know here himself speak which I you know more inclined to go with he just wants to hear him so to speak\nAnd ... and I'm an act we as a pet but\nMaybe it has some effect maybe possibly but here's the thing that I Would say for anybody that gets a chance to sit in front of the president of United States of America and talk about it issue\nYou need to make sure that you have the right person 'cause sometimes just because you live and you may need to bring somebody with ...\nThat qualify to talk on it\nIt's great to be in the spotlight is great to get the news going about you but when you say you're passionate Brian\nI'm not the best guy who knows how to tie time\nWhen I was there trying to touch on you as bad I mean what did I Do you asked me that that does and stuff that the women in a time that you see that you know something better than me what do I do you step son I said but the way because there's always somebody who knows you know something better than me I mean I knew everything I'm a hard work but I don't know everything them when we have issues like this\nJust because you're a celebrity does not make you to write messenger and I do live or to deliver that message to the president or the ... in an on a national stage\nInternational as you've got you've got celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio and that'll get up on the un start talking about climate change and a lot of the fact that he's putting out there are incorrect facts but because he's a celebrity and people want to look it's an eye it's it's\nI dollar tree in a sense and because we have this form of celebrity worship and that's\nThat's my issue with the whole economy worsening it's more of the celebrity worship that we have in trying to make people credible that don't need to be credible and why I roll my eyes at the whole thing\nSeeing it's more of the celebrity worship that we have in trying to make people credible that don't need to be credible and why I roll my eyes up the whole situation and why I just kind of brushed it off\nBecause I see it more as a dollar tree and that's kind of you know like Taylor Swift coming out and saying that she was gone you know\nPeople should vote for the Democratic candidates in Tennessee and people are cheering and then people are doing her depending on your political ideology but you're elevating somebody who isn't as you said it's qualified to make those decisions but one\nThing about tell us with that completely different and everybody doesn't came out\nShe said this is who I'm voting for ... she said go get rid of ... to ... go get educated and vote for the person that best serves you and your family values ... very smart she was not now with some people go back and follow her because she voted for the president will be just because of that yes\nAnd that and that's wrong to vote for somebody because your favorite celebrity is voting for them\nBut if Donald Trump to this done Trump does that's what they have all of us\nAs well I mean they go around Obama he'll back when they I mean that's you know and\nThis is what all they do they don't die from these when he first go out and endorse these people they don't really know them they for the same party yeah so they want their party to win and what the president's supposed ... everybody does what does that so what tell us with that or I'd say was very smart\nWe create jobs and find your winning moment\nFor more than Twenty years I have consistently

L. O. R. C. okay and I'm a first name that pops up ladies and gentlemen we have a ton to cover today\nReally excited to be spending they would you just it's a great weekend overall can't can't ask for any better\nA little sick I don't know what it is I think it's this weather man going back and forth from Tennessee Alabama the allergies are acting up but got a little bit of a virus going around so if my voice sounds a little bit more nasally the normal you just gotta stick with me here but I got my coffee so we'll keep trucking through so\nYou know that the me too movement was started I'm essentially I Believe around the time of Harvey Weinstein\nAnd people came out and the alleged sexual assault and it was good because women were coming out against powerful men and the power of these men had typically kept them silence silent about claims of sexual assault\nAnd so this movement helped because it was kind of a unification of not only women but at people around them\nThat said that\nEssentially this is okay we are with you regardless of how powerful the person is\nThat was a really good thing in my opinion\nWhen you have people like Harvey Weinstein scene and Bill Cosby that go down as a result of it people who\nUh you know ever since it it's interesting wine Steen part of his charges were thrown out the other day um I didn't look into the reasoning as to why what part of the charges were thrown out but a Cosby has since been convicted and sent to prison and said this is doing good this is exposing\nThe underside of our society the underbelly to this gummy side that has since hidden behind a darkness and power\nIs now being brought to light and that's a very good thing but at what point does this go from a good thing to mob mentality now I hadn't seen anything that was an identifiable case of mob mentality\nThing to a mob mentality now I hadn't seen anything that was an identifiable chase a mob mentality yet but this has been a question that was not pose by me but was posed by many and when it was posed in certain cases I really didn't see the evidence for it\nI didn't see the evidence for it being a case a mob mentality it seemed like the allegations in the cases where people said oh this is just mob mentality were credible and warranted and investigation\nBut something I saw early this morning late last night was not that something I saw was not\nThe way things should be handled and this is what I was afraid we would be going to announce this idea that we saw with Brett Kavanaugh essentially convict him in the court of public opinion and therefore a trial is no longer needed I think that's fair to say\nI think that they didn't bring it up during the advise and consent period they didn't make a real attempt to learn what was actually going on in a rather they waited until I Believe it was three to five days before the vote was supposed to happen\nThey brought forward this information and it was a targeted smear now I'm not saying the allegations made by these women were targeted smears I'm saying the way they were used was targeted smears because the Democrats wanted to convict Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd the quarter public opinion and therefore having not voted on the Supreme Court because they were under the misconception that his ideology differed from them and we know Supreme Court justices are supposed to be a political as Kavanaugh was\nAnd still is the only place where he wasn't\nWas when his life was literally being turned upside down by Senate Democrats and he called them out for it now I don't see this as a political move because\nYou take out Democrat takeout Senate Democrats in place any other term and they're saying my life as being turned upside down by bakers or something like that like if there is a is there is a bakers union coming after him making these claims and I think he would have said these bakers these cowards\nBlah blah blah so I don't think that he got political there\nUm do a lot of people yeah do I know but that's not the point\nThe Senate Democrats used this and it kind of became this mob mentality thing before we had any evidence whatsoever for any of the claims\nPeople flew to their opposite sides right if you're a Democrat you sided with Senate Democrats and youth convicted that man without hearing any evidence\nI'm not saying all Democrats did this I'm seeing a lot of them did\nAnd so they just convicted him they said he's guilty he is sexual assault don't legitimize sexual assault\nI'm sitting there going do you have any evidence and then before the testimony Republicans came out and said Chris some sad but Christine Ford was like I was like\nDo you have any evidence there was no evidence for either side but the narrative was such at which mob mentality accumulated on both sides and they just started yelling when neither side have the facts\nAnd I got some of the worst blowback I've gotten in my short lived political career this far and which I said hey let's just wait for her to testify because wasn't right for her to air this grievance in the Washington Post now she went to the media um instead of\nThis instead of having Dianne Feinstein do this\nEvents in the Washington Post now she went to the media um instead of doing this instead of having Dianne Feinstein do this\nThe proper way now maybe it was all tear your outlook because she took it the Feinstein and Feinstein basically said not doing it but the fact of the matter is when she turned the letter M. right when she turned the letter in to a shoe who then bumped it up to Feinstein she also went to the Washington Post I Believe it was three times\nThree times in that same week\nSo there's that but at the end of the day neither side knew what was true and to this point we still don't know what's true\nRight we don't know what the truth is but what we do know is that Dr Ford did testify there were many discrepancies in her story under oath not as far to um assert perjury but there were many discrepancies under oath and there for\nHer story was not credible and she brought no new evidence to the table and that was my whole point is\nWait to see she brings evidence to the table if she's not it's not enough to\nIndict let alone convict Kavanaugh so we should move forward the vote\nThat's exactly what they did but yet the right immediately jumped to he's innocent and Dr Ford lying some of the right to and the left some of the left it jumped to he's a rapist she's a gang rapist and should be treated as such and should ever be placed on the Supreme Court both are wrong\nTo take either stance is wrong you can advocate for the presumption of innocence right without saying that the accuser is lying without any evidence Sherry basis to the accuser is lying there are two completely separate ideals\nNow fast forward to last night or early this morning\nAnd I saw a post on social media and I thought what happened with the Kavanaugh hearing was very scary in fact\nI'm On record as saying that it was similar to what happened in the Salem witch trials\nRight you throw out some allegations against him nobody verifies it and they basically want to say let's throw them in the water if he drowned sees a witch or if he drowns he's not a way it should be floated through the woods and let's kill him it was similar to that I'm On record as saying that in an interview\nAnd now here we are and and that was frightening because that was the case of mob mentality\nThere was a case of where a bunch of evidence was brought against somebody like the case of Giles Corey during the sixteen nine deep to Salem witch trials Nineteen sixty two sixty nine to sixteen sixty nine to that's why I bought during the sixteen Ninety two Salem witch trials it's early on during the sixteen Ninety two Salem witch trials\nAnd they place stones on top of Corey a farmer because he refused to submit a plea he was called the which he said I'm not going to admit to being a which I Want to trial a magistrate judge brought him in front of the magistrate judge and literally laid him down out on a slab\nAnd started putting stones on top of them and essentially said are you a witch and he said I'm not going to admit to as much I Want to trial another stone are you a which I'm not going to admit that as such I Want to trial\nAnother stone I'm not going to admit to as such I Want a trial and\nBefore he ever gone to trial they put so many stones on him that it cut off his oxygen supply and he died\nThat is what mob mentality is I don't think there's a better illustration of it\nThere's allegations that aren't verified art corroborated that are brought out and put on top of people and they say I just want to hearing I just want to trial in the case of Brett Kavanaugh give me a chance to defend myself nope we're going to put another stone on top of you\nBrought out and put on top of people and they say I just want a hearing I just want to trial in the case of Brett Kavanaugh give me a chance to defend myself\nNope we're going to put another stone on top of the Senate Democrats are going to come out and call you a rapist Cory Booker is going to call you a gang rape is Michael ... is going to join a stone after stone after stone until the person who is being accused is grasping for air and unable to say their piece\nThat's what mob mentality does that's not how our justice system works yet we're in the state where it seems like that's how it's working so last night\nEarly this morning there was a girl that came forward and it caught my eye because she posted two pictures of the guy and it was obvious that it was a girl's profile she posted two pictures of the guy that seemed like they were taken from Facebook\nAnd she said this man is gave his full name said he sexually assaulted me last night\nMake him famous so he never does this to another person again\nShe posted that that\nIf he did that and he's currently and he was indicted and tried and convicted as such maybe that would be the right move\nDo you take the social media or do you take to the police and a lot of people say well you're not in her position you\nDon't decide how she handles our claim your one hundred percent correct in saying that I don't decide how she handles their claim I never should decide how she handles her claim I haven't lived experience she's lived through\nHowever if you're going to air that grievance against somebody and it's with in the timeframe you're not saying it so that other women\nRight will come forward you're saying it to basically ruin ruin this guy's name and say nobody should ever come into contact with them\nWhy in doing that instead of just\nConvicting him in the court of public opinion so just simply going off your word I'm not saying your word is false I'm saying but we're just going off of your testimony\nWhy not have a chance to have your testimony and your evidence presented in open court and have him pay as the legal system stipulates as he should\nIf he committed sexual assault and ice grilled through the comments 'cause there's probably a hundred comments on I think I read them all and I wanted to know\nHow did she go on to the police because I thought it made a big difference\nAnd somebody asked they said did you go to the police if you haven't here's where you could go and as soon as somebody said that\nRight they were attacked by nearly Fifteen to twenty people that said why on earth argue questioning her experience in the way she chooses to come forward\nAnd and this guy that just said hey if you want to come forward this is where you should and you should bring this to a court trials this guy can get what he deserves right\nIn saying that he was been attacked and called all these things in silence\nBecause of what he said suggesting that she follow the way the judicial system sets out and all these crimes are supposed to be handled because she's within the window right if it wasn't a month ago allegedly it it wasn't a year ago wasn't multiple years ago it was allegedly yesterday\nSomething and still be done\nBut people jumped down his throat for saying that and I think he has a real reason to say that because here's the thing if you make a case against someone and you can't validated right and it ruins their life\nAnd you give out information that shows them in a specific negative light such as calling them the word rapist then they have a case for libel against you a defamation lawsuit\nIf you cannot prove it\nSo not only is this guy did this is she going to bring him to the justice he deserves she's also protecting herself from I live a lawsuit it it is it's a very smart thing to do to go to the police because when you file a report you're on record saying as much\nRight saying I Want my claims to be investigated I Want them to be found out and then if the claims are investigated by the police it's really hard for somebody to launch a libel suit against you\nRight saying I Want my claims to be investigated I Want them to be found out and then if the claims are investigated by the police it's really hard for somebody to launch libel suit against you because you were willing to make that testimony under the penalty of perjury\nRight that is a really really important point but\nYou know we we can talk about the semantics of that of should she had gone to social media or should she have gone to the police any day and that debate will happen to all for a long time and I I'm not going to question her experience again I don't know the facts of the case says there's nobody commenting on it\nBut here's where it really where I can objectively say it got wrong right before this has been a subjective should she should she not here's where I'm saying it did get wrong\nSomebody said I Want to talk to him can you leave his address\nSomebody left the address another person said as centrally I Want to go take out his knee caps can you leave the address somebody left the address somebody ordered hundreds of dollars and pizza to his home\nAnd sent it there was a little message and the pizza\nRight for them to pay some but they left his address and people were able to make physical threats and to go up and I don't know if anything was physical is carried out I haven't seen anything on at all I've seen as the initial publication of the threat now\nIf a claim is made and it's just somebody's word somebody could be telling the complete truth but it is not right to give out somebody's address based on an allegation and allow for essentially\nTell me if I'm wrong an angry mob to go over and affects them or assault them in different ways is that not the exact definition of mob mentality\nRight I mean am I making sense here I think that it was objectively wrong\nFor that to be handled that way for his address to be given out for people to make threats in that manner\nLesson he could have sexually assaulted her and if he did he deserves to go to prison for a long long time\nRight I'm not questioning her story I'm simply saying that this guy no matter how big of a ... he may be\nUnder our law is innocent until proven guilty and so if it's\n... years after it happened and you want to come forward and courage somebody else to come forward right to talk about this if you think there's been a pattern of it that makes sense that's what the me too movement is about but if it's the day before\nAnd you're ready to make a public declaration and your public declaration could be to the police or it could be to online\nI Would in my mind I think you should go to the police and allow the justice system to handle it but again that's not what I'm saying is objectively wrong she chose on line I don't agree with her choosing on line but she chose on line All right fair enough\nBut when you go forward in his address is\nThat was on line I don't agree with her choosing online but she chose on line All right fair enough but when you go forward in his address is given out on that and the mob literally wants to show up at his door and physically assault him over an allegation\nThat's not right\nWhere have we seen this before\nThink long and hard wherever we seen this\nYou've ever heard of a case where somebody a white woman alleged sexual assault against a black man in a group of people went to that black man and carried out mob justice we've seen famous cases of this like with Emmett Till\nRight\nMob rule\nNever ever ever is the right way to handle things it needs\nTo be handled in the court of law that's what separates our country from a barbaric anarchist society\nAllow the judicial system to work in the case of Kavanaugh if there's a case let it be brought there wasn't in the case of this guy if there's a case allow it to be brought don't just simply condemned people\nBecause of an allegation made against them that's a dangerous precedent to say we'll get into some other stuff when we come back from break don't go anywhere eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three if you want to voice your opinions on the subject again that's eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty
