Congress particularly on national security issues you know you sit on the ... a ... a house armed services committee or you know you sit on the homeland security committee and ... and of course importantly here in Alabama\nOn agriculture or you know we'd go to a lot to talk about congressman um you know there's a part bombing is is a a caravan coming up from Mexico or your first impressions with a member of armed services on what we're seeing on the uh on this arrest today\nWell I was fully expecting them to have him arrested within twenty four to forty eight hours I've seen the FBI before or do this do their thing when it comes to ... collecting evidence on these kind of suspects\nThey are really phenomenally good at it and uh I expected they were catching quickly\nMy guess is they knew who he was yesterday and we're just watching to see if there's anybody else involved they are bringing in but I it was impressive the way they got him I'm I'm anxious to find out more about uh what was going on with him but my guess is there some mental health issues what usually we find to be the case\nYou know not wanting to give you know give away the farm here how does the FBI you know this is an extraordinary how does the FBI or mobilize so quickly and roll someone like this up so fast\nThey have just built a a a pattern over the years of of knowing exactly what they're looking for immediately and collecting that evidence I in this case this guy gave so much of it\nOr by having these unexploded bombs which is just to give them of abundance of information you know they they demonstrated several years ago um that here in Alabama that was a fellow that\nSent a letter to my office to senator uh\nShelby's office and I I think Senator Sessions I Can't remember I Know she'll be in may and one other one uh with some white powder novel loans and when the staff open them in our district offices or the pattern came out and there's a letter saying I Hope you're down this road you know the hazmat grooves had to come in at\nOpen them in our district offices or the powder came out and it was a letter saying I Hope you down there should ... you know the hazmat grooves had to come in they had to empty the courthouses and\nUh but bottom line was the the letters had no return address or nothing but a stamp an address to the office right it was just that they were able to track the fell down\nA little longer but they track I liken figures DNA from the on below rod while they're standing up or something of that nature I don't again I don't know how how exactly it's all like in the same but he's in prison I mean they found him I think he found him in Missouri somewhere like that\nThat is amazing is that when you think about it\nYeah I mean by that because I was so impressed by how they they were able to capture that probably would much less evidence and this guy gave I run a finding fast\nUh but you know there's a lot of of technology now that we in the homeland since we've stood up the homeland security department that we used to monitor what packages move around the country\nI knew that would be deployed and in fact it did turn out to be deployed a we have a lot of camera systems now they did not exist Fifteen Years ago so there's a lot of things are able to grow together to be able to isolate somebody like this and find out who they are\nTrue the as though we could do a whole lot more and I'd been urging that no one of the things they do in a in London\nIs everywhere they go you get when you're out in public you know their writers these these and and those things turned out to be in value but when they had the subway bombing they catch all cost ya that within hours\nI think that particularly in our in our major urban areas especially we should have that because when you're out in public you should not have no expectation of privacy right\nIncome and that's one of my things people are always jumping up and down and ... my parents are jumping up and down well its privacy this property that well I'm Sorry uh I don't want to get blown up by some crazy Islamist when I'm coming out of a bus stop\nOr not I'm quite happy I'm not doing anything bad I don't care if they see me going into the polite\nYeah no I ... I Believe if you're in your whole or in your business if you do have in the show takes in the privacy but once you go out into the public domain there is no expectation of privacy so nobody should have concerns about a closed circuit cameras\nUp particularly in this day and age of of terrorism and again particularly when you're in major metropolitan areas where it's been proven this is where the terrorists are going to go for the major impacts able to get international\nCovered the biggest self the saga and the folks that are jumping up and down to the same ones that post pictures of their kids in the vacations and where they are all the time and not at home and the kids doing this and that uh there is no expectation of privacy anymore\nNo not in public shouldn't be a so anyways my whole and that's one of the things we've ... we've been pushing along and we're we're making slow progress on the homeland security committee but I'd like to see us make a lot more progress on that front because where do we like it or not we're going to have more attacks in the future yeah we've ... we've seen that a\nA ... where it comes to a terrorist attacks domestically around the world the terrorists to have started to move away from just a airlines and they started to move to what we call soft target yes revenue for concerts\nMajor uh games and such and stadiums are it's much easier to get a truck close to one of those being used and blow it up than it is to try to get a bomb on a plane so we need to adjust and start recognizing adapt and start recognize that we've got to take better care of soft targets\nRight and then he says it could happen if the terrorists don't down they win the Superbowl every time they carry an attack like a nine eleven kind of ...\nCare of soft targets right and then he does it could happen to the\nTerrorists don't now they do when the super bowl every time they carry on the attack like a nine eleven kind of attack they just need to inflict pain and Hanks and uh so I'm I'm fear in the in in ...\nPlus Cal terrorism as far as I was here in our hearts\nThey want to change it and they want to have an economic impact on this they want to get us to stop doing some of the things that we do to keep our economy moving so are we just have to be thinking round the curve about where to go when what could be be next to try to do some things that are a responsible to make sure we protect these kind of targets that we anticipate than\nYou know we'll sit down congressman you're also you serve as we mentioned on the Herman Herman Security Committee or\nImmigration illegal immigration that's a ... I don't know it's a bug Barack much of the folks listening to the show a\nLet's talk about these invasion caravan or as as NPR always calls this a migrants caravan I mean give me a break you know it's thousands of people what can the administration what can the United states do to stop these illegals coming into the country\nWell I think what the president is already started that's moving the national guard troops down to the border uh he this has been a a tactic that's been deployed by previous administrations is nothing unique to this president rock Obama did it when it was necessary\nUm I think the ... president needs to move as many National Guard troops I'm now down there if he thinks is necessary to prevent them from getting in the country\nAnd to send a signal to the rest of the world don't try this we're not going to let it be successful ... one of the things I'm hopeful that we will see a and and what happens when they send the national guard at the national guard and losing to support capacity and freeze up a border patrol agents\nFrom their administrative another responsibility so they can actually moved to the border\nTo keep the illegals out\nRight so a National Guard type up like violence and admin and a lot of anger out\nYou'd be absolutely stunned how many trained border patrol agents are sitting at a desk ... down in Arizona and New Mexico and California these are highly trained highly qualified skilled law enforcement professionals pushing paper are working on cars that means you're trying\nTo keep them working as it's insane but what will happen is the ... the national guard will relieve them and those responsibilities what it's deep breathing detainees\nOr just any other administration possibility so that all the border patrol agents can move down to their law enforcement role of protecting the border but what I Want to see us to do is\nStop as many of these people from being able to get in\nAnd a starring in and being trained to be able to say the magic word so they get to stay in the country are you still there hearing occurs which may never happen congressman can we get you to just hang on the phone for one more minute and we'll come back to on the other end of the strike because I really liked to have this little more\nNow Congress when we got a couple of coal Cola's that have been waiting to throw question to you I think we've got a totally on the laws that rugby dive yeah tally going hey buddy\nHey they're a congressman Rogers can you hear me I Can't hear\nOkay well go ahead ... will [laughter] overlay them a question\nAll right I Want to say the congressman Rogers punishment I like you I I like how you suggested that Edward Snowden should be put on a kill list I like how you said that when you were carrying the intelligence committee that the NSA can't violate your privacy right if you don't know your ... Raja being violated and I like how when the uh laws proposed\nThat said the government should be able to get all the information from Facebook and Twitter and Google they want to and the Google and Facebook and Twitter could violate the privacy agreements with a user without legal recourse you said that people arguing against that the system deals where just fourteen year olds in their basement\nSo I like the way you do that also like what are your wife works for a contract that I didn't see the benefits from all this\nI just wanted to say thank you for being on the air today\nWell thanks for the call and unfortunately your caller has me confused with Mike Rogers of Michigan who retired two terms ago oh he's still watch you know\n[laughter]\nAh we do we have another call and they're big dive or buy a car goes on there or have your own mayor was Margaret Rogers ... represented my grown\nThank you so representative Rogers my\nThere was Margaret Rogers ... represented my grown\nThank you so representative Rogers my understanding is the number of people that are currently in this caravan is probably about one percent of what we already taught at the border this year\nI mean we're we're somewhere around four hundred thousand that have been taught so far this year aren't we\nI I really couldn't tell you the number of ... it's a large number yes\nIs there a way to put me through so you can hear me\nNow he said he he can't tell you what\nThe number is right now ...\nOh okay so I Want to say maybe a couple of weeks ago I was reading that so far have entered on the order of four hundred thousand or this year\nThat was what I Do I've heard that do Clark thanks very ... I got a question for where Mr Rogers\nHow can we\nWas not having the wall and everything and they use this caravan is coming up once they step over here we have to take care of them correct\nOnce we let them in yes that's exactly right here's one of the things give you an example\nWe have somebody that that we capture that comes across the say they come across the river and in Texas and we capture them we take 'em to do the briefing center and and the brief them if while we have them at the D. briefing center they say\nI'm much yes I've got shift things we have to take them to the hospital and if it turns out they're having a heart attack we have to pay for their heart surgery or whatever it has to be done to them and not only pay for all that we have to keep ... agent within twenty four hours a day while they're in the hospital we\nMove really saying absolutely you you have somebody come across a woman that comes across as nine months pregnant and then while she's over while she's in our detention facility she says I think I'm starting to go into labor we have to take her to the hospital we have to pay for the birth of that baby all this I mean it's you and there's no records and I\nWe didn't his owner and what they call an anchor baby congressman\nAs an ... an exactly becomes an anchor baby was that babies born here under the way the law is being interpreted even though the baby was here with a new legal mother and the womb of an illegal mother or that becomes the United states citizen and then all of a sudden the entire family can come over and a good that it\nIs and is anchored by the Indiana's and I know is insane and saying\nYou know we're the only industrialized country on the planet does that rise let's say let's say that\nThat my wife and I went to a Paris and my wife was eight months pregnant we were over there visiting for for Ninety Days and she delivered a baby while we were there\nFrance would not recognize it as a that would be a United States citizen that just happened to be visiting over there right in our country you're you're a citizen if you were born here even if it's illegal parents can we just change that low\nWe've tried Democrats fight it left and right\nThat is that is not so I didn't quite realize that now congressman or do we bring came here I did something or just have to talk to you about and I was going to get big guy to play the star wars thing but I don't think we've got to you\nYou you you're the sub committee chair of the strategic forces subcommittee on has 'cause I'm not mistaken as correct can you talk to me about like I just saw the report coming out this week I think from the Pentagon signed that they've got their\nThis is subcommittee on has 'cause I'm not mistaken that's correct can you talk to me about like I just saw the report coming out this week I think from the Pentagon signed that they've got their path forward for the spice voice or can you talk to me about where that stands do I need to get you know the ... or or what what do we need to do here\nThat's funny yeah a lot of people have had fun with this because Trump came out or did it and all of a sudden people thought were trying to create a star trek kind of it\nHas nothing to do with that this is all about national security satellites which we have are heavily dependent on to fight and win wars or people think that the GPS system is up there for their ... to be able to tell them how to get to the local hearty restaurant\n[laughter] the Ritz up\nThere it's a military satellites constellation that's up there to guide missiles moved troops do a lot of things the timing of but most people don't realize they're using a military satellites Curtis United States government uh but that's up there to fight and win wars we have satellite constellations\nThat look for a ICBM launch is uh when we when the President Trump sent over those cruise missiles to hit that Syrian airport and take out those warehouses that were store and chemical weapons those missiles were guided by our satellite systems\nSo bottom line is we have become heavily dependent on satellite systems for command and control of nuclear weapons enterprise for a whole host military\nI mean ... that he's a enterprise rowing we'd have to protect them because both China and Russia have realized how dependent we are and they developed all fenced it capability that can disable are in some cases destroy our satellite satellite and we have fallen behind in in in that\nEndeavor and allowed them to to not only catch up with is their own path to surpass us what our armed services committee came out with on a bipartisan completely nonpartisan basis is\nWe have to restructure our military to be able to deal with that threat and the owner or we can do it is to pull those existing space professionals out of the air force army and navy mhm into their separate service where they single mission to be dominant space\nWell this is no different from when you know the air force was created out of the U.S army apples\nThat's exactly right Seventy years ago it was it became obvious that the army which was a terrestrial force would never popular up a properly nurture fund and develop this air mission right so the Congress forced them to just pull it out into separate service\nThe same things happening now the air force is not properly nurturing the space mission so we're forcing them to separate that out into a separate ...\nDifferent at all they're playing golf that's why congressman [laughter] well my air force and I'm an ex navy guy and all my air force or colleagues just seem to play golf all the time is what I tell them they have not golf courses that through my lovely golf course now we're we're almost at a time and I really appreciate your being on\nA ... eleven dies it's a you know it's the election uh\nThis is probably the most important election certainly since I've been in the U.S was like the last sixteen years you know we've got the lowest unemployment generations you know you guys in in Congress just recently passed tax reform\nHow important is it that people get out to vote\nIf if the conservative and Republican base does not get out and vote with intensity to house we'll flip\nA because the Democratic base is completely animated and ... and energized just like we were eight years ago bronco Obama's first midterm and we took away sixty three seats from well 'cause their base was happy they had big government spending big government grow our base was apoplectic over Obamacare Dodd Frank ...\nBase was happy they had big government spending big government grow our base was apoplectic over Obamacare Dodd Frank consumer patch fiction border stimulus bill all that stuff\nAre based turned out in huge numbers and we took the majority away\nThe roles were reversed now mhm we have a Republican president Republican House and Senate we've been doing what conservatives due to the court to spending the tax base to the military and their side apoplectic right now\nSo if our race will get out and vote in and help the numbers will keep the house not as big a majority but we'll keep it and we'll be able to keep this path toward prosperity that world Barbara but if if our base sits home will lose the house Nancy Pelosi\nMaxine Waters a joke Schumer they will do everything they can to stop the Trump agenda and a ... fast\nRepresenting rod ... ... ... last question can you know do something about the deficit please\nThe only way we're going to be able to deal with the deficit is on a growing so we have enough money to close the deficit and hopefully grow enough to start paying down the old and its history demonstrated is you have to grow the economy to get revenue coming in\nTo close the deficit now we can we the president called for boxing reduction across the board and spending I agree with that\n\nW why do enough for him Coleman W D.

that we really became a majority steady eight years ago or ...\nYeah it's just been ... years ago that's it's really not that long ago you look at the the whole picture so that that's been a massive massive changing Hank about quickly and I think we can bank Brock Obama actually get a lot of credit for that\nWe don't even think about doping\nMaine had well his policies were so preposterous and Alabamians are good conservative\nPatriots so we kind of looked at what the heck you know that's not that's not what we want that you know he under his presidency they lost a thousand feet I mean that's not an accident that the message so watching the state flip 'em ... has been an amazing process but\nThe ... the other part and we just live in a very technology tech tech tech\nWorld right now I'm a real techie myself when I got it right but I Try\nI let Twitter and Instagram if I understand that that's important ...\nNo not really a ... or ... ... what is your ... or ... or so like in the ...\nChairman late then chairman liked it and I would love to I follow back and you know unless someone crosses the line I Will John Merrill lock them I can tell you that\nMuch [laughter] I don't know if we can all have their right mind opinion\nIs one thing that crossing a line of\nYou know personal attacks are using foul language or your let's row I get to pick my loans and I'm going to pick my life but anyway um I think that the tech world has been an amazing change in the political process\nUm where we used to go home and watch TV back okay how old are three channels you know I remember three television\nThat's all right very good and then at the end then maybe the radio the radio when you're at or we have to open a newspaper daily\nIn Russia ... board game\nThat was sort of debt and that nowadays my goodness everybody say something can read something\nThe problem with some of this this though is what the president called fake news there really is so much fake news you're in a fake news is not news you don't want to believe fake news is not real loose and so I think the tech world ... politics it's so easy to start rumors or cause trouble\nAnd so we have to we spend a lot of time in politics now healing that back and getting the truth out where we didn't have to do that sure how in the decades past so lot lot of changes but\nUm you know I I've been there in the dark days and and I I'm here now with arcane Elmo mountain top and I I like the mountain top you had a lot\nBetter I better or your ... interesting you bring up you know the whole fight Newsweek and the

Montgomery\n\nWell the guy let's say a excellent point that Raleigh grain right Robin grain bury me in Dixie I haven't heard that some before I Do think though I'd be worried if we were we were digging into what was happening in Montgomery at midnight to\nA gym in life and I don't think we need to be looking at that too cause it's like a er about love that song how wonderful was Riley green ... what's the bury their million Dixie I Love that\nThat's going to be on my uh my apple is the boy when I get out of here a bright so bright fun they're a big dive\nA so far we've got chairman Terry life in on the line now the chairman of the Alabama Republican Party or if you'd like to call in and throw a question to the gym and a number of non for one one zero one one a gym and thanks for starting with this\nBook which we look at a couple of specific Rice's perhaps\nUm and of course the you know the the big one in the room is the governor's race a governor ... the uh food most popular governor in America which is which is just fantastic uh she spoke last night at a yellow him a awards event\nUh here in Birmingham ah she was inspirational uh I thought she spoke very very well unlike other politicians including Walt Maddox she doesn't travel with a huge entourages just governor will I be standing at a table or trying to everybody and taking photos with everybody that comes past\nHow are you feeling going into the election for governor\n[noise] well if if our folks will show up at their motivated and that's something I'm always concerned about like the road or we're gonna have a good night on November ... but that still that take yeah um you know one of the challenges and in\n... and having such a red state and I think Alabama that's been ranked\nAs conservative state that Gallup poll I got called out without I feel like we're at first\nI Would think so I think it just seems like that and you know now that I feel something that must be traded stopped feel like we're number\nOne pollsters hadn't but very accurate or in the last few years\nWell now but that but let's just say we're we're top five I think that like air to say right what about challenges is is is trying to get people motivated and not sit back and get what you got it all but I'm I'm a big sports fan ... costs\n... is is trying to uh get people motivated and not sit back and go we've got it all look I'm I'm a big sports fan especially college for um sports and whatnot that without champions\nThat we all love champions everyone watches but champions don't rest they don't go all out I've got the crystal ball or I Want that one of the blue ribbon or you know I was first in the track bean or whatever on my team was what they do is they go back and they say how can I Do it that are\nGoing to do it faster how can a fix my mistakes what did I met and those that's Mike's champions and so I work with a group of champions across Alabama and they're called patriot\nThey're good oh yeah not American citizens that say I love my state allows my county I care I just came out and the founding fathers gifted us with the greatest gift\nIn and sit man in in mankind and in our history on planet earth with with the democracy with democracy with the bill of rights to the constitution\nWas American retired from the ... that's one of us are\nI mean it's one reason the group the caravan as we call them as you know we're trying to get in it you don't see any of us trying to get out the ever tried it in writing and so we have a great team of people\nAnd I'm really just citizens patriots says it's your neighbor it sure your your relatives ditch your church folks at your school friends and and we we just think that conservative policies that and so but on the\nOf that that's the good days the flip side for us is not to be complacent\nSay oh we've got it all oh they don't even though I don't need to go to more worried to him back\nIn ... yes and in fact is if any thing right now with the noise that we hear from the resist don't across our state in pockets now it is it pockets of Alabama but it is they're across our nation that we need to um\nPut put our nation put our state first and and not our complacency so that is always my number one fear or\n... or or your agree with you wholeheartedly you know or ... or ... or seen the ... the governor why these opponent a wolf as he works from ... a couple of going to have a couple of opportunities to see you\nKnow you you you know just put 'em in or whatever and seen him a couple of times he seems the mayor of Tuscaloosa seems to be much more liberal when he looks on now is that we just are seeing something like ... that would that be an accurate description\nNo I think that's an accurate\nDescription not because I Want it today or do you want it today or people want it today I think it is what it is\nUm when he says out loud I'm so glad George from this group that money to packs of guide me money I'm so glad that happen and when he says I'm pro life so I don't do that too which simply steps Alabama's alive state there is no legislation by the light on them to tell\nYou there's no laws that are trying to please everyone don't let Planned Parenthood who spent ... million dollars in Alabama and television and digital radio scary my dad that's that's fake names right there on the corner that address I started for that moment when he\nRight when he when he looked at you and tell them and he goes but I'm pro life but he turned right around and he gets he gets in with Planned Parenthood and and them fighting us\nThose were works main things and that is totally contradicts contradiction to what he is saying us look at us in the eyes and saying it so I think what people\nThat is totally contradicts contradiction to what he sang at looking at it than that so I think what people will have to do is use your gut instinct on there what about this is not like when I see him standing up at a press conference\nWith I'm senator Hank Sanders who's right or rented a purple but I really boat or die stickers on it\nAnd I see him standing next to Doug Jones\nWho we now clearly see is is less progress that we\nSee the money Chuck Schumer helped him get elected he's a truck shooting literally I mean I I just tell everyone you know what Alabamians are smaller and they're going to see through this uh absolute a show they're putting on\nYou know Jim and we have a cold or Michael is on the line Michael you have a a course in the gym and light the\nGerman lights on this is Michael hope you're doing well Haji joined the show you should question as an Auburn fan you think it's a coincidence that the Republican Party adopted the Alabama elephant as its mascot\nOkay now they there was a big with murder I I Would have rather he hasn't asked me about\nLike you know Russian collusion with Michael are you going to get in trouble here but let me just say yes I Am an ... Gulf War and all I all rolled toward\nYes go ahead get satellite that okay well you know the color red it's a party read it's sort of are adopted while the party and I wear nails and all that all the time and so it it I get a lot of teasing for ... all over and uh from from Alabama friend\nI'm not I wouldn't wish not all sleep well tonight and I just yeah kill it\nAnd I tell you what it's not the government is doing these things that people it's the people when you implement\nA when you get you votes\nThat's the first step right that officials aren't that the first step of voters or the first step the voters or the board of directors they determine which way our ship is kinda got and when I go to a voting booth and do that in it and put in conservative Republicans not liberal Democrat\nThis is what we get this is a simple I don't know that it could be a better cause and effect\nYeah this is what happens they can do this is what happens is is this thing over here well this is what's gonna happen and I guess the voters just has to make that decision do they like what's happening or you're better off is Ronald Reagan said you're better off now than you were a year to four years ago I I think the answer is pretty much\nYou want you to buy more tuned to the ... that whole cause and effect or a thing [laughter] now chairman or one could get much longer term we\nGeorge Soros this Boston today or a couple of days ago he pouring money into when we Planned Parenthood to wall medics and other Democrats ...\nYou know are red and it might be so correct but he's put nearly three hundred thousand dollars into a medic skin but surely\nA you know these white stage that money is going to be spent on you know getting out the vote in those more liberal areas sort of around Birmingham man broke a ... you know where we might not normally vote but you know he's going to spend as\nA you know there's two hundred thousand George Soros a gold coins uh uh trying to get people to to to vote\nHow much you do think that we have on races down ticket like I'm Talking about in Jefferson County in some of the other counties or you know how much effect will statewide\nGet out the vote campaign to these like ... with George sources money have on those rights as\nWell I you know first of all I think I heard that Mr sorrows put six hundred thousand dollars hole in the tax\nNow I don't know I haven't looked to be done on a date that um where at all when I'm you know he's that's just play money for him so and that's kind of like mind blowing but the fact of the matter is I I don't know how they're going to spend their money and I don't know what they're going to do but\nI'd really like to think and I really believe in my heart and just watching what's going on in our state how how wonderful things are for folks that they're that Alabamians will show up\nAnd maybe regardless of something they saw on TV or something they start running across did it all you know they'll look around and go gosh things are things are going really well in our state\nUm the national news it seems to be a very loud because they're on a chair to get Donald Trump and they're not going to adopt one seven so um I don't know how they're going to spend the money that I'd like to think that the diabetic service the policy when people walk in the day that that that's where they're gonna plant themselves\nRegardless of where they live in regards to that how they send them anyway\nAnd when people walk in and the day that that that's where they're going to plant themselves regardless of where they live in regards to how they send them\nOut and we hope you right now just one last thing to can you we touched on this bill you when you first joined us\nYou know the cooling now the great pretender would senator Doug Jones no influence break for you know majority of Alabamians certainly folks listening to die or the when I saw how hole and just trial or was that his treatment of now just as a cabinet or\nA you know and then comment I did not vote against the judge who was I hardly hardly qualified jurors your\nSenator Jones went against the will of people in Alabama how can you justify that food is and what what what is the endgame here as he becoming a shoe for Chuck Schumer so we can get a job on CNN or MSNBC and to use\nIt seems like it's in game is to come back to Alabama Senate he'd like yes thing I mean I I don't know what kind of housing leases they had some big say that I wouldn't sign anything more than six months at a time look here's what he did he went on a and you anybody can Google it are you to that he he\nLike he went on national TV on CNN and my jaw dropped and a lot of other people that too and he said\nUh well um when asked by national news reporter also don't you think I mean we understand that the Georgia of Alabamians want you you're going to yes on a half an hour and you're going to you you're going about NATO and he said well that might be so hot\nIt's not the end all be off\nNow listen to the work that might be that the majority of that might people might want me to but I'm not inland further us later on several days later he said well ... thank my staff with the fact that we came to the ...\nSo he and his staff right so he's governing for his stuff yeah it's\nNot even thinking Alabamians are going hey hey overhear us up on you know center shelving or why he's always had it right on the topic\nAnd ah I think that John could learn a few things from the states and then a Richard Shelby on when it comes to things like this for sure but I I just um look what you got a very liberal rats is now and I'm going to work across a ... would you call it along with\nAn interesting an album still lost an even under circumstances we found herself in a net right\nBut yeah that that's not what he's doing he's a real a real sick this\nYear he's a true believer I you know I my uh my day job I have a a governor ... ... the booth we started to potential calling to potential candidates are and we even have it as a hash tag when we put her account you've candidates matter\nAnd uh you know we saw this play out you know which put Doug Jones had mislead\nA but even once they candidates matter and you're going to be sort of get report you saw a little bit I guess but uh now before we let you go which we have to do because we are because I'm getting the ... from a big dive\nUh uh what's your predictions for the house and Senate and can the Republican Party hold the house\nWhen I see CNN and the last few days I'm Talking about well wait a minute maybe the Democrats want won't take the house over well\nWait a minute maybe our numbers are wrong to me that signals to get a little soft in their messaging and so I I think we pick up in a Senate seat in the United States Senate\nAnd I I have not bought into that we're losing a house\nAt the gym and so I I think we pick up in a Senate seat in the United States Senate\nI I have not bought into that were laid out we're seeing record turnouts around the nation in early voting and\nAnd the Republicans are crushing it in early voting so I I think this is an air at the national news is I think if they say over and over and then maybe we'll country you know what they were wrong it twenty sixteen\nMother telling what's wrong and everything they threw out of this wrong and so I I I think we are we going to lose some we are a lot to been redrawn\nThat's one thing I Want to talk about some of these districts a lot but I think we're still there and we need to be because uh we need to protect this country\nGenerally as a parent has to place to uh to wrap up thank you so much we spending so much time but this is up and and enjoy your weekend drawn tai chi

I mean I mean yeah I mean it's like Robert De Niro was one of the ones that received one of these are potential bomb yes and uh you know he's come out you know very adamantly against the president and others have said some things that you've also had McDonald's come out and says she wants to blow up the White House in a Johnny\nDepp his you know do they come and see how they want us to a police remove a president does and you can't you can't forget these images Kathy Griffin holding the president or the head I mean you know they'll\nAll these things right\nUnder this administration and I know there are a lot of things that happened on the president ... don't President Obama\nEight years address those things but it's nothing like\nIt and if I don't do that don't don't do don't do that the lesson that'd be little what happened whether it's more or less you know what I'm saying\nI don't want to be little what somebody did to the president of the United states then and I don't want to be with somebody is doing to the brunt of the United states\nNow no I'm not I'm not I wasn't knowing that direction I was just saying I think that it's just been amplified in the past Eighteen months I in my time\nI don't remember anything quite like this are members at the ... of um\nPresident Bush ... er during the anti war protests of him just comparing him to Hitler I Do remember the ... of President Obama comparing him to Hitler as well uh I denounce and decry both of those ... you know death doesn't deserve a place within our our current system that we have um but I'm not I mean this is just\nBecause Brian this is the one thing people don't want to admit okay\nWe have never seen this because we have never had a president like president Donald Trump ... good bad or indifferent he came in and did things completely different than everybody else to say see say okay the things he tweet he makes sure every day pretty much throughout the\nIs going to rub people the wrong way but the Brian this is what I have the problem with you know everybody ... that say that\nWe have a Congress we have a Senate\nThat need to put the brakes on this but they're ... I mean but but but what I'm saying is run\nAs this thing changes and this is what people don't care who you vote for him to go vote okay if not for me to tell you who to vote for okay I Know who I'm going to vote for but I'm telling people if you like what you're saying you need to vote if you don't like what you see you need to go vote on November ... oh yeah because what's gonna happen here is\nThat if\nMore people vote for the same things are going to say the same if more people vote for they want to change I think the house or wherever there's going to change was going to change and shake things the way president done some has to conduct himself on certain\nBut nothing has changed\nI think the house where everything's going to change was going to change the shape of things we president don't some has to conduct himself on certain things but\nNothing has changed in in when you look and we've been through this with the especially I mean what what what the house of representatives let's just take a legislative branch you know they have the worst approval rating and the president the prison United States Americans ... Donald Trump right now sending him to another\nOne in ... but they haven't done anything for twenty Thirty years\nMore people believe that chocolate milk comes from brown cows and then give support\nTo the legislative branch of our government\nBecause they haven't they haven't done anything President Obama good at the uh Democrats over eight years in the house of representatives OK ... according to ship across the board\nOf ... the United states of America in state elections and\nAll that good at um the legislative branch of the government under his reign for Democrats because it became all about president don't I mean President Obama to yeah\nNow right the Democratic republic came into office and they promised the American people and we got a ... with a Republican president will we got on the show and he said his Republican we have the Senate and house that I mean Senate and the Congress that control everything is controlled by Republicans and steal well ...\n... the fare and be honest and we're not talking about this when I was running 'cause everybody said well you know that either the Senate Republican ... it's a slim majority and the way that the rules in the Senate work you need to work across the aisle and that is not happening\nRight and what I'm saying is still they control bottom line who control the Republican\nRight and and you and obviously you knew you see what the federal judicial appointments right you know those ... you know sort of lord right\nNow just like I say when President Obama was the president mhm if the Democrats are in control we should we gave it to get something done yet and ... and Harry paranoid period\nI said it right I was on this microphone in this position than exact same thing President Obama I don't want to hear about Bush only about nothing else only had none of that sir you're the president you're in control of everything and you're a Democratic president make it happen to things that you see it\nIn during Obama's first two years he had more of a majority than Donald Trump has ... and and and the key issues that the Democrats wanted to do immigration reform they could they could have done so much ... can change things but they didn't\nAnd here's the thing that I'm saying ... president Donald Trump I Want to hear the same thing I don't want to hear yes right actually all the stuff that people are telling me ... President Trump did know\nThe answer is no no sir I'm not going to give you a pass if I called it out on President Obama I'm calling it out on President Donald Trump and the Republicans right now you have not done your job yes the economy is harming\nPut it out that thank you sir the job Yes sir put it out there thank you but as a whole lot of other stuff that people are not holding this\nRepublican Party accountable for like they didn't hold the Democratic party accountable for an American people to stop you to vote if you're not doing your job you need to put some more representatives and to do the job for them regardless of whether you're a Democrat or Republican back to this thing that happened today ...\nWhen we look at we have a man in our country that's the anti Semitic\nOr whatever you want to call them a monster or ... whatever you want to call this guy a Jew hater lives along the American folk mhm there's a lot of them out there but now Brian because of this toxic environment that we all have created and a lot of people want to bring the president\nAbout ... there's a lot of 'em out there but now Brian because of this toxic environment that we all have created and a lot of people want to bring the president he's part of the problem but he's not the problem ...\nYou have people and I said is when I when we do this thing about kids kids watching right ... what they're doing they are watching now what I say to this is\nWhen you got the people there and I'm not going to call these folks\nCrazy or they got mine issues okay what are you talking about the the shooter and all of them all of them are I I'm not going to let them get away with this on this one here you have some mean spirited angry people in this country ... and they will placate the ... thing and take it\nAnd use it for their own put the pictures of put the cross hairs on these people because of what they think you made me\nSo your mom was there to teach the say the words have meaning regardless of whether the president or you a senator a house of representatives or mayor or governor your words have meaning to the people who elected you\nWere even if you're not a person who has been elected in your celebrity and what you get ... voice saying you don't have one because\nPeople in Enron people are listening kids are list yes\nKids adore celebrities there isn't a dollar tree yeah a lot of worship in when you look at when you look at somebody like Johnny Depp mhm\nJak sparrow and kids love the parts of the Caribbean they love the character of jak sparrow and so when Johnny Depp gets up and start talking about things and asking a question when was the last time an actor assassinated prison the United states of America and kids are listening\nBut here's the thing the kids set aside until we get a kid a coming of sorts you know places I'm send them suffer from right now I'm Talking about the adult\nKids right that have been waiting for this moment right before we were talking about hope and change okay now we're talking about making America great again to fundamentally different types of\nA polar opposite yes yeah thinking ... okay and it brings out different type of people mhm this what President Donald Trump is going whether we like it or not he has awakened a section of America even though there's somebody that now is that\nRight he said he's not a part of it and he's not you know that's not what he does it has a waking the white nationalist has waking the KKK of this country we are waking up people in a rural area that fell that feel that they have not been taught to nah\nYou do you mean this is what made you go yeah or yeah because I feel like the ... make America great again speaks more towards the wire ... individual Ron I'm with you on that point right I I'm not saying Donna ... again let me make sure you understand what I'm saying I'm not saying president\nDonald Trump is that person but when people hear the speech when you see in a black man become president the people in a in a city that spoke to them mhm when President Bush did speak to them so I'm saying when president Donald Trump get up and say that things these days away he phrase things right he's a smart\nBrother that Donald Trump did not get elected by the way other person's got elected he got elected in areas that nobody was talking to yeah he was talking to talking to the rural area people a lot of people in a rural area but I'm not saying all of ... but they feel that there was left out you know that's because\nOf the over regulations of the industries they're riding ... it was all economic sock right like don't don't\nThe KKK you know what the end it is supposed to kick it I'm saying when you're talking to a certain number of people in the rural area mhm right okay now you have the people in American to say okay no innocent people say you're not talking to me right I'm being left\nThe rural area mhm right okay now you have the people in American to say okay no innocent people say you're not talking to me right\nI'm being left out but I mean but the Obama ... medically yeah\nHe called them basically in and said those of us who live in Alabama and the majority of Alabama's rural\n... those people that ... to their guns in their religion ... you know he demonized\nExactly and that's what that's that's the point right when a president say those things ... because you're still red meat to who\nYour audience President Obama did it yes mitten and resident Donald you all seem to be around ... label right or Donald Trump is doing the exact same thing if people keep giving them a pass on that\nNow is he who is calling rubber ... I Want to know specifically ... has she called half of this country either deplorable nope or has he called half of\nThis country and demonize them by saying that you can't get anywhere by clinging to your guns and your religion\nYou know he has he has said he ever said about that because he wasn't talking to those people I Know\nBut okay so who in a phrase that was similar where he's basically\nSubject getting half of this country in the humanizing them in a sense of what has he specifically said that is targeted towards the other half of this country when\nPresident Donald Trump and this is where you're going to disagreement when he went out and said there are good people on both sides ... that there are a lot of people totally against him\nBecause at that time people felt on the other side if any other time that she was going to stand up for the country mhm you was not going to say that was good people on both sides I mean you had brought in to the Iran is there but\n[noise] so we do we want you to the seventies [noise] do do\n\nDo you find yourself wearing the same thing over and over about not knowing how to apply here make up for enhanced your features thanks a lot is what\nThey're looking for the last offered one on one styling for drug shopping closet reconstruction beauty classes and much more to help you with your fast at work for a\nContest or seen it a secret today and take advantage of our radio only special offers call to five six six to for several uh Ninety five right now or head to W.

don't I don't I don't disagree that the guy's crazy I mean look look here's the thing I've never disagree my whole thing is he's crazy people on the other side of do things we have to adjust and the same way that is my only argument here\nFive well you know he's been crazy right was that was three thousand twelve he got arrested for\nWriting cook credo okay but he's crazy about he's crazy about Donald Trump other people are crazy about Bernie Sanders these people are crazy but there are crazy because they believe in what these people are saying\nThey're crazy for what the they they feel that they that the president of Bernie Sanders a hitter claim they feel that they're talking to them\nAnd I said this on this show off his on my TV show at the end of the day these people think you are sending them subliminal messages and you can't do anything so they're going to do it for you\nRobert ... sorry no I was just going to say I I Will say kind of falling out though and speaking from someone\nAnd I just tell you the as I got into medical school so I the whole reason I really got involved as a whole immigration thing is because I was looking at this from a humanitarian perspective and not a political perspective\nBut to carry on with that what I'm seeing from my perspective is you have an entire demographic as people that happens to be according to ... to or the biggest voting\nBloc minority in the United states which is Hispanic specifically Mexican Americans and you see people on the last day that they care about this entire demographic of people yet they set their they called for open borders and then they essentially getting better with the cartel I don't I don't think that that's right and I know that I Wish\nI Wish that people were as honest I G and politics but frankly\nIt or not the case not like people like you I Need to stand up and say that they're not and that's\nWhy you have to have me there but that's okay let me ask you this on a real quick I Want to ask you a couple of things\nUm the caravan the people come from doors and they're making their way to the United states of America I'm your thoughts on that because you have a what what do you mix with again\nI'm half Mexican I'm a quarter native and German\nOkay so you have an invested interest in this right you've seen it from both sides and of course did you have friends that have come across the land lean okay\nYeah I have had friends that came across legally and illegally one served in the military to get his citizenship\nOkay so I don't know if you guys just looking at right now we're talking to the one on ... and she's here with us She's given her role on his opinions about what you feel that going on in the United states of America right now we're going to get into the thing about the caravan got to ask you this because I'm a guy on the United states citizen right I have friends who are connected like you are with\nThey're going to ask you this because I'm a guy on the United states citizens were I have friends who are connected like you are with family members in close ties and friends\nWhat you were on the street about what these people coming from Honduras come to know what I'm saying is is actually something that's blown up by the love is itself is one of our car too and they're trying to you know put it to America what's really going on\nI'm I'll tell you what has been covered by outside American news sources that it is politically funded and motivated\nThat was covered by the government of Mexico and the government of Honduras murder and that they actually made a call for their citizens not get involved with as I can tell you what I've seen on footage and what are people who are there to include reporters and getting footage of the\nMain man who headed up the active or the party activists who is actually a citizen he has a\nDual citizenship to us and Mexico and paying women and children to join the march because it's about eighty percent males for so what I can tell you the word on the street is is that it is a politically funded and motivated care of and now I don't want to even call it a march because there's also footage of these people being trucked\nTo cover this amount of distance there being fed to have security escort vehicles I mean this is not something that people just all of a sudden and say hey I'm going to go do that is a very very dangerous journey and what people need to understand is anything happening in the in Mexico not only affects the United states but if we don't\nEnd it here it's very likely that people will get killed in the process and innocent people at that because my yes there can be bad people and not caravan ... but they're also innocent people that were basically pay to join so that's also something that when you need to remember\nOkay and I'm a I'm a ... look at me like do you let me talk among doctors other here so [laughter] what are you one more question please help me understand is because this is what I don't get why would men and women\nPut themselves in a situation where they can be few home or something you've been you know worse than that with their families um to come to United States I'm trying to figure out so many people are going to do with their families in danger\nBecause of a political reasons\nBecause to the rest of the world I'm troubled mind you to twenty five countries all around the world to include Egypt right across\nThe United states is the best country in the world and regardless of said you'd ads right or wrong\nThey would be willing to sacrifice that to be a part of this country because it is that great of a country and I genuinely believe that they believe that that's why they're doing it but I Will say that there's four million people to include some of my family members waiting to come here legally and they're not cutting lines to do so and they're not putting their lives in jeopardy to do so so that is why\nWe have a responsibility not only to Americans here but to the people that are going to hurt themselves to try to come here illegally you know so I used to that soundbite that\nAn open border hurts not only the people in the United states but it will hurt the people that are trying to come here illegally\nWhen as soon as you know I mean it's been reported that Mexico is all for refugee status and ... the I hate to call to care about I don't really know what to call it um\nBut they have denied the refugee there's like no we don't want it to what's what's the end goal for this group of thousands of individuals who are making this political truck right before the midterms\nThey are making the political track against you try to gain access to this country we have had very last year news outlets in fact this is a perfect question because you guys know how dangerous this journey as right people can look back stuff about human\nLast year news outlets in fact this is a perfect question because you guys know how dangerous this journey as right people can look back up about human\nI Begin to bringing in but we got the problem is we can run the can you hold just meant yeah part of our\nEverywhere it rears its very ugly head\nWe stand with our Jewish brothers and sisters to defeat ...\nWhere's the forces of have that's what it is [noise]\nThe surgery the Jews of and do terrible persecution and you know that we've all read if we've studied it they've gone through a lot\nRight now ... auction at one we will seek their [noise]\n\nNow what are you a crime like this\nWhether it's this one or another one on another group we have to bring back the death penalty [noise]\nThey have to pay the price again [noise] they can do this our country\nWe might draw a line\nIn the sand and say very strongly never again [noise]\nThey're not every one of this arena and every citizen across the luncheons our prayers to the victims and their families and we all do\nWe also send our gratitude to the law enforcement officers\nIncredible risk their lives [noise] that's just stayed\nVery very serious injuries\nDuring this horrible attack we salute the heroes\nOr do we just lived through the president Donald Trump was speaking at a rally Illinois address an issue that happened this morning I'm In Pittsburgh and I'll like with the president had said\nWell I'm In or are we still have the death penalty I don't understand why he's saying we're going to go ahead because in\nPittsburgh um their subject mandatory embezzle they ... they just like they're not going to get to\nYou but this is a this is being charged the hate crime so therefore we would be a federal prosecution\nBut when they were saying when I listen to earlier they based in saying that even if you do get to do we get a ... ... and let's get back to an interview with the one on the ana I Believe ... ...\nOkay so back back to what I was going to say real quick in that we're finding has a very leftist media coverage that has been\nIn my opinion exploiting the humanitarian issue for political reason with you completely nailed on the head earlier as we've actually seen at twenty five percent increase in the last year of these quote unquote family units coming to the border now it's dangerous about that is\nThe whole reason we have the family separation which I completely agree with what's to protect the children because they were finding that the family unit or even biologically related and that these were basically waits for cartels and organized crime to traffic and children in the United states there's plenty of\nA story that you can read about this the ACLU which ironically going after Trump very hard right now in regards to immigrate immigration did a huge article full of detail about a year prior talking about the correlation of human trafficking and illegal immigration and so it's\nIn my opinion that this crisis I mean unfortunately because of what has happened because you can't find organization that has like a death and in fact I'm I was reading an article earlier and one of the organizations\nFortunately because of what is happening because you can't find organizations that have like a death and in fact I'm I was reading an article earlier and one of the\nOrganization that passing out that kind of helping with the organization based out of the United states called have lifted from Quetta which is basically people Without Borders and they are illegal immigration in the United states\nIn my opinion is that is the only thing that you could possibly do for someone because it creates a breeding ground for human trafficking organized crime and drug running wrong\nToo I mean you bring up a good point because\n... we saw um an up tick\nIn human trafficking and child sex trafficking during during the Obama administration\nAnd people are sick getting caught about that 'cause I didn't have to excuse my language it makes me so angry people and their children and their women and they talk about how they yeah they really care about women at the whole meets you move but yet you have them here basically turning a blind eye legal or illegal\nThis story should have been about this guy and his past mhm because you made it a national news story you're talking about here in and out right but I'm saying when he's called\n... this was a person on the left that was go there would have made about this ... that you don't want to hear what Donald Trump or anything 'cause somebody's if you don't want to hear what this guy did not because you see what I'm saying you know what I'm saying right now\nThis is a new national news story that we they made\nAnd so when you go to bring it up everything else right that you wasn't talking about before this week in this ... this past weekend before you but it's just showing the park or see right that ... I didn't have a double standard\nIt it's the narrative that they're trying to push I get is a national news story yeah they're going to cover it and they're going to cover it more staunchly\nBecause it fits their narrative if this\nTheir narrative brown but it is news when you go off the top political figures yeah OK dearly and right and so why didn't rice and goes after Mattis goes after Donald Trump\nGentle Donald Trump's into Donald Trump junior air and that's my court right why didn't Fox cover it why did wrong and then covered it but I'm making a mess a new store every single day what why why why Fox\nNews' Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck and so they offered it for three days but why did why did why didn't CNN why didn't MSNBC why didn't see it because that was a problem here's the other part that didn't sit their narrative I'm agree with\nYou on that I'm agree with you on that but he is older than me who's the president Donald Trump why didn't president Donna jumping out of the FBI Gordon funny so they're looking for but I'm saying if we can find this guy like you hold on hold on but look better see no no no no that's not good spirits I Know but I mean you know I'm the president right right who just went up to my son\nI Am the front of the United states FBI work for who were you okay so if we found this guy ... bears quick and it went up to somebody you just went up to my son ... both of them maybe your sense of it to me\nEverything stopped bra and cabinet members you know I mean what I'm saying right depressed up but rather that Donald Trump is not talking about it mhm okay he got the biggest political up and go through the toilet seat\nYou don't say no you know that's my point\nBrothers don't don't go to this would have read about these days talking about ... owned news talking about because bombs\nAre scary and rice and is it it's\nAll about the Enron you asked me why right now and I'm going to go and I'm just hands and asked me why and another you if the guy just opposed to the United states is not making an issue calling covered it was not an issue that died down to who start speaking\nAbout it now don't bring no no no no no no the reason why\nThat the issue came back up about him because why\nThe president started talking about and made an issue my point being the president could have made this an issue ... about his son's all you had to do is say they love their this is my son was put it on Twitter let's find this guy and I promise you it had been a national news story why didn't the president do it\nBecause she\nA great question what then his sons go out and make this they they they hold a loan or what they did they go out and they kept on and and they have in it and even this week they're like how come\nTo know where I'm not I have I ... I looked at what a seat they set of twins I mean so the Twitter feed don't have to him how to anything it for ... okay so here's ... again now the three percent\nOf the media coverage of Donald Trump is attacking Donald J on they're not going to cover an event where Donald Trump and his family and his cabinet members have been kept in the same way\nThey're not going to cover an event where Donald Trump and his family and his cabinet members have didn't eat cats in the same way I Believe that this book bright variants last week\nBut who has the biggest ... of them all Trump okay again I asked the question to American anybody knows around eight six six stuff I've won a three three why didn't the president make this an issue he make everything as an issue why did\nHe make the you know he has made the bomb is an issue if it hadn't been the constant deluge\n... some of my son ... another I'm ... I'm I'm Talking about I can get mad about everything goes in the world okay I can talk about the and we all know how much he says he loves his family right I'm saying but I can get mad about the Pocahontas I can go out there but like I said I've only owned the bully pulpit when I'm doing my uh my my my rallies okay\nAnd I can say all this stuff about other people right let me tell you some ... I can say all day and talk to the kids you come up to my wife you come up to my son right come up to my daughter\nBut you don't get a whole different do you think my rage is going to be when I'm Talking about politics and the passion about this I don't know you go to my son right and I am the president of the United states I'm sure this country now\nOkay why didn't the president of United States I've actually heard about is why doesn't the president make this an issue here by the time of the mainstream didn't make it issue is one main God of need that needed to make this an issue that was the president of the United states of America\nAnd you're making a valid point why didn't he I mean it did it happen yes to his kids to his kids\nAnd could potentially have ... and the F. B. I. is on the hill right and there see they they don't let him for everybody else's to him ... you went after my kids well and it'll just be honest here\nIs that the whole bomb sending potential packages that could explode\nOr your Time Warner building CNN the Britain and then you wanted that President Obama and Clinton and you know yeah so you you have higher names names that make more money if they are thrown out and that's where all this is now starting to trickle down to\n... we can say that oh the eight six six of one another if you're going to go into the show where we can say that all day ... okay and I agree with you that they got the covers because of the names he sent them to listen to it and it was in ... when I did to strike fear yes yeah it it would seem to strike fear but here's the thing\nI've seen our president ... make an issue I a mount a millennial he'll yes he is okay you know whenever he wanted to know you know ... all you have to do is they left my kids this is wrong mhm\nTwitter will explode people were still recovering it the less it's going to cover to put their fans who and said this is not true Fox news is going to cover the president\nOf the United states of America had they said to his son ... and he has not said a peak to my knowledge about it now it that's why it's not national news and so when people saying that the left the left left the mainstream and the biggest may say made it to me right now is the president genetic or whatever you say they cover ...\nGood ... and ... and they spin it they toss it back at him and they try to chop it up and give me news clip oh the low to prove that point and then the cycle but soccer continues but like I said everybody be honest about what we're talking about\nReplacing the blame and we want things to happen and see what was happening less actual real questions\nFor they start to cover it happened the way it does in this country we need to\nWe're replacing the blame and we want things to happen and see what was happening let's ask the real question\nFor the stuff they cover it happened and where does this country we need to make sure that will be honest with our cell yeah and not you know doesn't want it to one party because I can show you there and ... and it just seems and in a Bosnian go I get it but I promise you Brian\nIf this was on the left ...\nGuesswork nobody's been asking those questions\nThey'd been just a they're saying see I told you Maxine Waters Cory Booker or Eric Holder their rhetoric calls this this is what we've been talking about right right 'cause you've got your calls and all of his vows you'll you'll talk more about it and nobody would have been looking at and others on\nYou see what I'm saying that's my problem with this country that is what I have an issue with it once or does it\nNobody sees other part of it yeah I and that's why I say we have to look at this from an objective standpoint of you for right now like you always told me and I've been more on this because you're my goal of\nThe fact that we have to go on the facts but we have everything else is just hearsay and speculation speculation and so we can't but there is deductive reasoning as well run\nAgain introduced into your argument when I'm Talking about something that's not the death of reading and talking about something you said these are the facts of the undisputed ... so we can't do that that's my point we can't have it both ways though is that\nYou know facts are facts but you can have the reason we used to live but see we see we'll see what you're doing there\nYou see what you're doing right I Am I Am in ... we we yeah but when we're talking about taking events in correlating together and then having the fax line up\nThat's different than having black and white monitoring other people are saying about this um bomber guy lines up no ... it's it's completely perplexing right but I mean did they call them the people to call them a white nationalist when he's a\nFilipino right but I'm saying people bring I mean it's just weird stuff would you see them saying yeah it what you just said\nIt don't line up no is coming out of thin air right people just keep telling me well Joe just don't add up Joe it no I'm saying to me it was in front of me in a brand new more information and all that we have right now is these are these devices\nAnd he was ... right and apparently he was a DJ or a river and we're at right now it looks like he was Donald Trump's supporting period yeah those are the facts and and that's all that we can go by and then kill the department of justice rise us more information which I seriously doubt they will\nUm you know that's just what we have to go on and we speculate you know for the girls go out

group of people that really wanted the government control everything and you wanted another group of people that wanted the individual to control everything so you had centralized in an centralized ... but the thing that separates\nOur founding fathers from what we're listening to de ... they had the same goal ... and I don't believe that the Republicans and Democrats or the conservatives and the liberals have the same goal and more ... and\nUh you know I I think that\nWe it's just been in in our lifetimes were this environment has come to play where the Democrats and the Republicans started shifting\nA almost like magnets\nShooting apart from each other and we used to work towards the same goal used to be United States of America and if you're a Democrat and you were in office

little ladies and gentlemen were hanging out as we shall be an interesting way you can\nSee why a little later in the weight so we're just be hanging out this week in anything you want to talk about is what we'll be talking about of course we'll get into the shooting that happened in Pittsburgh will talk a little bit about the caravan\nAnd I'll let you know why I was not here on Fridays no one was not out partying don't let your mind go straight there I Know I'm young Dylan was out partying that's why we weren't here on friday that's the real reason will get into that oh I\nSee the here to the fake news media popping up again but we'll\nGet into that a little bit more a little later in the show however I Would like to go over to the man with a plan demand keeps this all running and kept it all running friday while I was out and about Dylan my friend\nHow're you doing I'm doing All right it's a Monday it's it is Monday she'll be an interesting week right oh yeah definitely going to be an interesting way definitely going to be interesting we so here's the thing\nI'm curious I'm curious how the weekend go because whenever you come in you're like I didn't get any sleep and I'm like doing a good weekend you're like I Know did you get any sleep is we can\nThe weekend yeah although last night I laid there until nine thirty trying to fall asleep and then also woke up to Fifteen\nOver the weekend yeah although last night I laid there until nine thirty trying to fall asleep and then\nLook up to two Fifteen\nThat's not fun now that's not a at least you got extra time for coffee and shower glass half full of coffee I guess you could say\nWell welcome to Fifteen really Thursday so I got out what in the bathroom because we keep a cup in there for like if you want something to drink you know you don't have to go all the way across the house\nYeah you live in one of those ranch style houses where it's got the loan hallways and you just gotta walk from one end of the other I Lived in that for Twenty years one of those\nKinda yeah the upstairs is outweigh the the ... and we didn't have an upstairs so the downstairs isn't a but anyway I'm filling up the cup at the sink\nAnd the toilet just very\nVery suddenly starts making this noise like it's being fleshed\nAs uncomfortable you got goes and I haven't touched it you got ghosts have you\nCome to that conclusion already are we going to have to reach that spiritual journey here together you'd definitely have ghosts in your home I mean I suspected it for years but has there been a small child or an elder or an elderly person that had died in that house pre dating you\nKnow because that house was actually built for my dad's parents\nMm Mm somehow go Scott in need check to crawl space there might have been a kid he was throwing ball right to me through the ball and Johnny Was like I don't get any ran into the crawl space\nAnd then he got locked into crawl space and couldn't get out and then unfortunately Johnny, Johnny passed away inside the crawl space and now he's hunting your house that is the best that's my best idea\nThe only access to the crawl spaces in our garage and there's a lot that's usually on that door\n... got a great arm and Johnny's really good at getting well he was really good at getting around walk so and now he's good at going through doors so he blocked doesn't even bother him anymore but\nI had an interesting a night last night well should I say afternoon I uh I got back we went to Atlanta this weekend I mean a couple of fraternity well me and most of the fraternity did for a a like a Brotherhood retreat thing which I always think sounds a little bit suspect because it sounds like\nGirls night out you know what I'm saying Brotherhood or a tray like it just\nSounds the same but when they say hey free Six Flags on a free place to say I'm like okay I can get past the name but um\nBut so we went uh we went down to Atlanta I went down to that Six Flags over Georgia or whatever it's called and um we were down there for a couple of days and that was really fun but um [noise]\nWhile we were while we were there we said up really late right and so last night or two nights ago my apologies we stayed up until for a um\nA three or four I Am and then got up at eight and drove back which for me is no problem you know 'cause I'm used to running on those sleep used to getting up far earlier than that\nSo it really was no big deal but everybody else was like dying and so I like um like one of those people that has to be in charge you know what I'm saying like not just not has to be in charge us for the sake of being in charge when it comes to driving I don't trust anybody else's driving\n\n\n\n\nWelcome back into the wakeup call ladies and gentlemen feeling good feeling fine well that makes one of us I'm getting\nFive five one Ninety nine thirty three were just hanging out this morning we're going to talk about a couple of things we're talking about what went down in Pittsburgh last week the horrific horrific event or my apologies over the weekend that last week\nA that went down in ... Pittsburgh the horrific hate crime an act of terror that happened there we'll talk about that we'll talk about the fact that they captured the bombing suspect yeah they captured him and what did he have all over his van to every conservatives dismay\nTrump sticker so we'll talk about what impact that could have come November cause the elections are right around the\nCorner and we'll talk about a couple of other things but specifically what I Want to talk about is what a conversation that happened or the other day while we were sitting um\nWhile we were sitting around the fire talking about different stuff and so there were the there were there were a couple of guys that are started having this conversation about biblical relationships and stuff like that and you know all of that fun stuff that everybody loves to talk about three am just like yell up talking about it if I Am right\nSo we\nRelationships and stuff like that and you know all of that fun stuff that everybody loves to talk about three am just like yeah I Love talking about it at five AM right so we were sitting there talking and these two guys really aggressive and going back and forth at it um and ah they they were calling their stances arguments\nAnd when you do that I'm like oh yeah because the other side is definitely going to listen to you when you're having a discussion and you say well my argument is is and your argument is wrong because\nIt just it never facilitates good conversation 'cause when it turns into an argument and I told them that they both got really bud hurt I said you realize you're just causing each other to take a hard line them stand where you stand and back yourself into a rabbit hole theologically or\nA mentally if you do choose um because of the fact that you call it an argument you can never now say well maybe you got a point\nAnd so that's why I hardly ever have arguments but I have discussions and if anybody wants to have an argument I'm like well you can find probably a hundred other people on Facebook didn't want to argue with you um I'll have a discussion with you though in person if you like\nBut nevertheless a bunch of people were talking a bunch of people were getting to know each other um especially me is like I said I'm not very active nor involved um in the fraternity because of how much work I got to do and you know\nThat sounds kind of sad sounds like a how could you do that but when the work pays the bills you know it's kind of what you got to do with that point so we were\nWe were sitting around the fire getting to know each other and\nThe thought hit me and my buddy ... ah Cooper that was sitting next to me the same guy that likes to uh incite\nThe fires among people you know come and drop kind of a truth bomber drop this little hint of knowledge that he knows will cause everybody to go crazy and want to talk about it and then walk away he's one of my really good buddies because uh he's able to have those discussions see 'em and he's one of the\nFew be rare few people that are actually able to have a discussion and not get heated about it and so we talked about a lot of stuff\nAnd uh and I I propose\nThis concept to him because the freshman started arguing about some topic that he dropped in there you know just kind of slid in there and then they just boom they just all started arguing about it so me and him started talking over the side\nAnd um and I said you know I think I found out something that I've been trying to understand for a while here um and that's the idea of um why we act the way we do around people that we don't know now\nIf you're anything like me I'm I mean I literally get messages I I Know somebody you think of the most ignorant person in the world and God Bless you thanks for listening but there are some of you to think that uh I'm but I Do get messages a I get people that call me boy genius and stuff like that I get a kind of accomplishments [noise] um I think I I think I'm well versed in my field\nAnd so I think I can talk about it and portray myself very intellectually and so\nI I hear that coming from this side right coming from the television and radio side in which I work that um it's kind of that in that I carry an intelligent or with me\nBut and I like talking to you all like this because I feel like I can be myself and talk like I Want to talk about things I Want to talk about and we can have conversations about him but then you transition into social life\nAnd when you get around a group a large people\nYou know they're not listening to super station one on one W why D you know they they didn't come here for politics or come here for God and country they can't they're just you know out and about and they're doing their thing and they may not care\nAbout politics or religion or life or anything like that they just may want to talk about what the card actions are doing this week and if you've listened to the show for any amount of time I'd say if you listen to the show for even just one week\nProbably know how we feel about the car crash into your\nAnd if you've listened to the show for any amount of time I say if you listen to the show for even just one week you probably know how we feel about the ... here on the show so\nIt's really nice to have this outlet where you can talk and kind of be where I can talk and be myself within your transition to this other area and I always feel when I'm Talking in this space in this other space not the radio and TV space that I feel like I sound ignorant in comparison to others\nNot like we're having an intellectual conversation they best me but I feel like when I approach somebody I say something that's intended to be stupid\nYou know kind of like stupid sarcasm stupid humor stuff like this and so me and Cooper who I'm really good friends with and he knows exactly how I Am when that's not where or when I'm not acting like that we're having a conversation I said I think have figured out the reason why I Do that\nAnd he was like go ahead come on tell me and I was like so I think the reason that I come in and I'll act stupid and act overly sarcastic and make stupid jokes\nI'm just cliche jokes here and there um is because it's kind of everyone says Schumer is a defense mechanism I don't think it's a defense mechanism I think humor is a ... a distancing mechanism\nI think humor is a way of saying look I don't know you I don't know if I'd trust you so I'm not going to give you I really am rather I'm just going to give you\nThis this part of me that can be changed on a dime right because if you're any good at talking to people you can change your sarcasm I mean you don't even have to be good talking to people you can change your sarcasm changer jokes change the way he taught really easily\nAnd then so I feel like Schumer is malleable medium right I feel like humor can be molded in to whatever fits the situation\nThat you needed to fit so I feel like if you're around some people and they're judgmental like there are a couple there a couple of people that I Know that we're that are judgmental but I've been talking to here recently and I don't\nI don't talk about anything really personal or deep or anything like that with them because I just I don't want to get judged by um point a plain and simple so\nUm they have been getting on my nerves and I was talking about that with Cooper and I said look I feel like the reason that I make those jokes and act that way around them is because if they start judging then you know I can switch it up and switch up what I'm Talking about not have to deal with the judgment I feel like humor is used because humor can change\nIf somebody doesn't like what you're saying when you're being humorous it can be changed but if somebody doesn't like what you're saying when you're actually being yourself and showing them your true self\nYou can't change that you know what I'm saying if somebody rejects you for what makes you you not only can you not change it\nBut it hurts like hell to cause they're basically saying I see you see what you're about and I think it's stupid and so I think that's the reason that a lot of us use humor and I proposed that to him\nAnd he was like you know I've never looked at it that way 'cause he does the same thing like he won't have the same type of conversations that he has with me\nThat he has with other people are are that he has me he won't have those other people\nAnd so he's like that's a really good point because look we we had a conversation about this and it was a we just were genuinely talking it out it's the idea you know divorce rates are rising in the U. S. is monogamy a concept socially not in a religious standpoint but socially that can last\nIn the societal sphere we have now right is monogamy something that can last or will monogamy via failed concept we were just discussing it because it's an interesting topic um especially with the statistics that kind of say otherwise rising and then after we talked\nFailed concept we were just discussing it because it's an interesting topic um especially with the statistics that kind of say otherwise rising and then after we talked about socially we brought in a biblical perspective because we're both Christians and saw how\nHow the Bible says that it will last and how we have to cling to those biblical values regardless of what the social standard\nDictate because the social social standard of progress to anywhere the ideologues want to take it right I mean Jordan Peterson talks about this all the time that the society is dictated by ideologues these are these ideal is at the top these people that that are the heads of the ideologies\nSpecifically religion but just the heads of the ideologies society will progress to where those people choose to take it so you have to cling to those values\nAnd so we had that conversation and nobody judge but then we decided hey let's see what happens if we open this up to\nTen guys sitting around the fire right now are debating about the ... of a gun rights and abortion you know whenever you pose it to people who aren't very political they go to the two topics you know here on why one on one ... we can have forty five minute conversations with callers about the tax plans\nBut we can I uh but when you pose that people are very political they go to ... murder and you need your gun rights or we don't need guns and everybody has the right to choose you know it goes to their belief propose that idea them and we said hey guys main Cooper were having this\nDo you think I'm reaching or do you think it's true that that could be a reason that we use humor is because we're afraid to let other people see who we are\nI've never really thought about it that way but it makes a lot of sense to me\nIn the ... the the whole reason I bring up this conversation is because my thought processes\nIf I'm going to you know everybody's afraid of what people are going to say and that shot that could be taken to the ego or the way they feel about themselves yadda yadda yadda but here's the way\nI started to view it and why I hardly ever use that humor anymore and people are like oh you've changed I'm like no I haven't changed this is just how I actually am because if you don't like me for me\nI don't need you nor do I want you in my life\nIs that a fair statement yeah I mean because I feel like why would you try to conform to somebody what somebody else wants\nOf your life you know they haven't had your experiences they haven't you know the old cliche phrase walked a mile in your shoes why would you want to conform to something else that somebody once\nI learned very early on to treat everyone the same from the c._e._o. to the janitor mhm yeah garbage man yeah every single one of them and to that extent my view of new people\nYou're an idiot and a jerk except I don't usually use jerk and not worthy of my trust until you prove otherwise however I Will show you the same respect that I get my mother until you provide otherwise yeah\nAnd that's the thing is we um we we always have these\nUm these conversations and the more and more like I see the truth behind the cliche phrase like the cliche thing ... you know the parents taught us and I think that happens whether you're twenty my age or whether you're forty or fifty or sixty or Seventy you can still be sitting there and thinking\nOh okay I see exactly what they're saying\nYou know that thing that mom or dad always used to say it has some relevance or even coach or the teacher\nI mean I'm Still seeing the people in my life that have lived through that you know keep using these cliche phrases they mean something right like when people say humor is a defense mechanism I wouldn't say it's a defense but I can see the point like I I Do honestly think that that is very valid\nWell you can be defensive or in that manner using humor ... by putting distance in between you and the person\nAnd that's why I said I can see it I just like the phraseology of distance better but that's just semantics you know so I can see the humor is a defense argument clearly um but I just I thought that was interesting because we've had a couple of these on the show or you know we come in and we talk about it and I keep seeing more and more of these things that we're told\nAnd I feel like it's specifically from um virtuous or biblical influences in our lives you know a lot of things that society tells me when I actually sit back and think about it I go I don't know what I I don't know if I agree with that\nAnd then a lot of that a lot of times I have the same feelings\nSo I don't know what I don't know if I agree with that\nAnd then a lot of that a lot of times I have the same feelings\nWhen it comes to what other people tell me the from the biblical virtues standpoint but when I sit down and think about it I'm like well they got a point but what society I hardly ever come to that understanding I don't agree with a lot of arguments society makes that's another point altogether eight six six five\nFive one Ninety nine thirty thriller type out of these phones is going to my phone line one measure of how you doing well maybe if we can get the phone call Jim ... know can you bring up oh there is a matter of how you doing\nThere you are doing All right so [noise]\nMurder view of mess up both of our names this morning I'm about to drop your mum him I had to even it out [laughter] no [laughter] I Know it just didn't how're you doing man Monday morning\nA ads Monday that's for sure whether\nYou're talking about marriage and the interesting thing with marriage and I don't know if you know specifically the statistics on it you know last time I looked at him and it's been several years I I'm sure they've updated it but roughly\nThirty to force them originally and thirty or forty percent of the first time marriages actually end in divorce\nYeah now it's up to around ... to sixty\nReally\nYeah it's a past half it was around for like three or four years ago which was the last time that I looked\nYeah it's but it's the same people getting divorced\n[laughter] fair that he could be made you know ...\nThat and that's what I'm saying that the actual first time marriages\nOh I was saying okay I looked at the divorce rate ... time divorce rate okay I see what you're saying right and in my way to do\nSo and that's what I'm saying it you know when I looked at it the last time several years ago was sixty five thirty five but as you know I'm sure there's room for error an adjustment there but\nUh\nThat you know that thirty five just use that number that thirty five percent that got divorced or the same ones getting divorced over and over and over again yeah they never deal with their issues personally so when they move into their next marriage they ended up getting divorced I got a friend of mine\nThere on our third I get to friends of mine on the third marriages yeah you know it's the same because they never face their issues\nAnd and so do you think that would alter the discussion\nOver whether or not monogamy is a a a thing or not\nYeah and I I think that so there's two arguments that I can see\nRight there there's an argument that I can see that says are not arguments either I'd go you know being hypocritical ended up myself was to discussion points that I can see stemming from that initial point and that is one of them being so is that is the case\nWhere people in the past right just holding\nOn and working through relationships that now we see a silly right where they just over working in over trying for something that really didn't deserve to be tried for right because of the fact that that was the social norm of the time or be are we getting into a generation that is weaker\nAnd has this idea that has um a\nLike this um participation trophy generation where any type of hardship or any type of loss is just considered absolutely awful and everything has to be our gratification and so when we're in a relationship and we at one point that doesn't gratified as to the most intense amount than we just say okay I'm done with this\nI I can see that yeah my my grandparents both my grandfathers were alcoholics and um my father's father died when he was sixty hours and ...\nMy grandparents both my grandfathers were alcoholics and um my father's father died when he was sixty hours in a little little little kids hadn't known that well but my mother's father I ended up knowing real well these lived on into his eighties ... but\n... you know neither one of my grandmother's ever left their husbands and they put up with alcoholism they put up with everything I mean it was my father's mother that taught him how to sew football yeah 'cause my grandfather was drunk so\nYeah you know looking at my mother and I love her to death but my parents got divorced when I was three yeah so you know it was I can see that argument of you know she's sitting there seven\nYears in which they that's another part of the statistic is a\nFirst time divorces usually happen before seven and a half years so if you make it to seven and a half years yeah you've beat the statistics and your first marriage yeah so that was my mother like seven years my mother and father got divorced when I was three mhm which my father was not an alcoholic but\nYou know and again the hardships came up the disagreements came up\nAnd the attitudes came up and instead of working through it you know in order then part of that might be a social ... being ostracized socially ... getting a divorce\nOr you know because that's what I'm saying back back in the day you know at that\nTime a way before your parents like where we got this idea that you know marriage is stay together and this is not talking about what the Bible says because the Bible is very clear on this topic but you know it says\nA ... society said you know you stay with your partner because if you don't then everybody's going to know you know that's Tommy and Jenny they got the divorce but now are we getting into an age where it's almost more acceptable\nAnd therefore people are like okay I don't have to put up with stuff that is absolutely ridiculous you know I don't have to put up with hardships that oh no sane person should\n... and I you know and again in cases of abuses and that sort of thing I could absolutely see getting out of a divorce yeah are ... getting a divorce and get out of her marriage but here's the thing though is just like morals everybody talks about oh you can be good person and not going to church and not have more to have morals and all this other jazz\nBut the whole idea of marriage and I realized that you know some sort of union is common across all cultures even outside of Christianity yeah\nBut from a Christian perspective on a nation built on Judeo Christian values that's where you get the ... and still value of keeping your marriage together ... and as we
