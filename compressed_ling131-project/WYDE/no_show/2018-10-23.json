outside\nUm so that's where we are Randy before we get to ... go ahead\nAnd just you know a lot of people down here in South Texas that are very concerned about this and we keep seeing some of the media and say let's go and nobody is even tell estrogenic coaches so ticked ourselves and our property in our family\nAnd it's a big concern you know their safety or safe to eat it just isn't going to

know there's only one way to stand up against it and you know nobody's tell us what's right and wrong and basically we're going to do things the way that we feel have to be\nTaking care of to protect

that are in coal Keating American history and uh Craig surely is with us now\nHistorian extraordinary author a founder of ah surely bends for public affairs and dish and everything else he does a but

they would ... you know welcome them in give them food shelter tell him to stay a while would they of course not welcoming loud\nThough of course not and we know or you know the answer of uh Mexico when they invaded there a country is is that the assaulted the police officers there well first of all we need to stop calling this a caravan of ... justice is\nFun comical or ... or ... you know a circus or something like this this is a mob of illegals that's all it is no no better no more no\nInvasion it's an invasion\nPrecisely and these everybody everybody as a member of Congress swore an oath to protect the United states gets all enemies foreign and domestic\nRight from the president on down every member of Congress they are a duty bound to protect this country against all enemies foreign and domestic and these these are illegal and if they cross the border than their enemies that's all there is to it and if they're not and they should resign their office\nI think again the fact that we are not all hands on deck to stop this right and that I mean the president is apparently the only person willing to really hold is what it is\nWe don't violate the immigration laws of Guatemala Mexico ... ignore the rule of law in are about to do it in this country right what what are you better than the old or they're not criminals well ... well [laughter] they have no respect for country's sovereignty or borders ...\nWhich makes them criminals that de facto makes them criminals and that's why\nA gotta stop treating this as a PR disaster this is you know for a political standpoint this is this matter from heaven for people like yourself myself others\nWho are concerned about the sovereignty this country now we've got now instead of a trick or them you know sneaky over under the cover of darkness or climbing fences or whatever now I've got an open massive out in the daily invasion if this doesn't\nScare the bejesus out of middle America that nothing will\nRun again we want we want people\nTo come to our country who respected enough to ... do not violate law the first chance again or game the system that is in you know is to gain the system as it's as it exists anyway well this is talk now is if you want to claim asylum you\nCome here you you go to a port of entry and you say I claim asylum then we'll have to process them into the country then we do know beds for them so we release some most of them don't show up that's it but\nI but I but I wouldn't I I don't like the word asylum because asylum to me means somebody\nIn the United states because of political oppression\nIs that these people are not politically oppressed this there's no such thing as economic asylum only political asylum and so if you come here for the goodies for the free stuff for the handouts for the welfare for the food stamps is that you're not coming here for asylum you're just coming here to to you know uh to you know to ponder\nThe free stuff for the handouts for the welfare for the food stamps is that you're not coming here for asylum you're just coming here to to to you know to you know pond yourself up on society without giving anything back with these people were water than the old country anyway but the fact is is that they need to go back\nWell and again uh the president\nSeems to have the pulse of the people again better than any other American politician on this\nYeah I mean I'm Talking I was I was a shopping with the kids over the weekend\n[noise] and you know I'm In my my mom\nSoccer clothes and have my son got his on the nobody knows why

the same right where I live to is is that we're we're grocery stores we can listen to people everybody's talking about this and it was outraged about there's nobody is no reason for this except for the elites but the funny thing is that at least never let these illegals into the neighborhoods anyway\nNo bingo well they want they they don't want their classrooms filled with people who speak multiple languages don't speak English\nWas no they don't want to back yards yes\nThey're all private private schools\nAs it has nothing to do with skin color where you come from a ... has everything to do with the fact that\nThis becomes a burden on the system if you don't have an orderly process of immigration puree like in ... and it's it's just absurd let's let's I Wonder\nIf that's the thing Trump needs to ram home and the Republican Party and anybody concerned about the rule laws every one of these people in this movable mob of illegals could apply for citizenship all they have to do is go through the process\nNo they don't want to do the ... I don't have time it's too dangerous in my home country but that's not you know that is not a justification for asylum because your country is corrupt well welcome to most of the world\nYes except precisely then go back and change your government\nNo no one wants to go back and change of government they want to just you know get on and get into the\nMovable mob I liked that movable mob a mobile mob it's a mobile moms\nMobile mob is even better [noise] uh this is what they want you run a caravan is kind of a fun\nRollicking group of cloud who wouldn't want a caravan right now we all want to ... sounds like a lot of foreign let's caravan to the football game that means you've got three cars we're also following each other you know their tailgate ah yeah that's\nA David in North Carolina with Craig surely hear David go ahead\n[noise] [noise] Hi I'm Laura we need to Scott ... of the rhetoric or the laughter and calling for care of their yeah you're you're in Beijing\nYeah I think look that's occurred just said and I'm going to start doing that going forward it's not going to be carrying around this is a mobile mob\nA crack I'm going to play something from your dear friend John ...\nWho has moved so far left now that he's on a regular panelist on MSNBC this is what he said about the Democrats' chances of a massive blue waves wave now slipping away\nBecause of cabin on probably this immigration and these great numbers on the economy that came out today with Trump's approval Republicans approval way way out [noise] um let's listen\nTrump is not a wholly new force in American politics he's\nBut he is the most vivid manifestation of many of our worst characteristics you know the constitution was written for moments like this it assumed that we we're sinful and driven by ambition and appetite and greed is why they made it so hard for us to get anything done [laughter] they basically\nIt assumed that we we're sinful and driven by ambition an appetite and greed is why they made it so hard for us to get anything done they basically bad that we would get things wrong more often than we get\nThem right and we have proven them correct or with with astonishing regularity reaction to that\nBut I I agree with his analysis of the constitution but to what end to what point I don't understand the point he was making is is that what is Trump gun to violate the constitution sounds like Trump is supporting the constitution that's the liberals who were were ... were were opposing the constitution so I don't understand I don't understand his point\nNo I I again it's we're sinful because we elected Trump that's it that's why we're sinful and not want to do because of of all this other stuff that happened and criminality and pornography and all the other things that we've embrace were simple because we elected Trump\nBy the way just a racket I think the ah the blue wave is going to turn out to be a a a leaky faucet\nBut ah\nI I just there's nothing I sense out their law there's no you remember Ninety four you could feel I mean I felt that there was an upheaval coming against Clinton and the elites are just everywhere as the Republicans were dominating\nEach year that includes boys and girls every age every type and level of sport\nIsn't always clear that a player has had a concussion so parents athletes and coaches need to learn about concussions signs and symptoms the American Academy of neurology recommends athletes start to have a concussion be immediately removed from place\nAnd not returning until assessed by health care professional trained in concussion this isn't just about sports [noise] it's about your brain when in doubt sit it out [noise] learn more at A.

so it doesn't affect them at all [noise] but it is a big issue for the rest of the country you're listening to the Laura Ingraham show eight five five forty Laura remember the fact we\nBrought you a last week about how black\nVoters and Hispanic voters in the last CBS Hugo poll on this which was in June kind of at the height of the family crossings family separation issue\nOf the workers that were poll by the CBS poll forty five percent of black voters and forty four percent of Hispanic voters each said that immigration has had a negative impact on their community\nFifty five fifty eight percent of white voters said the same thing sixty seven percent of Republicans sixty one percent of independents\nSay that immigration has changed their area for the worse fifty one percent of voters a said they want their congressional candidate to talk about immigration\nA lot that's fascinating\nLess than ten percent of voters support current levels of immigration to the United states\nOpposed to eighty one percent of voters who support curbing immigration levels that is a Harvard Harris Poll that was done at the beginning of this year a stunning thirty five percent said the levels should be fewer than two hundred and fifty thousand a year that's a quarter\nOf what we allow in legally now\n\nNineteen percent said it should be two hundred and fifty thousand five hundred thousand combined that makes them a majority at least fifty percent\nUh they wanna cut of oh at\nLeast fifty percent to current annual levels of immigration\nJust Nineteen percent of respondents said they want an increase over the current one million people they allow into the country legally see most people just don't know most people you know in the country doing other things maybe they're not listening to the show they're not\nThey're not on these topics but suddenly they say why things seem to be changing around here\nI mean now you have to let you have to know Spanish to get certain jobs in certain industries by the way one of the guys they interviewed on the ah the thing I tweeted out last night in the LA Times article that that's in the LA Times\nToday one of the guys the interview said well I ... I expect to be getting a job in construction very soon well of course why ... unscrupulous builders hire people coming to the United states who claim they have a skill and who are then brought into a pool of other illegal immigrants who also do these jobs\nBut you think you're getting like this great these great you know artisans\nWell our then brought into a pool of other illegal immigrants who also do these jobs but you think you're getting like this great these great artists and there were coming in and doing like the craftsmen building out please\nGive me a break um we're not calling in a caravan any longer\nA but but Bob Bob Bob Let's\nGo to Mike line to Mike real quick ten seconds\nOr you know I'm a when you're just talking about on the African American conservative but when you just talk about African Americans are still were against illegal immigrants these jobs are African Americans used to do\nAre taken over by legal immigrants and we looked at Trump for that\nWell good ... spread the word Mike spread the word in your community we have a lot more to get you coming up Marsha Blackburn going to join us\n\n\nThe following is not an actor but a real life story from trinity debt management and I had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't have my ... I was feeling so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and contacted trinity\nIs your view on this\nYou know are there is a right way and a wrong way to do just about everything and there is a great way to come to this country and there is a long way and they are going about is a long way if they want to seek political asylum there is a process for doing that and we know\nThat it is important that we defend our southern border and when you talk to all of our border patrol agent said talk about the necessity\nOf doing that and I think it's in theory if that is we\nMake certain our border is secure I encourage Mexico to make certain that they're border is secure and that they are protecting their sovereignty will cause\nThis is not something that you know people entering by force is not something that we should\nView as being an acceptable process\nWell this is what your opponent said about you and immigration let's listen\nTo opponents whose first you do this you know take no prisoners very partisan way of looking at the world's he brings a very good at it and I just tell people that's what I was I'm not for a guy\nJoyce I'm uses you want to move things forward makes a compromise is trying to get free of racial healthcare and all these big issues with one of them will be real pleased people's honestly one more time\nOh here's the had eight years of Obama what did they did they must have our healthcare system and we did catch and release yeah so what does he talking about\nWell you know just this this is going to be language that you hear from liberal\nWhen they don't want to stand on constitutional principles and we hear it over and over I have one of the most bipartisan\nRecord of accomplishment of anyone in the house and I continued to stand on constitutional principles I Believe in those first principles and I'm going to continue to fight for\nFace family freedom hope an opportunity I Do it every single day and one of the things that we ought to be doing is protecting our nation's sovereign Kate and protecting our borders securing the southern border\nOr send my opponent said he sought building a wall along the southern border was political theater when\nHe was governor he gave valid state issue taxpayer paid for driving certificates to fifty one files and illegal aliens he they tend to see a haven for illegal aliens and our general assembly stepped in and stopped that policy\nAnd got rid of it but yes it's the difference I Believe in building a wall he thinks it's political theater I fought against when I was in the state Senate giving any kind of valid state issue id to illegal aliens he gave them\nThose certificates and I believe we need to end all sanctuary city policy I think we need to end chain migration I think we need to end this diversity lottery\nAnd I believe we need to end all sanctuary city policy I think we need to end chain migration I think we need to end this diversity lottery and I think Phil Bredesen somebody there at the border welcoming dental giving them\nA state issued id and of course we know the Washington Democrats are the ones that want to abolish eyes open up our borders so I say let's stand firm on this essay what makes certain deceased care of and now they cannot just come walking into our country and receiving benefits\nTennessee and want to see us to deal with the gangs with drug traffickers sex traffickers human draft traffickers and secure the border\nWell again we're getting reports from rural Virginia I'm this is you know rural Virginia down south West Virginia or illegal immigrants there are\nAgain demanding services go off and getting paid cash\nOr and this undermines us a worker of all backgrounds legal immigration legal immigrants and and the like and I think people are beyond fed up with us and how it has to stop a congresswoman Blackburn what ... what will you\nAnd in in the Senate demand of Mitch McConnell what should be done because Republicans have had two years to get this thing\nSquared away and didn't do anything which I'm personally live at about but there's there's no reason this mobile mobs should be making their way through Mexico if we'd handled this asylum issue properly and close these loopholes and funded this wall\nWell you're exactly right and of course my doctor legislation\nHas passed twice in the house but we couldn't get the Senate to take that up and that is a good place to start and to remind people is that is in executive Menlo program that is not something that was passed by Congress and passed into law\nSo it dealing with those issues funding the wall I Am so putting that money on the timetable and developing a timetable for securing that southern border you know ... you realize walls work anybody doubts that go talk to Israel\nWalls work and what we're trying to do is to keep people out of our country\nThat ought not to be here to keep these gangs out to our country I met with say an angel on the other day and Upper East Tennessee and our heart is broken her thirty seven year old daughter was killed by an illegal alien who had had several\nRun ins with law enforcement\nAnd of course her daughter is she did she is retiring this grandson and that illegal alien went back to Mexico and\nThis is not it's it's not right and for these families they want to see justice they want to make certain that we do you verify that employers are held responsible\nFor those that are illegal in the country and are working in West and mushy I talked to a guy who has a a brick and mortar date a business and\nHe was talking about his masonry business and how difficult it is for him his son to get work now because they're being under the bed by those that are coming in the country illegally and do the job and many times it is an inferior\nRough totally and yeah and then he and his sons go in and do it\nWell totally is and\nAnd then he and his son go in and do it\nRight but he said you know England these big jobs for he and his sons to keep them they simply business in in key or to keep it growing again\nAnd so these are real issues and I will tell you this I think when people look at the immigration issue\nThey see it as a security issue we're having the border secured every child support or to them every state supporter state and it's one of the fraternal order of police has endorsed to me and my grandson tough on crime tough on trafficking truck got\nTough on the drug issue the immigration issue and\nPeople see it as a security issue they see it as an economic issue they see it as an issue that affects them and their community against the law enforcement personnel that are working to keep their community safe\nWell and again uh we're talking to Marsha Blackburn here on the Laura Ingraham show we hit\nThe issue of immigration and now the issue of the economy the Republicans are leading by\nA record Fifteen ... percentage points against the Democrats in this mid term cycle of that is music to my ears President Trump promised he was going to do certain things and he's done them including on trade and all the Republican establishment was against what he was doing on trade\nHe they have a ... I think they have one of the largest gaps in history also on trade meaning people are embracing what the Republicans are doing this is the new NBC Wall Street Journal poll a congresswoman Blackburn and and it it's bearing fruit we're seeing the the results of sticking with this more American focused\nTax cuts pick on China get more manufacturing it home and it's working\nWell it is working and I'm not a fan of tariffs I like free and fair trade\nAnd in West Tennessee where I Am right now we're our farmers our sleeping farmers are incredibly concerned about what he's going to end up happening with China but here's the thing China China a trade war on us for decades\nCongress on how do you expect to win the trade war with China without terrorists because if we had been able to do that we would have done that by Twenty years ago right\n\nThat's right and so what they will say is if\nWe're in a war we got to be sure we win this war\nAnd it brought us what they want to do and they want to make certain that the price so that is tough on China they than stealing our intellectual property say than reverse engineering is they have been taking American Jobs and our phone urged will say okay\nWe get it but we've got to have some great leaflets they sure we win this trade or and that we open up markets today are encouraged by the U.S in the way they are encouraged that the EU is structuring their agreement and that's a cable with talks now\nDid you do that over a million athletes suffer concussion each year that includes\nBoys and girls every age every time the level of sport\nIt isn't always clear that the players had a concussion so parents athletes and coaches need to learn about concussion signs and symptoms the American Academy of neurology recommends athletes thought to have a concussion be immediately removed from place\nAnd not returning to obsessed by health care professional trained in concussion this isn't just about sports [noise] about your brain when in doubt sit at a learned more an A.

saying that somehow the Democrats are involved in making this happen or it is it is a pretty on the hands rhetoric but it is something we've come to see if the president because he is so\nInformed by conservative media or frankly\nI was a misinformed by conservative media [laughter]\nOh you mean the fact that we point out that thousands of people actually violated the immigration laws of Guatemala\nKnocked through barricades and violated the immigration laws of Mexico including injuring a Mexican police who were by the way unarmed\nThis is ours were taking it we're taking the fans were taken this barricade we're not stopping now what is that again what would you do if this were your own house if this were your own home\nWhat would you do what would you just allow this tell me I Want to hear if all these people who say these are not criminals what would they do if this were their home\nCriminals are not criminals eight five five forty Laura [noise]\nUh this is just completely ridiculous you know the answer is they wouldn't have them immediately arrested and they would want them prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law do\nYou think of\nZuckerberg would want to find out what their motivations were\nBefore he had them removed from his compound member he bought for lots around him\nAround his property he bought all the other homes around him we did that whole report years ago when he did that now he's all for open borders but he he bought all the homes around him so he could establish a perimeter he and his wife and his kids\nYou can't blame 'em he's one of the richest men in the world and he wants safety and security but you little people aren't supposed to have that little people are just supposed to deal with that\nDonald Trump has got to enforce this border if it means sending the U.S National Guard at the border you must do it but I'm telling you something Mexico's going to blow up this trade deal they're going to blow up this trade deal if they don't handle this right\nYou got to handle it and the un I Love that were calling in the UN to help you know the UN's gonna do UN's going to pick up the people and disperse them including into the

America some will go to England others will go to you know lord knows where it what is China\nAnd they know that you went to pick them up then they'll send a number of them will go to the U.S others

[noise] uh we have a lot to get to a ... going to join us in just\nA moment I'm\nRandy in Texas on line five were there is going to be a massive rally\nIn Houston tonight they had to move Venus a because there's so many people signed up over a hundred thousand people signed up to attend the Trump rally initially it was going to be like a thousand then it was seven thousand now it's Seventy thousand they can't they don't have a venue for all hundred thousand so some are going to have to stay outside\nUm so that's where we are Randy before we get to ... go ahead\nAnd just you know there's a lot of people down here in South Texas ... that are are very concerned about this and we keep saying this on the media and see what's coming and nobody's even telling us are trying to coach is somehow ticked ourselves and our property in our families and\nAnd it's a big concern you know their safety or safe to eat it just isn't gonna work force and um\nYou know what are we going to do when they get here and the crow in our finances and coming to our property in our ranchers they have access to our houses are bars are tractors vehicles and\nYou know there's only one way to stand up against it in you know nobody's telling us what's right and wrong and basically we're going to do things the way that we feel has to be\nTaking care of to protect ourselves\nAnd uh there's no concern for that\nNo American people you are you basically\nJust have to suffer you have to suffer for the dream of open borders so Democrats will have more democratic voters and the chamber of commerce will have cheap migrant labor\nThey want cheap labor they want to never ending flow of cheap labor which ultimately ensure that we lose America\nPeriod that's just that's just it\nWe don't have public schools that are inculcated in American history and uh Craig surely is with us now historian extraordinary author a founder of ah surely bands for public affairs and dish and everything else he does a but Craig the more I\nSee this this coverage is sob story coverage\nOf the caravan the more I think about what these individuals' would do if someone breached their threshold in their own homes and whether they would ... you know welcome them in give them food shelter tell him to stay a while\nWould they not welcome were allowed\nIt though of course not and we know the answer of Mexico when they invaded their country is is that the assaulted police officers there well first of all we need to stop calling this a caravan of care of his justice is fun comical or ... or a car you know a circus or so is this\nThis is a mob of illegals that's all it is no no better no more no\nInvasion it's an invasion\nPrecisely and these everybody everybody is a member of Congress swore the oath to protect the United states gets all enemies foreign and domestic\nRight from the president and out every member of Congress they are a duty bound to protect this country against all enemies foreign and domestic and up these these illegals and if they cross the border than their enemies that's all there is to it and if they're not and they should resign their office\nI think again the fact that we are not all hands on deck to stop this right and that ...\nI mean the president is apparently the only person willing to really hold is what it is we don't violate the immigration laws of Guatemala Mexico you ignore the rule of law in are about to do it in this country right what what are you but they're all they're they're not criminals well the\nMexico you know one of the rule of law in are about to do it in this country right what what are you but I mean they're all they're they're not criminals well ... well they have no respect for the country's sovereignty or borders period\nWhich makes them criminals that de facto makes them criminals and that's why\nA gotta stop treating this as a PR disaster this is you know for a political standpoint\nThis is this matter from heaven for people like yourself myself others who are concerned about the sovereignty this country now we've got now instead of a trick or them you know sneaky over under the cover of darkness or climbing fences or whatever now got an open massive out in the daily invasion if this doesn't\nScare the bejesus out of middle America that nothing will\nAgain we want we want people\nTo come to our country who respected enough to ... do not violate law the first chance again or game the system that is in\nYou know is the game the system as it's as it exists anyway well the system now is if you want to claim asylum you come here you go to a port of entry and you say I claim asylum then we have to process them into the country then we don't like that for them so we released some most of them don't show up that's it but\nI but I wouldn't I I don't like the word asylum because to me means somebody\nIn the United states because of political oppression\nIs that these people are not politically oppressed this there is no such thing as economic asylum solely political asylum and so if you come here for the good news for the free stuff for the handouts for the welfare for the food stamps is that you're not coming here for asylum you're just coming here to to\nTo you know to you know pond yourself up on society without giving anything back with these people are were water than their own country anyway but the fact is is that they need to go back\nWell and again I'm the president\nSeems to have the pulse of the people again better than any other American politician on this yeah I mean I'm Talking I was I was a shopping with the kids over the weekend\n[noise] and you know I'm In my my mom soccer\nClothes and have my son was on the nobody knows why nobody knows who I Am and my ... with my with my camouflage baseball cap on [laughter] and uh I'm listening to people's conversations about this people are outraged outraged about this\nYeah ... same right where I live to is is that we're we're grocery stores weekend or listen to people everybody's talking about this narratives outraged about this nobody's nobody's ever this except for the elites but the funny thing is it that it leads to never let these illegals into the neighborhoods anyway\nA bingo well they want they they don't want their classrooms filled with people who speak multiple languages don't speak English or grooms\nNo they don't want their backyards yes there are private private schools\nAnd there's nothing to do with skin color where you come from ... has everything to do with the fact that this becomes a burden on the system if you don't have an orderly process of immigration puree like in ... and it's it's just absurd let's let's um I Wonder\nIf that's the other thing Trump needs to ram home and the Republican Party and anybody concern about the rule laws every one of these people in this movable mob of illegals could apply for citizenship all they have to do is go through the process\nNo they don't want to do that they said well I don't have time it's too dangerous in my home country but that's not you know that is not a justification for asylum because your country is corrupt well welcome to most of the world\nYes precisely then go back and change your government\nNo one wants to go back and change of government they want to just you know\nIs corrupt well welcome to most of the world\nYes precisely

by a legal immigration\nAnd I've been saying for weeks now that the cabinet confirmation hearing all weekend and angry silent majority that the left is not anticipating he's not wrong but at what cost the president of the United states is using immigrant families\nFleeing violence and pain than she is not fair among his base at what cost to basic human decency [noise]\n\nIn a kind of liberal la la land would they think immigration is just a Republican issue it affects the poor disproportionately in the United states that affects middle income earners disproportionately in the United states the rich people don't get affected by it [noise]\nThey enforce their borders believe me they enforce their their uh parameters [noise] they have cameras they have their sensors they have their alerts\nOn their phones that if a deer walking walks into their property they get an alert on their phone so it doesn't affect them at all but it is a big issue for the rest of the country you're listening to the Laura Ingraham show eight five five forty Laura remember the facts we brought you\nA last week about how black\nVoters and Hispanic voters in the last CBS or Hugo poll on this which was in June kind of at the height of the family crossings family separation issue\nOf the workers that were poll by the CBS poll forty five percent of black voters and forty four percent of Hispanic voters each said that immigration has had a negative impact on their community\nFifty five fifty eight percent of white voters said the same thing sixty seven percent of Republicans sixty one percent of independents\nSay that immigration has changed their area for the worse fifty one percent of voters a said they want their congressional candidates to talk about immigration\nA lot that's fascinating\nThan ten percent of voters support current levels of immigration into the United states as opposed to eighty one percent\nThat's fascinating less than ten percent of voters\nSupport current levels of immigration into the United states as opposed to eighty one percent of voters who support curbing immigration levels\nThat is a Harvard Harris Poll that was done at the beginning of this year a stunning thirty five percent said the level should be fewer than two hundred and fifty thousand a year that's a quarter\nWhat we allow in legally now\nNineteen percent said it should be two hundred and fifty\nThousand five hundred thousand combined that makes them a majority at least fifty percent\nOr they want to cut of oh at least fifty percent to current annual levels of immigration\nJust Nineteen percent of respondents said they want an\nIncrease over the current one million people they allow into the country legally see most people just don't know most people you know in the country doing other things maybe they're not listening to the show they're not they're not on these topics but suddenly they say why things seem to be changing around here\nI mean now you have to let you have to know Spanish to get certain jobs in certain industries\nBy the way one of the guys they interviewed on the ah\nThe thing I tweeted out last night the LA Times article that that's in the LA Times today one of the guys interview said well I ... I expect to be getting a job in construction very soon well of course why on ... unscrupulous builders hire people come into the United states who claim they have a skill\nAnd who are then brought into a pool of other illegal immigrants who also do these jobs\nBut do you think you're getting like this great these great you know artisans or coming in and doing like the craftsmen building oh please\nGive me a break um we're not calling in a caravan any longer\nA but but Bob Bob ball let's\nGo to Mike Lines to Mike real quick ten seconds\nOr you know um when you're just talking about African American conservative but when you just talked about the African Americans are ...\nOr ... illegal immigrants these jobs in America if you do are taken over by legal immigrants and we look President Trump for their\nWell good ... spread the word Mike spread the word in your community we have a lot more to get to coming up Marsha Blackburn going to join us\n\n\nThe ... but a real life story from community to management and\nI had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't pay my bills I was feeling so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and contacted trinity\nIs your view on this you\nKnow are there is a right way and a wrong way to do just about everything and their mistake right way to come to this country and there is a long way and that you're going about us of our life they want to see political asylum there is a process for doing that and we know\nThat it is important that we defend our southern border and when you talk to all of our border patrol agent they talk about the necessity\nOf doing that and I think it's in theory is that we\nMake certain our border is secure I encourage Mexico to make certain that they're border is secure into the air protecting their sovereignty book cause this is not something that you know people entering by force\nIs not something that we should view as the unacceptable process\nWell this is what your opponent said about you and immigration let's listen\nTo the problem is who's very sting to this um you know take no prisoners very partisan way of looking at the world people are very good at it and I just tell people that were too was I'm not a guy\nYou know you've got a choice if you want to move things forward makes compromise is try to get some solutions for immigration healthcare and all these big issues of events with one of them would be real pleased represent people are trying to say one more time\nOh here's another had eight years of Obama what did they do they must have our healthcare system and we did catch and release so what is he talking about\nWell you know this is this is going to be language that you hear from liberals when they don't want to stand on ...\nWell you know this is this is going to be language that you hear from liberals\nWhen they don't want to stand on constitutional principles and we hear it over and over I have one of the most bipartisan\nRecord of accomplishment of anyone in the house and I continue to stand on constitutional principles I Believe in those first principles and I'm going to continue to fight for\nFace same belief freedom hope an opportunity I Do it every single day and one of the things that we ought to be doing is protecting our nation's sovereignty and protecting our borders securing the southern border\nOr send my opponent said he sought building a wall along the southern border was political theater when he was governor he gave Valley State issue taxpayer paid for driving certificates to sixty one files and illegal aliens he they tend to see a haven\nFor illegal aliens and our general assembly stepped in and stop step policy\nAnd got rid of it but this is the difference I Believe in building a wall he thinks it's political theater I fought against when I was in the state Senate giving any kind of valid state issue id to illegal aliens he gave them\nThose certificates and I believe we need to indulge sanctuary city policy I think we need to end chain migration I think we need to end this diversity lottery and I think Phil Bredesen somebody there at the border welcoming download giving them\nA state issued id and of course we know the Washington Democrats are the ones that want to abolish eyes open up our borders so I say life stand firm on this end to what to make certain that these caravans now they cannot just come walking into our country and receiving benefits\nTennessee and want to see us to deal with gangs with drug traffickers sex traffickers human draft traffickers and secure the border\nWell again we're getting reports from rural Virginia I'm this is you know rural Virginia down in South West Virginia\nOr illegal immigrants there are again demanding services go off and getting paid in cash or and this undermines us a worker of all backgrounds legal immigration\nLegal immigrants and and the like and I think people are beyond fed up with us and how it has to stop a congresswoman Blackburn what ... what will you\nAnd in in the Senate demand of Mitch McConnell what should be done because Republicans have had two years to get this thing\nSquared away and didn't do anything which I'm personally livid about this there's no reason this mobile mobs should be making their way through Mexico if we had handled this asylum issue properly and close these loopholes and funded this wall\nWell you're exactly right and of course my doctor legislation\nHas passed twice in the house but we couldn't get to send it to take that up and that is a good place to start and to remind people to say that is in executive Menlo program that is not something that was passed by Congress and passed into law\nSo it dealing with those issues funding the wall I Am so for putting that money on the timetable and developing a timetable\nYou can go with those issues funding the wall I Am so for putting a that money on the timetable and developing a timetable for securing the southern border you know are you realize walls work anybody doubts that go talk to Israel\nWalls work and what we're trying to do is to keep people out of our country\nThat ought not to be here to keep these gangs out to our country I met with say an angel on the other day an Upper East Tennessee and our heart is broken her thirty seven year old daughter was killed by illegal aliens who had had several\nRun ins with law enforcement\nAnd of course her daughter is she did she is retiring this grandson and that illegal alien went back to Mexico\nAnd this is not it's it's not right and for the families they want to see justice they'd want to make certain that we do eat verify that employers are held responsible\nFor those that are illegal in the country and are working in West Tennessee I talked to a guy who has a a brick and mortar update a business and\nHe was talking about his masonry business and how difficult it is for him his son to get work now because they're being under bid by those that are coming in the country illegally and do the job and many times it is an inferior\nRough totally and\nYeah and then he and his son go in and do it right but he said you know he meets these big jobs for he and his sons to keep their may simply business in in the or to keep it growing again\nAnd so these are real issues and what I Will tell you this I think when people look at the immigration issue they do see it as a security issue not having the borders secured every challenge the border town every state supporter state and it's one of the fraternal order of police\nHas endorsed me and my great some tough on crime tough on trafficking truck on tough on the drug issues the immigration issue and\nPeople see it as a security issue they see it as an economic issue is they see it as an issue that affects them in their community and to law enforcement personnel that are working to keep their community safe\nWell and again uh we're talking to Marsha Blackburn here on the floor and groom show\nWe hit the issue of immigration and now the issue of the economy the Republicans are leading by\nA record Fifteen ... percentage points against the Democrats in his mid term cycle of that is music to my ears President Trump promised he was going to do certain things and he's done them including on trade and all and the Republican establishment was against what he was doing on trade\nHe they have a ... I think they have one of the largest gaps in history also on trade meaning people are embracing what the Republicans are doing this is the new NBC Wall Street Journal\nPoll a congresswoman Blackburn\nAnd and it it's bearing fruit we're seeing the the results of sticking with this more American focused tax cuts pick on China get more manufacturing it home and it's working\n\nWell it is working in I'm not a fan of tariffs I like free and fair trade and in West Tennessee where I Am right now we're our farmers our soybean farmers are incredibly concerned about what he's going to end up happening with China but here's the thing China has headaches\nRight now or our farmers our sleeping farmers are incredibly concerned about what he's going to end up happening with China but here's the thing China China a trade war on us for decades\nCongress on how do you expect to win the trade war with China without terrorists because if we had been able to do that we would have done that by Twenty years ago right\nThat's right and so what they will say is if\nWe're in a war we got to be sure we win this war\nAnd that is what they want to do and they want to make certain that the price that that is tough on China than stealing our intellectual property take them reverse engineering it's very hard in cooking American Jobs and our owners will say oh\nWe get it but we've got to have some great leaflets they sure when this trade war and that we open up markets today are encouraged to project us in the way they are encouraged that the U.
