is a great place to work\nUm I appreciate the call All right well continued take your calls on this coming up we're going to talk about who is funding\nThis migrant caravan which is now supposedly four thousand people strong\nHondurans who make per capita was a two uh two thousand three hundred dollars income\nBut they were they get the money to spend seven thousand dollars a migrant to cross the border eight five five forty lawyer art Arthur will join us a lot more coming up\n\n\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule that is what I had a sinus headache for a few days but I had a massive brain injuries and image of the\nAnd outs called ice and he joins us now art I'm I'm sure you're not surprised that\nAfter we did away with the family separation policy which you know was unpleasant and the media obviously played a big role in\nGetting people are very outraged about that ah that this was going to continue and get worse and indeed we had a thirty eight percent jump in family units crossing the border in the month of August from the month before a so this is no surprise I assume deal\n[noise] no absolutely not a lord ... took this long for a cure it like this to assemble the fact is that you know we see these courts no culturally a spring the president's effort to\nAh cut down on the number of people are coming across the border to detain individuals that your purpose in terms of the United states has to live and work in the United states and you get released\nYou've got all that you want it and it's a it's the center for those individuals her to the states we need to cut off his leg the credits was tempted to do it but Congress has stepped up and you know frankly\nThe polls is all the\nYeah I mean Congress can do a few basic things\nFairly quickly if it wanted to\nTo stop the magnet number one mandate e verify every employer must have e verify and it has to be enforced strictly with significant fines that's one thing they can do what other a few things could they do that are simple for our listeners to understand\nThey could expand the another detention that's available to the administration in order\nA few things today do that are simple for our listeners to understand\nThey could expand the amount of detention that's available to the administration in order to detain these families so that their cases could be hurt quickly so that the good cases can be separated out and said the bat cases could eat that night and those folks can be returned to the United states\nThey could also uh you know change the asylum laws so that if you pass through countries where they granted asylum like Guatemala like Mexico\nThat you would be expected to apply for asylum in those countries before you come to the United states and again you keep hearing that some of these you know individuals have legitimate claims if\nThey do they should be applying for asylum ... they should be applying for asylum Mexico but they're not in addition ah the ah the administration is taking steps to end the floor as a rule where unaccompanied alien a miners have to be released after twenty days\nUm Congress can you know step in they can end the floor as a settlement agreement or if they'd like but again\nThere are free or judges right they're afraid of being called mean spirited that's what they're afraid it doesn't matter if how many instances of hideous you know criminal acts had been committed by illegal aliens even DACA kids which we've also documented on the show doesn't matter\nFor them it doesn't matter I said it's a it's an emotional manipulation game and they want to they want to pull the heartstrings America and put these Republicans back on their heels says okay you wanna put babies in cages you want to put babies how many times did we hear kids in cages kids in cages we heard that phrase over and over and over again\nIn ... we do separate children from adults very briefly a U.S citizenship or a U.S customs and border protection does that in order to protect the children but then we move them very quickly into\nThe best facilities that we have available Congress can provide more money for that but here's really what it comes down to the trip that these people take to the United states is so horrendous\nRapes robberies murders or the Obama administration when they had similar ah programs we saw NPR run articles about this we saw National Geographic of all things\nAre run an article about this but you don't actually hear about that anymore all your little girl at least a pink shirt standing next to her mother crying as border patrol agent\nMake sure that her mother doesn't have any contraband that child traveled through the night without food how in the world any parent can subject their child but this horrendous drone United States is beyond me\nUh when you when you see these four thousand people now just grows and grows and grows this caravan\nWho's paying for this like ... there's no way when you have a per capita income of you know two thousand five hundred dollars in Honduras each individual can pay the seven thousand dollars up to ten thousand dollars it cost to\nGet to the United states so someone's footing the bill here who is it do you think I I\nI Wish I knew I Wish I had some idea and quite frankly I expect administration to be looking into that a lot of these people though are you doing this because they believe that the that the amount of money that they have to borrow or get from somebody or that they're given\nA they can pay back once they work in the United states who are very brief period of time and unfortunately the economics probably working their favorite this is another incentive again went back to verify that people can't work they will come\nAnd if they can't pay back their smugglers are definitely not going to run the risk of being smuggled to the United states we need mandatory verify\nCan't work they will come and if they can't pay back their smugglers are definitely not going to run the risk of being smuggled to the United states\nWe need mandatory verify that's the key is the kingdom but until we get to that point we need to catch that we need more immigration judges to hear these cases as quickly as possible so that a good cases can come in but the vast majority of the bad cases are can be returned\nTo eighty percent or eighty eight percent some I guess some cases by some measures of those who apply for asylum\nFrom Central America are denied yet only five percent of those who are denied actually are you know ever going to leave the country is that the case is that is that a proximity right\nThat's approximately correct we are talking to you know upwards of nine hundred thousand my God we're in the United states\nUnder five orders were ... they received their due process or it's not like they're waiting for their their their hearing everything that they had coming than they've had but they remain in the United states we continue to work here again we have no ... no way to verify that there are leading and\nIce chips lack the resources to go out and find one season to these people\nPlus you you put on top of that the sanctuary laws places like California and localities where you know people under five orders removal\nYou know are apprehended by the police it shows up on the rats sheep that they're under a puddle order removal and yet they get released a in back into society and they're not return to their home countries\nBut everybody needs to work together in order to make the system work with any one part of it breaks down the entire system breaks down and that's what leads to a human tragedy that we see along the border\nMark Krikorian ah your colleagues on a with me last night art and he said that the folks in a Guatemala who are being interviewed by the you know the MSNBC traveling reporter who travels with the migrants\nHadn't been coached yet so all he said was well look I Want to work in the United states in there and just no jobs here and\nNever mention anything about persecution and mark said well that's because he hasn't gotten to Mexico where all the coach coaching really occurs\nThat's where you get do you know the paragraph that you have\nTo say no matter what when when when authorities interview you sell the script for everybody man woman and child seems to be\nThe same and I fear for I think for my family that I'm going to be killed by the gangs which is why sessions wants to remove domestic abuse and gang concern correct from the asylum a consideration\nHe already has done that through a\nHomeland security bill I think it was attached to that bill\nYeah it but you know here's the other problem or this is the next year that's going to drop\nAbout Seventy five to ... percent of all people who claim credible fear than to have credible here even though the asylum numbers or a ... as you mentioned before\nThe problem is that if people allege that they have suffered or fear or something then\nUh they get referred over for torture convention claim back in Nineteen Ninety nine the Reno a Justice Department gave authority over a planes into the convention against torture to immigration judges even though it might be years before an individual's removed from the United states\nDa chess needs to give that authority back to ... or ah the Justice Department needs to give that authority back to the H. S. so that they can make determinations\nWhether someone's going to be tortured white before that person will leave the United states because that's really the critical point\nWell and also a as is here someone else made the point when someone claims\nWhite before that person will leave the United states because that's really the critical point\nWell and also a as is here's someone else made the point when someone claims domestic abuse there is no way for us to verify that even if that was a legitimate reason I'm horrible thing\nBut think about the people were going to be bringing into the country from all over the world it's it's well it's domestic abuse I'm afraid of domestic abuse\nWell it hasn't even been investigated in their home country how are people to investigate a local domestic violence concerns from an immigration proceeding in or review in Texas or Arizona just ludicrous\nIt's even worse than that because there's a regulation of place that actually prevents the United states government investigate it whether or not\nThat claim took place in the home country nothing that's contained asylum application can be disclosed to anyone outside of that asylum proceed with only very limited exceptions none of which would apply in those cases\nAre in the turned back at the border and that's the other thing we have to be able to expedite which means even to non contiguous countries or if you're from Guatemala we need to change the law doing not so we can do immediate border turned backs like we can with Mexicans\nSuffer concussion each year that includes boys and girls every age\nEvery type and level of sport\nIsn't always clear that a player has had a concussion so parents athletes and coaches need to learn about concussions signs and symptoms the American Academy of neurology recommends athletes thought to have a concussion be immediately removed from place\nAnd not returning to assess buy health care professional trained in concussion this isn't just about sports [noise] it's about your brain when in doubt sit it out [noise]\nLearn more at A.

assuming that they do what they need to do which is and they've been very slow out of the big uh Kavanaugh hearings I think of galvanize to even before that\nYou could see that there were voters who are quite concerned with the issue of what I call chaos\nWhen you when you talk to voters about the potential\nThe issue you're talking about his one of the big three I Believe um that worries to immigration you have you know a large majority so huge majorities of people who oppose sanctuary cities who um are are in favor of 'em I mean who oppose\nUm uh uh um uh what's happening\nAt the border who who are worried or you have a belief that the I'm a huge huge majorities Oregon's abolishing ice which has become kind of a overnight in democratic\nParty um doctrine 'em and um and and who believe I'm ... and above twenty twenty margin of people who believe that you know Democrats are\nMore likely basically to favor of the rights of the illegal aliens\nThan they are the rights of citizens it's a theme that Trump has put on this is a big issue and it's across the board um and and um it change moves votes as does the another issue which is important because I Believe\nUm in light of the cabinet off stop these numbers probably already been more important which is the\nWhen the argument that the Democrats if they take the house\nAlready many of them pledge and we now have their chairman hum of there to be chairman and if they win this year in committee I'm sharing that are saying\nWell we're gonna we're gonna impeach cabinet and we're going to impeach Trump we've got all these investigations are a great belief that this will disrupt the economy\nAnd I'm a sense that um this is going to be ... chaotic and that it is going to weaponize the constitution for the purpose of going after unpopular presidents whatever they say we know that that's their agenda\nSome had had a couple of days later said just to recap so you know some issues that would drive Republican turnout in maybe maybe\nEven win over some Democrats\nDr noxious yes but we'll move is the number of Democrats and many independents civil move in the third big issue of course is what the Democrats are doing the Democratic socialism or someone said to me uh you know the Dems as they now refer to them the Democratic impeachment\nMob I'm a party um uh\nAnd you know the repeal they promise to repeal every piece of a or reject every piece of the president's economic policies\nAnd you know the repeal they promise to repeal every piece of a or reject every piece of the president's economic policies\nUm which are booming for most people are at least much more positive than they haven't been in years um these issues in the sense of the Democrats are opting out of the middle one democratic socialism but Hubbard all with the idea of chaos\nYou know whether to bang on windows they are going to disrupt\nThe country in a way that it for two years would be awful for the most people see\nYou know some of the law and order and I'm not as much life now hold on let me just again law and order safety law and order ... the respect um\nRespect yes those are really good terms and then there's the answer is is that they are so far out they are now with their projections of what they want to do or what they're saying saying\nThat this really bothers voters and that is what has been we've been seeing the closing up it is imperative it seems to me that those through what I call that prior to ...\nUm the Democrats have health care and you're not going to take that away from its to light 'em but um except for the fact of what the cost is because that goes again\nYou have a third of more Democrats who oppose the idea of the Democratic party trying to Institute\nA socially the Democratic socialism that bothers people and then the policy does\nOkay this is yeah hold on this is what Nate Silver of course the whole\nYou know he's the he's the ... the statistical a journal and you know he practiced statistical journalism\nUm and he you know he didn't get the production right in twenty sixteen uh but this time he's saying\nPeople should not be that surprised by a Democratic Senate\nOr a Republican House where in dangerous territory from a productive assumption standpoint he set of four and five chance may sound like a done deal but it's simply isn't a and he said it's it just because someone thinks\nSomething is a high probability might be but it doesn't mean it's an inevitable\nFact so when people think it's inevitable that Republicans lose the house and no one isn't enough about it maybe it's likely historically but it's not inevitable and I think that's what a lot of Republicans have to get through their heads\nYes this is why it's still hang 'em I leave it there and it's very hard to be predicted business environment because you don't know what's going to drive\nThis thing at the end we have a the selection that there are many many things that are under law in this election most of all by the way is what like the Trump and sixteen a fear of returning\nThe country to the hands of the political class\nA elites and the\nSense of of losing what progress that has been made and the the that anti\nWashington anti elitism still exist very great with the issue has been from the Republican nationalized the election I still don't think I still think there's more they could do they could run national advertising with these things right\nStop and by the way it's cheaper to do and it's more effective because guess what when you buy network to advertise you to be inside of the shows rather than crammed in the local three minutes five minutes to do with the and in the states with this these commercials you get to stand on your own\nAre the shows rather than crammed in the local three minutes five minutes to do with the and in the states with these commercials you get to stand on Europe but they need to nationalize because then Harris lay off year elections are\nAre off year elections are um tend to be for people who were in the party that the the unhappy the disgruntled people who don't like Trump's trade tweets either\nBut when you put the big issues in front of people are consequences then something happens and I think the Republican doing and all the candidates are doing a better job of frankly the patch and all they have not gotten together\nTo do what they could do 'em to mash can Berger national\nHample I now have not and not just local X amount is\nIs it a national election and people need to understand the choices\nBecause their concerns are very great again Kavanaugh hearings beginning of the Supreme Court the driving people out of restaurants this incivility arguments recipes and had some numbers yesterday that showed overwhelming rejection\nOf the Hillary Clinton proposition ... even split among Democrats\nOr whether or not you know this notion that you can't be civil 'til you when I'm there is and the things at the end they believe by the way by a large a priority that if the Democrats win civility will get worse\nThings will become worse than they are now\nI Want to play a Nancy Pelosi for you on this policy on discussing Trump's desire for a long especially given what we're seeing these new migrants listen\n[laughter]\n\n[noise]\n\nUh manhood issue and and that ties into what an a

the woman you're the one it could also be the year of the man\nOf because well our ... man and masculinity being attacked in the cabin off and all\nYeah so I think there was a backlash I think that there is certainly a gender gap that goes both ways and the men are and and again I come back to it's not just rubbing up the Republican base there are huge numbers of independents remember the Trump carried\nIn twenty sixteen and a large share of Democrats who are not happy with the way things these these the prospects are going and it isn't heritage really that those voters as well as the

which you know what's unpleasant and the media obviously played a big role in\nGetting people are very outraged about that ah\nThat this was going to continue and get worse and indeed we had a thirty eight percent jump in family units crossing the border and the month of August from the month before a so this is no surprise I assume deal\n[noise] no absolutely not a lawyer and actually an source but it took this long for a cure of and like this to assemble the fact is that you know we see these courts no constantly a hair bring the president's efforts to\nAh cut down on the number of people are coming across the border to detain individuals that your purpose and come to the United states has to live and work in the United states and you get released\nYou've got to let you want it and it's a it's an incentive for those individuals to curb to the United states we need to cut off those Meg that's the president has attempted to do it but Congress has stepped up the task and [noise]\nYou know the frankly the fault is on them\nYeah I mean Congress can do a few basic things\nFairly quickly if I wanted to\nTo stop the magnet number one mandate e verify every employer must have e verify and it has to be enforced strictly with significant finds that's one thing they can do what are they are a few things today do that are simple for our listeners to understand\nThey could expand the amount of detention that's available to the administration in order to detainees families so that their cases could be hurt quickly so that the good cases can be separated that circa ... cases could eat that night and those folks can be returned to the United states\nThey could also uh you know change the asylum laws so that if you pass through countries where they granted asylum like ... like Mexico that you would be expected to apply for asylum in those countries before you come to the United states\nAnd again you keep hearing that some of these you know individuals have legitimate claims\nIf they do they should be applying for asylum Guatemala they should be applying for asylum let's hope but there are in addition ah the ah the administration is taking steps to end the floor as a rule where a company daily in a miners have to be released after twenty eight days\nUm Congress can step in and they can end the floor as a settlement agreement or if they'd like but again\nThere are free or judges right they're afraid of being called mean spirited that's what they are ... and it doesn't matter if ... how many instances of hideous you know criminal acts had been committed by illegal aliens even DACA kids which we've also documented on the show doesn't matter\nFor them it doesn't matter it's it it's a it's an emotional manipulation game and they want to they want to pull the heartstrings America and put these Republicans back on their heels says okay you want to put babies in cages you want to put babies how many times that we hear kids in cages kids in cages we heard that phrase over and over and over again\nIn ... we do separate children from adults very briefly a U.S citizenship or a U.S customs and border protection does that in order to protect the children but then we move them very quickly into\nThe best facilities that we have available Congress can provide more money for that but here's really what it comes down to the trip that these people take to the United states\nSo we have available Congress can provide more money for that but here's really what it comes down to the trip to these people take to the United states is so horrendous\nRapes robberies murders under the Obama administration when they had similar ah programs we saw NPR run articles about this we saw National Geographic of all things\nAre run an article about this but you don't actually hear about that anymore all you see a little girl in a pink shirt standing next to her mother crying as border patrol agent\nMake sure that her mother doesn't have any contraband that child traveled through the night without food how in the world any parent can subject their child but this horrendous drone United States is beyond me\nUh when you when you see these four thousand people now just grows and grows and grows this caravan\nWho's paying for this like there's no way when you have a per capita income of you know two thousand five hundred dollars in Honduras each individual can pay the seven thousand dollars up to ten thousand dollars it cost to\nGet to the United states so someone's footing the bill here who is it do you think\nI I I Wish I knew I Wish I had some idea and quite frankly I expect administration to be looking into that a lot of these people though are you doing this because they believe that the that the amount of money that they have to borrow or get from somebody or that they're given\nA they can pay back once they work in the United states for a very brief period of time and unfortunately the economics probably working their favorite this is another incentive again went back ... verified that people can't work they will come\nAnd if they can't pay back their smugglers are definitely not going to run the risk of being smuggled to the United states we need mandatory e verify that the keys the kingdom but\nUntil we get to that point we need the tension that we need more immigration judges to hear these cases as quickly as possible so the uh the cases can come in but the vast majority of the bad cases are can be returned\nTo eighty percent or eighty eight percent some I guess some cases by some measures of those who apply for asylum\nFrom Central America are denied yet only five percent of those who are denied actually are ever going to leave the country is not the case is that is that a proximity right\nThat's approximately correct we're talking to you know upwards of nine hundred thousand my God\nWe're in the United states under fire orders for mobile they received their due process or it's not like they're waiting for their their their hearing\nEverything that they had coming to them they've had but they remain in the United states we continue to work here again we have no ... no way to verify that there are leading an ice chips lacks the resources to go out and find one season Tuesday's or people\nPlus you you put on top of that the sanctuary laws places like California and localities where you know people under ... orders of removal\nYou know are apprehended by the police it shows up on the rats sheep that they're under a puddle order removal and yet they get released a back into society and they're not return to their home countries\nBut everybody needs to work together in order to make the system work with any one part of it breaks down the entire system breaks down and that's what leads to a human tragedy that we see along the border\nMark Krikorian ah your colleagues on a with me last night art and he said that the folks in a Guatemala who are being interviewed by the you know the MSNBC traveling reporter who travels with the migrants\nHadn't been coached yeah so all he said was luck I Want to work and then I\nIf you know the MSNBC traveling reporter travels with migrants\nHadn't been coached yet so all he said was luck I Want to work in the United states in there and just no jobs here and never mentioned anything about persecution and mark said well that's because he hasn't gotten to Mexico where all the ... coaching really occurs\nThat's where you get do you know the paragraph that you have to say no matter what when when when authorities interview so the script for everybody man woman and child seems to be the same and I fear for I think from my family I'm going to be killed by the gangs which is why sessions\nWants to remove domestic abuse and gang concern correct from the asylum a consideration\nHe already has done that through a homeland\nSecurity bill I think it was attached to that bill\nYeah but you know here's the other problem or this is the next year that's going to drop\nAbout Seventy five to ... percent of all people who claim credible fear than to have credible here even though the asylum numbers or a ... as you mentioned before\nThe problem is that if people allege that they have suffered or fear or something then\nUh they get referred over for torture convention claim back in Nineteen Ninety nine the Reno a Justice Department gave authority over a claims that of the convention against torture to immigration judges even though it might be years before an individual's removed from the United states\nDa chess needs to give that authority back to er at the Justice Department needs that authority back to the H. S. so that they can make a determination whether someone's going to be tortured white before that person will leave the United states because that's really the critical point\nWell and also a as is here someone else made the point when someone claims domestic abuse there is no way for us to verify that even if that was a legitimate reason I'm horrible thing but think about the people were going to be bringing into the country from all over the world it's it's well it's domestic abuse I'm afraid of domestic abuse well\nIt hasn't even been investigated in their home country how are people to investigate local domestic violence concerns from an immigration proceeding in or review in Texas or Arizona it's just ludicrous\nIt's even worse than that because there's a regulation replace that actually prevents the United states government investigate it whether or not that claim took place in her country nothing that's contained asylum application can be disclosed\nTo anyone outside of that asylum proceed with only very limited exceptions none of which would apply in those cases\nAre in the turned back at the border and that's the other thing we have to be able to expedite which means even to non contiguous countries or if you're from Guatemala we need to change the law doing not so we can do immediate border turned backs like we can with Mexicans\nSuffer concussion each year that includes boys and girls every age every type and level of sport\nIt isn't always clear that players had a concussion so parents athletes and coaches need to learn about concussions science and symptoms the American Academy of neurology recommends athletes thought to have a concussion be immediately removed from place\nAnd not returning to assess buy health care professional trained in concussion this isn't just about sports it's about your brain when in doubt sit it out [noise]\nLearn more at A.

you know a large majority so huge majorities of people\nWho oppose sanctuary cities who um [noise] uh are in favor of 'em I mean we'll pose I'm a I'm\nA what's happening at the border who who are worried or you have a belief that the I'm a huge huge majorities Oregon's abolishing ice which has become kind of a overnight it democratic\nParty um doctrine 'em and um and and who believe I'm ... and above twenty twenty Martin and people who really but you know Democrats are\nMore likely basically to favor of the rights of the illegal aliens than they are the rights of citizens it's a theme that Trump is put on this is a big issue and it's across the board um ... and um it change moves votes as does the another issue with you\nIt's put on this is a big issue and it's across the board um ... and um it change moves votes as does the another issue which is important because I Believe\nUm in light of the Kavanaugh stop these numbers probably are even more important which is the\nWell the argument that the Democrats if they take the house\nAre already many of them pledge and we now have their chairman I'm up there to be chairman and if they win this year in committee I'm sharing that are saying\nWell we're gonna we're gonna impeach cabinet we're going to impeach Trump we've got all these investigations are a great belief that this will disrupt the economy and I'm a sense that um this is going to be ... chaotic and that it is\nGoing to weaponize the constitution for the purpose of going after unpopular president whatever they say we know that that's their agenda\n... they made us just to recap so some issues that would drive Republican turnout in maybe maybe even win over some Democrats\nDr ... yes but we'll move was the number of Democrats and many independents civil moving the third big issue of course is what the Democrats are doing the Democratic socialism or someone said to me ah you know the Dems as they now refer to them the Democratic impeachment mob\nI'm a party um uh and you know the repeal their promise to repeal every piece of a or reject every piece of the president's economic policies\nUm which are booming for most people are at least much more positive than they have been in years um these issues in the sense of the Democrats are opting out of the middle one democratic socialism but Hubbard all with the idea of chaos\nYou know whether to bang on windows they are going to disrupt\nThe country in a way that it for two years would be awful for the most people see\nYeah some of the law and order and I'm not as much now hold on let me just again law and order safety law and order comedy the respect\nUm respect yes those are really good terms and then there's the answer is is that they are so far out they are now with their projections of what they want to do or what they're saying saying\nThat this really bothers voters and that is what has been we've been seeing the closing up it is imperative it seems to me that those through what I call that prior to ...\nUm the Democrats have healthcare and you're not going to take that away from ... to light 'em but um except for the fact of what the cost is because that goes again\nYou have a third of more Democrats who oppose the idea of the Democratic party trying to Institute\nA socially the Democratic socialism that bothers people and then the policy does\nOkay it is yeah hold on this is what Nate Silver of course the\nWhole you know he's the he's the ... this statistical a journal and you know he practiced statistical journalism um and he you know he didn't get the production right and twenty sixteen uh but this time he's saying\nPeople should not be that surprised by a Democratic Senate or a Republican House where in dangerous territory from a productive\nAssumption standpoint he set of four and five chance may sound like\nOr a Republican House where in dangerous territory from a productive assumption standpoint he set of four and five chance may sound like a done deal but it's simply isn't a and he said it's it just because someone thinks\nSomething is a high probability it might be but it doesn't mean it's an inevitable facts and when people think it's inevitable that Republicans lose the house and no one isn't high enough about it maybe it's likely historically but it's not inevitable and I think that's what a lot of Republicans have to get through their heads\nYes this is why it's still hanging 'em I leave it there must be very hard to be predicted business environment because you don't know what's going to drive\nThis thing at the end we have a the selection that there are many many things that are under along the selection most of all by the way is what like the Trump and sixteen a fear of returning\nThe country to the hands of the political class\nA elites and the sense of of losing what progress has been made and the that that anti\nWashington anti elitism still exist very great with the issue has been from the Republicans can nationalized the election I still don't think I still think there's more they could do they could run national advertising with these things right\nStop and by the way it's cheaper to do and it's more effective because guess what when you buy network advertise you to be inside of the shows rather than crammed into local three minutes five minutes to do with the and in the states with this these commercials\nYou get to stand on your own but they need to nationalize because then Harris lay off year elections are\nAre off year elections are um tend to be for people who were in the party that the the unhappy the disgruntled people who don't like Trump's trade tweets either\nBut when you put the big issues in front of people are consequences then something happens and I think the Republican doing and all the candidates are doing a better job of frankly the patch and all those they have not gotten together\nTo do what they could do to um to Nashville and further national\nHound polite and now we have not and not just local X amount is\nIs it a national election and\nPeople need to understand the choices because there are concerns are very great again Kavanaugh hearings beginning of the Supreme Court the driving people out of restaurants this incivility arguments recipes and have some numbers yesterday that showed overwhelming rejection\nOf the Hillary Clinton proposition all even split among Democrats\nOr whether or not you know this notion that you can't be civil 'til you when I'm there is and the things at the end they believe by the way by large a priority that if the Democrats win civility will get worse\nThings will become worse than they are now\nI Want to play a Nancy Pelosi for you or this is below sea on

that's supposed to show that she's a Cherokee Indian\nOnly to find out that the person they used as their Cherokee stand in for the DNA sample was Colombian or something of that nature I mean it just doesn't get any better than that also talk about a little girl that was um that a court order to be pulled from life support\nWas Colombian or something of that nature I mean it just doesn't get any better than that also talking about a little girl that was um that a court order to be pulled from life support yesterday and there was a court battle to find out what would be the correct way to handle it\nSo we'll have all that coming to you\nToday will also take whatever you want to talk about eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three were just kind of hanging out this morning since the Kavanaugh ah since the Kavanaugh's confirmation has left the news cycle you know it's been very quiet it's been pretty slow\nBut we got some stuff to talk about especially it's always fun to talk when Elizabeth Warren makes a fool of herself so we'll make sure to a cover that eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three is the number to join the conversation but without further ado I got to go to the man with a plan the man that always keeps the show on the road and\nKeeps me relatively in check I think some would say Dylan how you doing this morning\nI'm doing All right now they're not so sleep full restful night\nMe either I'm trying to figure out what's going on here man because\nI lay down stare at the ceiling and I can't sleep and I don't know why 'cause I've been up for like fourteen hours up an active I've been doing stuff but I Can't go to sleep and I don't understand why it's like I Can't turn my brain off it's like I lay there and just stare at the ceiling\nI Need like a remedy I I don't I don't know what to do you know people are like a shot of whiskey and I'm like that doesn't seem healthy you know the the whole night cap thing but then you could also do stuff like this melatonin stuff but I also feel like taking sleeping pills regularly\nUnless you're prescribed them would really hurt you know what I'm saying I don't like taking pills unless you absolutely have to\nThe thing about taking mountain melatonin every not as your body gets used to it and it comes to expect it mhm chef you ever stop you are so much worse off than if you had never started\nExactly and it's like a dependency thing right because I mean it's it's the same argument with taking in any substance you know if you've taken\nCrack cocaine regularly and you try to stop all of a sudden I don't know what it was such a strange ... extreme example this morning we have you taken crack cocaine regularly and you try to stop your body because becomes accustomed to it and therefore you go through\nAre just terrible withdraws I'm kind of a more common one is cigarettes or alcohol um bodies go through the same withdraws for that I Know that all too well\nHad a grandmother that I'm smoked for sixty years and so she was a she smoked since she was a teenager\nAll the way into her late seventies and she tried to quit multiple times and it's just it it truly is an addiction man and once you start you really can't stop because life is just so different without it which is crazy that people are able to sell a product knowing full well that does\nThat you know what I'm saying it seems a bit insane to me\nYeah and the tobacco plants they use to make cigarettes or they have them specifically bred to have more nicotine and be more addictive\nYeah try the American spirits I smoke I smoked menthol American spirits and those are great\nI mean it's very interesting I've always been curious appreciate him or he has her marriage every day\nI don't think I'll ever a\nPickup smoking Dylan but here's something that I Want to know if you've heard and I want to talk about this when we come back I'm deviating but I'm fine with it because I've always wanted to to talk about this and have this discussion\nDid you see are the little vapor thing\nThat looks like a U.S be a fool\nA jewel yeah they're getting sued for millions of dollars because the targeted their advertisements\nTowards teenagers and I don't mean like Nineteen Eighteen I mean like Thirteen fourteen Fifteen they're getting huge blow back in a huge lawsuit against them because they're like the fastest growing product of like twenty Seventeen are twenty eight dean one of the two but in doing\nThat started back in like twenty Thirteen okay yeah whenever whenever they started they were one of the fastest growing products\nReading about this the other day but now they're being sued for millions of dollars because they think that it think about how bad this is you know we've got the truth initiative and all this stuff promoted by the government or the goal is to reduce teen smoking right now is looking up a the stats for Alabama and I'm\nA magic a product that was targeted specifically to the youth how illegal that would be because you can't you can't do tobacco advertisements for like anything anymore to let alone to the youth but in twenty Fifteen fourteen percent of high school students smoke 'em on at least one day\nFor ... for like anything anymore that let alone to the youth but in twenty Fifteen fourteen percent of high school students smoked a on at least one day in the past thirty days nationally the rate was ten percent so Alabama's up around three point two percent above the national\nAverage for teen smoking in for adults smoking it's around\nFour ... four point four percent above the national average um\nBut then the statistics on people that use the date things man I I Do want to talk about that lawsuit when we come back because I Want to learn more about

saying that you're running around well\nNobody really ... low on the ... campaign nobody has to go low on the ... campaign because the ... campaign is not really ...\nI was saying that run around [noise] well [noise]\nNobody really low on the ... campaign nobody has to go low and the ... campaign because the ... campaign is not really making any significant headway\nBut what do they do they decided to go lower than low and then I guess they just decided to uh follow the rule of that irrelevant guy whose name I Can't even remember right now who said when they go low ah we kick them yeah because she medical or he metaphorically kick a governor Kay Ivey yesterday\nWith the re release of a report from twenty Fifteen citing a source who is currently suing a former member of the Alabama government seems like a real credible story there wall you're pulling a play out of the cabinet playbook will get into that a little\nBit later in the show [noise] then we have the Democrats showing their hand not the Democrats are specifically but the left is the far left the progressive quote unquote that are slowly but surely taking over the mainstream Democratic Party and\nThey showed their true an today and we'll get into that a little bit more the Dodgers one last night as a dodger's fan I'm excited one game away from the world series hoping to cook\nClinch that come friday\nElizabeth Warren accused of white privilege we'll talk about why that was off base white privilege doesnt exist and quite possibly the most disgusting story of the Day Lewis Farrah Khan yeah big it's back in the news Louis Farrakhan is in the\nNews because he referred he said he's not an anti Semite he's anti termite equating people of Jewish ancestry to termites yeah you heard right\nYeah we're going to get into that story and yeah we're going to expose him for the overwhelming bigot he is even though the left has an overwhelming love fest with Louis Farrakhan if you remember correctly a prominent members of the women's march she was nothing more than they were radicalized\nWing of the progressive party that's all the women's marches they don't advocate for equality all they do is push political talking points with no basis and they just try to yell louder than anyone else in the room well\nThey back Louis Farrakhan they've sat with Louis Farrakhan they've said he's a a great leader who may be misguided at times he's not a great leader he's an anti Semitic big it and we do not care what he has to say and he should not be given a platform\nHis listen you stop listening to these people they go away to Richard Spencer's of the world they come out and they preach white supremacy you quit listening to these people and they go away but if you give them constant media attention blah\nBlah blah blah blah blah blah they're here to stay and unfortunately when they make a comment of this magnitude we have to talk about it because for some on the left\nThis is still there savior let that sink in right\nFor people on the left specifically in the women's march you know who I'm Talking about that advocate for religious freedom\nAnd freedom and equality for all people back a man who says he's not anti Semite he's anti termite referring to people of Jewish ancestry as termites\nIt is absolutely unbelievable an unconscionable and we're not going to stand for it here but\nI think the story where I Want to start last night as obviously the Dodgers one that was fantastic as somebody who's a dodger's fan you can't get any better than that they're traveling\nI think the story where I Want to start last night is obviously\nThe Dodgers one that's fantastic as somebody who's a dodger's fan you can't get any better than that they're traveling back to the brewers home\nAnd they're going to play the brewers at the brewers home park friday night to try to advance the world series the red Sox won last night if I saw that little news blurb correctly\nThey beat the Astros most people are expecting the Astros to advance a lot of people are expecting the world series to be Astros brewers well my Dodgers are putting up a fight it doesn't look like it's going to be Astros brewers at the moment and knock on wood\nListen I usually agree with a lot of stuff they ... the n._r._a. spokeswoman I think she's very good at what she does and she's very very good at pushing her method regardless of you agree with what she says are not um but she accused Elizabeth Warren of white privilege yesterday\nAnd I don't agree with that\nI Do I I Am from in my belief right the white privilege is a mythical concept\nYour race does not give you elevated privilege in the United states in our modern time that's a fact I don't care what your opinion says your race does not elevate you in any way yet\nSo sorry for the momentary delay ladies and gentlemen were trying not to let it happen\nUm it's just this morning was relatively rough but we're in we're in Studio and we're in Studio because I had a lot of things\nThat made me upset yesterday in the news cycle and it it like especially the I think I'm One of the\nI I think there are two types of people in this world right the people that enjoyed being sick and I don't mean like enjoy physically feeling sick but they like being able to just lay in bed and veggie out and just watch Netflix all day right\nPeople ... there are some people are like that I hate that I feel so lazy\nI feel just like I I get ah my mom says she has some um she has some ailment which I call mythical every time she talked about it 'cause I think it's the most ridiculous thing in the world but she says she has fidgety feet right which is apparently I don't know where your feet start moving I'm like Jesus Caspar the goes like what's taking you over like it's not\nI don't think it's a real thing but\nNevertheless she says she has it and when I get sick I feel like I got that like just my my legs are restless and I'm just like okay I Need to do something so what I typically do is get on and I just start reading the news and I go to my least favorite politicians Twitter pages and just start reading the dumb things that they've said\nWho there was a lot of it that's where the Walt Maddox story came from one of the first Web sites I go to his yellow hammer news dot com go check them out yellow hammer news dot com it also helps with their my bosses so\nThat's the first place that I go but this program is sponsored by yellow haven't presented not sponsored presented by you'll hear news if you want to sponsor the program\nHit me up Jay Baylor cook a Gmail dot com but\nWe uh so I was over on the ... that's where I saw the K ivy story we're Walt Maddox and his campaign went lower than low\nAnd a followed um I still can't remember his name is that a relevant followed the guy that was saying I kick him he needs to come back into the news cycle sometime in the next six months so I can remember his name but I don't feel like you're doing it and he's just out of relevant at this point so\nListen but that's not what we're talking about I got a little off topic what we're talking about right now is another thing I saw which was I also go to some people that I really like like Dana ... sites and Dana Los ... ah posted on her Twitter\nShe said probably the only thing that I think I've ever disagreed with what download said she said I didn't think white privilege existed until I watched Elizabeth Warren give a pass for appropriate given a pass for appropriating a culture\nNow Dylan just off of the bat right me and you kind of think the same thing about this Elizabeth Warren scenario so what do you think of that quote quote I didn't think white privilege existed until I watched Elizabeth Warren given a pass for appropriating a culture what do you think about that\nI don't think it's appropriate and culture really why tell me why because I disagree entirely I mean\nShe was trying to claim that I was part of our heritage because she's very well could have been told by her parents at a young age that a good portion of her heritage was Native American Indian\nBut isn't that by the very essence of ...\nHer parents at a young age that a good portion of her heritage was Native American Indian\nBut isn't that by the very essence appropriating a culture\nNo because you're not appropriate in a culture you're just claiming that you have the heritage mhm\nYeah but she was also writing for so the the reason that this first the story first broke was\nWhen there was stuff that was found that she wrote for a Native American cookbook right and it was like Native American cookbook where it's got Native American food right and then all in Elizabeth Warren put something\nIn there like lobster bisque and I was like yeah the Native Americans of all definitely we're making lobster bisque but I still think like at that I still think there's a twinge of cultural appropriation and like look I think if you're going to apply for a job at Harvard law\nHarvard law and then to a another school in Pennsylvania right I think\nYou got to take a DNA test at some point I'm not convinced that this isn't that because I Know like I have a significant significant significant amount of Native American and me I cannot remember the specific um the specific ah what's the word I'm looking for the specific ratio I Know I Believe you can be for generations removed\nNo two three or maybe it's three three generations removed to receive scholarships at a university level I think I'm either four to five generations removed some still more Native American than Elizabeth Warren but\nNevertheless I had to I ... when I thought about applying\nFor a Native American scholarship right which I I thought about doing you have to be able to substantiate that some of my feeling is if she applied and was granted preference based off of that identification then she had to have known\nAnd if she knew that she was like what one one thousand twenty fourth Native American but isn't that inherently cultural appropriation 'cause she's taking that culture and she's saying because of this you should give me special treatment\n\nDoes it does that make any sense Irma just rambling\nNot make sense uh I'm actually look up exactly all called cultural appropriation isn't worded or during this next break yeah 'cause I'm not sure if that's appropriation or if that's just being ... come\nBack I mean fair fair you're not under oath here I'm not going to invite you for what you say it but just like based on what you know about called her appropriation without going and reading the definition and all that stuff does it sound like cultural appropriation you either either way I don't care I'm just I honestly curious\nIt definitely could be I'm I'm just not personally ... certain odd I just think that makes her life scum bags\nFair fair which I think she was before this so I don't think this is like a big revelation a per se but I think she was alliance come back and you know I find it hilarious right I'm Elizabeth Warren basically her ... her claims of Native American ancestry have been all but this proven\nBut nevertheless she persisted yup hurting here first eight six six five five one\nNinety nine thirty three lesson\nSo I agree with nearly everything Taylor says like I said uh I I think she's a very very very intelligent woman and it's sometimes it's very clear what she's saying to push the n._r._a. viewpoint and I happen to agree with quite a bit of the ... viewpoint I'm\nSo inherently I agree with what she's saying but I Do not think that white privilege exist and I think she just making a joke here about Elizabeth Warren and she's not making a debate for white privilege but I think it's very important that we don't normalized this term on the right right\nExist and I think she's just making a joke here about Elizabeth Warren and she's not making a debate for white privilege but I think it's very important that we don't normalized this term on the right\nRight I think it's very very important that we don't normalize this term on the right because let me be very clear very crystal clear so you can quote me on this in the United states in two thousand eight team there is no such thing as white\nPrivilege any concept\nOr idea to the contrary is false\nThere is economic privilege in this country right there is economic privilege where you could be born into a family that is more well off and therefore you are more well off from the start\nRight there's that however\nThere is no such thing\nAs white privilege because that economic privilege is not dependent upon your race it's dependent entirely upon your income level\nSo I'm not saying there is no privilege you\nKnow in the past when I was younger and I was an ardent Republican that was out debating people I got caught in a Web of my own words and I said something really stupid I said there's no such thing as white privilege and somebody said well are you saying there's no such thing as privileged and I said yeah there's no such thing as privileged that's not true\nThat's that's a young person that's not even in college that hasn't really encountered a debate that got pushed back into a corner and just blurted something out that looking back at it is knowingly an utterly false\nThere is such a thing as a privilege in this country sometimes you're born into a wealthier household it's kind of like a lot of the draw type mentality and that is a privileged aspect but\nThere is no such thing as privilege that is derived from your skin color that's just silly right a lot of these concepts that left is push that give me so irritated I feel like can we not just look at them objectively and say that they're silly because doing what it what do you think about this claim\nNow and if you ... if you disagree with me that's fine but I think there is a solid solid solid solid case for economic privilege but I Do not think in the United states in two thousand Eighteen that there is white\nPrivilege\nSo looking specifically at the hiring process mhm uh and how racism still exists in the minds of\nSome ... ... if you have someone who is inherently racist that ... that has that personal bias against people based on their skin color\nOr doing the hiring looking over their resumes and if there's any kind of pictures with those resumes ...\nThen they're automatically going to throw out or be much harsher on the resumes of the black people ... ... which would be", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "18"}
