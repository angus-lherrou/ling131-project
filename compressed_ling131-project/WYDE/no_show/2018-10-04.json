he was hilarious absolutely hilarious now as they continue to pour over Brett Kavanaugh's notes about beach week or\nTwo I'm Kevin uh we we decided that you know we were partying like every other kid in high school most other kids and you know this is what we did in the eighties\nPeople do different stuff now some still do the same stuff but you know this is this is enough I think a lot of people have seen right through this let's go to\nA militia Missouri line what Melissa\nHi I just wanted to say I'm I've been on both sides I've been in in a doctor fourth position and I've been in jets Kevin opposition where um I was a tax\nSides I've been in in a doctor fourth position and I've been in judge Kevin opposition where um I was attacked I was on the left it in a doctor's office in fact\nAnd then um another time a former friend accused me or spread rumors about me that I was sleeping with her husband and I had no way to protect my reputation\nOn so I Would have believed her if she had come out with Kavanaugh's demeanor and said you creep you did this to me and if he had taken her demeanor and said oh I don't remember I don't remember what I did when I was at high school I Would have put the story but I didn't believe it\nI didn't believe her allegations from the get go just because of the timing of the letter and I want to start a match or on your show right now Dianne Feinstein must resign\nNah I appreciated it five five forty Laura ah let's go to Paul main real quick Paul\n[noise] um I I just wanted to say I think um everyone tries to say so many people said a doctor for ... testimony was credible\nBut that's because it's the polite thing to say it's the politically correct thing to say it's like saying Santa Claus exists\nI I think anybody that looks at her testimony objectively which they it wasn't credible and Mr Trump President Trump is willing to hope that balloon of the social law and he's willing to say no Santa Claus doesnt exist we need to grow up\nAnd and I I just I I think that's you know I think that's what he's trying to do here\nI appreciate it a five five forty Laura uh this is going to go down as one of the hardest fought confirmations and Supreme Court history if not the most difficult\nAh but in the end I think it's worth it you know why you can't reward people who make false charges you can't reward people who make allegations after the process has gone through with no contemporaneous ... who have\nSome type of axe to grind can't do it and same goes with these people showing up in the Senate and cornering people in elevators none of this should be allowed it's a game of intimidation they're playing it we know people who practice emotional extortion\nA political extortion this is a this is like an emotional terrorism so conservatives need not apply because if you ever had a beer and high school never partied too hard you can't you can't ever work again apparently\nIf you're tired of paying maintenance feeds the time she can't even use you need to call resort release now\nSo many of you who have them don't want them you want to get out of them but you feel stuck they'll help you get out of that contract legally permanently and a hundred percent money back guaranteed\nNow not we'll get into sort of more about this but this is also very interesting uh joining us now Senator David Perdue from the great state of Georgia senator how are you\nWell Oregon morning I don't know what the word ... means but I think um would cause I'm pissed this morning I'll apologize to your listeners going there but this is a sham it's a new low in America this level of character assassination I didn't think we would see again in my lifetime but I'm disgusted with the process this week\nUh the the fact that President Trump comes out yesterday and starts talking about it ah and says look this could be your father your brother's son she's getting excoriated and the media or they're saying he he's attacking a victim how did you take it\n[noise] well I agree with the president a hundred percent but you know the war all women law has been perpetrated by the Democrats in this case\nYou know a Dr Ford was you know I don't know the woman but she wanted this to be kept confidential and the Democrats exposed it they leak didn't expose it intentionally for their own purpose\nBut this is part of a bigger a tip by the Democrat to take this to a new level I mean the paid activists that are well right now or my wife and I were physically accosted at a public airport on Monday This week because of this these people were paid by the center of public democracy\nOr they get money from the open society foundation which is George Soros who is putting to listen to this more than thirty two billion billion dollars into this effort over the last couple years this is a bigger issue and it's not going to go away when we confirm Kavanaugh this week\nNow and I think you're exactly right I think it's time for conservatives to stop playing defense\nAbsolutely everyone on their heels all the time like Jeff Flake later this hour in the elevator and\nYou're exactly right I think it's time for conservatives to stop playing defense\nAbsolutely everyone on their heels all the time like Jeff Flake later this hour in the elevator and then you get these ladies are yelling at me he turns out the woman has a ... executive director of of the Soros funded group as you said Center for democracy and I think it's time to turn the tables were okay sunshine on you who are you people\nWho are working for this organization you are carrying on and I think you could make the argument senator that uh and maybe a good lawyer plaintiff lawyer could do this or just go to good litigation attorney can do this this is kind of a\nIt's almost like a Rico deal like these groups are working together to deny other people their rights to movement free movement which is guaranteed under our constitution free association\nOr they're ... they're acting in a way to deprive others I I Would say of there\nAre inherent civil rights and totally agree meant to intimidate\nI totally agree but listen to what the senators are doing to incite the crazy in this effort this is senator Cory Booker you just had him on their here's another one\nThis is Corey Booker please get up in the face of some congresspeople representative Maxine Waters they're not going to be able to go to a restaurant go to a gas station go to shop at a department store\nTheir absolute get up and absolutely harass them\nNancy Pelosi I don't know why they aren't uprising all over the country I mean it goes on to tell me again while we shouldn't confront Republicans where they eat where they sleep where they work until they stop being complicit\nThis is outrageous law and it it if it doesn't do anything else that should serve the wake us up you're exactly right Democrats had been playing office for the last hundred years this time for Republicans to stop being a minority party and wrote in and grow and\nGrow up and you don't have to grow up and become a you know stop playing defense this is this is the time right now\nA senator for do uh there's so much a that is happening which is positive\nOr in this administration the news has been unreal Minton ling Henri medically negative uh because ... that's just where the media are they're not going to ... I mean we had this NAFTA deal pass okay or or or be able to negotiate as a pastor's son\nEveryone said this couldn't happen they said Trump was a big uh ...\nUh Obama ridiculed I'm going to maybe the way this magical hours I'm going to renegotiate all these deals well you know didn't took actually work to do this like Nineteen months of work and and you must hear nothing out of this huge lower milestone for this administration\nIt's huge but it's part of it as part of what's going on this this economy is growing at twice the rate it did under President Obama we have a new free trade agreement with South Korea were about how long with Mexico and Canada Europe is talking about zero terrorists we have China paying stepping up and paying attention to us now we have a nuclear\nConversation going on with North Korea to to end up in the nuclear option of North Korea this person's agendas working at all we talk about is what the Democrats want us to talk about that is what you're saying is that we need to be on the op is talking about what's working in this agenda before we get into these elections in a few weeks\nI I can tell you the senator no one's going to want to try to stop\nMe moving in a public street or try to harassment or restaurant\nOkay this is a new I tolerate that anyone comes in my family and my kids they they they better be ready they better be really ready because this is I'm not intimidated by some\nRich kid who lives at home with his parents and in his free time you know jumps on the move on dot org website to get his marching orders okay like go home to rich parents and and and who pay for your ...\nParents than in his free time you know jumps on the move on dot org website to get his marching orders okay like go home to rich parents and and and who pay for your your three square meals a day and you're you're you know your\nYour activism on the side I mean I just it just doesn't impress me I call these people right after their faces\nLaw that's what we're going to be under the this week and it starts right here in the United States Senate people who are supporting this actively encouraging inciting it we have a state representative that actually was involved in our altercation on Monday a state representative from\nFrom Arizona okay of all places here in Washington these are not genuine people\nWere asked for out of Dr Ford or anything else they are paid activists this is a George Soros conspiracy and it's time we wake up expose them in stand up and fight for our country because that's what's at stake here\nDo you think we have enough Republican money bags types to counter the effort is dire and Soros because they're just pumping tens of millions of dollars and ... into voter registration and two are educating people in these training sessions on how to approach new voters\nOr this is you know they're going to the ... the new a Puerto Rican voters and in Florida and and land on line on them like oh Trump hates you and you've got to throw the Republicans out in Georgia you see this\nTight governor's race which is really disturbing to Stacey Abrams ...\nLast winner Georgia could elect a left wing Stacey Abrams to be governor great state of Georgia\nThis is what you were saying earlier one of the one of the good byproducts of this is I think it's a wake in the Republican base\nA was a little pass it particularly in Georgia maybe this year but I'll tell you this\nUm that race and George has drawn thirty million dollars from um uh Mike Bloomberg and ... and two other California investors what they're doing is they're California investors and New York donors are trying to sneak into Georgia instill that governor's race because they believe that's the way to the presidency and twenty twenty to get those electoral votes down there\nAnd it's just not going to happen we're not going to let that happen Laura\nI'm David Perdue or here in the learning them show a Jeff Flake yesterday seemed to kind of shift the goalposts little on Kavanaugh or maybe it was just commenting on his overall demeanor with the committee let's listen\nI was very troubled by the the tone of the of the remarks or the initial a defense that a judge I'm tapping on gave a ... was something I Hope that I Would sound that indignant if I were a if I felt that I was unjustly\nMaligned but then it went on and\nThe interaction with the members was sharp and partisan and that concerns me\nA year reaction was that concerning to you Kevin ... face of the old club it's your\nFloor he did exactly what I Would have expected him to do he was in dignity and he should have been listening to what these guys are saying Chris Coons says if judge Kavanaugh seeking a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court\nAnd who I think now bears the bears the burden of this proving these allegations that presumption of innocence has been a trashed in this whole process it gets not convenient for the Democrat\nI mean they talk about him being Cory Booker again cause him evil\nOr the other one said a Yale alum said people will die I mean the vernacular here has risen to a level that we haven't seen in decades Laura and it's dangerous Republicans had better not be asleep at this because these people are now mobilized they're funded\nAnd quite frankly this is just this the tip of the spear of what their ... their malign activity I actually\nA Center for do in Georgia just going back briefly to this very tight governor's race\nThis fear of what their ... activity I actually\nA Center for do in Georgia just going back briefly to this very tight governor's race\nUh what is your sense what are the people need to know I'm again this was this poll by landmark pretty decent polling outfit\nI likely voters hum and it was basically a forty five forty five dead heat or the governorship is very important for so many reasons the state of Georgia a and the growth economic growth and George has been very strong ah but what could a left wing governor due to that growth\nWell here's what they what she's saying she wants a single payer and she won't always give away programs that would cause a state tax has to be tripled this is the most extreme liberal progressive candidate that Georgia has ever had and she's getting funded by a all these outside donors not donors in Georgia by the way\nAnd so what's happening is all of this conversation about war women everything else has confused issue Georgia right now is really the best state in the country in which to do business and she wants to tear that that\nWe have a great Republican candidate Brian Kemp is going to make a great governor and Republican so they get the vote out we will win that election\nSuffer concussion each

Monica McClain who worked as an attorney or for a P. O. Y. which is I'm In the D. O. J. and FBI in a robust beach Delaware apparently both of them are there at the same time that she wrote her a letter to Dianne Feinstein\nA Ford and ms McLean her best friend or the best friend she actually coached on lie detector testing were together for the four days leading up to the actual writing of the letter from the twenty sixth of the thirtieth\nIt would appear this is a conservative a tree house it would appear that Ford was with McLean again the retired FBI agent and former former New York field office spokesperson at the time she wrote a letter to Feinstein\nThat would certainly begin to explain quite a bit about who exactly was handling ms Ford and how there would be an intentional effort from a subject matter expert on how to best position the attack against Kavanaugh\nWho better to scrub the Internet history and know what process sees and people to enlist in such preparatory work than a retired lawyer who were deeply inside the FBI a lotta people are saying deep state was involved in all this not only did ms McLean possess a particular set of skills to assist system is forward\nBut ms McLean would also have a network of de OJ an FBI resources to assist in this endeavor\nA former friendly FBI agent to do the polygraph a network of politically motivated allies\nDoes the appearance of FBI insider and deputy FBI Director uh to Andrew Andrew McCabe Michael Brown which begin now to make more sense\nI think about it I remember the lawyer she ultimately got with brown which brown which was as Andy McCabe lawyer Andy McCabe former deputy director the FBI\nAnd we know that ah\nWell flight called McCabe before ... the um Rosenstein excuse me before\nThey he decided to ask for that extra week and that that doesn't really bother me because they want to know what you can get done in a week an FBI background\nBut this FBI connection with the woman she was now reportedly within ... beach is fascinating\nSo again if you want to examine whether she misled the committee put this country through a nightmare you need all her text messages all her emails\nAll of those that have been deleted which are recoverable and that is for Powell McLean anyone who was ... was talking to her at the time including anyone from Feinstein's office all of that needs to be out\nAll of it do you agree with me that you cannot allow people to get away from this get away with us excuse me\nThe same thing with Julie sweat neck if you're submitting statements to the Senate Judiciary committee that are false knowingly false you should be prosecuted for that I don't care how long it takes I Would prosecute for that\n... and I I bet that text messaging trail to Christine Ford tells a fascinating story about what really went down and I'd subpoena that therapist\nChristine Ford tells a fascinating story about what really went down and I'd subpoena that therapists if the therapist even exists a subpoena that therapist\nThey look there is no patient a doctor privilege here apparently she was releasing notes and showing them to at least showing to the Washington Post she references them in her testimony gone no privilege\nBut a lot\nTo uncover here so they want to go

Monday SARS Monday during the NAFTA announcement said this\nI really believe that the people of our country they want the wall and they want border security they don't want to open borders like the Democrats want to have\nAnd I really think I have a very big decision to make some time right after the election very quickly do I want to do it before the election personally yes but I don't want to do that for a different reason 'cause I have some very find people that are running in close races in uh may affect them and it may not it may be good for them I happen to think it would be good for them\nI think Trump is usually right and as a political calculation is he is he right to put this also and Republicans until after the election\nIt either way it's his call I mean usually with the problem in the budget process it we've lost our leverage right we we let it be known nine Senate Democrats will block us and so right now we don't have at the beginning of the cycle or it after the election our laboratory back to a hundred percent\nSo he's probably right on that call and we got to have a fight on that one right that was one of the biggest rally and cries up his election\nSo he's probably right on that call and we got to have a fight on that one right that was one of the biggest rallying cries of his election and of mine and the people want to see it and\nA nine Senate Democrats whack it uh we got to let the world see that and and the whole party gotta come behind the president on this immigration issue because it is a big issue that just\nDivides the crony elites

I'm pissed this morning apologized of your listeners going there but this is a sham it's a new low in America this level of character assassination I didn't think we would see again in my lifetime but I'm disgusted with the process this week\nUh the the fact that President Trump comes out yesterday and starts talking about it a and says look this could be your father your brother's son she's getting excoriated and the media or they're saying he he's attacking a victim how did you take it\n[noise] well I agree with the president a hundred percent but you know the war on women law has been perpetrated by the Democrats in this case you\nKnow a doctor for whether you know I don't know the woman but she wanted this to be kept confidential and the Democrats exposed it they leaked it and they exposed it intentionally for their own purposes\nBut this is part of a bigger attempt by the Democrats to take this to a new level I mean the paid activists that are around right now or my wife and I were physically accosted at a public airport on Monday This week because of this these people were paid by the center of public democracy\nOr they get money from the open society foundation which is George Soros who is putting to listen to this more than thirty two billion billion dollars into this effort over the last couple years this is a bigger issue and it's not going to go away when we confirm Kavanaugh this week\nNow and I think ah you're exactly right I think it's time for conservatives to stop playing defense\nAbsolutely everyone on their heels all the time like Jeff Flake later this hour in the elevator and then you get these ladies are yelling at me it turns out the woman is a co executive director of of the ... funded group as you said Center for democracy and I think it's time to turn the tables were okay sunshine on you who are you people\nWho are working for this organization you are carrying on and I think you can make the argument senator that are in maybe a good lawyer plaintiff lawyer could do this or just good good litigation attorney could do this this is kind of a\nIt's a Rico deal like these groups are working together to deny other people their right to movement free movement which is guaranteed under our constitution free association\nOr they're ... they're acting in a way to deprive others I I Would say of there are inherent civil rights and totally agree meant to intimidate\nI totally agree but listen to what the senators are doing to incite the crazies in this effort this is senator Cory Booker you just had him on their here's another one\nThis is Corey Booker please get up in the face of some congresspeople representative Maxine Waters they're not going to be able to go to a restaurant go to a gas station go to shop at a department store their absolute get up and absolutely harass them\nNancy Pelosi I don't know why they aren't uprising all over the country I mean it goes on and tell me again while we shouldn't confront Republicans were they eat where they sleep where they work until they stop being complicit\nThis is outrageous law and it it if it doesn't do anything else ... served a wake us up you're exactly right Democrats had been playing off is for the last hundred years this time for Republicans to stop being a minority party in ... and and grow\nAnd grow up and you don't have to grow up and become a you know stop playing defense this is this is the time right now\nPretty low and and grow\nAnd grow up and you don't have to grow up and become a you know stop playing defense this is this is the time right now\nUS Senator for do ah there's so much a that is happening ... which is positive\nOr in this administration the news has been a ... ... only negative uh because ... that's just where the media are they're not going to that I mean we had this NAFTA deal pass okay a or B or negotiate has to pass the Senate\nEveryone said this couldn't happen they said Trump was a big uh ... uh Obama ridiculed gonna made it ... does not have to go on for some are going to renegotiate all these deals well didn't took actually work to do this like Nineteen months of work\nI and and you must hear nothing out of this huge lower milestone for this administration\nIt's huge but it's part of it as part of what's going on this this economy is growing at twice the rate it did\nUnder President Obama we have a new free trade agreement with South Korea were about how one with Mexico and Canada Europe is talking about zero tariffs we have China paying stepping up and paying attention to us now we have a nuclear\nConversation going on with North Korea to to end up in the ... of North Korea this presence agendas working at all we talk about is what the Democrats want us to talk about that is what you're saying is that we need to be on the off is talking about what's working in this agenda before we get into these elections in a few weeks\nI I can tell you the senator\nNo one's going to want to try to stop me moving in a public street or tried to harassment or restaurant\nOkay this is a new I tolerate that anyone in my family and my kids they they they better be ready they better be really ready because this is not intimidated\nBy some rich kid who lives at home with his parents and in his free time you know jumps on the move on dot org website to get his marching orders okay like go home to rich parents and and and who pay for your your three square meals a day and you're you're\nYou know your your activism on the side and I just it just doesn't impress me I call these people right after their faces\nLaw that's what we're going to be ... this week and it starts right here in the United states at people who are supporting this actively encouraging and citing it we have a state representative that actually was involved in our altercation on Monday a state representative from\nFrom Arizona okay of all places here in Washington these are not genuine people\nWho are ... out of Dr Ford or anything else these are paid activists this was a George Soros conspiracy and it's time we wake up expose them in stand up and fight for our country because that's what's at stake here\nDo you think we have enough Republican money bags types\nTo counter the effort of style hair and Soros because they're just pumping tens of millions of dollars in Baltimore into voter registration and to a educating people in these training sessions on how to approach new voters\nUh this is you know they're going to the ... the new a Puerto Rican voters and in Florida and and land on line on them like oh Trump aides you and you've got to throw the Republicans out in Georgia you see this\nTight governor's race which is really disturbing the Stacey Abrams Abrams who's left wing or Georgia could elect a left wing Stacey Abrams to be governor great state of Georgia\nThis is what you were saying earlier one of the one of the good byproducts of this is I think it's a wake in the Republican base\nA was a little pass it particularly in Georgia maybe this year but I'll tell you this um that race in George has drawn thirty million dollars from a a Mike Bloomberg and ... and two other California investors what they're doing is they're California investors and New York\nThe million dollars from a a Mike Bloomberg and ... and two other California investors what they're doing is they're California investors and New York donors are trying to sneak into Georgia instill that governor's race because they believe that's the way to the presidency and twenty twenty to get those electoral votes down there and it's just not going to happen we're not going to let that happen Laura\nI'm David Perdue or here in the learning them show a Jeff Flake yesterday seemed to kind of shift the goalposts a little on Kavanaugh or maybe it was just commenting on his overall demeanor with the committee let's listen\nI was very troubled by the the tone of the of the remarks or the initial a defense to judge Kavanaugh gave ... was something I Hope that I Would sound that indignant if I were a if I felt that I was unjustly\nMaligned but then it went on and the interaction with the members\nWas sharp and partisan and that concerns me\nA year reaction was concerning to you Kevin ... face of the old club it's your\nFloor he did exactly what I Would have expected him to do he was in dignity and he should have been listening to what these guys are saying Chris Coons says if judge Kavanaugh seeking a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court\nAnd who I think now bears the bears the burden of this proving these allegations that presumption of innocence has been a trashed in this whole process is not convenient for the Democrat I mean they talk about him being Cory Booker again cause him evil\nOr the other one said a Yale alum said people will die I mean the vernacular here has risen to a level that we haven't seen in decades Laura and it's dangerous Republicans had better not be asleep at this because these people are now mobilized they're funded\nAnd quite frankly this is just this the tip of the spear of what their ... activity I actually\nA Center for do in Georgia just going back briefly to this very tight governor's race\nUh what is your sense what are the people need to know I'm again this was a poll by landmark pretty decent polling outfit\nI likely voters hum and it was basically a forty five forty five dead heat or the governorship is very important for so many reasons the state of Georgia a and the growth economic growth and George has been very strong ah but what could a left wing governor due to that growth\nWell here's what they what she's saying she wants a single payer and she wants to all these give away programs that would cause a state taxes to be tripled this is the most extreme liberal progressive candidate that Georgia has ever had and she's getting funded by a all these outside donors not donors in Georgia by the way\nAnd so what's happening is all of this conversation about war all women everything else has confused issue Georgia right now is rated the best state in the country in which to do business and she wants to tear that day out\nWe have a great Republican candidate Brian Kemp is going to make a great governor and Republican so they get the vote out we will win that election\nSuffer concussion each year that

story I Can't remember the these specific name but I remember the story of Jesus going across I Believe it was an ocean right and the other side of the ocean\nAnd police somebody I Know I got biblical scholar Henry on line ones who are correct me if I'm wrong but then that's not a joke and re is very intelligent when it comes to the Bible but Jews won across the water right and there was this man\nWho had been who had a demon inside of them I don't remember what specifically what specific store this is I'll find it during the next break it Henry doesn't know but there was this man that was believed\nTo be a demon inside and nobody talked\nWhat specific story this is I find that during the next break if Henry doesn't know but there's this man that was believed to be a demon inside of them and nobody talked to and everybody said that guy's crazy we we're not going in there we're not doing that he lived amongst the tombs right our modern day version would be he lived in a graveyard\nExcept she didn't live in a graveyard he lived in the way tombs used to be set up er tombs used to be in this cave like structure right you've seen them you've seen pictures of them even if you haven't gone to a place where they had structure like this you've seen the idea that you used to walk into this thing and it was covered place and they were just bodies on top of bodies on top of bodies\nThat were in these little things it's it's a similar concept to what we have in big cities where the there's these big buildings and they essentially pull out a drawer and once you're dead you get plopped in the drawer enclosed like that\nJust as a side note I never want that to happen I don't want to be in a drawer my whole life\nThat I don't want to but that's a side note Jesus went and he talked to\nThe guy living down there every once it was crazy the nobody wanted to talk to\nCan you imagine that\n... and look at the lessons that taught us look at what we do we go we talked to the people who are the most hurting or the most broke or the most afflicted and our society\nWe have a whole groups of Christianity that are dedicated to going to prison and talking to violent felons not just people that you know the stole or ah or had drugs or something like that was talking to people who committed murders of three or four people\nMurder five people six people some people you have people that dedicate their whole lives to going into the jail it's following that teaching where he went into a place where this guy was afflicted by demons and she walked in he looked at the guy and he essentially said this is obviously a paraphrase he's a demon get out\nDemon leave him\nAnd if I remember correctly the demon went into a group of pigs that were nearby and then the pigs ran jumped off the cliff\n\nJesus want is wanting to drive that thing out of you write Jesus cause you to help drive that thing out of others\nThat makes you want to do the things that aren't productive for you right he wants to come in and he wants to teach he wants you to teach and\nI think successes defined by following his teaching and then going out and sharing those teachings in changing the community in that way and driving the demons out that way it doesn't have to be a literal demon can be a metaphorical name and what are the demons you're facing\nWhat are the demons your parents are facing what are the demons your kids are facing what are the demons your brother is facing what are the demons that anybody in your family is facing\nAnd how do you drive them out right\nIsn't that what successes have you known that somebody's been struggling with something and you just said look I got a lot going on I'm just gonna stay over here I'm going to work on this worldly success you can't take the money with\nYou can't take the stuff with you\nCan't take the Lamborghini whether it'd be really cool if you could jumping that Lamborghini and drive all the way to heaven but guess what you can't\n\nBe really cool if you could take that private plane and fly it all the way to heaven but guess what you can't and guess what it also doesn't does that that plane that car that house you can't sell them and then turned that money and to get to heaven quicker to get to have it on a more expedited route to get the having maybe when you\nAnd guess what it also doesn't does that that plane that car that house you can't sell them and then turn that money in to get to heaven quicker to get to heaven and more expedited route to get to heaven maybe when you don't deserve it\nThe only way you get to heaven is they're following Jesus Christ\nAnd when you follow Jesus Christ and when you believe in what the Bible says you followed these works right true faith produces actions a tree that is alive bears fruit\n\nTree that is alive and healthy doesn't bear nothing right the tree that is alive and healthy bears for and that fruit is not only the fruit is the spirit but it's the first success because when you're following Christ and you're following what he says to do\n\nYour being successful by the very definition the David gave Solomon again in first kings to three do with the lawyer God commands and followed his teachings obey everything written in the law of Moses then you will be a success no matter what you do or where you go\nNo matter if you're the top of the mountain\nOr in the cave where the bodies are with a guy that's crazy are considered crazy by this world the person the steam inflicted\n\nNo matter where you go or what you'll do he'll be successful if you follow God I think that's a really really powerful message we're going to get to your calls when we\nLittle your spirits yeah they are they are falling angels ... and there were seven thousand of those and ate him alone ... he called himself a legion of legion averages about\nThe reason why I say seven thousand is because there's only one group other than saying that is Satan is by name will perish burn from within twenty eight ... you can read and how he his demise goes but now in the fall in angels there's several thousand\nAnd they immediately once Christ the head now our seven thousand men fall into the streets of Jerusalem ...\nThat's the seven thousand that will come where say in and they roll the of course they don't mix with the uh\n... what did you play the iron in the ... ... feet do not mix so you know uh they're never going to be friendly to each other they have no license for as they hate us you know dangerous all they want to do is have sex with women and thank goodness there won't be any children born of 'em because they won't be here long enough ...\nYou know a lot of people saying she was seven years which was short and the short and I get to the fact of pleasing God I'm going to be I don't want to get off on I'll let others that are going to have stuff is not going to tell you too much and but once you learn a lot more you can get into stuff like that yeah but\nWhat are you every day you should bless God and he will bless you that is one thing you want to do right never never acquire ill gotten gain or else you're not going to go through that NATO gate\nThat need okay is that gate that they had it was a smaller door inside of the two main doors and the camel how to crawl through on his knees and everything on that camera all had to be taken off of him so he uh he had to be unloaded so you've got to unload\nAll of your gun games before you even get in heaven when you want\nIs your works mhm you're righteous acts you want your works works are the only thing is we ... with us and you are judged we are judged by al works were not judge by a phase\nWe're judged by our works and those works make up our clothes are crispy white linens and I plan on having a little bit more than some are boxers [laughter]\nHopefully I'll be doing it right but you know on the uh laws\nThere's no way I Am areas I Am curious I Do have a question\nUh what do you think about the idea a then that\nSay uh my faith not by side by um my faith in my works they did now that is something that I've heard that's been preaching Christianity the Austin amongst a variety of sex and Christianity um and I was wondering why there seems to be a difference in what they're saying and what you're saying did I miss honors down a bit actually\nA variety of sex and Christianity um and I was wondering why there seems to be a difference in what they're saying and what you're saying don't misunderstand the ...\nNext time asking where it is Matthew I'm I think it's twenty five ... you're\nGoing to make me look it up I don't have [laughter] listening\nBut I yeah Christ is the one in ... it's a revelation also because the the the people who make it\nOr or or don't have to go through the second aspect of the spirit mhm that second death is the one what we're talking about the leisure prior yeah a diverse death is those some of us\nAre it's basically like a Christ judgment ... you're judged on one side of the paradise or the other\nYou're either with the rich man or you're on there with the poor man that's in the arms of a Abraham ... but on the other side you know he's the poor man's just burning up over there because you ever get that way when you know you're messed up just burn up all over yourself\nAnd then he runs a drink of that ever lasting water and you can't get that and so everybody from Hitler to everybody's over on the wrong side of the Gulf men's Luke sixteen you could read about that that dividing a loopy in a medical doctor\nAnd he ... he puts uses the word a chasm that's an ear you cannot cross\nA only across Christ did when he went back all the way back to those prisoners ... and that's who I spoke with and some of 'em were were were released at that point you went all the way back to the\nEight or ... and Peter\nThat are you then he went back in so many of them were then breed but on the bars I Want to I don't want to run out of time yeah the laws are important missing the food laws are very important people\nDon't it don't listen to these are people that are going to teach you nothing but the traditions of men which make boy the boy the God we have the commandments or the law ... then we have statutes statute statutes and then we have ordinances ... blood ordinances we're now to the cross with Christ\nOr everything from circumcision to animals sacrifice anything that draws blood\nNo longer exists Christ has taken that trade said I'd change that one ... of the war we have the law not one kid all I wanted to John John we have the law\nAnd statutes of course they should be changed and they ... some British takes care of some of those things on it for a nine to ... to ...\nWell we have grades and you must forgive but not be forgiven yourself so not the laws on rape the laws on murder all those laws exist you don't want to steal even that when most people can figure out and don't say that God don't exist don't take his name and bang\nBan is emptiness or nothing that's so you don't want to say oh God is nothing or doesn't exist most people think it's a good old GED and uh that's how you can get in trouble with that long again\nIt's just ignorance it's that understanding and not getting the full translation yeah so when it comes to the bar read the law on\nThe how we eat and basically ... the whole thing I Do not eat scavengers a pig gives a scavenger\nAdventurers a scavenger Iraq as a scavenger anything that's a scavenger a captive sorry folks I Love 'em to strip out all my gosh oh I still am sometimes [laughter] but God Knows arming them but it's not a sin too so\nBut it is a senator your body to your health and it will cause you to live a little bit longer or have a a crappy help that's our bodies were not changed after he gave those laws that bar bodies\nIt will cause you to live a little bit longer or have a\nA crappy help that's our bodies were not changed\nAfter he gave those laws that our bodies are the same as they would have been now the condition of the earth is different we have a heavier atmosphere of the earth is a a lot different than it was when there's a lot of live to nine hundred and sixty years old so you know and he ate God told them the\nAnd that's why one of the reasons why do you live that long plus we have the ability to live that long so remember laws they never change Mm crunch set it and change one ... that that's a that's a tutor was a a mark\nOn the Hebrew where it changes the pronunciation of\nA from a are to

good Christians\nWho are going to win the first\nChrist times we're going to run like germs thinking they're going to do all these great things but they don't really know he's the anti Christ and he's gotten a\nPromise everybody's going to fly him away\nNo such thing if you're going to put on the body armor and you're going to get in the field at work then you'd better stay in the field at work until the real crisis gets here and if you're going to put on the body of honor you're going to be ready to fight right with saying you have that the heat shield of truth and you'll be in the um the the\nThe shield of that the head\nArmor of truth in the shadows of of\nUh oh gosh I'm forgetting now but that when it gets rid of his firing dog she joined kids poison\nOr any other bar enemies poison
