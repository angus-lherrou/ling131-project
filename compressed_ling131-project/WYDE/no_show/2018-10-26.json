who's challenging the Democrat incumbent Joe Donnelly its its neck and neck it's up to point down two points so this is a tight race we're going to talk to Mike about Indiana\nAs a ... it's a reliably red state meeting a conservative state so why should there be any question that the governor of that great state where Mike Pence came from of course a should also not be a Republican strong conservative and what what Indiana's think today\nExcuse me ... excuse me for the Democrats are incumbents that are I think governor I'm Still have governor on my mind\nA so obviously Joe Joe Donnelly for the Senate race but I said that but I'm All right we're going to take a break a five five forty Laura will bring you the latest updates on the tracking of these packages the political timing is

like well he supports Trump to does he\n[laughter] well only on the stuff that doesn't count a\nVoted against tax reform and you know it was for Obamacare all the stuff that's really important he's a hundred percent lined up with Chuck Schumer and the liberal side of his party and that record being fully flushed out a peer through this campaign and\nThat's the reason we're going to win it with or without the capital you know Bob but uh just a lot of good things have happened we brought a good campaign and we restore strict competitively in great fundraising and\nNot a whole lot different than executing a business plan and we feel good about where we are\nA well Mike the concern today and the part of the media these packages that arrived and uh the offices and residences of Trump's critics prominent people from John Brennan to Joe Biden or in ...\nUh the offices and residences of Trump's critics prominent people from John Brennan to Joe Biden or and what what is your take on this the criticism of the president was almost instantly even though he condemned this of course and ask for national unity it was not good enough\nOr and they're blaming him for creating the atmosphere that resulted in these packages being sent\nOne of the president's been blamed for everything gets knowing knowledge but for the main thing is that on the reason I'm running is\nUh I wouldn't be running for ah invent another outcome and sixteen now we've got a rare opportunity\nTo kind of shake the system and fix what's broken and uh he they're still re litigating I think the two thousand sixteen race and that's why he gets\nCredit for the great agenda that's out there that's a exciting Hoosiers and he was popular in sixteen here among conservatives and even more so and I even think the people that maybe don't love his style are going to look at the results and uh\nI think that's why I'm winning this race that's why Joe Donnelly has tried to become so Trump being when you know you never you know he's been always with the liberal side of his party's so\nUm I think this is just another example of how they try to distract than ah give him absolutely no credit for all the good things happening\nMaxine Waters said today she responded to these packages saying I ain't scared on she called on the president to take responsibility for the kind of violence we're seeing for the first time in different ways well this is a year plus after Steve ... was almost killed\nAt the hands of a rabid Trump a hater Andy Bernie Sanders supporter and everyone seems to forget what happened in fact I wasn't style of the security they would have been dozens dead\n[noise] exactly I mean it's a litany of um I think the real exposure to this kind of approach occurred in the capital hearings and olive is challenging Democrats in these red states or the amount of just absolute negative uh lives and distortions that\nSchumer's packs dump into George Soros than the rest of 'em uh I think it's exposed and ugly underbelly of uh what they're about which is a lack of any message completely obstructing and trying to\nPlay down all the good things that are happening with the Trump agenda and I think voters are going to hold him accountable I think ah the capital hearings for Hoosiers would have been apart the\nPoint where our race changed and many others and I think enough was enough and they related back to my race and many others I sell something Fox dead on across the board than regular advertising that just swamped you on the airwaves and that's because they're afraid of their record\nWell again the Democrats don't want to debate the issues because they have absolutely gone out of the business if they ever were in the business of\nA proposal to actually advance our economy or or grow our prosperity are enforce the border I mean they're just not interested in those conversations so they resort to\nPersonal attacks and even on issues where they agree on to some extent like Schumer agrees with some of the things that Trump is doing on trade he won't talk about those because you can't give the president any credit for anything any time anywhere\nNo doubt about it I'll give you a great example in my race I took on the health insurance companies about ten years ago to make sure he'll be Affordable Care act the first word of it it never will\nMy race I took on health insurance companies about ten years ago to\nMake sure he'll be Affordable Care act the first word of it it never was in its was doomed to fail because she had big government hooked up with big health care is specifically insurance and I covered preexisting conditions and no cap on coverage and\nLore of health premiums flat for ten years and it's the absolute truth and it's kind of blown up in the sense that they can't believe a conservative\nActually mine out of a solution for what they you know that's their pivotal issue they think they went on that at all I did was\nMade at consumer driven made a transparent the kind of things that you'd like in free markets and a great result I go to the set out I'll talk about that and that's why we're going to win the race against the guy like Joe Donnelly and it's been\nA career politician that's never had an original idea since he's been there\nI think that again when you when you see how absolutely nutty the left is driven by the Trump progress the results the economy\nThe fact that he's not going to be back on his heels and constantly apologizing I mean that's the that's the type of Republican they liked the best they like someone like John ... forever back on his heels and apologizing for being a conservative and Trump's is not going to do that and that drives me crazy and he calls them out on and and I think it's a little\nLong since pass the time we had that type of planes speaking politician\nWell I mean thank goodness that's exactly where I'm coming from an alarm the other thing you're going to get as if a gender\nReally healed then I talked about tax reform and I do think it's a incumbent upon conservatives are business owners now that you've got more Django in your pocket share it with your employs we've done that by\nFurther lowering healthcare costs after keeping them plot for ten years and are preached out all the time but you do that\nI really believe that's the signature piece of legislation that they gambled would not be appreciated we've had ten months people now adding up more money in their own pocket and if you get business owners like us\nThat ... gone out there in touted tax reform we want to share the benefits with your employers people quit looking to the false hope of a federal government that the Democrats believe and that hasn't delivered over the last two or three decades and really put us on the brink of\nA financial calamity if we don't get more people in there they're going to be able to solve things and not worry about the political ramifications that's why I'm going and there'll be more of us I think that jump on the bandwagon stick our necks out and\nJoin the Trump trains so\nI'm looking for ... well we cannot wait for\nElection day uh Mike I think you're going to win this race\nOr the people of Indiana and we have a huge audience in Indiana\nYou got to get out there and vote get everyone you know to get get to the polls vote for in advancing economy and a an America\nThat's growing that's more confident and optimistic and do not go backward we don't want to go backwards to more identity politics more mass ... illegal immigration gotta deal with this with the new Congress close these loopholes\nAnd Mike Brown would be fantastic in the U.S Senate I I just can't wait for you to come to Washington I think you're going to win this Mike\nAnd I'm I'm so glad either in we're going to win it\nAnd I'm looking forward to it and the lower thanks for the support and we're going to finish a art end of the tape on the sex and can't wait

I just would be interested to hear your comments on that I Know\nWell it seems again it it's this is someone who is a fan of Donald Trump then it's got to be someone who's insane\nI'm just completely nuts and some I mean people who do this have an ... an element of of insanity evil all all combined in my view but I'm not an expert on you know tracing bombs I I don't know I'm not a profile or of these situations\nIn an evil all all combine it might be but I'm not an expert on you know tracing bombed I I don't know I'm not a profile or the situation that's why we're going to speak to profile ers\nWho will tell us what this seems like people who know what bombs or when they're designed to go off look like and what they must contain\nBut at the the the list of targets are all Democrats in all outspoken critics of President Trump eight five five forty Laura we'll talk the high camp challenger in North Dakota coming up [noise]\n\n\n\nDoes your dog it scratched tinker shed like crazy come to die by perhaps quarter and Ninety Days supply of dynamite\nI'm along comes to the Brett Kavanaugh opportunity\nTo demonstrate in a substantive way that you stand with North Dakota ... and with President Trump when he's right for North Dakota and of course she not only did she voted against the confirmation of of a great judge who's by the way very good for North Dakota or many of his his opinions and dissent a defense\nBecame of course the majority opinion and the Supreme Court over things like EPA overreach and in in many areas what land water air a just a brilliant judge for for North Dakota when he's on the DC circuit\nAnd so she has this opportunity to to prove or brand and sheep blows it by voting against him and her whole brand went right out the window\nAnd then of course campus is like ...\n... she just doesn't fit with the north Dakota's code a mindset in the\nSpirit of North Dakota which is one of I hearty courageous a well still still has that frontier feeling well then that's not a very populous um state but it's a pro Trump conservative\nPro Second Amendment of course and believe in fairness just general fairness in the cabinet deal just wasn't fair and I think most people just well that and I and so she's obviously not going to apologize for not supporting him but I think that was the\nStraw that broke the Democrats back\nIt was ... but at the same time you know I've had a double digit lead for quite a while on her and\nAnd I think the comparison was already resonating with with North Dakota and she just blew up with the cab nothing because again her everything she pretended to be was revealed in one major illustration\nSo and the fair to say she was really big but also\nShe's a former state attorney general she was a former North Dakota attorney general so the idea that you didn't understand fairness or due process or the value of it at a time Laura when the polls in North Dakota\nNever showed ... never showed even thirty percent support for a for opposing cabinet but rather short anywhere from sixty to fifty sixty sixty four percent\nFavoring confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh so\nIt wasn't like she didn't know where North Dakota and stood so she had a hard time and by the way even ... blaming her ... she changed her her opinion first she believed him and believed a professor poured then she didn't believe\nHim but believe professor for it and then it was not about that at all it was about his demeanor she watched his hearing you know with the phone turned often noticed his demeanor\nYou know it's just ... it was phony on top of phony and again I think it was just the veil removed\nBecause everything you described about North Dakota's lord that the independent spirit the rug and is\nThe frontier spirit that's what she has pretended to be and now all of a sudden it's quite clear that she's really quite a liberal activist\nI think again people have been well they've been exposed during the Trump era\nThan media has had a ... mirror um I think raised up to their bias\nAnd it comes out in different ways but Trump really has driven people to just peroxide the frenzy and fury and upset and and the left always takes it too far they took it too far with\nKavanaugh uh we don't know what's really going on with this these packages that were sent to Trump critics but I think people have a lot of theories they're um\nUh we don't know what's really going on with this these packages that were sent to Trump's critics but I mean people have a lot of theories there um\nAnd I and the leftist they're never satisfied with they get one thing and that's like okay we're going to go to the ... and now we're going to push for universal health care and it's going to be Medicare for all and it's going to be healthcare for illegal immigrants than\nA one lesson that you you know assuming un which looks like you're going to um Congress than in North Dakota or what lesson do you share with others who are listening across the country about about this period and politics and\nWhat we need to do to keep this prosperity going obviously the markets had a rough ride in last few days but in general things can't be couldn't be going much better on the economy\nNo you know the main lesson I Would share and and you know I was a energy regulator before I went to Congress six years ago in in North Dakota and the thing I Would share is\nLet's return to a respect for states ... you know the the these incredible laboratories of democracy called states will show the way in North Dakota chief among them and by the way\nSo will the soul of the states that I Would consider bad states places like California North Dakota is the second leading producer of oil in the in the country not because we produce more necessarily although we have a lot of it obviously technologies unlocked it but but because places like California that have lots of it\nHas screwed it up okay they have a right to do that and and they have a right to have a a cost of living higher than than there are a ... quality of life\nBut I I'd say that the thing I'd say is this trust the laboratories of freedom at the state level and that's what President Trump has done he's restored\nYou know states' rights and and that's what ... what do you have a cabinet does on the courts and ... and just trust people at the most basic and local level and that means with their tax dollars that means with regulations it means having a respect for a return to\nCooperative federalism and you're going to find the federal government that's far more efficient and much less not necessary frankly in many cases and you'll have a you know you'll have a much better country in my view\nUm congressman finally or a month at a time but your thoughts on these packages arriving at the residences\nOr offices of Trump's critics\nWell it's my first thought is as a as a member of Congress my first thought is you know here we go again and whether it's you know the left or the right we all need to be more diligent ... and it's frankly it's scary but my my main thought his let's please not jump to conclusions let's\nYou know this is less than twenty four hours oh let's let's calm down let's let the FBI and the other law enforcement agencies do their work and let's see we're all of this leads before we create something different than than the reality that it that is behind it all in the meantime it's always a good opportunity for self reflection on\nOn our own individual behavior in what contribution if any we make

I'm a bomb squad um there's lots of entry a value to this um which they should be able to ascertain a lot of information over the next few days\nWell it seems also that they've had a uh they've had an ability to to know that some of them didn't actually go through the post office they were hand delivered or one one initially said it was delivered by courier the stamps weren't actually stamped\nThat's all well ... yeah it is a hard and\nYou would think someone had to pay for that so they should be able to to track down who gave it to that person who actually delivered it trace it

if it's an inert powder as it looks like it was again not meant to detonate um another comment that was made yesterday was that if you're going to send something in in in you really wanted it to cause

like this through the\nPostal service because it's too easily detected\nIs there anything to that\nWell I mean if you look or you know historical data the uh bombs have been put used you know through the mail um especially when you have like a you know Ted Ted Kaczynski and what you did this or do the Unabomber stuff I mean you can use the the post office or you use other various means of\nThe courier service FedEx or whatever but I think when the day you're not going to use what they used in the last few days but you're going to use something that's not detectable\nUm look at this again refer back to the FedEx incident that we had were the the devices actually went off um those were intended to all these uh these are intended to be found in my opinion\nUh they were meant to instill

to spend too much time on Brett Kavanaugh but as you know we are in what is known as the do or die phases right now\nI mean nobody called that but I'm calling that were were indeed do or die phase

as much as we can today unless we see some news broke up last night that we need to bring to you because as you probably will know by now me and Dylan fall asleep\nEarly because we have to get up early and let me tell you the other day\nOne of my buddies had something wrong with the steering right as power steering went out on this car so she\nThe other day I had\nOne of my buddies had something wrong with the steering right as power steering went out on this car\nSo she went to a car shop a garage that was out\nIn your area of town and so I drove our or no I think it's more a big Dave's area you're outside of Huey town right but we drove to Hewitt down essentially so close to where you are so we drove all the way a too she retired and I realized\nFrom super station one on one Huey town is a long way away you make that drive every single morning that's like a thirty forty five minute drive easily\n\nIt takes me twenty five minutes to get here including getting breakfast at McDonald's in the morning how fast are you driving doing Seventy five area on the Internet thing that doesn't seem true\nWe were we were going about Seventy miles an hour granted his power steering was out so we were being a little bit cautious and I didn't time is on the way back but we drove all the way out there and maybe we took a weird on ramp or something but I just know that we got there and it's such Huey town next exit and I was like wow this took a while I'm shocked that you drive this every single day\nWhat's happening all coming through\nA is a busy time it was like it was around lunch hour\n\nSo it wasn't like a rush hour type thing but there are people emerging on and then getting off one exit later kind of you know like lunch hour ground\nWhere we are coming from Birmingham Sanford\nOkay see I went to the junction twenty fifty nine and then to your town exit\nThe words you're saying we're very confusing to me so I'm just going to say yes and we're going to go with yes\nYou got on the interstate yes sixty five nor yes and you got on the other interstate yes\nThey need to Utah to cool okay you ought to some weird because I like Fifteen minutes maybe twenty from Stanford I don't know\nMaybe we're just so drivers his power steering was also going out he could not make any turns he was great it straight line so the interstate was were great but or\nAnywhere off the interstate was a real struggle and it was like a newer car right so it didn't have the steering wheel or it could go all the way around and you could just essentially without power steering you could still make the turn at some point the steering wheel just said no we're not going any further\nAnd at that point it's like Mm what do I do because I'm going straight but I Need to go hard left and so we eventually got there safely he didn't hit that many things now I'm getting he admits he'd had anything that we reported the police no I'm saying he didn't have anything\nAnd we made it to the garage and we were very safe you got there are safe and sound but\nI don't know I was just thinking about that because I was thinking wow you make that drive every single morning\nCan't be fun maybe we went to a different accent I don't know all I Know is\nAlways\nBaffles me [noise] because timber draws not that old [noise]\nLike he certainly does not out they crack and cocaine which is

openness who could do like what\nAm I about to come out an oversized basketball jersian pants down to my knees and drop in order to be single that will shape the world\n\nWell like what am I about to come out an oversized basketball jersian pants down to my knees and dropping R. and B. single that will shape the world forever\nHuh except it didn't listen besides the point wasn't yesterday\nWe started a university today I'm becoming an R B singer were just coming up with something new every single day of the week ladies and gentlemen welcome back into the wake up call hanging out this morning\nSo yesterday we were ah I went to a college Republicans meaning right\nI go to some of those occasionally they ah um occasionally political I don't know if you picked up on that or not but they had representative Gary Palmer\nCome speak which is really cool and uh for those of you who don't know Gary Palmer is serving Alabama's six congressional district Gary Palmer works in Washington and his privy to some of the most a valuable information\nAnd our nation right now he's privy to all of these classified hearings that are being had over the FBI and struck and Russian collusion he's on the oversight committee and so we were talking about all of that and ah\nIt's really crazy so I go to Sanford university and you'd think a small\nBaptist school in the middle of Birmingham, Alabama would have a greater conservative movement and I don't know I didn't even know we had a a conservative group on campus um until\nYes last semester last so last semester\nAnd I've been there for four years now I found out that we had a conservative group on campus and so of course I joined\nUm and it is shockingly small and I don't know whether or not it is just lack of advertising or lack of people wanting to be political but we had a sitting US Senator\nCome in and speak yesterday and I can't you not maybe ten people showed up\nTen people showed up which really makes me think our people let's just say it's not\nThe fact that it hasn't been advertise well let's just say maybe that's not the case let's just say this is just people not caring at one point have we reached in our country when a representative in Washington that talks to the top people right he talks to he was there during the Peter Struck\nQuestioning he question Peter Struck alongside Trey Gowdy he was there what have we where we got into as a nation\nThat people want at least come sit and talk and respect those people\nI mean I did I'm not saying I agree with everything Gary Palmer did I don't I'm not saying I disagree with that or any anything Gary Palmer that he's a very interesting a politician I like where he stands a lot of issues but I Would be in there if Kamala Harris came to speak at Stanford University\nI don't agree with anything Kamala Harris says relatively maybe ... point one percent of what Kamala Harris says do I agree with\nBut here's the thing she ... sitting United States senator that holds the power of a sitting United States senator and so I think you should go listen to those people's ideas especially if they're going to open the room up to ... and you get to ask let me tell you with\nGary Palmer sitting in front of us\nAnd nobody else around like they were just ten people in the room and\nCollege Republican so half of these kids are shy and are just really political and don't know what to say a lot of people are afraid to speak up I basically got to have a one\nRoom and it's college Republican so half of these kids are shy and are just really political and don't know what to say and\nA lot of people are afraid to speak up I basically got to have a one on one question and answer with Gary Palmer\nAnd it's all just because I decided to go listen to a twenty minute speech seriously somebody I'll spend twenty minutes on the toilet you know what I'm saying you can spend twenty minutes listening to us beach\nAnd that wasn't directed at the listeners those directed more at college students but it just baffles me I'm curious if that's what it light was like in previous generations you know like Tim McGraw was referencing I miss back when well I I have this theory that back in the day politicians were\nRespected and more people showed up to those events and more people were involved in the political process so\nI miss back when people were involved in the political process\nNot as catchy but I'd like to submit that lyric Tim McGraw but I'm curious if that ever was a thing still and do you think it's always been this uh I I Believe the word is apathy right this political just I'm not really caring is it the right word here\nWe're going to figure it out apathy is a lack of hearing yeah\nYeah so is it political apathy of our generation\nThere's change or as political apathy benefiting from generation to generation to generation\nHonestly from every report that I've seen it's less of a thing among our generation than it was previous\nReally so engaged meant you believe is actually gone up\nFrom the EU reports that I've seen yes\nIt's a very interesting idea because if this is up it's just pitiful like\nHalf of the people are on my campus I guarantee if you go up and you ask what are the three branches of government\nNo answer absolutely no answer it's it's very shocking and it's not something I I I don't everybody tends to put\nThese things on the education system right they tend to say oh the education system isn't teaching government therefore we have a problem and the education system needs to teach government I don't think that's the case at all honestly I think it's people really and truly not caring\nLook because I hate it when I see somebody that goes into a class right they don't listen to the whole time they don't give the teacher any respect and yet they complain when they fail the test\nIt's like at some point there's a there's personal responsibility the teacher can't take a hammer and hammered into your brain right they can only give you the information and it's your job whether or not you're going to take that information and\nI think that's what a lot of people\n... that's the case with a lot of people I mean people are given the information I mean people like Gary Palmer come to speak to college students\n\nOutside of their schedule that he didn't have he doesn't have to do this we're not going to be the voting force that gets him over the edge you know to get him back in office he doesn't have to do this but he chooses to do it because he believes in the process so much\nAnd people just they don't care and some of them that show up they don't listen and then there was something else that was incredible last night\nWe were sitting there and so afterwards he does ask for a picture right it doesn't ask for payment for speaking like he would if any other organization asking them to speak he doesn't ask for anything all the asked for his picture so a lot of people go down there but there's some people\nThat just don't want to go down for the picture and I get it some people don't like having their picture taken but this is rude about it too like it's the only form of ... and he's like a can I get a picture of the aisle and they're like no\nI'm like okay All right\nOnly for David he asked for and he's like a can I get a picture with you know and they're like no I'm like okay\nAlright are like what does that hurt\nI don't care if you're a die hard Democrat right I don't care of your as left as they come what does it hurt getting a picture with Gary Palmer\nIt really doesn't it if if you think it hurts to get a picture with a senator that disagrees with you a little bit on some policy stuff or a congressman and the case of Gary Palmer that disagrees with you a little bit about some stuff I Would\nPush you to evaluate your thinking All right we're going to go out to these phones eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three we're going to help out the Dexter on line one fixed or how you doing\nAnd how you doing this for better now deserved extra how about yourself\nOh man I boat up that showed outlaw hot ... and\nI knew it was time in my man I was going to\nA sort of weird I Know I Know you you're talking about are the people didn't show up a little town all thing at all or whatever\nYeah well he uh he came and spoke to speak to college Republicans and nobody showed up really only ten people did on Sanford stamp is\nThe construction field is wide open as a pocket knife yeah and you know one hundred percent on how to go to Mike ... live in a working hard a lot of paperwork with the ... a lot of people were there by\nYou know and\nIt's just not that it's a lot of people do they were saying well you got to go to college you got to get a degree or there's a lot of people out here that are manager at a grocery store managers up different kind of trucking companies that have a degree that in physical education\nYou know and that might really good money very but\nYou could get a job at it because you had a degree it didn't matter what it was saying it ... you know are they allowed the allergy or something like that\nMhm but back\nLike you were talking about Tim McGraw a step back and I see stuff that's when technology really kind of started taking all yeah and all the technology was good afternoon boat what black show\nYou know [laughter] ... what you can do very true\nBut you know a lot of people on end politics 'cause they're not thinking about future ... my dad used to always get money put it in a bank save it you know save it save it if I had a quarter for every dollar spent in by I wouldn't have to worry about doing it I\nKnow yeah I'm a I feel about one hundred percent\nAnd he was talking about Gary Palmer your mom or a British smart man he's good man you know there will be back country mhm uh\nI've I've met him before and talked to him in ... and I mean he's saying straight forward it could be oh yeah I think it's really good representative and I think he's somebody that you could pay attention to\nA one hundred percent he's definitely one of the good ones and that's what struck me is that you know sometimes politicians you can listen to him speak and you can tell you know they're putting on that mask they're putting on that political mask and they're going to tell you exactly what you wanted a year and he didn't he told you exactly what he thought\nUm and what he thought is what aligns with a lot of the people who his constituents um ideology and I really appreciated that that a politician was willing to be so forward and not just pandering to people\nI I mean have you first and I thank you use a true\nNo thanks right one in a way yeah very true you know paint in yeah yeah very true but\nWe need more representatives like that and if these people don't get out and vote your ... the guy in that way my\nThen ... and that's what he said he said look we have a team mentality right now you got to get out and vote we can't have this voter apathy where it's like oh you know we were doing good right now it's just going to stay that way he's like because if we lose the house and we lose the Senate it probably doesn't stay that way because we're just going to be stagnant\nUh for the next two years maybe until the next elections come around\nYou know a Trump doesn't do everything I mean Jesus Christ what what let me tell you the grass I dialed in golf mhm you know ...
