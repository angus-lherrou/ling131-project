now I Am in the dark\nWearing pink headphones a smile on my face I plenty of notes before me something's wrong with me because this is an important moment in history\nAnd we're in paying headphones a smile on my face I plenty of notes before me something's wrong with me because this is an important moments in history this matters Kavanaugh's confirmation or fail to confirmation matters\nGravely for our country but it feels like the day before the iron bowl\nYou know [laughter] I Know is that what you're talking about\nThe level of energy kind of kinetic energy that I'm feeling is not really political as much as it feels like it's the Superbowl\nWeekend well and some of that I think is the fact that they're going to be voting on a Saturday right so it just kind of has that feel to it that we're not used to I feel the same way and actually\nI think it's very similar to how I felt the day before we found out President Trump was President Trump's sure if that same type of energy and emotion\nYeah nothing Florida and I mean it's a huge deal\nI'm totally geek that out but it's strange to me so we have protesters who don't want cabinet right and then he got tears running down their face and they're screaming and yelling and they're passionate and their worked up\nI'm feeling none of those things are I mean I'm I'm very interested in I guess I'm I'm having a struggle\nKind of communicating the words but I appreciate that you seem to understand where I'm coming from [noise] it's important but my mind is approaching the importance of it from really in a place\nNow actually do understand that it it's like we're not excited for it and the historical sense right it's just we've all been through this dog and pony show for the past however many we are and this is the culmination everything\nIf this if you know this is a media circus they've been calling it I'm ready for the guy to get shot out of the cannon yeah and I mean [laughter] but I think we're we [laughter] we had the popcorn but gotten can be the leader of hey thanks for printing out the elephants shoot the guy out of the can and I go home\nThe grand finale as to finally have that but I think it's been that whole\nThing or it's like the build up to the the culmination has been too long drawn out right ... it's been too much I I was done like a week ago I Need this and\nWell I was done a week ago now I'm going to\nBe sad when it's all over your likeness Karen I really\nAm even if he gets confirmed and he sits on the court for the next thirty five years and I know that it's weird and as a grown man I should not have this juvenile view it does matter\nWe need a an originalist on the court we want someone who I Believe that the constitution is the guiding\nA I guess document for how we write law how we govern ourselves is not a living breathing document that changes on a whim I Know it's been born and you think of all the different issues that matter\nI Want his confirmation I Do but as a juvenile\nI turned forty two years old tomorrow but I feel like um fourteen years old right and I'm ... gonna do about it\nDon't you think that the media has played a role in that I mean they have drug testing out in the public square like yeah something for us to like sit back and pops and popcorn and white\nRice I think this has been done to you and you're just a victim or a product of all of that well what I mean we are the media [laughter]\nBut we did not create this and I feel like they did I mean think about the fact that they even drug\nThis out in front of the American people the hearings and not not just a cab and all I'm Talking about cabinet and Christine Ford how did that in the public forum and I'm not saying that they shouldn't be transparent but they did that intentionally to try to shape public perception\nIs it wrong\nFord had that in the public forum and I'm not saying that they shouldn't be transparent but they did that intentionally to try to shape public perception\nIs it wrong but I'm ready for the sequel\nI'm reading here we are getting ready for what is the season finale right yeah and then your favorite show goes away and you wanted to come back to the good news is\nWe are all Republican Democrat voters of all kinds are going to be energized for the midterms in ways we would not have been if not\nNo I agree with that a hundred percent now you might get your season to jump if Kavanaugh is confirmed and then Trump has to nominate someone out and we have to go through this all over again and no doubt he'll nominate a female if I ... and then I Will be very curious to see what they throw at her\nYes the thing that will be notable if if Kavanaugh is not confirmed tomorrow then you're up against the clock so you'd have to have I my understanding is basically\nLike a recess appointment right it wouldn't be time to get it all done ahead of the midterms and then there wouldn't be so much drama as to whether or not\nBut I think that in itself and staying out of all the trap or\nGood called George Will see how it plays out appreciate your perspective I thank you for checking in I Do I Do it's important factor the recipe and

Jillian something or other from Fox News and I'm just a fan\nI don't know when the the trend went from lipstick more like a mat finished dry the lip gloss but I just love it and you're like in that shy and I just I support that isn't that made for well blubber is that\nSo [laughter]\nI've got to admit that true I'm going to have the guy [laughter] right that's what I hired all my life was that it's made out of well lover alright\nWe will ah we will have to fact check that we don't want to be fake news about the whale blubber I Do think\nHaving watched the movie fight club years ago where Brad Pitt is making soap and I do feel like they talk about using fat maybe human fat for soap which is odd to think about oh I'm not sure that that's true it's true that that was in the movie it's true that that was the claim being made but I don't know well blubber for the uh\nThe lip gloss that is good at Jessica have you seen\nThe video of the Canadian karate kid\nUm I don't think so yeah All right let me we're going to kind of take our time with this one okay let me describe him to you in full you don't have to close your eyes but You're welcome to undergo nice and slow here okay so we're in Canada think of a guy probably late twenties [noise] pardon me late twenties early thirties\nLips pierced oh wait both of them is bottom lips ... okay a little bit of facial hair he's got glasses kind of a dark ... glasses dude he's wearing a purple hoodie\nAnd he works with a hair salon gay and ... out the no the hook I don't think that he's ... he's got the zip up I got windbreaker purple thing with the smog sarcastic hipster smile on his face\nCanadian karate kid roundhouse kick a pro life protester he\nSays he's trying to kick the phone out of her hand he missed the phone [laughter] kicked the girl here's what I don't understand by all accounts they would appear that he's there\nTo support pro choice people right he won ... that he is here a defender of women right how's the show that he gets caught on camera basically dropped kicking in the face [laughter]\nA pro life support [laughter] [noise]\nSo he's there I Would imagine looking for a date he cut fair he's a Canadian karate kid\nHe has a purple hoodie on this look on his face and the woman holding the camera that gets kicked\nIs them she herself is pro life she is filming some pro choice protesters he doesn't take to that he looks at her sticks his tongue out to one side like look how cute I Am and he's so what\nYou're saying is if if a girl gets raped in at this and that and the baby should be\nKept alive she's like yes it's a baby why would you kill the baby I'm Sorry that this rape habit if it was all about twenty five thirty seconds long and then instead of continue with the debate he gets this bizarre\nIt was all about twenty five thirty seconds long and then instead of continuing with the debate gets this bizarre grin on his face sticks just hung out to one side like he's Michael Jordan preparing to do a slam dunk from the ... the free throw line\nAnd then does around the house karate\nKid kick not kicking the\nThe woman's hand but the woman to the\nGround okay wait and the fences that he was trying to kick the phone out of her head and the defense he offered as she's laying on the ground\n[laughter] if if that's your ultimate goal is to get the phone out why not just like snatch it\nWhy not leave it alone is that your phone service and let's just those picturing it lets our sanity ... why why go around health kick 'cause he's a karate kid I don't want to know impressed the women who were there I don't quite know what do you think that it worked okay well I mean here's the\nThing I realized with men when they do something stupid it's usually because they tried it on someone else before and it worked right so if he's in a crowd of one and he's probably thinking well this is work before I'll just do it again I think\nLet me let me adjust that a little bit I think what happens is guys who do things to impress saw someone else do\nIt okay and it ... so he did actually have a guy who had the skills and he was like wow that was born and bred them fried I Am going to try that he's going to give it a whirl and it failed it didn't do so well\nBecause we have video like right of it he has been identified he's been fired\nFrom his job and he's very well may face criminal charges he's trying to be a hero of women he's a a pro choice kind of Fela but he kicks basically upside the head the pro lifer is all caught on video\nThey didn't find him he loses his job and now face may face criminal charges so wow take that karate kid art to the phones we go David welcome to the Ford faction\nHi go ahead or not [laughter] I give us a crowd of gifts or a ... and I'm Out\nAnd it's over no good at all um I Do oh five nine four one one on one one toll free one eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three\nAnd I mentioned that with the sec cabinet confirmation the Senate voting fifty one forty nine to advance the nomination looks like we'll get a vote\nAs early as tomorrow as the nomination clears a key hurdle and Fox News making the rounds and talking to different senators Jeff Flake voted yes Susan Collins voted yes Democrat Senator Joe Manchin voted yes as well\nLisa Murkowski voted no might be a little bit fun I'm next half hour to take some calls kind of we talked about how it feels like a game day and offer\nYou were productions which way is it going to go\nIf it comes down to a fifty fifty tie\nThe vice President Pence would get the the tie breaker of course he would vote to confirm\n[noise] okay well why didn't they ask like like ... and I know the person to say what it and I asked where's the people don't do God came into all the way you were the one that did they ask to eat it so where are they okay so like who ... you can't remember who drove you back and forth\nSo you feel like he wasn't question well enough at the hearing there on the Senate floor is that what you're saying\nYeah I it's which I hearing deposition why wouldn't they asked ... questions like I've been before\nThey didn't ask her an equine but if you're referring to the Democratic side because they're not interested in the truth I think [laughter] I Know that you know they were interested they would have answered and Republicans were afraid to come across as anti woman when ever made and the prosecutor in there and meantime\nIt's the the pro choice karate kid who's kicking the women so they're talking about violence on the left to the phones Adam welcome back to the Ford faction\nI thank you I just wanted to see if you are not only on a\nOn the Ford facts on Facebook but again when Jessica comes back at three on the line y'all put a foot or the office number for old Josie\nAre up there so that we can bombard his office and let him know he's gone and I'll go ahead and stick it up here on the air for all of us who can't wait to get back home and a check to check the page\nNot a bad idea a negative ad and we appreciate is aboard faction two oh five nine four\nHome and check the check the page [laughter]\nNot a bad idea hey thank you there and we appreciate it support faction two oh five nine four one on one on one one toll free one eight six six five five one Ninety nine\nThirty three Russell pie also Jessica here today Clark go right ahead\nNow so I I don't know if I really want to disagree with what Matt said are just taking a little further you know he said the Democrats were worried about roe versus white yeah\nRallying cry right now but that's not what they're worried about what are they worried about their ideas are so bad that even though they control almost all the media cases twelve schools colleges\nI can keep going on even though that control all that they cannot get their ideas past sue an actual legislative body\nSo that ... have been their legislative venue for at least the last fifty years right and when you have a conservative majority on the Supreme Court that goes away for them and that's the reason they are so desperate here\nYou know Rosie weight is just that that's a rallying cry that they can get their base fired up about but that's not really what they're about right now\nI think that's a good point because there there is a strong potential that roe v Wade in the future should cabinet to be confirmed it there's a possibility that they can be overturned but even if it's not even if it's not Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court is still going to be\nUm a major influence\nOn the legality of of how we're governed for decades to come potentially\nYes or no I Do have a question here and it's just right up a question I don't have a clue is Lisa Murkowski going to be primary because of this or can she maintain that the state of Alaska if she votes no tomorrow\nYeah I Would think she could probably maintain that seat simply because it is of no surprise she was considered a swing vote to\nBegin with and um you know she ended up voting no I don't think that's necessarily going to surprise the people of her state they like or to this point so I don't think she's in\nGrades political danger or I might be wrong on that but I think it's different than let's say if you had another more conservative I'm\nRepublican who who maybe by surprise voted no\nOkay and then one last question does she lose all committee appointments and whatnot because of this can be put on for a minute we're trained detail or something\nWell [laughter] I mean I guess it's possible I Will tell you after her no vote after the Senate vote today even though she voted no her colleagues came and shook her hand they have great respect her they're not surprised\nBy her vote and I think they feel believe they can get a confirmation even without her her yes vote so I don't think she'll be ban is just yet\nOkay well just was hope or [laughter]\nI beg your mark [laughter] game you're next on the Ford faction two oh five nine four one one oh one one toll free one eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three games go right ahead\nIt James\nOh All right well gung ho Douglas [laughter] and I still have games are ... go ahead\nJames at it [laughter] okay go ahead I'm Sorry Oh yes yes yes yes [laughter]\n[laughter]\nOkay go ahead I'm Sorry Oh yes yes yes yes\nIt is in a liberal talk ten minutes to take that girl and the head why wasn't that\nThis was in Toronto is and this happened on the [noise] yeah yeah but what a tough guy rhyming want a tough guy with his purple honey and got\nOut I guess I could see somebody like myself coming down on the table but it would have fallen care\nYeah I think you're right I didn't see him trying to kick a man he takes a woman holding a phone\nAt a hotel choice pro life rally sort of thing there's a disagreement on the sidewalk if they want to have words fine but he had his tongue stick analogies Michael Jordan he had this stupid look on his face he's wearing a goofball\nPurple hurting and yeah he kicks the woman like he's the karate kid roundhouse kick in the mid to kick the phone out of her hands city kicked through the shorter knocks into the ground he's been identified he's lost his job now may face criminal charges\nI Hope I Hope that dome and kale out domino really bad you know how that worked at it I thought I'd gotten it could be down if it happened and the south I'm sure thoughts on a gentleman like myself cutting down on it with a baseball\nFan [laughter] magazine name is James James James Bagian where the guy I Do yes and here's what I'm saying I mean I'm not condoning violence I Am not I don't want anybody to get beaten down\nBut I worry you hears oh sorry Jim we'll get to see her second well here's what I was going to say you hear about in ... in prison okay now what are you in for [laughter] you don't want to be the kind of person I mean here because I kicked a woman you know that right yeah I Do not want to be your claim to fame Hi Jim go right ahead buddy\nWell first off I Want to say that when I first heard uh the young lady on the air that there with you I pictured are just as I saw a picture in it and attract if a self confident intelligent gal so I mean\nIn in my opinion is exactly what how I picture that only ever happens [laughter]\nWell no and then I actually met you I don't recall when when I came into the ... [laughter] anyway yeah and and and your just basically what I pictured in my mind when I heard you on the air but anyway uh I agree with you this guy should not\nGet a beat down what he should definitely do some serious jail time in a salt as an assault yeah and you know this whole thing to me and I am so glad to finally see I'm an outspoken person I tell it like it is I Know sugar coach stuff and I'm so glad to finally see a lot of the people\nIn power mainly the Republicans and some of the others even some of the commentators are actually telling it like it is about\nAbout how evil\nThe Democrats are and and it it's not something that happened overnight this has been this way for years and people have been sugar coating it and giving him kid gloves\nAnd you're making excuses for him and Lisa Murkowski I actually met her and her father her father was governor of Alaska when I was up there\nAnd one of the reasons that I think people voted for her 'cause he was pretty conservative fell a but the one of the things that the standard me in Alaska is how many liberals or were you would think the last frontier would be\nKind of like the wild wild west you know in the butt half the judges up their smoke dope\nOr they turn people lose that they were not top friendly uh it's really a ... I don't mean\nEnvironment in Alaska that that would take you by surprise you if you're up\nYou know it's interesting that you and I know the thrust of your call was amount about no but the ...\nWyoming in Alaska that will take you by surprise you\nYou know it's interesting that you and I know the thrust of your call was not about dope but the more we hear about people the more I think probably more people do it then will admit to it\nI'm sure it it really is crazy people have these strident views is bad\nAnd then you can find out that they've been ruining his all time are taking baggage him we appreciate the guards the Ford faction phone number here nine four one one one one toll free one eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three no sugar coating it the economy\nIs booming give me some headlines about that next the Ford faction making radio great again\nDo you want to melt sat get toned and had the body you always wanted then you need to check out iron tribes fitness through high intensity interval training and nutrition education I even tried to get healthy trend setting gain muscle Ayers rabbit currently looking for forty locals who want to participate in a free six we challenge that is guaranteed to get the results\nWith that challenge you'll get accustomed meal plan personal accountability grocery list and so much more as long as you reach your goal wait the challenge is absolutely free\nContact your closest try today to find out more\nHad guys this is Thomas talk from ... we're talking about our service milk meals which is\nReal prep but you can pick up on Monday afternoon so what we do is we have meals and we have food pounds which you\nAnd to hear them just lobbying for votes you know I don't mind that they're running though I have to see it I'm not going to vote to opt out you know Cory Booker God love you you know I Wish you nothing but the best but I don't want to see a big Muslim TV he's going to be grandstanding like nobody has that cannot take his avoid faction\nRussell be Jessica your phone Gulf two oh five nine four one one oh one one or toll free one eight six six by by one Ninety nine thirty three [noise]\n\nDo you why do you have for him Coleman W do you see these two or three years we're super six of one on one will be windy\nRecently on the Michael hard\nEvery ... yeah I I don't him a lot of my life in the kitchen I Do as a bit of\nI Know somebody say something by\nI mean and you're on the same page when I'm cooking dreamy knows\nDo not come in the kitchen [noise] when I married my first wife when she could better get and I said I was like ... ... what do you mean as I said well you said just bumped sacrificing\nNikki [laughter] [noise]\nI remember him that will get\nThe most too hard\nOn superstation little one do you want [noise]\nIf you're looking for a new home anywhere from Huntsville to warn you do not want to miss your free W Whitey home orange see with the whole butler team if you're an easy about buying a new home a home orange is the best remedy to be worry free this means within one year of being in your new home if anything\nHappens to your HVAC\nHumming electrical or larger planes is\nYou are covered start your journey to a new home with a free home on the front of the whole ...

Ford faction on a friday and the one o'clock hour begins and make that distinction because it then it begins\nWith a drastically different emotions for me than just one hour ago Jessica oh\nWow really and I\nI I didn't have this written down this is just this I'm just telling you\nHow I feel organic organic here's what I mean we had callers and I can't remember which specifically said those have just the kind of person who calls it as they see it I think it might have been Jim\nSaying that and\nI Want to do the same but\nOftentimes the best I can do is just tell you how I'm feeling what my gut tells me I don't know if my guts right or wrong oh they were even knows but in the moment what am I feeling\nSome on the show yesterday I was telling you that I felt that there is going to be one or two Republicans who are maybe going to surprise us with a no we had some swing votes out there but I just thought\nSomeone was going to have their Ted Cruz moment you remember at the convention two years ago when everybody is offering praise for Trump as he accepts the nomination from the Republican Party\nTed Cruz takes the stage he wanted to be different things and vote your conscience you didn't they vote for Trump is a vote your conscience got booed off stage John McCain had indicated he was going to vote for the repeal of Obamacare until he didn't he gave the famous thumbs down killing the repeal effort\nOf Obamacare we spend a lot of time on this yesterday those were my thoughts of yesterday of the victory lap I was hearing by Republicans I felt was premature\nLet's go back to just one hour ago our show began ... an hour ago and I was telling you how to geek up it felt like a game day felt like the super bowl\nI wasn't even really caring about the historic nature of it as much as that was just excited by all of the energy right we talked about that for twenty minutes\nThen comes the word that an hour from now Susan Collins will announce which way she's going to vote\nThen comes the word that an hour from now Susan Collins will announce which way she's going to vote\n\nIt's hard to make predictions because either go your way or they don't write I don't know and you can laugh an hour from now if I get it wrong I'm telling you right now and one of five in the afternoon I think an hour from now she tells us She's going to vote no\nI think this very well could all come crashing down in an hour and whatever goofy energy I was feeling an hour ago and now we're real nervous is not for the sake of the show and I'm not saying for the sake of a segment and our from go an hour ago were laughing about just little gravy\nKeep the craziness going my gut tells me an hour from now it could all fall apart senator Collins has lunch with a leader Mitch McConnell I don't know that you'd having lunch with him to say I'm voting yes right I think she might be saying you can't count on me\nWell and I I I thought it was kind of strange that she came out and said she was going to make a statement today\nI mean I had of the vote and what's the purpose of that and I don't understand if you vote yes to go ahead and move forward to have the vote then why hold a press conference to say which way you're going to vote sure because it would seem if she's going to come out and say 'cause I battled with this myself it would seem as she was going to come out today and say I'm voting no well why did you vote yes to\nGo ahead and have the vote tomorrow yeah I mean that doesn't make any sense but then again if you're going to come out and say she's voting yes what's the point of telling us that right\nAnd I think you can have a yes vote to let's get to the vote was kind of wrap this up what's your final answer who wants to be a millionaire style of\nVoting yes to move the final vote to me I don't necessarily think is yes I Will vote for this person I think it's just let's get through it already have enough information right I made my decision\nAn hour from now you can call and say your big dummy we knew it was fine and the victory lap can continue a head of the vote tomorrow but\nSitting here right now my only emotion is I don't think there's going to happen\nWell there's one or two chains of thought I've had it's either a she's going to go ahead and and lay out her her reasons why she's voting no when she wants to go ahead and clear the deck and make sure she saves data or it could be the exact opposite it could be that she's nervous about her yes vote and she wants to make sure everybody knows why she's voting yes okay so she can walk away with the clerical yeah\nAnd that may be I did see a headline or maybe it was a an opinion piece of that the FBI didn't clear Kavanaugh as much as it allowed for Republicans to have a clear conscience is\nWhen they vote for him for confirmation\nHappened to get your thoughts that's all that's all we have here um\nIt's you know we're not professional prognosticators were just sharing our thoughts we all read we all watch we all listen and we react and You're welcome to do so as well two oh five nine four one one oh one one\nSo free one eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three an hour ago I was getting enjoying the circus right now yeah\nI'm nervous is going to come crashing down here this afternoon\nLet's find out what Sandy has to say Sandy welcome\nHi how are you doing\nWell I was better an hour ago now I'm nervous how are you\nI'm good good and then on the whole thing is\n... is the new way to give some tickets run fundraisers manage volunteers track hours

help others and build the most powerful trust document ever changing the world starts with transparency ... dot com that's your Q. U. E. S. T. dot com is just power\n\nBases [noise]\nWhat are your best interests October twenty four teams\nUp to ... and head out to dig a super speedway for Easter weekend October twelve to fourteen ticket holders for the with thousand votes dot com five hundred can enjoy camping in three different camp grounds around the track this is more than a race this is ...\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n\nThat is no warning\n[noise]\nThat is so important and you just [noise]\nI Know you've got some where do you make your cell phone home as\nAnd Ford faction are also be Jessica your phone calls Murphy will get to ... do you hear and\nSecond we got Andrea ties coming in and telling her off air that um it's just fun just can we talk about this hanging out together Andrew does a great job I don't know Ford well but um you know I appreciate him and Michael ... thousand years\nScott reason we tease when it's just fun right it's just fun what we get to do even as our heart rates quick in and our blood pressure rises and her voice booms and we disagree we fight we bad movies or whatever\nIt's just fun right absolutely just good good good good and we appreciate you listening and commenting\nJessica yesterday somebody called in and I was ready for them to completely bust my chops because I could hear it in their voice was coming and\nI had made a point about cabin on politics he's like\nOh [laughter] whoever good I\nDon't you know something I don't want to hear from you because I Know something about you like oh my God what are you going to say I know that you took a photo with cardboard Hillary Clinton haven't listened for years you know and then we had a good laugh about it I think she's high then I'll never\nForget that so it's a reminder that these are important times and these are\nSituations that matter they do they do they do but then there's also the realization we're in a country with roughly three hundred Seventy five million people that we votes we\nGet involved we let our voices be heard\nBut in some respects we're also just got to go in with the flow and I don't mean that to be dismissive but you just life is what life is we try to be good citizens and good parents and good spouses and good friends and hardworking employees and the rest is just kind of details\nYeah right yeah I Know what you mean and it's one of those things too and I know that we have a we have a voice as voters and blah blah blah\nBut in this current situation we don't really have any power to control the outcome of graduation all we can do is sit back and watch and see what happens and it is it's kind of nerve wracking in a way I agree because it's one of those times and and the more you can do this especially in this industry and radio\nThe more you kind of get a knack for being able to predict maybe not with a hundred percent accuracy but you know you you kind of feel things out you're like I think I Know how this is going to pan out I have no idea [laughter] literally have no clue and it\nFeels kind of good to say that 'cause I listen to to other people who do this job or a watch things on TV or read people on line like wow these people are so stinking smart\nAnd then there is wrong if the rest of my thoughts on it you know none of us are and I\nThink I realized that not just politics but with sports you know we're all paid to have an opinion and express our opinion and you think of the most passionate people in the most opinionated people I Can't remember when they were right or when they were wrong I Would try sometimes ... you know like when it comes to sports they'll give the\nGoldstone lock of the day I promised tomorrow afternoon this is going to happen\nAnd then Monday rolls around I Can't remember what the right and who knows I enjoy listening I enjoyed talking to them and that was good enough like Murphy we always enjoy hearing from him go right ahead\nScorpion in the wall of Whitey\nYou're talking to them and that was good enough like Murphy we always enjoy hearing from him go right ahead\nRussell piece scorpion the wall of Whitey\nThat I like it\nYes yes ah listen ah Christine Blasey Ford is a liar she has borne false witness against Brett Kavanaugh\nAs she might be tell the truth about being assaulted but when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh she is lied by implicated in him now and then flying\nBut how do you have now let me and that may be but here's ... let me ask you this is how how in the world could you know that\nWould would you go to Congress and to tell the whole entire world somebody assaulted\nMe well Haitian here is that ... that Brett Kavanaugh salt\nAnd he said he was in or a hundred percent yes I don't know if he did or not I did\nShe provided hero evidence she none of her\nWitnesses would corroborate her story and then my living all it takes us to\nBut there's a difference between being unable to corroborate and being an refuting right I mean I feel like her friend Leland uh she she didn't tell the FBI when they spoke earlier this week that she felt pressure from one of Dr Ford\nUm allies to change your story or to revisit her story but you know you make a claim I'm unable to corroborate it simply means I Can't vouch for it I that doesn't that's not the same\nAs me saying it definitively didn't happen\nI don't know whether Dr Ford is telling the truth or not so I certainly we talked about this on the show last friday in fact I don't want to bear fault false witness against her I don't know I Do agree with you that she didn't produce enough evidence or maybe even any evidence but I'm not ready to call her a liar\nWell if it walks like a dog wax like it though [laughter]\nCollins and Murkowski both of those ladies are owned by Planned Parenthood and\nIt's I you know for Murkowski not voting for him she's all along with the with Planned Parenthood Collins yeah maybe she's getting something out of a deal she's got a sweetheart something coming in the next whatever bill um but she has to get out in front of that and say face with Planned Parenthood\nBecause she's in there they're in her pocket so she's going to put on a dog and pony show to make it look like she's she's doing this against her will like her arms being twisted\nIn order for her to maintain her status and keep getting our tax dollars as campaign contributions from Planned Parenthood\nWhatever her statement is thirty minutes from now can we all agree we don't want to Cory Booker moment he'd she doesn't need to go over forty minutes I'll give her for just make your point up or down yes or no and we can all move on and figure out what happens next\nBut ah yeah I don't need an hour long press conference with her telling us whether she's going to vote yes or no tomorrow\nWell I I don't think she's chair and are close yelling I'm Spartacus\n[laughter] I don't think that's going to happen what if\nShe got out there today All right I'm all for almost thirty minutes away from this now and she goes to this whole long thing about how she feels and all this and she goes so I'll let you know tomorrow\n[laughter] that's like a cliffhanger I was going to polarize the craft and saying after the ... [laughter] gosh can you imagine\nGood call her a buddy always good to speak with you I Do appreciate it two oh five nine four one one on one one toll free one eight six six by\nBy one Ninety nine thirty three Senate voting today fifty one forty nine to advance the cabin on nomination Jeff Flake Susan Collins voting yes to move forward the final vote on Kavanaugh tomorrow as did\nThe one forty nine to advance the cabinet nominations Jeff Flake Susan Collins voting yes to move forward the final vote on Kavanaugh tomorrow at the Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of voting yes eight no from a Republican senator of Alaska Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins\nOf Maine I Believe it's Maine right or will be offering her\nHer plans on her vote for tomorrow I'm nervous I think next hour we're going to find out that she voted no when Jessica I Do like\nThe kind of the different scenarios you laid out that maybe she doesn't know or maybe this was her way of saying I'm voting yes\nBut ... me too I'm Still with you or I don't appreciate how Dr Ford has been treated I don't like that she's been ridiculed or whatever this is not a complete and total endorsement Brett Kavanaugh himself but they have enough information to vote yes so maybe this is her trying to save face however she chooses to vote\nAnd what makes sense as she did that I mean because that's kind of what they do they're all about protecting themselves and their image\nYeah meantime a President Trump continues to tweet I Can't wait to get his reaction later today to see what he has to say he did call the protesters earlier today paid actors not to buy into it he says they're paid by George Soros and others\nProtesters gathering in front of Mitch McConnell's office having a cabin are keg or with beers and solo cups you got all people up in arms in all manner of ways we got Andrea ties coming in we've got to talk about the economy I tease that we would and then failed to do so will use them in the headlines to show you how\nTo do that you're you're saying let's continue on I don't know what she thought could be achieved by continuing debate well butter allegations could come for I guess ... but he the here's what she said after it did the woman's all over the place like she's just a\nDeer in headlights gone you know between the the dotted line like just both sides yeah because she said afterwards to reporters basically indicating\nI did vote no for on this cloture vote but that doesn't mean now I Will vote no against him\nWell yeah I Know the ... and Collins said the same thing about her yes vote so it's a weird thing is it's almost it feels like to me and maybe I'm just\nFantasizing you've got these two women and it's like they're trading off votes like I'll vote no for cloture you vote yes then when it comes to the real vote you vote no and also yeah all swept through at will do a switch through and that'll just show how conflict there we are and how we had to wrestle this through and we weren't quite sure I don't know I had\nHeard is that the agreement was they're going to go in the same direction of let's agree yes or no that we vote the same way so there's not one person\nStanding out as a sore thumb right\nBut rather be a group of people flake out together or stood strong\nRight so I I'm not quite sure what the reasoning all is in that but it just struck it struck me as interesting because Murkowski in college tend to work together there you know Bob de twins\nAnd um and Murkowski said no calling said yes let's vote it's through let's get it to a final vote and then I'm In the Murkowski is like yeah I'm not a hundred and ... not\nSo I don't know what these girls are plotting honestly it's kinda crazy\nThis conversation today conversation yesterday and even last friday isn't always breaking down what happened but really trying to\nPredict what might happen I've been talking on the show today that my emotions are kind of all over the place at as the show began at twelve hours pretty excited just the whole spectacle of at all\nThen at one o'clock when the news came of here's the time two o'clock hour it'd be three eastern but two o'clock for us when Susan Collins makes known her planned on how she'll vote I suddenly got nervous have you Andre have your emotions kind of gone up and down here and there are you pretty much locked in however you feel about things\nIt's really much it's just a a wait and see hold my breath I'm In hold my breath mode and I'm just holding my breath not letting the emotions come one way or the other right now I they're they're not going to vote until four o'clock tomorrow because they have to wait thirty hours\nAnd I calculated that they completed their vote right before ... and came on so he comes in at ten\nSo it you twenty four hours of ten AM and then you add six and it's going to be around for pm that\nAnd anything can happen I mean I some there was one point where when calling said she would vote you know vote for cloture but that didn't guarantee that you would vote yes for the final confirmation it sounded to me like she was just simply buying time like\nYou know vote for cloture but that didn't guarantee that you would vote yes\nFor the final confirmation it sounded to me like she was just simply buying time like I'm going to vote yes here but don't assume anything because I Need to get back to my office [laughter] quickly without getting accosted by a myriad of screaming women blocking me in the elevator and you know making me feel bad to think\nThat they would get interest in terms of the protesters and the pressure from the public and people literally screaming in your face I Know that this has historical and that maybe we they haven't seen that level of protest you know first hand\nBut but at a certain point it as as many years of some of these senators have been in place you'd think they kind of used to the public pressure and be able to navigate through that without it you know knock on the back and forth I mean it it kind of surprises me that they're not a a little bit more accustomed to that\nYou would think that they would be Jessica but at the same time think about how often they skate through on doing things with their little shallow surface explanations right and nobody calls in to the carpet on it for example who's a costing Doug Jones right now\nBecause Doug Jones gave the most shallow answer about why he voted no on her the and um it it's in raging when you think about it when the the a majority of people here in the ... in Alabama want Kavanaugh\nAnd want him to vote for Kavanaugh and he's a senator representing us and he's voted no so how you know nobody's chasing him down roughly what what did he say you know to give a direct quote but just his his reasoning or did he oh well see I happened to have a piece\nOur let her go to their yeah let me just whip it out there it is yeah I ... a piece\nStory Jones is saying you know what this is what makes me nauseous really he says there's been unprecedented ugliness this is true okay on both sides\nAnd I just I'm Sorry I I fled disagree I'd like to know the ugliness started with dirty Diane and her little\nLetter whipped out from wherever she was stashing it and and the ... the the ugly and they started with dirty died in and it went on with Spartacus and Kamala Harris and you know um what's his name\nWas it was the nickname for um the Rosen guy who claims he's Vietnam I Can't oh I Know is Iran hung dang dang [laughter]\nFrom Vietnam right okay All right anyways it just kept going and going and rolling through on the Democratic side I beg to differ senator Jones who was ugly on the Republican side yeah who was ugly I Know\nIt is strange that Democrats in this situation seem to be able to say whatever they want and any pushback is seen as being mean yeah you know what I mean that you can say all manner of things about Brett Kavanaugh the man and then when he gets heated\nI Can't believe ... look out why can't it just sits there are a lot of ... and just smile about it and wondering what\nKind of man would sit there and and the face of having his family ripped apart you know I mean think about the ah the conflicts and and the pressure that must cause inside his home I mean just as from his wife and his kids and how devastating these accusations have to be I'm sure they know they're not true but still it's it's going to have an effect on your family and then you put him in that situation\nAnd you put them in before the the very people that have orchestrated all this and you expect him to to be a completely perfect human being that's ridiculous and yes and then the act\nAct with this sanctimonious a judgmental spirit like ooh I don't know that\nTemperament oh it might flare up in the middle of a courtroom he might throw is ice well you know what they were saying to their own MSNBC\nWell I don't know that temperament oh it might flare up in the middle of a courtroom he\nMight throw his ice well the you know what\nThey were saying to their own MSNBC there were just like you know I just don't I don't know you know this was like a job interview and and he just did not perform well and I thought how many times during the job interview has somebody asked you if you're a gang rape is because that is literally never happened to me right\nOh I Know right now and the thing is if anybody on any given day released video or some sort of undercover coverage of current day senators and what they do\nWhen they're off camera and they're not going to come on are you kidding me I mean ... yes believe me it it would come around real quick and they\nThey would be caught for the hypocrites that they are\nA hundred times we don't want an ambush you but when we come back we're going to end Bush you\nIs it about that Halloween [laughter] listening yes I years are and I say I forgot to bring that up and\nWhat did you call her dirty energy [laughter] I you know in between dirty day in and you know Dr fraud\nUh I mean Christine for oh yeah yeah you see I'm here's what I'm thinking ... easy enough to get a blonde wig in a in a suit and then just have one of those really super big big cans and wrap it was a cover that says one beer WN\n[laughter] like in a brand name one beer All right and a goofy glasses and some frequent flyer miles tucked in and sticking out of your pocket and oh that'd be fun what do you see on the truth I'm wires out do you mind my lie detector wires hooked up to me I'm so afraid just because he's telling the truth I Know I Know\nI Know but I just think here's a thing as a female and and I mean again I'm kind of go on a limb here but I Would just send the thing that if you were in a situation where you had been you know attempted rape or a year and that type of situation\nThat you would go to the authorities I mean I'm good you know and and since she didn't take that for there's like statute of limitations in place here so she she still had that open door to go to the police and say hey I'd like to you know yelled investigate that if if you were truly wanting someone to have to answer for what they did you\nI Would think that that would be the greatest stuff you could take was to go to your local authorities and and do it there and not put it out\nI could even appreciate the fact that she thought he shouldn't hold that place in the Supreme Court I can appreciate that if if that had really happened\nBut don't you think you should seek justice in the form of going through the proper route and then they even said well you know you need to file charges and she just didn't and that makes me think that she didn't fall charges because you can get in trouble for falling a false police report\n[noise] yes and that was the same thing that came up between you and me Russell remember that why is a person who has a doctorate\nNot going through the proper channels the normal channels the logical channels for how you deal with something if you feel it's worthy of attention by law enforcement or needs even be brought to the Senate you still want to ... you know establish it with law enforcement there is actually a crime\nAnd it's much like the Roy Moore thing it's like Roy Moore didn't all of a sudden burst onto the scene he he was in the public eye for a long time and it was right when he was running for office that all of a sudden we find out and much she'll lay down\nYour book appears in all of these allegations come out that ... and all the time he's been in the news and in the headlines never once said these allegations been\nBrought forth but not all of a sudden\nNever know or like a total abstinence from the garden got rather died from alcoholism ... yeah yeah I guess that makes it\nSo he when he was grabbing about yeah dude that's over [laughter]\nNew door that event [laughter] or that [noise]\n\nDo you why do you do for whom do you do do she reached out to where we were super six of one on one it'll be ...\nThe following program was a ... program and does not reflect the views of station management or sponsors [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nSaying\nOnly talked to [noise]\nWhat you're saying and now it's like [noise]\n\nAn informant patriotism is what\nPeople have got to know whether or not their President Trump is a crisis of confidence I have a job for\nThe governments in this town is excellence and uses your tax dollars suspicion [noise]\nWe've got to do a better job of getting a subset of new to this fruit in prison is that we will keep it from the American people that would be very American thing to do I want you to listen I'm from St Louis [noise]\n\n\nConservative these controversial man is for for this country and he's not afraid to to watch on his mind [noise]\nOr law true sure [noise]\nLike any\nJob\nYou may be indicating brain\nYou may not get\nThe job\nAll right

Andrew maclean was up Andrew\n[laughter] hey whoa hey now we're going over a\nMan what you hear is what we call the gold and then your show starts right or something that uses that happens and you're the man of the hours you get to cover and I'm very jealous of the right\nBut that's why I told you to call amber because I Know you've been all over there so we go and break this down the number to call in you know eight six six by about one not three three oh I get to know like all the body you buy\nThem a metric yellow to address triple W. damage without gum dot com ... trying to stop Malay station a write in this country we appreciate it\nOh I get to know like all the budget you buy\nThem a mentoring they'll do to address triple W. damage without gum dot com oh my gosh I'm ... trying to stop Malay station a rape in this country will present and we love you know let's get into the bra Andrew maclean y'all got lucky I got the one on the edge McLean from the line he called ... with a loving debate today to break down what actually happened to get to the point\nSo bright and thought I Would you first\nHow do we give you know which part what did they you know we need to do you have that was the vote right right and then today but that was a chance that one of the senators had to go marry his daughter oh\nAll right yeah and so they had to hold a vote open ... for him to come fly back of the American daughter so he can ... they didn't they didn't come back no he didn't come back no I'm a guy that wasn't calling it was a who wants to go to Andrew\n[noise] a a dangerous ... is the senator or is it wasn't there who he was attending is is doing his own wedding west yeah right but I'm like I'm not mistaken\nOur task is the senator who haired her her hopes lift Janesville which basically took us two votes away so you're taking away one yeah spoke with against being at that wedding right Murkowski used Senate rules to say I woke up all my vote with his and we'll just\nTake out two votes from the Senate so really instead of having a hundred votes like you normally would in the Senate you only had Ninety eight right and that's why we finished off with a vote that was his speech to forty eight\nWithin fifty one when Mike that's most of the time\nSo Andrew let me ask you this um now that the you know it went through today I mean it would have took a really close to afford not to go through today or what do you feel ...\nMan I Am I Am around I I Want to say this is what I'm most proud about I'm proud to be an American I'm proud to see the way the Supreme Court is being structured [noise] um\nProud of our president who stood his ground and said I Know this is ... ... and I'm not in a whole has nomination I'm let this process right out\nBut I'm mostly proud of the public in\nThat me as well as lots of other people lots of other conservatives have been so frustrated with for so long as they did not have back though they were used to stand up to the other side they stand up for the things they told us they would stand up for when they were campaign when they would ask for votes\nAnd over the past week we have seen those we eat Republicans grow a backbone and when you know following the lead of Donald Trump or just it's just a coincidence that they finally said enough said enough on route of those Republicans finally standing up and saying we're not going to be pushed around anymore\nBryant your thoughts are well I thought this whole process has been absolutely disgusting I'm bringing unfounded uncorroborated and baseless accusations against somebody at the thirteenth our are the moments before they were supposed to vote out of committee ... or ...\nAs this process has continued to go forward in the last week I said I Believe both um\nProfessor Ford\nAnd a judge Kavanaugh uh now that I Know that they were trying to strong arm witnesses now that I Know that I'm more as more information has come out I Do not believe Dr Ford\nMetal and um you know it's just a shame as to what the Democrats in the Senate Judiciary committee in the Senate or what have resorted to their destroyed two families they destroyed the credibility and the reputation of a good judge\nAnd um they are slowly not no no I'm not going to say so\nYou have destroyed the credibility and the reputation of a good judge and um they are slowly not no no I'm not going to say so if they were quickly turning into a the national socialist party a with their um a aggressive behavior and they're brown shirt or ... tactics\nYou know I must say this um [noise] after watching this stuff over the last couple of weeks I'm\nI'm Glad just Kevin I've got confirmed ... I thought he should have been confirmed last week I was on board with him I think thirty six years and after hearing the testimony a couple of weeks ago you know I Would not convinced that I'm actually anything that they could prove anything happen\nI'm I'm Still going to say that I Do believe Dr forward that something did happen\nWith whom I don't know\nBecause I still act as one question that no one can ... Andrew can now since he's on the line with us today um what did you have to gain from it because he's losing everything I mean she's pretty much lost everything\nRight now in gained a million dollars that's a well I mean everything I've ... I've yet to see her where it's been documented the facts as you always say that she has gotten a million dollars I heard people talking about what goes on me accounts to keep it to go from you go out to live to a bunch of dollars for what are they are these actually for her\nShe's actually receive no one's actually documentation where she ever receive that money\nBecause before on on when she was on um the hearings she said that she had no access to any of these accounts\nWill of the the thing with the go fund me accounts if you have a go fund me and you raise it for an individual has to go towards that individual or you can be charged with a crime\nBut I think what you know what you got your is the fact that none of us can accurately\nAnswer what was what did she see there was to gain link started this whole thing and as far as I'm concerned I've seen as things play out ... ... it seems to be political and I I'll I'll even go with your Joe I think\nShe's been sexually assaulted and she recounts this with a therapist years ago and all that kinda stuff\nBut I think I think what's happened is is this this person this woman Dr Ford has taking taking her tragedy or for instance of being sexually assaulted and just act the innocent man aim along with it because he was the pick\nFor the Supreme Court we knew that they weren't going to hate whatever ... dollars from many of them that who was going to be right we're going to the guy and so her with a you know relations to senator and everything else friends family whatever\nThey ended up any type of thing a plan and saying let's just take the things that happened to you which was very vulnerable let stack Brett Kavanaugh name on it and then went over the size of the crap out of it and I see she's implicit in that and the reason I think that's because\nI don't think Brett Kavanaugh did it but she gets up there and she says I Am one hundred per cent without a doubt sure that it is ... ... and if she's saying that and it's not really him and she's in on this whole thing\nBut he lied under oath but here's the thing to do and again I think Rick I'm not too big American when people understand that\nWe don't know ...\nHe stuck to his guns yes well she doesn't know right we're already I mean she can't remember a thing about she can't remember these things but again like I say I'm just being fair on both sides and that that's the way I've been able to tell you I think I'm not going to change today ... you know because like I say I don't see\nAgain for political gain for what she does and being a professor and for a million dollars a screw up your family to screw up your life really well\n[noise] well and that's another question and that\nNo no no but she said that under oath by saying agree with her if she was going after this why did she come out and say first and foremost she wanted to remain anonymous but it could not an ... here's the thing with the with the letter\nIt's not based in any truth but she gave the letter and says she wanted to remind them as a ... half\nThe game and here's the thing though and you have to take on on the entire situation Dianne Feinstein did move on it she sat on it if she thought that it was credible she would have moved on it and I think that there is one of her staffers\nWere so upset that the process that they couldn't bring anything in the initial judiciary hearing a that would tarnished judge Kavanaugh\nWhich are really wasn't anything I mean he's gone as spotless a judicial careers you can get right um\nThey they they ... at the thirteenth our ...\nIs it really wasn't anything I mean he's gone is a spotless a judicial careers you can get right um\nThey they they leaked it at the thirteenth our ... I Believe they lead them or find the man has something to do with it you know I could kill us I think she should be I think the FBI investigation to go into the final hadn't got up I'm asking you got this question let me bring bill into the into this and they were too high that we've got Baylor cook from the morning so what's going on Baylor Joe how you doing\nDoing good doing good um we got Andrew maclean from the line we got brown people this do we get the money so here we we all know what are you right now we are now becoming over here and with the radio talk show host of this ... probably the only one love right now Baylor real cook we bring the wheel quick let me ask you this question what do you think\nThat um about the ... are you you're cool way to do you happy with what\nI'm very excited or I'm very excited because the basic tenets of the American judicial system prevails presumption of innocence was one of the things that our judicial system it's bad rock and in sales today\nBecause if we can say we believe Christine forward the cows come home at the end of the day there was no corroboration to her story no rational validation validation of any kind so you can't really demands career thirty five years\nIt's nothing says to the antithesis of what we've seen throughout his career I mean you you just can't I'm happy\nAnd I really don't like the argument you know for didn't want to take it to the media you all are talking about this just a second ago and the Ford wanted to remain anonymous also allegedly did Anita Hill but she became public and now when we're talking about sports she after she has\nTo find signs office then she turned around and went to the Washington Post three separate times she ... she herself admitted that you can go to the Washington Post if you want to remain anonymous that's just not how it works\nWell at the end of the again okay bail I'm actually does then we'll get back to um I'm Andrew and I'm I'm Brian I think that your name right [laughter] um [laughter] because I'm an ex you and I actually didn't own a TV show um Baylor what does he got the getting\nWhat does she have again a well look I didn't think she got anything again but we cannot overlook the fact that she now has roughly a million dollars and Gulf on me that are going to be given to her I'm not saying that was her motives at all that she is now a millionaire because of coming out and\nLet me actually does bill is again I I hear about a saying we don't know for a fact do you know for a fact go Andrew or I'm Brian ... affected that money's going to go to her\nDid it get like I said if you open up and go on to me and you said this go fund me money has to go towards this individual like us ... you\nCannot raise money for purposes other than what you were saying you were doing so if she has go from the accounts that are opened up in her honor in her name that those funds as soon as that go fund me close this and they have\nTo go to them or else they can be persecuted oh let's let's say hypothetically speaking do y'all are correct\nThis woman and I'm like I said I'm happy just Kevin I've got going for him I think thirty six years ago there was no evidence he should have been confirmed less we got them from all that but my question to everybody that this\nHer family her livelihood is worth a million dollars\nI well I go back to what I said about as a martyr thing and I mean I I Know you brought up\nThe whole thing about her wanting to remain anonymous as an ad that into my hypothetical go ahead and we're going to have to assume that she's being completely honest 'cause\nReally if we look at the two they both everything they said was under oath assume whatever flying right over the line so if she it turned out to be the liar\nShe can lie about wanting to be anonymous and actually hit them working with these\nPeople if they don't bother anyone of love for to do because she can\nShe can lie about wanting to be anonymous and actually hit them working with these\nPeople if they don't advise anyone of life for to do because she could really\nYou don't think Senator Feinstein would stoop to that level of what I'm saying look what the demand\nRental we can only wait a minute it made her look back over here on it made her look bad no she ... she said no no that wouldn't have happened because it made her an overlooked by well she she did why she said well I'm saying for that particular question when they wish he was asked she said yes she did and I'm actually be remain anonymous so I'm saying at that point in time right\nShe she wouldn't have taken the heat for it no she pushed\nIt back on Fort Sam Ford was one that leaked everything and that does how her\nDown to Portland about what I'm saying are beginning she said yes she when she first came to me the active ... a number and I'm at that at that point in that point in time for the whole question hold on doesn't mean older than me at that point in time\nRight when five thing and her was talking about it they got together and she remain anonymous what they see you have the game at that point\nMartyrdom looking that\nCome from I got a question before we get to the ideological Santa Marta them and stuff like that there's just one basic question if you want to remain anonymous do you go to the Washington Post on three separate occasions or did you you just go to your senator and the question\nTo ask you Baylor how long after that she gave that letter D.C go to the Washington about what the next day or whenever they start hitting the famous you want to get her set up as it was already out\nBut that's a strong argument I Want to know if you want to remain anonymous\nIf the ... information got out that she wanted to be none of us it's not for her to tell her story too you know she she went to the press over\nHe wrote a letter to issue and then which rates to her and and then went straight to the Washington Post this was her testimony under a ...\nThe way strangers she went straight to the press and on and\nThen she went to her congresswoman and then the congresswoman then got in touch with Senator Feinstein\nOkay go see that now that they'll make an assistant because why are you going to say you want to remain anonymous right there and then you go straight to the Washington Post so that wasn't the timing of it I don't I'm not ... I'm going to take your word on a CD but to my understanding that she did that after\nIt was it came out no no it was before she she\nShe didn't give the letter but she did contact the Washington Post because he thought that would be the best way in order to get whatever information that she wanted to get out out so what was she going to take the Washington Post for to letting them know that judge Kavanaugh that she had a recollection that he had committed a sexual assault against or when they were teenagers\n... to ... to to Andrew go ahead\nOh ... that's what I got and I am I stand by because again I I Can't stress enough how one of the two lied under oath of crime was committed in right here in a way around it\nBut it I ... I Can't say enough how much how passionate people are in this political climate\nHow passionate people get about whether it's anti Trump was opposed Trump or whatever to where they will be willing to do anything you know if that's putting in a family in harm's way you know they they feel like they've got their own a\nMoral high ground by this in a sense because it's it it wasn't it's not about\nHaving your family sent death threats or getting to talk about and having the name brands are but I'm all over national television\nAnd it was about saving about saving the future of women's ability to be able to get abortions on demand or the rights of gay people whatever other things that they've set about Kavanaugh that he's going to do is on the Supreme Court they have literally\nCreate the American public out over Kavanaugh\nThey've set about having all that he's going to do with some of the Supreme Court they have literally ... the American public out over ... as if this guy is going to come in and make was czar wacky decisions that are going to change the landscape of this entire country\nSo I uh we got Andrew maclean we've got to be able to cook I'm from the morning so Andrew ... on the line we got brand people didn't do that with me were thinking of you guys long ago we got we got out and talk to and how they are we bringing down the Kevin overhearing he had just been confirmed today I'm for Supreme Court during the ... by by ... three might be reluctant delivered to me\nHey hey\nHey how's it going to go and go oh\nLet me say this I understand I can appreciate the Republican point of view of people looking at it from the conservative side I Am a believer in law I'm a believer in the constitution which is why I asked which is why I got so upset and so ticked off when Republicans for a\nAlmost a year held up the nomination of Merrick Garland ... now\nAll things being equal Democrats shouldn't do use this as a learning to\nThis is what you do when you have power you use it now I'll flip the script back the other way Democrats used a learning your Democrats used as a tool all Republicans with President Obama got ... they had sixty into how mean sixty in the Senate\nAnd they had they had a majority of the house so they pushed to Obamacare\nThat's how you do Republicans took that to the next level they use the Senate album they broke ... vote majority they used their power in the Senate minority to block the arrest all bottles apartments and to do everything they could until after twenty twelve the Democrats\nMe too I Believe it happened to him\nWhy we were we don't have a ...

Kevin up here and\nI hear what everybody's saying now I've been defending doctor for it you know throughout the show on a few things but let me tell people where I really see it on where her story goes campus to the side for me\nWhen she said she wanted to remain anonymous that made me put my breaks do I believe just Dr Ford I Believe something happened to her\nI Do not believe that it was a breakup Brett Kavanaugh if there was no evidence um but this is where a lot of stuff for the fall apart from me with her of course the when she says you couldn't fly ... okay that was a big no no for me and she was\nThis rated on that yeah I've been living here and she um that that part for me would just you know it kind of liquor off yeah you have to go I mean that that was a no brainer for me a lot about that\nUm the other part that really are made me started to say you know ... okay let me let me let me think about this when she started to go back and forth um during the hearing and they was asking are different questions now I'm not a woman\nI've never been in this situation ever ever ever before so I cannot say that people will remember don't remember but here's my point that I'm going to make about this\nIf I Know that I'm a doctor I've been to college I'm college educated and I know my facts don't stand war do hold water am I going to go to the press with this because it can be very hard for me to\nProve that made me question what she's doing\nBecause it's very hard to prove you can put it out there but you're putting out an acquisition that you can approve which can ruin a man's career in the other question to this is the biggest question I got for her that makes me I'm not going to say not want to believe something happened to her but it makes me question her\nJudge Kavanaugh if have been a judge for twelve years the second ...\nMakes me question her judge Kavanaugh if have been a judge\nFor twelve years the second highest land the second though he voted just for the ... right next to being Supreme Court judge district court of appeals or he never she never said anything not two thousand six when you are to even said anything to anybody you didn't like he just came up he picked the name of now you can be Supreme Court judge\nShe never said anything\nHe'd been ruined on cases all kinds of cases mhm for twelve years she never said anything\nNow it does make me put my breaking make me pause for a minute to say ... why now\nDo do that of course I Do have about Dr force only about things that I'm just you know ride with her no I'm being fair about the situation about the process I think something happened to her I think we have to be careful what are we going to call her a lie or a doctor lawyer and all this other stuff because again\nI'm not a non profit but um as it is the most you know I'm I think anybody that's pretty much coming out of this life style military life\nAnd it's been around for so long um\nThere's always a ingrained pay it forward um and so I've had a lot of my collections attached to military charities or you know to give back room and you're a big believer in that I I I Know of what you've done and mentoring and the camps and um I think um I I give you you know great praised for doing that because I think\nYou know um those are important things and I think it's important to stand on the on the shoulders of giants and give back I'm I'm Still you know uh the beginning of my studio pretty much um I had a little bit of an interruption and twenty fifth team with the studio um twenty sixteen I was diagnosed with stage three\nBreast cancer and I I'm I'm getting my treatment last uh last\nYear um so I'm a I'm you know um and follow ups as far as to just make sure I'm OK so far I've got well on the move\nRight so it is a blessing praise the lord and so I'm I Am I'm now going back um and in full swing tried to get the studio and what are the things that I have is um I have to collections right now and those you know I Would love to\nFirst of all share with your audience that um if you do have a military family member that is serving and if you have 'em or have served if you're a veteran or um\nWhat I ... when I created the lines that you'll see on my website which is home front girl dot com ... all one word um and you can find me on Facebook and I think we just became friends joke\nOver but uh [laughter] [noise] my honor look for in a good one [laughter]\nThat's right I just was like [laughter] but uh I uh I there's a lot of different products there but um that you know it's if you're looking for something that you want to express um or get especially as you as a holidays are coming close and um I created some what\nDidn't exist when I was coming up through the ranks and what I wanted to see an inspirational way I'm to reflect the lifestyle that\nOur families live and our children and and do it in a in a way that it's available\nI'm In retail um so I I did that with\nHim Frank Pearl and when you go on the website you'll see we're currently I Do have um a story with the home front row teddy bear collection and that's available on the site and back in November of last year um\nI got involved with the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade through camp Broadway when I learned that\nWe had about a hundred and twenty five children that were going\nUm they were had been offered the opportunity to perform at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade ... representing their love of service and their families and everything else and he has a you know military families there's always a welcome how the ticker tape or all proud of building you know it's it's a wonderful service that were grateful\nYou know military children in military wise just boggles you know they don't get a parade um you know we they are the silent wars at home you know keeping the home front together um and so when I learned about this and that I learned that there was a issues with possibly getting the kids there because the financial aid\nI got I got in contact with whoever I Need you know I just found someone you know and I said look I use the look me up I'm not a ...\nFinancial aid I got I got in contact with whoever I Need you know I just felt somewhat you know and I said look I used to look me up I'm not a ...\nI'm I'm not you know but I I'd like to help ... help I'll use\nMy network I'll help you know social media to get the word out and I'm sure that we can get sponsors to get our kids all to New York and not say no you can't have a race wrong and no you know because I had the opportunity to read some of their\nTheir letters about why they wanted to be in New York and and it was quite moving and long story short um\nTwenty thousand was race through a a lot of effort and I I ... and I was grateful for the health of\nMilitary families that I Know in France came through but also through the alliance which was the ... the arm of financial aid arm of camp Broadway which was putting on the ... ah the performance and a lot of other good American you know good people went out of their way and and\nAnd donated and bottom line we got our kids to New York and I was invited to attend and our children\nPerformed on Harold square and the gold star kid\nA kid there we had veterans disabled wounded warrior veterans kids all of them and it was a it was quite a few a joy to spend\nThanksgiving a day of things\nYou know giving thing um and to spend it with those that have given so much and sacrificed so much\nUm and uh my son was with me so he was an army brat and so I just did a hundred and\nThirty of these bears and he helped pass them out to the children and on my website you'll see you have a very large photo of me I Know I was wearing like a like a black turtleneck so I'm like the little black dot in the center and everyone else is wearing were read for\nThe outfits that they wore representing whatever their parents service was ... kind of a funny little things need to see me I'm In the center but uh\nThey're all folding the teddy bears and so I currently have the teddy bears on that you know they're on sale on the website and every time you buy one I Will donate it forced into operation home front which is a military charity for star rated and it goes back to strengthen military family so I have a comment and committed to doing that\nSo I wanted to get the word out and raise awareness about you know the fact that that collection is there and\nUm you get a wonderful thing\nUm to have for yourself the messages are about our lifestyle but at the same time you're giving something back to a wonderful\n... right now and if you just went through the ... or ... or to some foods you\nWon't be your yeah ... ... to me ... ... ...\nAt home or\nWould you go right now if somebody wanted to drive or do not do that just remember the ... home from a girl dog come\nOf go through this will serve right no it was a beautiful a really beautiful ... ... to go through the ... she got women over ... she got pillows and I ... a year I'd be right now I'm just going for it and I'm probably will\nBecause every offer to revoke your ... were done in his view because we're number is ... ... that's me who just didn't want to be mean would you work\nOn a million or you know I've been oh oh so you know before my own over here and I thought OK bottles Laura ... as the candle wrong there's a teddy ... you know you know do you go we're ... we're we're going to me that's a nice\n[laughter] but I Do agree with it is uh\nIt was clear to me that's a nice women not [laughter] [noise] but\nI Do agree with it is a very beautiful river ... you're going to go to go to home front ... dot com or ... or ...\nAh for the teddy bear operational front and then I said at the candles collection of because they wanted to 'em for a long time is supported United serve eighty ... through just donating something through their option they have a\nA ball every year called the story the ball and real quick because this is a really amazing ah or get a charity a military charity\nI'm it basically what they have been doing for I think it's almost Thirty years but if you go to you know if you're reading ...\nWords you can learn more but I also did a video that on the Web site um that uh which talks about the um every time you buy candles a portion will go back to support you know I just reading\nAnd their mission basically what they do and they've been recognized at the at the Senate a building congressional I mean they've been recognized for the incredible work that they do is they have made it possible so that when our deployed families are are gone you know either in theater in a sand box or wherever they are around the world\nOr on training exercises they make it possible for the military uh men and women to record a storybook and send that back to the family so that the children can you hear their dad or their mom read them a bedtime story around them a story and it helps to bridge\nYou know a year deployment you know when you're far away and you know it has meant a lot um and sometimes it it may not be a supplement it may just be that their\nFamily members recovering at you know maybe San Antonio as a military hospital because they've been injured but it helps they so they made that possible through\nEnormous amount of um satellite locations to make that possible and so I created the collection and I know you know I did to reading very closely I Know the c._e._o. um and I wanted to be able to\nConnect that to something because I felt like a candle collection was a light in the home front always burning and as long as we keep you know for military families the connection because you know there's a lot of stressors um it's you know that what they're doing something very important yeah um as you know\nThe importance of family and bonding and mentoring is also you know the all important right when a when you've got a one parent thing you know it's very it's very difficult so anything that helps you nice that bond is important so the candle with every purchase I Will donate United survey feeding 'em and uh each

[laughter] yeah well okay yeah yeah I mean come on we're we're we're we're the stars of the show [laughter] well I can say this\nWill want to be ... a few laps you alone in a country that our own today just live is that they were not TV there's the ... uh to be able to cover the hearings today so we're very blessed me to do that and then you got you're locking in what we've been telling you guys will be covering this all day long that a judge Kevin old\nUm has been a confirmed he is now and they've done to ceremony he has now been sworn in as a Supreme Court justice ... so he is that guy now so those things are over a broad you just broke the news in the last hour there according to CBS ABC ABC that a professor\nFord will not be pursuing a her allegations any further than what she has done right now\nAll right so that's giving you got up to date uh what what is going on we've been breaking it down or they will your buildings were your thoughts got a couple of course you want to put out to the country to the ... by one and three three the first question I Want to put out to the uh to America's this right here do you guys think because of what then happened over the last couple of weeks\nThat oh November six that women\nOn either side\nGoing to show up and she well either for\nThat oh November of six that women\nOn either side is going to show up and show out either for because they are outraged of how they think that the full with a liar\nOr the other side what Democrats think that she was telling the truth ... do you think at the end of the day that this is going to ... motivate women to get out and vote Brian uh I\nI Do um I think that is just on precedent looking at the two thousand Seventeen Alabama special election and the allegations came out Roy Moore\nThose allegations invigorated or the female vote on the Democratic side and also had a um a almost a resistance I'm On a lot of Republicans that did not want to cast a vote for Roy Moore mhm on the flip side though I Do\nI mean there's just a lot of rumblings on us through you know just looking at conservatives news outlets and he was talking to my friends who lean conservatively\nOr they're outraged completely and totally outraged\nBy this whole process they feel that he has been railroaded mom that he has been done wrong where unseen just the opposite on the other side where a lot of my liberal friends you know they're just as outraged that he's getting off another another\nSexual saucers getting off a or a privilege white man is getting off so you're getting on a boat and I think that is invigorating both basis\nI yeah I don't I don't foresee a blue wave of right now there's a lot of people that are saying that the Republican Party might pick up six Senate seats and that houses now ...\nWhat we're going to see you know I it's hard to tell when you're\nTalking about local elections national elections ... you're talking about local elections um I still think the American people don't realize how important they are looking elections are in a different when there's about around the country um but what I'm looking at right now Robert I'm going to come to a six weeks off I Won a three three\nI think there's going to be um definitely conversations I think the media is going to pick up on this especially MSNBC and CNN I think they're going to be running stories now not just about during the Trump but what does it mean to women I mean they're going to put it on a ... of America\nAnd I think every Democrat is going to run on the horse and use of Americans say you see what the process was done you see this was a shame\nYou see that they didn't go um um they didn't go investigate all the other people that I'm Dr phil wanted them to investigate they only had a list of people they were trying to control it so the narrative is already being put out it was already being put out\nLet me put out even more now\nAnd you're going to have the uh the Republicans coming out and they're going to say you know justice was done you know at the end of the Democrats paint a picture mhm for America right with no facts\nAnd so again for me in the middle of this watching as an American citizen\nForget both parties okay for me forget for the boys what worries me and I've been saying that for the last couple of weeks as I've been covering a story from TV or radio what worries me is when this truly does happen and the woman is by herself mhm and she decides to come out\nHow do we believe them because I think with the twenty four hour media what I look and see is\nDepending on who it is they're going to spend the doorway of a way they can not said his role in us and is right but when it really really really happens okay when it happens to a female or a man and they're by themselves and they decided it triggers\nThey really happens okay when it happens to a female or a man\nAnd they're by themselves and they decided to it triggers one year later ten years later did this they decided to tell their story are we going to connect this to he's a CEO mhm oh he's a politician oh he'd give it to go through a position and it really happened that's my worry\nBut you shouldn't just tribally jump\nInto this boat of believe all women just to believe all women because somebody's coming forward with the story not all stories are accurate not all accusations are accurate I have been a part of a situation where I was trying to do the right thing ... and uh me and my best friend\nOr a girl that worked for me in a missed a couple of days\nGot a phone call from her friends saying that she was raped and\nShe comes back to work\nHer parents worked of about a block and a half away from you know we're we're our business was mhm and me and my friend but we we talked about it and we wanted to ensure\nBut there's a lot of people on both sides I think a lot more on the other one that you have to be able to a lot of yourself to go along with what they believe you know the idea is just will not withstand any kind of intellectual integrity or honesty\nBut our our bodies question okay and I'm a ... to Yuma for him\nDo you think a person I'm a ... magnitude where she lived her life ... being her what ... what is going to be a with a family and teeth is going to subject to her family to do for whatever\nOkay she goes to show she's already Murphy for the left okay the fact that she failed as a disappointment but you know whether they think she told the truth or not he still made a Supreme effort and it took one for the team as far as their concerns\nRun out democratic moment yeah now and I'm an I'm Sorry but there ain't no conservatives out there in Palo Alto where she's teaching psychology OK okay there's precious few and universities in Alabama anymore\nOkay All right I mean you know it's just I'm Sorry but\nSomebody pointed out that they control the schools and and unfortunately for the most part they do all you know what they won't allow is any kind of a thought diversity of you better be in lockstep with the way they think or you're in trouble\nAll the money from that goes on me accounts mhm\nOkay now next savings are best coaching football oh two ways about it right right okay\nWhere's he get his months he gets paid by the University of Alabama right but then there's ... money there's yellow wood money there's ... towards the camera\nEndorsement okay okay so the book deals the Gulf funding money this is golden slight can yell all that money if they're passing\nOut the people you know with bags of money passing out cash to protesters get elected it to be or get arrested at the beginning of this thing ...\nI got to think that she's taking care of\nLimit on his luck we would never know this but I Would like to see who donated to go I Want to be looked\nDown on to get on you just kind of used to go to the site because this is what I Want to research because\nYou would the ordinary American people go to a million dollar everybody's story short of organizations donated to her right that's a different story you got individual individual data will be part of a you know the Democratic party or you know some kind of a I'm a pack that ...\nI Can't remember the lady's name that got on the elevator with a Jeff Flake uh-huh what you saw the interviewer she just fought admitted that she was with the Soros organization\nWhat we know sourcing people to disrupt on politics all the time you know death that's ...\nBut he's the longer he using the platform okay that's the platform of using the cameras do his thing I'm ... I'm I Want to connect doctor for the money the book deal knowing this he was going to do the plane I can say is a possibility I'm not saying that it's not but when we live in these will affect some apartments in ...\nHoney the book deal knowing this he was going to do the plane I can say is a possibility\nI'm not saying that it's not but when we live in these will affect some apartments in the coffin we're always talking about this is what the record see ... no one is showing me around right now\nEverybody's going to have ... how are you going to respect on aid to\nRead on Monica my clients so far how much is what how much have y'all read on Monica McLean\nI have another who that any I don't know who Monica McLean is\nOh my goodness okay so you're going to monitor McLean is pretty sense okay she is the person that Dr Ford was probably with one of the letter was crafted\nShe is the person uh when we talk about a legal in Kaiser was pressured any change in her testimony right she wants to pressure on that she has a ... she's actually FBI okay off\nOr he told me late who are told her how to beat the they say they thought they had to be the uh the existence of\nThe ones that wasn't a whole other member ... protests right he wants to work for the FBI got to go okay now she is linked to\nThe ... I think I ... I don't know how to say the name right I Apologize I've read it several times ... ... for ... for some reason is how to pronounce it shifts connected to a call last many ...\nThese are the people that were in charge mhm not their investigators they were in charge of the Clinton email trials and found that there was nothing wrong there mhm\nI I mean you know telling us there's a lot of the state just doesn't wash at this point in time you know it's it's not just the same ilk just kind of the same people that we got the uh email ...\nI mean but but cook was saying right now and and I and I hate to push back on because I you know I Love you man but they were saying basically the same thing that when President Clinton was running for president\nAnd all these people came out the woodwork conspiracy theory right I mean everybody everybody that came out the came and ran with President Donald Trump they had a record they did is they did they do connected as they were connected to that\nI mean again we can say these things and you can find people linked to sort of thing but like I said for me\nI Do believe I Do I'm happy that just kind of got confirmed heard me say that many times\nOkay I'll tell you what did this for me jokes okay\nGo by a six ... six cork board okay alright get you a bunch of them pans ... and when you start reading these articles take pictures of these people and write their name on the picture mhm stick them on the cork board start running strings but quite on the\nRight button look I'm with you you can do that but I can do that with President Donald Trump and his connections to with the Russians and all that and stuff all the people who were connected will that they did with the Russians I could do that President Obama can do to President Bush Clinton\nI can do that with everybody would you ask me and I can do that with everybody\nDonald Trump's on business deals wherever Donald Trump figured Donald Trump with like money but\nHe but here's the thing ... we're making excuses you know what I'm saying\nShe can say that doesn't seek see can say that didn't happen when you say that these people came in afterwards Mm okay because the deep state wanted to come in they sought a platform they came in after this and they wanted to start working with her and they and she didn't know nothing about them before they had a I mean there's so many different ways we can go with that so connecting the dots\nIs not really connected to the doctor because like I say everybody on the national said like the president don't jump and food and everybody you can connect Dr something connected I go to Ron you ran for senator I did right there if something happened right now I'm doing is here in ... and some of the ... they couldn't make me do you mean something bad\nYou ran facility I did right there if something happened right now I'm doing it here in ... and some of the ... big connect me to you know something by as they should or they couldn't let me the clock and it was out of the gossip about midnight to connect me to clock to\nVenice you [laughter] well we we don't ... scrupulous character on your time clock I got you\nKnow really off the top for my shovels has been first and foremost and the news and all that they all they did I Know what it's not first and foremost in the news I Will be very surprised if you do not see a lot of stuff come forward on people's names I just mentioned\nI I Want to see it in ... like I say I would go on the on my radio show and I will apologize that I was wrong because now I Know\nI I think you know I'll go off on a rabbit holes when I see somebody's name or something in an article right so I I just like I'm I'm probably forty eight hours ahead of the first\nI got ... minutes I have a good one\nYou know [noise] I hear what everybody's saying Brian then yeah I mean I'm listening but again\nThis is coming from your play book yeah right but what you always on me about that now that right now it's in black and white and there's nothing you know black and white everybody is saying but at the end of the day is not in black and white and I'm surprised how are you I'm really you my boy bottom of it because because I don't I don't\nWant him to leave her because there's nothing in black and white ... you go into speculation\nOh it's fun to speculate but brought up but I'm saying like ... ... and I'm just throwing hypotheticals out there I'm not saying I'm One hundred percent behind all this but I'm saying what if you know let's look at the situation and how the situation has on food yeah it's not in black and white but it does make you go huh All right that makes me scratching my head a little bit but brown me\nAnd you have about a minute times on this show yeah right and ... it will be our reporters who don't pay for it and pay for it can't be with you it was written down and he can't be refuted from these certain organizations right we're in the high is being in LA and when it comes to the government yeah All right we got the media covering this yeah right\nAnd they love all the right has not come up with anything that anybody saying though right now in what now the media in anything that she was like the the lie that did not happen there's nothing out there in the media on either side from the left or the right there saying for a fact that she lived there for a fact that this was did not ...\nI'm ... I'm Sorry I I've I've seen some Fox\nNews reports that have gone detailed into what she said and has broken or department of also spoken\nThey'll park ... proved that she's lying that something did not happen ... ... yeah no I no body nobody\nBut her in God and who ever did do something to her can refute that\nThat's what I'm saying now ... was it just Kevin ... like I said we would never know I don't think so I don't think so but then something happened to this one because there are people you've heard on this show on my TV show people to vote in\nOkay well Obama wasn't born into not think sixty one Kenya East Africa was established until Nineteen sixty three because I Googled that to\nThe length of time travel are right now with the\nBorn in a place that didn't exist and when he was running for president I live in Alabama he used to be three separate and birth certificates Alabama and there were all different\nOkay I got ya um let me ask you this bowl about women okay I understand you do not believe Doug before let me ask you do okay let me get okay ... I got you but when I ask you this for women that this actually happens too\nAnd there's nobody around and they decided to come out two years of fifty years later\nWhat do she needs to do for people like yourself and other people to believe or did it really actually happen\nEvidence should have been more credible we should have been able to Google the grocery store and find out what the bill when she's climbing she went in there are confronted\nThat guy ... let me get a measure the course of the house that looked like the one she climates Brett Kavanaugh was in ... you know what makes it in France had dropped pictures of her all over the Internet looking like a well it's not Harlem Paul well American\n... American sports [noise] he's the grocery store was there and see what's in the true but it would just say would you believe\nUm I I Would I Would think that if I had not been able to the book so much of her story about the fly and the putting in\nYou still would you believe um I I Would I Would think that if I had not been able to ... so much of her story about the fly and the putting in the second door and the and the grocery store and then and the fact that none of her a\nPapal Hawaii the right to her story ... got you know there wasn't enough\nAnd the fact that she was telling the truth is they get something to back up she would tell the truth a lot with the Phillies\nGotcha so at no point in time uh when it came out did you believe or at all\nUm I well I Do believe or disbelieve till I did the research\nOn that information that's fair and then the more I found I kept saying she's lined\nUp there but I Love you think thanks for the inside there will ever have good even the Iraq um I mean the reason why I was kind of drilling polar bears me goes\nBelow lady you don't find that often where women are going to come out against each other on something like this but this has divided the country I'm In for women to me I think that especially because of the the\nTiming of it all knew it looks like a political hit job based upon when the information came out how the information came out and then all the dock story interests you know we have gone through um [noise]\nWith the process in there I think that's why a lot of people are looking 'cause I think everybody was kind of been dissipating kind of waiting for that October surprise for this process and then when it hit everybody you know you have all the\nDemocrats going oh ha but then all the Republicans right in front of ... [laughter]\nRight but you know into different no trains of thought well you know a radio talk show anchor news I could see roses joined us and I want to ask your opinion or\nI'm Sylvia you know fear what we've seen in last week's seeing how you know this has divided the country among women why women and black women I thought I Would never see something like this on a subject like this\nUm is about even in politics or what is your observation as a a woman in this time it was time to do to maintain what are you feeling right now about this\nThe way a lot of people are responding to these uh\nIt kinda makes a valid points for both sides of the argument on one hand you have people that can come forward and say like this is why so many people are reluctant to come forward when they are victims of some type of sexual assault was as you have so many people coming forward you know saying that she is telling the truth\nThen I'm On the other end of the argument like a a college said you know there are a lot of inconsistencies in the story\nSo it gives people a reason to say you know she's not telling the truth you know when we go here and find out that the reason they she gave for you know whatever she was actually different mhm so you know I guess it was kind of like you know when you were younger you there is always tell you it's hard to believe me if\nYou lie like if you lie about this and you lie about something else and continue to cover it up over and over again ... so just what's the what's in the face that we're in\nNow I'm just what the hell me too movement\nAnd everything is really hard and you know find an argument and stand firmly on it\nLet me ask you a question from and give it to the phone make six six four\nOr five one none ah three three supervisors do you believe that before\n\nSomething hard to answer as in rats\n\nYes something hard to answer as in wrestling with it myself\nUm\nI Want to release some way and you're watching someone of sexual assault mhm and the reason I say they didn't have that is such a hey the allegation anything because so many issues for um the uh the snake but\nYes I can call in before it isn't a lot of things they seen then saying they weren't sure so\nNew and ... do you believe it or\nNot I don't\n... about five one no nothing to do is get up to the phone line Dave you're lucky and to love to bake\nA brother a Gray Davis going\nPretty good I I'm quite frankly there's there is an undercurrent of\nOf a situation in the Senate and the Congress actually uh if you if you Google\nOh God be well these are a journalist or YouTube all he does an interview with George well these are a government analyst he's got a lot of information about what's going on since two thousand and two ... two thousand and one\nOf the Senate a committee on the military standing and I'm also the foreign\nRelations Committee Utah there's about there's there's about\nNinety percent of the Senate to solve the pay or is the most of those programs and they it was a toss up because I was I've said it wouldn't be going on I was setting aside wouldn't\nVoting in really a young man and of course I voted for Trump bomb I'm looking for and conservative means to conserve the constitution the way it's written right\nOff and I don't believe it's a a living document and all that garbage as a way it's written\n... uh but I'm a\n... it's well worth loses an hour and forty five minutes of a sad commentary on that YouTube program John the Web and these guys are George ... know John B a wells program and I'm spiraling down the rabbit hole was is the title of it is or what happens is Seth Rich\nYou got to and it's very interesting uh and uh it it put it connects a lot of dodge of what's going on but these people were not going to vote him it was a toss up because\nIt's a it's a it when they voted manager so sealed the deal that the um uh if they didn't do the man it was going to anger the Republican so fast\nThat was going to come out and drove a in the November election in that first but I think they're going to come out in droves anyway mostly yeah we'll see\nWe'll see I mean God Bless America this is the end of the size of a sudden I it's not that I don't\nThink they um yeah it's gone to the Bible too I Love you may have ... presents or have them\nAll right so um you know I always love when people bring up a birther and a center it's into the conversation it just\nI mean people here's the thing I Love all our lives and I do agree I agree with you know my point of view or my asking them questions um but when we look at the whole situation like I say I'm radio talk show ... my job is to\nSee what I see posed a question to give my opinion I gave his most affected that I Know and then I'm going to act logical question I Am an independent conservative I most of all Republican but at the end of the day\nI still things have to make sense to me right now with this situation that we're talking about and I hear\nMost of all Republican but at the end of the day I still things have to make sense to me right you know with this situation that we're talking about and I hear all the rumblings but what's most surprising\nAnd I have to say this I did not think radio talk show hosts news anchors to be Rogers would say the answer she said before we went to the caller well that's the profit Joe ... a lot\nA lot of this process has been talked about with her taking the lie detector test you\nAnd she was in her sworn testimony she said it took all day she was only asked two questions she was asked is everything that you have written in this\nTo be true and she\nSaid yes and passed a lie detector test that was one of the questions makes should we tell the full story she acts to question but before you get to those two questions they have to prep for you to make sure she was not ... she had to be she ... she\nWas there is no way she did not go through the the typical process so when the lead to them because they have to figure out what what did you learn and they don't they did not give her baseline I'm about questions in order to to avoid outlets to me that if they'll doesn't hold

we're we're talking and I'm not Facebook Live streaming the whole show\nIt's just uh I Do I I ... a lot for this even though sometimes I Know I appear scatter brained purple up for this and so when I Know something that I really want to talk about I Will always bringing in right now and I will try to live stream that\nAnd that really touched me yesterday like me and Glenn ended up having probably a thirty minute conversation about that right at thirty minute conversation and I was telling him don't be discouraged\nYou spent all your life in service can you be more Christ like than spending all your license service\nThat that that's what Jesus did right he came and he served others and he served others without complaint and without worrying about himself he came and it's been a short time on earth are saying I'm going to do this\nThis is the man that is the savior of the universe\nThe person who is more powerful than any change or any dictator anybody ever will be\nAnd what did he do he came in he washed the feet of those around them right he preached to\nThe people that nobody thought should be preached to\nHe went against is fair to say cool idea that religion was up on a pedestal and religious people are better than other people in state and talked to the gentile who the Jews were not supposed to preach do they weren't supposed to receive the word of God he preached that entitles\nHe preached the lepers\nHe went into the places where nobody would go he talked to the people that nobody would talk to I Can't remember the specific story I Can't remember the these specific name but I remember the story of Jesus going across I Believe it was an ocean right and the other side of the ocean\nAnd please somebody I Know I got biblical scholar Henry on line ones who will correct me if I'm wrong but and that's no joke interviews very intelligent when it comes to the Bible but Jesus went across the water right and there was this man\nWho had been who had a demon inside of them I don't remember what specifically what specific store this is I'll find it during the next break it Henry doesn't know\nBut there was this man that was believed to be a demon inside of them\nAnd nobody talked to everybody said that guy's crazy we we're not going in there we're not doing that he lived amongst the tombs right our modern day version would be he lives in\nAnd nobody talked to and everybody said that guy's crazy we we're not going in there we're not doing that he lived amongst the tombs right our modern day version would be he lives in a graveyard\nExcept he didn't live in a graveyard he lived in the way tombs used to be set up er tombs used to be in this cave like structure right you've seen them you've seen pictures of them even if you haven't gone to a place where they had a structure like this you've seen the idea that you used to walk into this thing and it was covered place and they were just bodies on top of bodies on top of bodies\nThat were in these little things it's it's a similar concept of what we have a big cities where the there's these big buildings and they\nSimply pull out a drawer and once you're dead you get plopped in the drawer enclosed like that just as a side note I never want that to happen I don't want to be in a drawer my whole life that I don't want to but that's a side note Jesus went and he talked to the guy living down there every once and it was crazy that nobody wanted to talk to\nCan you imagine that\n... and look at the lessons that taught us look at what we do we go and we talked to the people who are the most hurting or the most broke or the most afflicted in our society\nWe have a whole groups of Christianity that are dedicated to going to prison and talking to violent felons not just people that you know the stole or ah or had drugs or something like that was talking to people who committed murders of three or four people\nMurder five people six people some people you have people that dedicate their whole lives to going into the jail it's following that teaching ... he went into a place where this guy was afflicted by demons and she walked in he looked at the guy and he essentially said this is obviously a paraphrase he's a demon get out\nDemon leave him\nAnd if I remember correctly the demon went into a group of pigs that were nearby and then the pigs ran jumped off the cliff\n\nJesus want is wanting to drive that thing out of you write Jesus cause you to help drive that thing out of others\nThat makes you want to do the things that aren't productive for you right he wants to come and he wants to teach he wants you to teach and\nI think successes defined by following his teaching and then going out and sharing those teachings in changing the community in that way and driving the demons out that way it doesn't have to be a literal demon can be a metaphorical name and\nWhat are the demons you're facing\nWhat are the demons your parents are facing what are the demons your kids are facing what are the demons your brother is facing what are the demons that anybody in your family is facing\nAnd how do you drive them out right\nIsn't that what successes have you known that somebody's been struggling with something and you just said look I got a lot\nGoing on I'm just going to stay over here I'm going to work on this worldly success you can't take the money with you\nCan't take the stuff with you\nCan't take a Lamborghini whether it'd be really cool if you could jumping that Lamborghini and drive all the way to heaven but guess what you can't\n\nIt'd be really cool if you could take that private plane and fly it all the way to heaven but guess what you can't and guess what it also doesn't does that that plane that car that house you can't sell them and then turn that money in to get to heaven quicker to get to have it on a more extradited route to get to heaven maybe when you don't deserve it\nThe only way you get to heaven is they're following Jesus Christ\nExpedite around to get to having maybe when you don't deserve it the only way you get to heaven is they're following Jesus Christ\nAnd when you follow Jesus Christ and when you believe in what the Bible says you followed these works right true faith produces actions a tree that is alive bears fruit\nTree that is alive and healthy doesn't bear nothing right the tree that is alive and healthy bears fruit and that fruit is not only the fruit is the spirit but it's the first success because when you're following Christ and you're following what he says to do\n\nYour being successful by the very definition that David gave Solomon again it first came to three do with the lawyer God commands and followed his teachings obey everything written in the law of Moses then you will be a success no matter what you do or where you go\nNo matter if you're the top of the mountain\nOr in the cave where the bodies are with a guy that's crazy or considered crazy by this world the person the steam inflicted\n\nNo matter where you go or what you'll do he'll be successful if you follow God I think that's a really really powerful message we're going to get your calls when we come back\nLake and came up to him and and I told the legion to leave it there was a legion of a varmint of la\n... what we call them are are the new your spirits are they are falling angels mhm and there were seven thousand of those and in him alone ... he called himself a legion legion averages about\nThe reason why I say seven thousand is because there's only one group other than saying that is Satan is by name will perish burn from within his ... twenty eight ... you can read and how he his demise goes but now in the fall in angels or seven thousand\nAnd they immediately once crush the hit now all of seven thousand men fall into the streets of Jerusalem mhm\nThat's the seven thousand that will come where say in and they will of course they don't mix with the uh\n... what did you play the iron in the ... the the do not mix so you know uh they're never going to be friendly to each other they have no license for as they hate us you know dangerous all they want to do is have sex with women and thank goodness there won't be any children born because they won't be here long enough ...\nYou know a lot of people think she was seven years which was short and the short and I want to get to the fact of pleasing God there I'm going to be I don't want to get off on I'll let others that are going to have stuff is not going to tell you too much but once you learn a lot more you can get into stuff like that yeah but what are you every day you should bless God and he will bless you\nThat is one thing you want to do right never never acquire ill gotten gain or else you're not going to go through that needle gate\nThat need okay is that gate that they had it was a smaller door inside of the two main doors and the camel how to crawl through on his knees and everything on that camera all had to be taken off of him so he uh he had to be unloaded so you've got to unload\nAll of your gun games before you even get in the habit well why\nIs your works ... you're right just acts you want your works it works are the only thing is we take was this ... you are judged we are judged by al works were not judge by a phase we're judged by our works\nAnd those works make up our clothes are crispy white linens and I plan on having a little bit more than some are boxers [laughter] hopefully I'll be doing it right\nBut you know on the last\nLady I I Am very as I Am curious I Do have a question uh what do you think about the idea a then that people say uh my faith not my site by um my faith not by works did now\nThat is something that I've heard that's been preaching Christianity often amongst the variety of sex and Christianity um and I was wondering why there seems to be a difference in what they're saying and what you're saying did I misunderstand the ...\nNext time asking where it is Matthew I'm I think it's twenty five ... you kind of made me look it up\nThey're saying and what you're saying don't misunderstand the ...\nNext time and ask them where it is Matthew I'm I think it's twenty five ... you kind of made\nMe look it up I don't have [laughter] I\nThink that ... yeah Christ is the one in ... it's a revelation also okay the only the the people who make it\nOr or or don't have to go through the second day of the spirit mhm that second death is the one what we're talking about the lake of fire yeah a diverse death is those some of us\nAre it's basically like a Christ judgment ... you're judged on one side of the paradise or the other you're in the ... the rich man or you're on there with the poor man that's in the arms of a Abraham\n... but on the other side you know he's the poor man's just burning up over there because you ever get that way when you know you're messed up just burn up all over yourself\nAnd then he runs a drink of that everlasting water and you can't get that and so everybody from Hitler to everybody's over on that wrong side of the Gulf ... a loop sixteen\nYou could read about that that devising a loopy in a medical doctor and he ... he puts uses the word the chasm that's an ear you cannot cross\nA only of course Chrysler did when he went back all the way back to those prisoners ... and that's who I spoke with and some of 'em were were were released at that point you went all the way back to the\nEight a damaged souls and Peter\nThat are ... that he went back in so many of them were then breed but on the laws I Want to I don't want to be brought in and out of time yeah the laws are important\nMost of the food was a very important people\nDon't ... don't listen to these are people that are going to teaching nothing but the traditions of men which may avoid the word of God we have the commandments or the law ... then we have statutes statute statutes and then we have ordinances blood ordinances were nailed to the cross with Christ\nOr everything from circumcision to animal sacrifice anything that draws blood\nNo longer exists Christ has taken back tries said I'd change that one of the war we have the law not one kid all I Want to John John we have the law\nIn statutes of course they can be changed and they have some British takes care of some of those things like that for an eye to throw
