where do we go from here and it's gotten a lot of attention and it was a link to unreal gr politics a lot of other places and has been read now by sixty five Seventy thousand people\nAnd and um as we have time here over the over the course of the program I'm going to I'm going to talk a little bit about\nAbout that posted about some of the things that I that I said there and um and and and we're I think we're at what I think the landscape looks like a in the wake of a judge Kavanaugh's confirmation\nAnd lewd conduct the the abhorrent conduct that we saw from the Democratic\nParty over the last few months and then I think the the implications are significant that I think that this episode is going to be with us for a long time to come I started this post that where do we go from here or by saying this\nBrett Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court tomorrow bringing to a close one of the most appalling episodes in American political history\nThe Democrats shameful treatment of Robert Bork in Nineteen eighty seven has distorted our politics not just the politics of the Supreme Court\nFor the last Thirty years but the slander the Democratic party directed toward Kavanaugh were if anything even more disgraceful\nAnd I think that's I think that's right I paused there for a moment the smears they directed against judge Bork were outrageous a Ted Kennedy of course leading the charge there but many Democrats participating\nBut at least they were they were a geared toward his judicial philosophy which they massively distorted than lied about but they but they did at least purports to relate just thinks he might do as a judge here we have the Democrats are trying to claim that uh Brett Kavanaugh total Boy Scout\nOr was involved in in gang rapes as a high school student believable uh the smears that the the slander as the they directed against uh against judge Kavanaugh\nSo I continued uh but the slander as the Democratic party directed toward Kavanaugh were if anything even more disgraceful we will feel the impact for many years to come\nAnd I laid out various areas in which I think I which I think that's true where I think we will be seeing that in fact we're going to go to a break and when we return we'll have\nMore about the cabinet nomination with John Malcolm\nTimeshare honors maintenance fees will be due sooner than you know it and if you want out of your contract for the next set of fees contact resort released today\nIf one isn't going to get angry about that I'm not quite sure when when one would get angry and I am quite confident that if you had remained calm and robot like that the response would have been\nWell clearly he must have done the things that he was accused out because somebody who was truly innocent would've been a ... to this and we have shown that\nA by you know paid a little angry and responding to those charges so I really think the ... and damned if he did it the fact that twenty four hundred a walk professors\nOr you might as well throw in former Justice John Paul Stevens\nA leap into this when everything else failed horribly surprises me and and you know there may be a perhaps a dozen quote unquote conservative professors among that list but I have not the slightest\nI doubt that if I Am in that list that it will overwhelmingly skewed to the left and that's more comment I think on the state of affairs in the legal academy than it is state of affairs about Brett Kavanaugh's temperament\nYeah I think that's exactly right and I would add that I think the tide turned now Lindsey Graham obviously help too but I think the tide\nTurned in that in that follow up here and when when a cabinet or cabinet came out a blazing you know and and strongly denouncing these I think ridiculous or accusations against him I think he needed to do that to show people he was he was sincere and I and I walk it that's what happened\nI absolutely agree with you I remember I sat and I I was riveted it with my colleagues watching all of this and whatever you want to say about you know Christine Blasey Ford she was emotional during her testimony and came across as a ...\nThis and whatever you want to say about you know Christine Blasey Ford she was emotional during her testimony and came across as a reasonably compelling\nYou know person you may or may not think that she did but Kavanaugh had done something to her but clearly something had happened to this woman at some point in her life to cause her to be this emotional and I think that of Brett Kavanaugh had come out and said OK I'm here now ask me questions and I'll be happy to answer them\nHe would have been in deep trouble I think the fact that he came out exactly as strongly as she did and said\nYou are now trying to destroy a reputation over a lifetime you are also by the way of trying to destroy the judiciary by casting doubt about its credibility in the integrity of people who served as judges\nAnd I'm not going to play along with this I I think that he he very much helped his uh his claws and had he come out and been had a flat aspect or when he would he would have gone down to defeat in terms of you know the his nomination\nWe're talking to Jon Malcolm of the Heritage Foundation John let's look forward a little bit and talk about some of the things that I'm\nI'm the Democrats frankly are trying to do what one one thing that they're doing is they're talking about the authority of the Supreme Court here are being undermined and and they're saying that uh decisions in which judge Kavanaugh participates or maybe don't need to be respected if they're close\nThey're talking about if they take the house which everyone seems to think they will I don't know but that's the reduction or they'll they'll start impeachment proceedings against against judge Kavanaugh what what what do you make of all this [noise]\nWell I have several things to say I think it is terrible that they are in fact trying to tear down\nThe integrity of the court by making Eighteen\nOr that is just another political branch of government the Supreme Court hasn't helped felt in that regard because it involved itself\nIn more and more social issues that frankly under the constitution ought to be left to people but you know ... that is what people are trying to do I I think singling out Brett Kavanaugh I you know I understand that people are are doing that\nBut ... before the presidential election you had with Peter Ginsburg\nComing out and basically saying how awful she thought Donald Trump was and other than a few people grumbling when she actually came around to deciding cases over the last two terms involving administration and called policies nobody was filing recusal motion to get her a to draw away and nobody expressed of the kind of outrage\nTowards her ... her some outrage but not nearly the level of outrage at your hearing each beach west towards Brett Kavanaugh of all after all only challenge the tactics of the senators on the Democratic side of the judiciary\nA committee you know ... ... impeachment is to some degree\nA political process I think that this will shortly let people know that are the stakes are high in terms of who they vote for and whether they vote in the mid term election I think if the Democrats do take control\nOf the house it is possible they might impeach but kept up and be very clear impeachment is just leveling the charges and it only requires a majority in the house of representatives\nAfter he would be impeached then it would move to the Senate just as it did when the house impeach Bill Clinton and then there is a mini trial and it requires a two thirds vote\nThe Senate before somebody is actually thrown out of office and there was no way that would ever happen to Brett Kavanaugh so the Democrats might do this they might even filed charges against them if they take control of the house but there is no way that Brett Kavanaugh would be thrown off the bench\nNo that's right when we look at the at the crazed behavior not just of the Democratic Senate\nUh of the house but there is no way that Brett Kavanaugh will be thrown off the bench\nNo that's right when we look at the at the crazed behavior not just of the Democratic senators but of the the Democrats who showed up as a mob in Washington DC and invaded senators' offices in all the things that they did attack Rand Paul the airport I may go on and on\nBut I asked myself why are they so crane is I mean it's really a kind of strange and I think at least part of the answer has to do with roe versus Wade I I I assume that that that at least part of their thinking is that there with with Kavanaugh's confirmation there now potentially is a ... vote majority on the court\nTo um undo what what many of us continue to regard as one of the worst blunders in Supreme Court history what do you think about that do you think there's a serious chance of of roe v Wade actually being a overturned\nWell a step back I I certainly think that there are many on the left who are crazed and they have been crazed uh ever since his election night when when you know Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton so I think you would get a large amount of this regardless roe versus Wade is certainly a touchstone a lightning rod if you will\nUh for folks are on the left David ... and the demise\nOf roe versus Wade with every Republican nominee to the Supreme Court ah starting with Sandra Day O'Connor in Nineteen eighty one and that Susan Collins pointed out three people who voted to reaffirm\nWrote the opinion that reaffirmed the basics of roe versus Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey we're Sandra Day O'Connor David Souter any at the Kennedy all Republican appointees\nI don't know of course what the what the current court\nOr would do would roe versus Wade a chief justice Roberts tends to proceed very very cautiously only one current Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has outright called for roe versus Wade to be revisited overturned\nMy prediction if I had to if I had to make one is that it's less likely that roe versus Wade will be outright overturned\nThan it will be that more restrictions placed on\nUh the right to have an abortion will be more likely to be upheld that's how cases that tended to come to court over the last few years when Kennedy was there you that states that we have more restrictions or fewer restrictions with respect to abortion rights and the Supreme Court will weigh in on those but in terms of it\nIs full frontal assault on roe versus Wade\nI don't know whether that's going to happen anytime soon and frankly what the chief justice Roberts on the court I have no idea exactly what the outcome would be even if the other quote unquote

Jenny ...\nAnd I I don't know what's going on with that too I have no idea\nWhat were you and you're absolutely right that she has used Jenny and I think I think the the Republican politicians have

it was the Democrats who procured that false false testimony evidence seems to me that the\nThe target here is the is the Democrats we are up against a a heartbreak uh so I'm not going to take any

a dorm party she sent him a message saying do you have a condom\nLiberal Heather let's just pause on this for a second this is an accidental college Southern California\nAnd and they had been on a twenty four hour drinking binge and and this this girl dodges her friends so she can hook up with this guy and they're texting back and forth beforehand and as you said one of the things she Texas okay you have a condom\nAnd he replies yes and she text back good give me two minutes since so you know the inevitable follows and then after the fact she apparently changes her mind for whatever reasons\nAnd now claims that this guy raped her I mean it's just unbelievable\nAnd not only did she said you have a condom and again any guy who's asked if he has a condom is good it was so mad so

she replies you were great and then of course after the fact she says I changed my mind I think I think it was rape\nYeah well you know these are not just isolated anecdotes\nAs I describe in my book there the very first campus rape survey the one that gave rise to this epidemic of of false claims and that is hysterical it's completely counterfactual belief that\nThis epidemic of of false claims and that is hysterical\nIt's completely counterfactual belief that there's this epidemic of sexual assaults on college campuses first survey that was published in Nineteen eighty five at this

behavior that is completely in\nOn think of all if you have actually been raped you art that is the most as I say the most terrifying experience you can come through you feel nothing but repugnant for from this violent criminals you do not go on to voluntarily have sex again and and\nThe the key to this whole whole\nHoax is that the numbers that we have on a ledge campus rape are generated by the researchers themselves the same survey from Nineteen eighty five that was published in this magazine when the researcher asks that girls whom she classified as rape victims\nWhether they had been raped Seventy three percent said they had not so the ... the phony campus rape epidemic\nA conceit depends on\n[noise] violating one of the primary norms of feminism which we're seeing it play now with the cabinet hearing which is you always take the female editor word except if she says she hasn't been raped in which case you know better than she does and you declare that she has [noise]\nYou know whether this this this couple of things going on here what is that the left has just redefined the word rape right I mean they've got an ideologically motivated definition that allows them to vastly expand what any normal person would consider to be uh to to be rape\nAnd then that they combine that with this with this idea they tried to ram down our throats we saw in the cabinet and hearing\nThat any woman who is complaining must be believe you know you you can scrutinize restore you can't ask for their matches up with the known facts you can't cross examined her in question are you you just have to believe and and as you may know whether I spent forty years in the courtroom okay\nAnd and I can I can attest from from forty years of experience that women sometimes why you know

reasons\nAnd and I was this video allergy that somehow women are are you know camp you know are always telling the truth is ridiculous\nWell again let's let's go to remember\nWhere the ... coming from

currently\nAnd it shows a President Trump with fifty one percent approval forty seven percent disapproval which is which is one of the best ratings that he's had\nAnd it shows a President Trump with fifty one percent approval forty seven percent disapproval which is which is one of the best ratings that he's had 'em and and a strong approval Rasmussen causes the approval index the difference between strong approval and strong disapproval\nThere are now just as many voters who strongly approve of Trump is there are who strongly disapprove of him meaning that his approval index is\nRight now at zero not it doesn't sound great if you don't know about the history here but at the same point in in the Obama administration Brock Obama's approval index was minus eleven\nSo Trump's at at this moment is eleven points better\nSo we're seeing people across the country they're responding to something a ... what do you think that um are they responding to the economy or they responded to the the outrageous conduct of the Democrats in relation to the cabinet appointment or is it some of each\nYeah you know I think it's a it's all the above and it's both the things that have been happening but I think the more that you think about what could happen in the future uh it it really is a stark discrepancy between\nThe two futures that are are in front of us are right now that uh that that that left is literally campaigning on the slogan ripped you'll Trump's tax cuts and and what that what that means that you're at the Heritage Foundation with actually calculated what it needs but the average\nA tax payer in America and and with a combination of the tax cuts that that was asked last year and the economic growth projected over over the future the tax cuts are are repealed and the next year or two that could be twenty six twenty seven thousand dollars of\nLast take home pay that that that sort of typical American can expect and that the\nThat that that that should be scary to to most Americans that they all of this prosperity could be a could be reversed with the ah with by simply repealing somebody's big pieces that that that the house and the Senate and president ... have put through\nYou know it's interesting just an hour or so ago the president was about to leave um the White House on a helicopter he's on the White House lawn and he walks past all these all these reporters and they started yelling questions enemy stops to answer their questions\nAnd there's a bunch of questions about the Kavanaugh nomination and and and there were questions about some other things but at one point he talked about Venezuela and he said yeah if the Democrats get their way or you know all these socialist they're popping up now that they want us to be like Venezuela\nAnd I was really glad to hear him say that because you know it's amazing to me that that rather than recognizing the successes that the free market policies of this administration have enjoyed the Democrats just\nBlindly deny those successes and instead one after another they're coming out as socialists\nAnd when you look at what's happened in any socialist country around the world most recently in Venezuela you know you can tell when you're reaching the later stages of socialism because there are no more pets in the country the pet to have all been eaten I mean it's unbelievable to me that the Democrats really want to go there\n[noise] you know the the the record of of socialism or something like eighty six and zero it the way it's been tried more times than it should have been and each and every time it's a it's it's crumbled and and left misery and destruction at wake and so I mean that's the that\nAt a very high level that those are the two the two direction we can we can shoot the promise of the tax cut the promise of of putting more money in people's pockets is it simply allowing Americans to decide how their money is that rather than sending it to the bureaucracy in Washington\nPockets is it simply allowing Americans to decide how their money in that rather than sending it to the bureaucracy in Washington letting it sort of lost around blind people pocket and then\nA part of it getting bad back out elsewhere that adage is not a recipe for a strong and vibrant economy that American than American businesses no how best to spend it and invest their their resources and that's what we're seeing the power of of individual action rather than government action\nAnd we're also seeing success for for the average American or you know under socialism some people always do very very well so Hugo Chavez's daughter left the country reportedly with about four billion dollars in Swiss bank accounts\nAnd his finance minister I think made off with even more than that so I if you're part of the ruling click or you're you're a part of the end the socialist in crowd yeah you could do very very well but uh the rest of the people are trying to catch rats and they can fry him up for dinner and that's that socialism whereas what we're seeing\nCurrently in the ... the minister ration is real progress being made all up and down the economic ladder but especially\nToward the bottom of the economic ladder with with new entrance into the labor force in the labor force actually being able to get a pretty good paying jobs enemies shell thank

any means I've just noticed we're old Republican\nMe and I'm not putting John McCain down by any means I've just noticed the Republican shit finally grown up back oh\nOh that's very interesting ray you know I I don't know if that's right or not it John McCain actually had a endorsed a cabin up a prior to his death than I think if he had not a guide Neal if you if he'd been you know well and present than voting I I think he would have supported a cabin or [noise]\nBut um the problem with McCain of course as he was always this big question mark you know you never knew when he was going to go rogue and and the band that his party eyes that he was bigger than his party\nOr a ... and that and that can be dangerous so so after after running three or four times on a platform of abolishing Obamacare evil or to keep it and and apparently he did that just out of spiked a because of his anger at a at President Trump\nSo he was a loose cannon uh in a lot of ways and I think over over his time in the Senate he became more and more of a loose cannon\nAnd uh I I think I think the the the person with respect to what your theory might have the strongest basis is Lindsey Graham ... was always the junior maverick er he was always ah he was always John McCain's a wing man and and um and uh with McCain are gone\nAnd then maybe we'll find that Lindsey Graham ah won't be so prone to I'm asserting his a contrarian impulse as at precisely the worst moments or thanks for that call re if if if you want to be hurt eight five five forty Laura is the number to call\nYou know I wrote a post on a power line on friday and and it was titled or where do we go from here and it's gotten a lot of attention and it was a link down real clear politics and a lot of other places and has been read now by sixty five Seventy thousand people\nAnd and um as we have time here over the over the course of the program I'm going to I'm going to talk a little bit about\nAbout that post than about some of the things that I that I said there and um and and and where I think we're at what I think the landscape looks like a in the wake of a judge Kavanaugh's confirmation\nAnd lewd conduct the the abhorrent conduct that we saw from the Democratic\nParty over the last few months and and I think the the implications are significant that I think that this episode is going to be with us for a long time to come I started this post that where do we go from here or by saying this\nBrett Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court tomorrow bringing to a close one of the most appalling episodes in American political history\nThe Democrats shameful treatment of Robert Bork in Nineteen eighty seven has distorted our politics not just the politics of the Supreme Court\nFor the last Thirty years but the slander the Democratic party directed toward Kavanaugh were if anything even more disgraceful\nAnd I think that's I think that's right that's a pause there for a moment at the smears they directed against judge Bork were outrageous Ted Kennedy of course leading the charge there but many Democrats participating\nBut at least they were they were a geared toward his judicial philosophy which they massively distorted than lied about but they but they did at least purports to relate to things you might do as a judge here we have the Democrats are trying to claim that Brett Kavanaugh total Boy Scout\nOr was involved in in gang rapes as a high school students believable\nYeah but I Would total Boy Scout or was involved in in gang rapes as a high school student believable uh the smears that they the slander as they they directed against ah against judge Canada\nSo I continued uh but the slander as the Democratic party directed toward Kavanaugh were if anything even more disgraceful we will feel the impact for many years to come\nAnd I laid out various areas in which I think I which I think that's true I think we will be seeing that in fact we're going to go to a break and when we return we'll have\nMore about the cabinet nomination with John Malcolm\nTimeshare honors maintenance fees will be due sooner than you know it and if you want out of your contract for the next set of fees contact resort released today all it takes is one simple call for a free consultation and a free quote pick up the phone and\nIf one isn't going to get angry about that I'm not quite sure when when one would get angry and I am quite confident that if he had remained calm and robot like that the response would have been\nWell clearly he must have done the things that he was accused of because somebody who was truly innocent would've been a ... to this and would have shown that\nA by you know being a little angry in responding to those charges so I really think that would be good and damned if he did it the fact that twenty four hundred a walk professors or you might as well throw in former Justice John Paul Stevens a leap into this when everything else failed\nHorribly surprises me in and you know there may be a perhaps a dozen quote unquote conservative professors among that list but I have not the slightest\nA doubt that if I Am in that list that it will overwhelmingly skewed to the left and that's more comment I think on the state of affairs in the legal academy than it is a state of affairs about Brett Kavanaugh's temperament\nYeah I think that's exactly right and I would add that I think the tide turned no Lindsey Graham obviously help too but I think the tide\nTurned in that in that follow up here and when when a cabin on cabinet came out a blazing you know and and strongly denouncing these I think ridiculous or accusations against him I think he needed to do that\nTo show people he was he was sincere and I and I pocket that that's what happened\nI I absolutely agree with you I remember I sat and I I was riveted it with my colleagues watching all of this and whatever you want to say about you know Christine Blasey Ford she was emotional during her testimony and came across as a reasonably compelling\nYou know person you may or may not think that she did but Kavanaugh had done something to her but clearly something had happened to this woman at some point in her life to cause her to be this emotional and I think that of Brett Kavanaugh had come out and said OK I'm here now ask me questions and I'll be happy to answer them\nHe would have been in deep trouble I think the fact that he came out exactly as strongly as she did and said\nYou are now trying to destroy a a reputation over a lifetime you are also by the way trying to destroy the judiciary by casting doubt about its credibility in the integrity of people who served as judges and I'm not going to play along with this\nI I think that he he very much help his uh his claws and had he come out and being at a flat aspect or you would you would have gone down to defeat in terms of you know the his nomination\nWhich talking to Jon Malcolm the Heritage Foundation John let's look forward a little bit and talk about some of the things that I'm\nI'm the Democrats frankly are trying to do what one one thing that they're doing is they're talking about the authority of the Supreme Court here are being undermined and and they're saying that uh decisions in which judge Kavanaugh participates or maybe don't need to be respected if they're close\nThey're talking about if they take the house which everyone seems to think they will I don't know but that's the prediction ah they'll they'll start impeachment proceedings against against judge Kavanaugh what what what do you make of all this [noise]\nWell I have several things to say I think it is terrible but they are in fact trying to tear down the integrity of the court by making Eighteen or\nThat it's just another political branch of government the Supreme Court hasn't helped felt in that regard because it has involved itself in more and more social issues that frankly under the constitution ought to be left to people but you know ... that is what people are trying to do I I\nAnd more and more social issues frankly under the constitution ought to be left to people but you know ... that is what people are trying to do I I think singling out Brett Kavanaugh I you know I understand that people are are doing that but ... before the presidential election you had with Peter Ginsburg\nComing out and basically saying how awful she thought Donald\nTrump was and other than a few people grumbling when she actually came around to deciding cases over the last two terms involving administration and coke policies nobody was filing recusal motion to get her\nTo draw away and nobody expressed the kind of outrage towards her ... her some outrage but not nearly the level of outrage at your hearing at the beach west\nTowards Brett Kavanaugh who all after all only challenge the tactics of senators on the Democratic side judiciary\nA committee you know it ... impeachment is to some degree\nA political process I think that this will certainly let people know that are the stakes are high in terms of who they bulk or whether they vote in the mid term election I think if the Democrats do take control\nOf the house it is possible they might impeach but kept up and be very clear impeachment is just leveling the charges and it only requires a majority in the house of representatives\nAfter he would be impeached then it would move to the Senate just as it did when the house impeach Bill Clinton and then there is a mini trial and it requires a two thirds vote in the Senate before somebody is actually thrown out of office\nAnd there was no way that would ever happen to Brett Kavanaugh so the Democrats might do this they might even filed charges against them if they take control of the house but there is no way that Brett Kavanaugh would be thrown off the bench\nNo that's right when we look at the at the crazed behavior not just of the Democratic senators but of the the Democrats who showed up at ... is a mob in Washington DC and invaded senators' offices and ... and and all the things that they did attack Rand Paul the airport I may go on and on\nBut I asked myself why are they so crazed I mean it's really strange and I think at least part of the answer has to do with roe versus Wade I I I assume that that that at least part of their thinking is that there was with Kavanaugh's confirmation there now potentially is a ... vote majority on the court\nTo um undo what what many of us continue to regard as one of the worst blunders in Supreme Court history what do you think about that do you think there is a serious chance of of roe v Wade actually being a overturned\nWell a step back I I certainly think that there are many on the left who are crazed and they have been crazed uh ever since his election night when when you know Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton so\nI think you would get a large amount of this regardless roe versus Wade is certainly a touchstone a lightning rod if you will uh for folks are on the left have been predicting the demise\nOf roe versus Wade with every Republican nominee to the Supreme Court ah starting with Sandra Day O'Connor in Nineteen eighty one and that Susan Collins pointed out of three people who voted to reaffirm\nA wrote the opinion that reaffirmed the basics of roe versus Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey we're Sandra Day O'Connor David Souter any at the Kennedy all Republican appointees\nI don't know of course what the what the current court or would do would roe versus Wade a chief justice Roberts tends to proceed very very cautiously only one current Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has outright called for roe versus Wade to be revisited in overturned my prediction if I had\nCautiously only one current Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has outright called roe versus Wade decision overturned\nMy prediction if I had to had to make one is that it's less likely that roe versus Wade will be outright overturned than it will be that more restrictions placed on\nUh the right to have an abortion will be more likely to be upheld that case that tended to come to court over the last few years when Kennedy was there\nYou that states that we have more restrictions or fewer restrictions with respect to abortion rights and the Supreme Court will weigh in on those but in terms of the\nFull frontal assault on roe versus Wade\nI don't know whether that's going to happen anytime soon and frankly with the chief justice Roberts on the court I Know exactly what the outcome would be even at the other quote unquote conservative sweat along with overturning roe\nJohn Malcolm thank you very much for being on the program we're going to go to a break that will come

seventies oh I I Walk away from the law enforcement on white Marion Barry was going to become their off and the world has changed\nHow you did what he didn't want to be enforcing the cocaine laws Marion Barry was that was the mayor right\nIt it was very interesting I Can't talk about on the first time I met Mr Barry [laughter] [noise] but the people who were involved in all these things today are the same people who are involved in stuff from the sixties now shut up\nYou look back at Kent State the Democratic national convention in Nineteen sixty eight Chicago you look at all of the things

don't have any religion except for politics you know that and I think that's one of the things that cause them to think that uh [noise] you know what a whatever they do is ah is righteous so to speak no matter how a decided it's an even criminal it might actually be let's go to John in New York on line to John welcome to the program\nOn the air um I\nI like you to answer a question for me and I know that when you work or why isn't Dianne Feinstein\nA doctor and Maxine Waters I I think they should be arrested and after ... for what they did and I think that it would be in charge them under the RICO Act\nI think it would be hard [laughter] you know I I I think what they did was reprehensible but I don't see a sound basis there for a for criminal prosecution and I think it's a precedent that we as conservatives should be should be slow to set because we will not always be in the majority\nLet's go to Jenny in Indiana on line one Jenny welcome to the program\nHi\nThank you yeah I I agree I think you are absolutely right about carbon on her radical circus ... grew from um however Albert thank conservative back up for it a little bit at once you had something that didn't happen to her and her life and I think your your um but that I think that\nUm we're consider going back off her all that because I can go out like a friend like that\nOn that point that I Am thrilled the Colorado River there and got her hand um and I don't think that what is your phone with that too I have an idea\nWhat were you and you're absolutely right that she has used Jenny and I think I think the the Republican politicians have been very gentle and their treatment of ah Christine for what I think is that it is important to point out how false her story was not because we're interested in in pound away on her\nBut because it was the Democrats who procured that fault false testimony evidence seems to me that the\nThe target here is the is the Democrats we are up against a a heartbreak uh so I'm not going to take any more calls right now we'll take more later in the program after the break we're going to be joined by Heather McDonald who is the author of a a brand new\nBook uh called the diversity delusion which actually fits in quite well with the things we've already been talking about today so we'll run to a break and return with Heather ...\nTo fund starts to move

appearance is by upgrading your old line shades and shutters\nAfter immediately after she sent loving farming text messages you know Paul I want to see you you you I Love you we need to get together for another Paul and the chills sash\nUh this is not the tax of a female who has just gone through the most traumatic terrifying experience anyone can have shorter being murdered\nA this is somebody who you know wants to continue or sluggish involvement with this guy I and and we have other examples of that a girl who uh\nConspired to evade her friends in order to go have sex with this guy that she'd been making out with um during a dorm party she sent him a message saying do you have a condom\nLiberal Heather let's just pause on this for a second this is an accidental college Southern California\nAnd and they had been on a twenty four hour drinking binge and and this this girl dodges her friends so she can hook up with this guy and they're texting back and forth beforehand and as you said\nOne of the things she Texas okay you have a condom and he replies yes and she text back\nGood give me two minutes since so you know the inevitable silos and then after the fact she apparently changes her mind for whatever reasons and now claims that this guy raped her I mean it's just unbelievable\nAnd not only did she said you have a condom and again any guy who's asked\nSusan and now claims that this guy raped her I mean it's just unbelievable\nAnd not only did she said you have a condom and again any guy who's asked if he has a condom is good it was Sylvia too willing partner right before she left her dorm room to go down to her trips with this con demise guy uh she sent a message to her friends saying I'm going to have sex now\nSo any guy that receives these messages is going to perfectly rationally\nAnd accurately assume that he has\nAffirmative consent from his partner and yet occidental college she was under enormous pressure from the Obama administration\nThey want it to rack up as many male scouts as possible in its feminist crusade to basically right males out of out of western civilization uh occidental expelled the guy he's now he sued the school of that case is yet to be heard but\nThe text message trail is is completely a vindicate cement and exonerate sim\nYeah yeah there is another when you talk about um where I'm after the encounter which again long after the fact is we characterized as being as being raped a she checks to the to the boy how we're I'm sure the boy checks to her\nHow do I compare with your boyfriend since she replies your grades [laughter] and and then of course after the fact she says I change my mind I think I think it was rape\nYeah well you know these are not just isolated anecdotes\nAs I describe in my book there the very first campus rape survey the one that gave rise to this epidemic of of false claims and that is hysterical\nCompletely counterfactual belief that there's this epidemic of sexual assaults on college campuses first survey that was published in Nineteen eighty five at this magazine\nA forty three percent of the females homes they rape researcher classified as rape victims went on to have sex again with their alleged assailants now John I submit to you that that is behavior that is completely in on thing couple\nIf you have actually been raped\nYou art that is for the most as I say the most terrifying experience you can come through you feel nothing but repugnant for from this violent criminal you do not go on to voluntarily have sex again and and the the key to this whole whole\nHoax is that the numbers that we have on alleged campus rape are generated by the researchers themselves\nSame survey from Nineteen eighty five that was published in this magazine when the researcher asks the girls who she classified as rape victims\nWhether they had been raped Seventy three percent said they had not so the that the phony campus rape epidemic a conceit depends on\nIt violating one of the primary norms of feminism which we're seeing it play now with the cabinet hearing which is you always take the female at her word except if she says she has been raped in which case you know better than she does and you declare that she has [noise]\nYou know head of this this is a couple of things going on here what is that the left has redefined the word rape right I mean they've got an ideologically motivated definition that allows them to vastly expand what any normal person would consider\nThe ... right I mean they've got an ideologically motivated definition that allows them to vastly expand what any normal person would consider to be uh to to be rape\nAnd then that they combine that with this with this idea they tried to ram down our throats we saw in the cabinet and hearing\nThat any woman who is complaining must be believe you know you you can scrutinize restore you can't ask for their matches up with the known facts you can't cross examined her in question are you you just have to believe and and as you may know Heather I spent forty years in the courtroom okay\nAnd and I can I can attest from from forty years of experience that women sometimes why you know uh\nMost witnesses or don't lie in almost all witnesses would prefer not to lie but but some witnesses do and I would say that women lie in roughly the same proportion as man and for the same reasons\nAnd and I was this year the allergy that somehow women are are you know camp you know are always telling the truth is ridiculous\nWell again let's let's go to remember where the ... coming from it is coming from the campus is and it's part of a much broader assault on\nOn western civilization it is based on the idea that that America\nIn general and college campuses in particular are places of in Denmark racism and sexism that the world is divided into permanent victim classes and oppressor classes and it's a very highly competitive\nWorld the victim world it is that the ruthlessly competitive totem pole that is constantly being rearranged we thought that maybe gays or at the top now trans people are at the top that they\nThey're put position there is is is tenuous there's going to be some new victim group I guarantee you in the next year or two that's going to cut claim top dog victims status\nBut but females you know we started there early on and and they claimed that they are victims of rate of sexism this is preposterous it is it is preposterous particularly on college campuses which are open to everybody where females are encouraged\nFrom from the time a girl is five years old today on where she is the in incessant recipient of messages to six feet you know women in stem girls to code\nAh encourage them it right and left from mainstream foundations from the education establishment it's boys\nCore an afterthought who are barred with that message that they are at the ... they are the perpetrators of massive oppression you know college campuses give seminars and toxic masculinity at some point\nMail to just going to check out entirely because\nWe are now a culture that is is sending nothing but negative messages that them uh and you know why why bother in a world where everything that you've accomplished is is the value but as you say the courtroom\nYou know the reason that we the western tradition developed these truths are finding mechanisms like cross examination\nWas with the understanding that human memory is fallible even if the person in tends to be accurate it's very hard to remember things there's implanted memory syndrome that we know about you know we don't know with this Christine Ford what her therapist\nIt's very hard to remember things implanted memory syndrome that we know about you know we don't know with this Christine Fort what her therapist was doing to her ... therapists these days are very left wing who knows you know\n\nThe thing happened whatsoever\nYeah it's a ... and I think it was probably an eye opener to a lot of people who haven't been following closely the phenomena that you describe another on college campuses\nThey've gotta burst into public view here was the accusations against a judge Kavanaugh a but just as the kind of thing that has been going on as you say at our universities for quite a while\nYeah people have to pay attention if if you've got a child going off to college [noise] you'd be well advised to read my book or just educate yourself and and the rest of us have to realize\nDon't give money to your college anymore unless you've done due diligence and you can be sure that it is not perpetuating this victim ideology\nOr it's not just about the Democratic party although the Democratic party has now been overtaken by campus identity politics that is
