country I look at using his loyalists nationalist I'm somebody that wants to take care of our country because for many many years you know there's better than anybody power leaders have been more worried about the world and they have about the United states and they leave us in a mess\nWhen the president showed is that what national I think any thought about it very hot and it is wrapped up and they've connotations of a sudden this aggressiveness of dominance of one race on one country over another\nIs that the way you view the word nationalist when you hear Trump talking nationalism do you think Trump is as the BBC's Katty Kay saying there and MSNBC Trump is using the quote dog whistle\nOkay oh you racist out their vote for me is that what he's saying [noise]\nTerrific book written um and it was just it just came out recently by your um has an aid called the virtue of nationalism\nAnd his point is that he's\nA conservative Israeli writer and a political ferret Faris\nAnd his point is that nationalism as properly understood this post World war two or twenty first century nationalism is merely stating that country's deserve to have\nA their focus on themselves in order to keep their own national identity and culture intact so Japan is Japan nationalist little gas because Japan has tight immigration but they also believe in the Japanese culture that there's something

judgment on others but for Japan they want to preserve their history their culture their language all those things that they think make Japan special\nAnd I think for Trump and and this applies to other countries as well but for Trump the same thing for him what makes our country wonderful is our freedom our liberty\nAnd includes the free speech freedom to worship right to bear arms all the things that we have guaranteed in our bill of rights our constitution\nBut the left has to grab onto these terms if Obama said the word nationalist and explained it as Trump is they wouldn't have any problem with it but it's Trump Trump represents an existential threat to mushy headed liberalism they know it he beat them\nThey have to take away the rhetorical devices and weapons and issues that Trump has successfully used against the left to expose the laugh they have to remove those topics from his discussion if they can do that they believe they can beat him\nHe is and I let that happen oh the second migrant migrant caravan has entered Mexico according to Fox that's just broke here we go so Trump can't talk about that either can't talk about the assaults on Mexican police I guess either

people only here for economic reasons everybody knows it and the fact that he wants to stop this anchor baby goes right along with it I Wish she'd signed that executive order today\nWell again we're going to get into the birthright citizenship issue another issue that the leftist completely botched and some Republicans have totally botched is well we've been talking about this issue for almost

sanctuary cities even worse and she won't come out and said I directly but she says let the local law enforcement deal with it you know the caravan\nOr the catch and release the let local law enforcement she comes from federal law enforcement and doesn't know the basic provisions of the constitution for federal law enforcement\nAnd what she's really saying there and this is what the Democrats are saying is forget about federal law do not follow the law of the land the rule of law is outdated or we're just going to make it up as we go and that that is a\nDangerous new direction or that are no Americans want to move in that direction and so what we got some huge challenges healthcare you know they want the Bernie Sanders thirty two trillion dollar socialist healthcare pays ... ending Medicare is you know it double tax rates personal and corporate\nThat put you an automatic recession depressions so that that's the direction it it it's just like you said it forward versus backward well\nHere's what I see happening on the left and I would imagine that young people don't like to be told what they can and cannot speak about like issues that they just are not allowed to to address any longer because if you say you want our borders and force then here for a mass shooter\nShoes that they just are not allowed to to address any longer because if you say you want our borders and force then here for a mass shooter [laughter] I mean it's most ridiculous thing I've ever heard but this is what the left\nIs absolutely trying to do they are trying to take your shoes off the table that Trump connects on and one of them that you connected on early on and you were way ahead of the curve on this\nWas the issue of immigration or the sense that we have a sovereign right a God given right to determine who comes in our country and why they come in and set the terms and set the rules and the less the once\nThey want they want is kind of take those issues away and neutralized tromp on the campaign trail and probably neutralize people like you\n[noise] yeah and that won't work immigration you know Seventy to eighty percent issue the Democrats are being told not to mention it right by all the\n... an article in this deal yesterday the Democrats are just sarcastically\nCaving on the issues and just saying that well we don't have we don't have a party platform to run on why starting out there that cynical they know they have not offered a platform on any issues in immigration is I think the issue especially in my district\nSo yeah you're right that the kids were loading up with Twenty one trillion in debt and then catch and release you know these are all children of God coming across the border right like the cat which are good people in there but there are other people that have not been vetted at all or any family that comes in with two kids that's twenty six thousand dollars to go to school for one year\nAnd who's paying that bill rights and you run those basic issues by the\nThe taxpayer and by the kids and say you're paying off is that you know we're putting all of this on your credit card you're going to pay it off\nAnd we don't do a good enough job communicating to the next generation\nOr the problem is they're going to have if you revert to a socialist you know do grow the economy I taught college for Twenty years last the Obama period a high end college graduates couldn't go out by the decent job and now it it's just day and night that the economy is just boom\nAnd the kids are getting multiple job offers wants to know what's really interesting it's just the job ... ... people are leaving their jobs because they're that confident than go get a better job it's been a long time since that's happened and so are the kids are moving up the the wage chain you know\n... ... ... it's just great news and so we ... we got to share that with everybody but there is a group that is just dug in on the resistance right we're offer a result they want to resist like you said right they want to have enlisted best vacations they want to page the president and peach cabin all my opponent won't come down on any of\nThat of course not so what is she in fact I mean you know the question out asking the final final days why why is she hiding\nWhy why is that why is your challenger\nMitt spanberger hiding on these key issues and the the voters in Virginia and deserve to know the truth\nAbout what she really believes about the changing nature of of the state\nThe the economic burdens being laid at the feet of the taxpayers of Virginia but she's answering these glib cliches and bromide to make us every everyone's going to feel good but that's not how the real world works she needs to answer these questions and why she hiding\nI Would keep saying that we're in she why she hiding\nRight right one of the things she hired and came out months ago and of course the mainstream press or let her high risk ... worked

fundamentalists Saudi training school that produce terrorists\nAnd after the fact she says she's still proud that you work there but like you said if you're proud of the fact that you worked at this school that is a school then why didn't you put that on your resume she's hiding everything she tried to her policy platform she's hiding her position on\nHealthcare immigration taxes she won't talk

citizenship\nAnd Trump brings it up and it's uh we'll see where it goes but I think I think it just as a matter of common sense setting aside constitutional\nA language which it does not require a what the left claims that it requires\nA it's it's open to debate so fascinating subject are joining us now mark\nKrikorian also get to your calls eight five five forty Laura I'm Mark Krikorian is going to sell some of this forest Mark I'm\nThe president brings this up high yesterday and\nThe media that their ... response are basically saying oh how dare he how dare he dog whistle dog whistle\nOnce again\nYeah well I mean that's to expect that quite frankly but uh the president is a I mean I think this is a smart move I haven't seen the executive order hasn't been issued yet but what I assume it is is that he is interpreting\nA clause within the fourteenth amendment in such a way as to not automatically give citizenship to kids born to tourists\nFallen students are illegal aliens that phrase or it's complicated to get on the radio but it's called subject to the jurisdiction thereof that phrase is ambiguous Supreme Court has never ruled on it there's never been any legislation saying that's what this means so it's perfectly appropriate in fact long overdue\nFor the president to say this is my interpretation\nWhat's gonna happen if somebody's going to sue\nIt's going to end up before the Supreme Court and then we'll have a ruling one way or the other about whether the kids born to tourists\nUm our or illegal aliens are automatically citizens or not and depending on how they rule then whoever doesn't like it can you know try to do something to advocacy crucial amendment or something but it but the only way to get this process even start it\nIs for the president to do this issue an executive order and what I mean is that the state department won't issue passports for instance to kids born to Chinese burst tourists good women who um and then somebody will sue ACLU will find one of them they'll sue nobody lawsuit that's this is\nUm you know whatever you think about this issue mother was whatever you think the policy should be\nThis is the smart way to ski up the issue so we can move it along\nIn the process of you know public debate because all we're doing now is saying well I think that this senator and Eighteenth sixty eight men X. and somebody says no this other senator and Eighteen sixty eight meant why when the amendment was passed\nThat's pretty sterile that's not getting us anywhere this really is I think moving the ball forward regardless of what you think of the issue I think this is a smart move on the part of the present\nI completely agree we have to get this thing resolved I mean this Long Beach birth motels a Florida birth motels the Chinese the Russians and Mexican south Americans it is becoming a booming business Justin Russia alone\nOr and they get around all the other restrictions on on what we want from Russian uh investment in the United states\nBusiness just in Russia alone or and they get around all the other restrictions on on what we want from Russian uh investment in the United states by suddenly you have a kid has a passport and your golden yeah your gold and\nIt has if a kid has a passport he can go to a for instance UC Berkeley at um lower rates that's one of the reasons they're people from Korea and\nTurkey who do this\nAs a way of helping their kids dodged the draft once they get older because they can just hop on a plane and go to the United states and then they don't have is all it it's a retirement plan for some people because you know you're having a kid at thirty well by the time your kid is an adult and has a job and is working\nIf ah you know you walk he can sponsor you for immigration so that when you're finished working will retire in the United states I mean there are a bunch of different reasons people do this none of which is in the interest of the United states\nUh it's it's fast saying we're going to stay on this issue and a lot more a Mark Krikorian thank you so much for what you do from the center for Immigration Studies will take a break

Jersey just keep that keep the liberal liberal party rule going\nYeah that's their plan certainly I mean anytime you support Bob Menendez for reelection boy that says a lot about where you want to take the country and and what you think of congressional ethics so\nTell us what happened ah yeah I Know you and your family or have been targeted because simply the mere fact that you're a Republican and your solid a fiscal conservative running in the state of New Jersey but you've been subjected to threats yourself\nYeah we did I mean we got we got a letter somebody slashed up our lawn sign stuck in an envelope and then\nUh enclosed it with a a a letter suggesting that ah my seven children would be unlucky if I were to win and ah it was you know disturbing a law enforcement's been fantastic uh they're on the case and making the kids feel really really safe and secure\nAnd my wife and I look at it shows you what do we do about it you know we're going to make sure the kids are safe and then a with a push back which is not going to be intimidated by some creep who drops things in the mail and then a heights so we're going to keep pushing forward and the only way to deal with it just push back in stand up for yourself so that's what we're doing\nThe district in which you're running a the eleventh is a tough district Trump won it by one percent\nOf the media and the left the resistance

despite the fact that consumer confidence optimism small business unemployment all of these numbers are incredible what are you finding out there on the trail and could be a media conclusion about this uh this type of district be wrong\nOh absolutely it's wrong because the leftist jacked up so early and you'd always jacked up the taxpayers are getting screwed in New Jersey for years and they do it and they understand it\nAnd the state has gotten more and more on affordable with every democratic governor frankly the Democratic legislature around here Jack it up taxes every chance they get

again Venezuela is suffering greatly under corrupt leadership collapsing society two million people have fled Venezuela flip playing into other countries that are now themselves you know like at Columbia is is having a huge problem trying to bring in a Venezuelan same language\nOr many of the same traditions but still different people a and different traditions and there's a lot of resentment being built up in Columbia friends of mine there as a teaching profession everything construction same kind of problems stay there\nYou guys have heard me talk about a product for months that has changed my sleeping habits for ever it's called my pillow guys I used to wake up with a sore head I often have one of those critics in my neck you know it's like you can't turn your head when when your neck hurts forget about it\nOpen loopholes in our immigration law and these aliens are well coached and they know that if you say the magic word you're given a ticket in\nWell the fact of the matter is Mexico has confirmed Mexican official speaking to me last week confirmed that there were a Honduran left\nWing politicians one of them was removed from the caravan along with a couple of other associates or who is an opposition leader I was actually working in concert with Venezuelan\nA bullet politicians and getting help and comfort from groups within the United states who also have been aiding uh these masses of people as well so there's a complicated Web of facilitators behind the scenes a who've who've put the word\nWell as well so there's a complicated Web of facilitators behind the scenes a who's who put the word out that it's as long as you get into this group Katie you'll be protected because there's strength and numbers\nBeing a part of a caravan does not give these special rights I'm but our message is simple and our message is clear we will not allow at large group an authorized\nMigrants to enter the U.S an unsafe or unlawful manner we've already seen these groups for say they break immigration laws and Mexico and Guatemala they've employed violent and dangerous tactics have you mentioned\nAgainst both Mexican and Guatemala and immigration security teams the secretary made clear last week that we will ensure that our men and women on the front lines of protect and defend it and the president has done so and calling up\nThe military and ensuring that we have the resources we need to not only secure the border but defend our men and women on the front lines\nHave you I'm prepared already a and homeland security with the\nChance that the president was referencing yesterday that there you're going to now started housing people intense so they will not be released into society at large does as they are being now because they're just simply aren't the facilities to house them\nYou know what we're doing is ensuring that we're prepared for you know these caravan size we're seeing every single day on the border we've seen that in the rapid deployment of the U.S armed forces will have fifty two hundred on the border by the end of this week\nUm we are continuing to ensure that all us laws are enforced and upheld but at the same time right now we're not able to detain illegal aliens throughout the tendency of their immigration hearing right now we're forced to release after twenty days if you're a family unit\nWords out Laura I mean right now we're seeing a six hundred and twenty percent increase and family and apprehensions and the last five years\nWe are a record number of family that apprehensions this year alone what that says if you have a child with you we have to release you into the interior there's also a hundred and ten percent increase in the last two years of male adults coming with children than ever before\nWe're not able to detain them and immediately return with our us immigration laws right now so even if we have the space until Congress acts there's not much we can do and the way of deterrence to immediately apprehend and repatriate which which is border security\nWhere if there were children but if they're individuals without children you could detain them at the border correct\nCorrect and we're actually repatriating about eighty percent of the male adults that we apprehend\nOkay well that's a to produce a percentage well record\nLow of mail um of adults apprehensions this year I think it's like a Nineteen Seventy one is the last time we were this low in terms of adult apprehension\nSo that's the only and you're able to deliver a consequence know migration pattern change when we're able to say that we're going to refer you for prosecution you broke US law we're going to send you to a judge and have a penalty\nYou know illegal aliens they they know they know where you left a lot better than members of Congress do\nAh this was Terry McAuliffe course a good friend of the Clintons former governor of Virginia speaking about the uh the use I

he said the president by referencing the military as he has been doing sending them to the border that that is politicizing the military\n[noise] you know all I can say is this president and create this caravan this caravan you know took off with no control over who started it and when you know in Central America but I Will tell you that there is no way in which a large group of migrants should be able to come into our United States\nAs a large group just because you were in that group is president has every right to ensure that our borders are secure and defended and that's what he's done\nIn the homeland security department people you know think about in a border control and immigration and Customs Enforcement ice is part of homeland security now right I always think it's part of state but it's part of homeland security correct absolutely\nOut so we got the left wants to abolish ice or despite all the great work ice does with human trafficking drug interdiction uh and obviously important work and deporting a dangerous people from the United states um\nBut I think people don't really quite comprehend that this is not a victimless crime illegal immigration their their victims or economic victims\nThere the effect on public schools affecting our health care system how closely is homeland security working with other agencies on the effects in American society of math illegal immigration\nThe secretaries just in Yuma, Arizona last week with both Ron Vitale acting ice director and Kevin ... and had US Customs and border protection to meet with local sheriffs local officials to ensure that they have the resources they need to handle the influx of family units\nThat they see at the border you know we're meeting with these NGOs and these communities to ensure that we aren't just releasing into communities because of the sheer number we're seeing every day at the border I mean but someone has to pick up the tab when we transfer aliens to hospitals\nAnd that is the American taxpayer\nI think people forget that every time you you see the illegal immigrants dropped off at bus depots or even flown around you know the the when the kids are kids are coming unaccompanied they're placed with a quote sponsor sponsors sometimes themselves are illegal immigrants that costs money\nIt doesn't come out of thin air as my mother used to say someone has to pay the tab\nNow we have Thirteen thousand children unaccompanied alien children in a church has custody right now they cost us taxpayers thirty three thousand dollars each annually wow\nJust that just people have to chew over that figure thirty three thousand dollars each illegal immigrant the United states annually to the American taxpayer\nThat's more than it costs for me to go to college\nOh my gosh this was Brock Obama just a few days ago on the uh mid term trail referencing this issue of the caravan and the president's concern about it once was\n[noise]\nSuddenly

Faris\nAnd his point is that nationalism is properly understood this the post World War two or twenty first century nationalism is merely stating that country's deserve to have\nA their focus on themselves in order to keep their own national identity and culture intact so Japan is Japan nationalist will gas because Japan has tight immigration but they also believe in a Japanese culture that there's something unique and beautiful about it\nAnd they're not constantly passing judgment on others but for Japan they want to\nPreserve their history their culture their language all those things\nThat they think make Japan special\nAnd I think for Trump and and the this applies to other countries as well but for Trump the same thing for him what makes our country wonderful is our freedom our liberty\nAn includes the free speech freedom to worship right to bear arms all the things that we have guaranteed in our bill of rights our constitution\nBut the left has to grab onto these terms if Obama said the word nationalist and explained it as Trump is they wouldn't have any problem with it but it's Trump Trump represents an existential threat to mushy headed liberalism they know it he beat them\nThey have to take away the rhetorical devices and weapons and issues that Trump has successfully used against the left to expose the left they have to remove those topics from his discussion if they can do that they believe they can beat him\nHe is and I let that happen all the second\nMigrant migrant caravan has entered Mexico\nAccording to Fox that just broke here we go

federal law enforcement\nAnd what she's really saying there and this is what the Democrats are saying is forget about federal law do not follow the law of the land the rule of law is outdated\nOr we're just going to make it up as we go and that that is a very dangerous new direction or that are no Americans want to move in that direction and so what we got some huge challenges healthcare you know they want the Bernie Sanders thirty two trillion dollar socialist healthcare pays ... ending Medicare is you know it\nDouble tax rates personal and corporate\nThat put you an automatic recession depressions so that that's the direction it it's just like you said it forward versus backward\nWell here's what I see happening on the left and\nI Would imagine that young people don't like to be told what they can and cannot speak about like issues that they just are not allowed to to address any longer because if you say you want our borders and force then you're for a mass shooter [laughter] I mean is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard but this is what the left\nIs absolutely trying to do they are trying to take your shoes off the table that Trump connects on and one of them that you connected on early on and you were way ahead of the curve on this was the issue of immigration or the sense that we have a sovereign right a God given right to determine who comes in our country\nAnd why they come in and set the terms and set the rules and the left so once they want they want is kind of take those issues away and I neutralized tromp on the campaign trail in probably neutralize people like you\n[noise] [noise] yeah and and that won't work immigration you know Seventy to eighty percent issue the Democrats are being told\nNot to mention it right by all the\n...

and Trump brings it up and it's uh we'll see where it goes but I think I could just as a matter of commonsense setting aside constitutional\nA language which it does not require a what the left claims that requires\nA it's it's open to debate it's a fascinating subject\nAre joining us now Mark Krikorian also get to your calls eight five five forty Laura I'm Mark Krikorian is going to sell some of this forest Mark I'm the president brings this up\nHigh yesterday and the media that their ... response are basically saying oh how dare he how dare he dog whistle dog whistle once again\nWell I mean that's to expect and quite frankly but uh the president is I mean I think this is a smart move I haven't seen the executive order hasn't been issued yet but what I assume it is is that he is interpreting\nIt caused within the fourteenth amendment in such a way as to not automatically give citizenship to kids born to tourists or\nFallen students are illegal aliens that phrase or it's complicated to get on the radio but it's called subject to the jurisdiction thereof that phrase is ambiguous Supreme Court has never ruled on it there's never been any legislation saying that's what this means so it's perfectly appropriate in fact long overdue\nFor the president to say this is my interpretation\nWhat's gonna happen if somebody's going to sue it's going to end up before the Supreme Court and\nThen we'll have a ruling one way or the other about whether the kids born\nAnd the soup it's going to end up before the Supreme Court and then we'll have a ruling one way or the other about whether the kids born to tourists\nUm our or illegal aliens are automatically citizens or not and depending on how they rule then whoever doesn't like it can you know try to do something to advocacy ... or something but it but the only way to get this process even start it\nIs for the president to do this issue an executive order and what I mean is that the state department won't issue passports for instance to kids born to Chinese burst tourists good women who um and then somebody will sue ACLU will find one of them they'll sue and then it'll be a lawsuit that this is\nUm you know whatever you think about this Fisher ... whatever you think the policy should be\nThis is the smart way to ski up the issue so we can move it along in the process of\nYou know public debate because all we're doing now they're saying well I think that this senator and Eighteen sixty eight meant acts and somebody says no this other senator in Eighteen sixty eight meant why when the amendment was passed\nThat's pretty sterile that's not getting us anywhere this really is I think moving the ball forward regardless of what you think of the issue I think this is a smart move on the part of the present\nI completely agree we have to get this thing resolved I mean this Long Beach birth motels a Florida birth motels the Chinese the Russians the Mexican south Americans it is becoming a booming business just in Russia alone\nOr and they get around all the other restrictions on on what we want from Russian uh investment in the United states by suddenly you have a kid was a passport and your golden yeah your gold and\nGet as as a kid has a passport he can go to a for instance UC Berkeley at um lower rates that's one of the reasons they're people from Korea\nTurkey who do this\nAs a way of helping their kids dodged the draft once they get older because they can just hop on a plane and go to the United states and then they don't have ... ... it's a retirement plan for some people because you know you're having a kid at thirty well by the time your kid is an adult and has a job and is working\nIf uh you know you want you can sponsor you for immigration so that when you were finished working retire in the United states I mean there are a bunch of different reasons people do this none of which is in the interest of the United states\nNow it's it's fast saying we're going to stay on this issue and a lot more a Mark Krikorian thank you so much for what you do from the center for Immigration Studies will take a break we're going to highlight one of the key

freelancing is retiring\nAnd this is critical the races very tight uh he's been subject to a violent threat his family has uh just the mere fact that he's running for office in New Jersey a and we're delighted to talk to him J uh this is a tight race and your opponent making Cheryl\n... is hoping to keep the corruption machine don't I guess in New Jersey just keep that keep the liberal liberal party rule going\nYeah that's their plan certainly I mean anytime you support Bob and ended up for reelection boy that says a lot about where you want to take the country and and what you think of congressional ethics so\nTell us what happened ah yeah I Know you and your family or have been targeted because simply the mere fact that you're a Republican and your solid a fiscal conservative running in the state of New Jersey but you've been subjected to threats yourself\n[noise] yeah we did I mean we got we got a letter somebody slashed up our lawn signs stuck in an envelope and then\nUh

really really safe\nAnd and uh it was you know disturbing a law enforcement's been fantastic uh they're on the case they're making the kids feel really really safe and secure\nAnd my wife and I look at each other and what are we gonna do about it you know we're going to make sure the kids are safe and then a bit of pushback and we're just not going to be intimidated by some creep who drops things in the mail and then a heights so we're going to keep pushing forward and the only way to deal with it just push back in stand up for yourself so that's what we're doing\nThe district in which you're running a the eleventh is a tough district Trump won it by one percent\nOr the media and the left the resistance are geared up their jacked up to try to run the tables in congressional races and run it against the president despite the strong economy in the fundamentals of this economy are incredibly strong\nAh and despite the fact that consumer confidence optimism small business unemployment all of these numbers are incredible what are you finding out there on the trail and could be a media conclusion about this uh this type of district be wrong\nOh absolutely it's wrong because the leftist jacked up so early and you know who's jacked up the taxpayers begin screwed in New Jersey for years and they do it and they understand it\nAnd the state has gotten more and more on affordable with every democratic governor frankly the Democratic legislature around here jacking up taxes every chance they get so\nUh that's our message or measures let's continue to grow this economy let's cut taxes are the people know that a Democrat from New Jersey is not going to Congress to cut their tax is just not going to happen it doesn't happen in Trenton it's not going to happen in Washington and\nAnd that's the distinction were drawn and people respond to that because it's their felt experience for decades they've watched Democrats\nHike taxes around here and then blame somebody else in

I was driving back into work this morning taking my sweet time so Dylan would be a little afraid so I pull in here and around five o'clock or something like that and Dylan would be like\nUm it's spooky season where you at but nevertheless we uh we stopped I uh and there's this guy that had on a police officer shirt\nAnd a badge um and he was going up to cars and pulling something out of his pocket which kind of scared me because it looked like he was going to reach in the little Jack Benny out on and I'm like Mm that's where somebody reaches for gun but nevertheless the guy\nHe's obviously not a cop um he's very he's got a police officers uniform on but it's very disheveled and it's obvious he doesn't meet police dress code and uh the standards um of dress for a police officer but he pull something out of his pocket that resembles\nI'm identification like a badge and starts waving end up people and tries to get them their old on their window and I'm\nSo is dealing with that this morning and he went up to the Eighteen wheeler next to me while we were sitting at the base of this offer him because this happened on off ramp and was waving at me waving at them and came and was like waving and around me but I didn't I was not going to make eye contact with the guy 'cause once you make eye contact and you know that's when the interaction starts but ah\nBut yeah so probably nothing maybe just the guy asking ... for money or something like that but when somebody's got to police officers uniform on and has a badge and pulling something out of their pocket and waving it people trying to get them to roll the windows down just best to go home with ... especially because I barely even saw the guy\nA guy came down the interstate on her aunt and uh I pulled all the way up to the light and hadn't seen him and he just emerged from the darkness um so it really is spooky season out they're happy Halloween interesting starts in the morning gave him what ... call and they're working on that so Dylan I appreciate it\nYou know on today of all days Halloween bringing us in\nThe intro people will probably scared they're like where's Baylor where's but that doesn't sound like Baylor but you did very good I I had my headphones turned up I can hear you so\nFantastic it was different it was different you like it I don't know yet\nYou just want to switch are on the board they'll show and you can talk for most of the show that would be a train wreck from multiple reasons are are you saying I Can't run the boards that what you're trying to say\nYes and I'm also saying that I Can't talk like you do for two hours they're fair\nWell we've got a lot to talk about today um including a today announcement day\nA left wing do second hour on that [noise]\n\nWe could be talking about the birds the right thing but you guys are one of the first people to hear about the birthright thing because of the fact that\nWe were able to talk about it yesterday after broke so we've kind of covered the birthright scenario if you want to talk about it we can right now I'm Talking to a little bit about mid term elections because we covered the big news of yesterday because it broke while we're on air which is exciting that never happens\nUm so we're talking about the November ... election what's going to be on the ballot who you should vote for in our minds and we'd love to hear who you're going to vote for in your mind eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three ladies and gentlemen this is the wakeup\nCall you're listening to the wake up call [noise]\nCan you sacrifice a day of your life to change someone else's life forever sign up to volunteer with the Cajun maybe certain ... dot com and eat our Q.

need to vote for and the reason we're doing this a little bit earlier this\nYear\nIs because we have an announcement um that we'd like to make and you're going to hear this for the remainder of the day\nAnd that is that uh the programming on this station is are going to be changing actually and so a lot of the political talk radio that you've grown accustomed to is I'm going to be going off the air here um this was a move by a Crawford Broadcasting um we have enjoyed our time that we've been able to spend with you\nUm and uh that's why we've been you know pushing podcast and social media for\nThe last couple of weeks is because we still want to be able to talk to you about the things that matter because we think these political issues and these issues that really impact our state really matter but\nAnd some of you've already know or somebody you already know this I've been getting some tax and some calls and I haven't been able to um kind of answer those questions specifically because of contractual obligations but now we're able to say that a super station one on one as we know it will be going off the air I'm at the end of this week correct on\nYes a regular weekly programming we'll end this us this Friday the flip is actually happening Sunday night mhm I found out in a meeting that we had yesterday you know\nAnd as far as I Know the only program that is staying is lock it on Saturday is yeah\nJust can't get rid of Joe Joe be here and I'll be hanging out with Joe a little bit Joe's asked me to come in and fill in um are are not filling but to come in and sit in some Saturdays with him specifically this Saturday So um\nYou can catch me hanging out here on superstation one on one still but they're going to be going through a rebranding phase and there's going to be different type of content I Believe it's going to be evangelical Christian content that's going to be coming\nThrough the airwaves right or it's going to be very similar to W. extreme see if anyone is familiar with that\nAnd so we uh appreciate the opportunity to bring you political content I'm actually really excited for what we got here on the future for the wake up call and for that or you'd go check me out on Facebook you can type in um Baylor cook on the first name that pops up and it's awesome because we will literally be I'm\nI'm transitioning out of the wake up call and we're going to start doing a long form podcast and which I have discussions I'm with the politicians in the state of Alabama and also thinkers and we're going to try to get some people nationally describe in and do these long form discussions where we really get past the PR line\nThat the PR chair as written you know that they're PR guy's written and instead we get to you know the meat of the situation how they actually feel about issues\nI've actually got two people are lined up I'm working with a political I'm a political advertising company I'm here in town that wants to get their candidates exposure\nWorking with a political I'm a political advertising company I'm here in town that wants to get their candidates exposure and so um the candidates and soon to be as the ... looking elected official so right\nAfter this election season we're hoping to have some of these guys joined us everybody from I'm\nFrom state senators to district or to the district attorney for

L. O. R. C. oh okay I'm the first name that pops up and\nDo you have any questions you can send it to the to my Facebook right now and I'll be able to answer I'm already to questions live on air I Know this is\nKind of a confusing moment for a lot of people um a lot of people are we've got a lot of messages some people have\nSaid is this going to happen a lot of people have hoped is not going to happen we hope is not going to happen but just the nature of the beast the nature of the business sometimes programming changing so I'd appreciate my time here it's super station one on one and I look forward to the doors the guy is going to open so if you got any questions\nSend them to me on Facebook Gore hit us up on eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three\nAgain that's eight six six five five one\nNinety nine thirty three we'll be talking about this and the elections for the remainder of the day but excited to get into the into these election because while I'm Still checking in while these mice are still on\nSt Mark's missionary Baptist church in Florence and he lost a U.S senator Doug Jones in the Democratic primary for Senate special election last year and will face Aynesworth in the general election for lieutenant\nGovernor so what do you think Aynesworth yeah I'm a dangerous it is a lot of these races are going to go Republican I'm always bowl sometimes loud always ... sometimes ... that's probably my favorite political ad I've heard in a long time you want to know why because\nIt's not somebody you as you know nothing to do with the second and like I Love when it's like when it's like I'm running for county school board and I'm going to protect your second\nAmendment really gym really how are you going to protect my Second Amendment being in the county school board or county coroner [laughter] that's Michael's example I Can't use Michael's example but\nMe and James have literally a thirty minute conversations and just doing parodies of different different different uh different like stuff 'cause it's like I'm running for let's see what's another race I'm running for agriculture commission and I'm going to protect your right for ... free speech what I'm going to protect your religious liberties\nThat ... you're ... you're\nIn agriculture how exactly exactly exactly\nHow is that going to happen it's just it's insane but I honestly think Aynesworth would make a fantastic lieutenant governor the\nLieutenant governor's really who gets all the work done behind the scenes for the governor's office if we're being honest about it so here's the thing will ends where it'll probably one that win that race will Boyd has striking popularity and the state of Alabama I Will say that he's a young guy and for a democratic candidate he's got some he's got some force behind him\nSo I don't expect him will avoid to get completely blown out of the water but I still expect Aynesworth win by a wide margin will will you said he's a pastor Wright yeah\nWhat are your thoughts on that I'm curious your thoughts about um\nPastors and evangelicals going into politics what are your thought because we we saw that too with a with Scott Dawson entering the gubernatorial primary I mean he ended up losing are coming in third or fourth place one of the two but nevertheless he um I think he ... he was in fourth yeah\nPersonally I Am against it okay tell me why\n\n\nI ... I Am very much of the opinion that if you cannot separate your religious opinions from your political opinions ... you're not going to be a good representative of the people\n... as a whole that's fair\nFair because people are diverse people group and I'm In some might not share their religious preference in their religious views the jewel I Do have a question about that\nPeople are diverse people group and um and some might not share the religious preference and their religious views that you hold I Do have a question about that though um do you think it's possible for somebody to um\nDo you think it's possible for somebody to completely eliminate their religious principles because I don't think so\nIt's not entirely possible uh and at that point I use to different terms ... uh if you\nUh\nAllow your religious views to dictate your political views yeah you have no business in politics yeah however they are going to influence your political views okay tell\nMe the difference because here's where I'm coming from so I think that\nYour your virtues and values that influence your decision making process and I believe you're virtues in value sets are determined by your ideology right for somebody who is of Christian is going to have what we call Judeo Christian values which is centered mostly around\nThe ten commandments and jeeze what Jesus said was the greatest commandment you know love God love people\nAre and and I mean my yoga as easy my burden is light love God love people as a paraphrase but nevertheless it's what Jesus said we are supposed to do so I think it's around and around\nYou know that last set that we had those ten law says that we had 'em in the ... commandments I'm that's what they're supposed to be a student centered around exactly and so I think that my ... I Know my virtues in my values come from that how I Try to live comes from that\nUm and I think those are replicable to lay the populace as a whole you know there are some that are specific to the Christian religion right like put no got above your gun but that's a paraphrase obviously but I have no God above your God um\nI Believe that is something that\nWe cannot we cannot look past a or not that we cannot look past I Believe that something we can't look past but also I Believe that it's something that's specific to the Christian religion but nevertheless I feel like a lot of those like\nNational not murder down shall not steal you know we can we can continue to go for um for those I feel like those are in the virtues in value set so we'll hold a or that Christians hold\nAnd I feel like I could not if I was running for political office I cannot completely separate the two 'cause I feel like it influences my decision making\nWill\nAs far as uh than dictating your political views as think of that as a slave master kind of relationship mhm whereas an influence is more of a friend ... giving you advice\nMhm\nThat's the difference that's made in my mind in the example of the dictating because I I'm having a hard time following because to me they seem relatively similar eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three is number to join the conversation you can get that phone and ah\nBecause I Want to actually look up or if there's um I Want to look up right now what commandments would be ...\nTo what commitments would be a political when it comes to\nJust life as a life as a whole life for all people and then what commandments would be a political\nTo just the Christian religion\nLet's see\nSo while I'm while I'm while I'm looking this up and making sure I have these right because I Know if I don't have these right than I Will get yelled at on their um tell me what do you think when you say dictating what are you specifically saying there\n\nUm tell me what do you think when you say dictating what are you specifically saying there\n\nYou could put it as a a dictator are telling the people exactly how they're going to live their lives or you could put it as a teacher telling you exactly how an assignment and needs to be done mhm\nYeah I just don't see how that translates ... translates to politics because the Bible in and of itself is a history book right the Old Testament is a history book and a lot of people think of it as a strict legal code when rounded the Bible is are viewed by scholars has a history book\nSo I think that is a history of the Christian religion has a history of the ... religion or however there are people who are\n... super strict followers of all of the Old Testament a dude are on them a little bit of case law mhm\nWell and a lot of that is so there's a lot of that and this is a discussion I was having the other day with a a close friend of mine\nA lot of that uh the point of that was the point you toward Christ right for you to look at the point of that was um four to show the Jewish people hey try to do all this essentially you know try to do all this I mean and think about it you know you don't last but when you think of ... thought in your head you're still lasting\nRites of ... and everybody has those come on every about driving into work right now there'll be like I've never done that yes you have\nChaos you I've I've done it they'll have done it everybody's done it and so it nevertheless\nYou're working towards the towards being perfect but the whole goal is to show you can't be perfect and then that was the point of the point you toward crisis like hey look at this guy who is perfect\nAnd look at the sacrifice of this perfect person that was made for you because he being a perfect person and being the son of God is the only one that can take that bird and from you so I think a lot of those Old Testament laws were meaning to point people\nTowards Christ and it's showing that journey right the Old Testament is showing that journey I'm that's\nWhy I and a lot of scholars think that uh and I'm not putting myself in that category I Would say by no means that I'm a biblical scholar I'm Still learning but nevertheless ah I think that is why a lot of scholars see\nAnd I agree with their opinion that the Old Testament and that the Bible as a whole of the history book because then you get to the story of Jesus and there are a political lessons there was following the life of Christ right it's following the history of crisis Christ's life and there's a book that's looking forward right\nThe last part of the Bible revelation it's not a history book it's for what's to come but nevertheless a lot of it is a history book so\nUm I think in some Asian right I feel like I'm giving a stump speech right now in summation I feel like you cannot completely separate\nYour religious beliefs from your political beliefs because I feel like your political beliefs are founded in your virtues and values that's in those come from your religion\nDoes that make sense and I agree with that there's always going to be that influence there yeah\nAnd see I listen I um I I'm I'm looking at the ten commandments right now out of exodus I'm it's I'm the larger God or brought you out of Egypt and out of the land of slavery you still have no other God's before me that strictly Christian right you ... may you shall not make for yourself an image in the form of", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "31"}
