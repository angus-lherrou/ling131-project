was ...\nIn in sending the protesters in and rotating protesters coming into the air and screaming at him\nThat this was going to be a farce and so it didn't really surprise me given the fact that the

issues and cabinet even though he's a Bush guy\nOr doesn't matter and he's the fifth vote and so by any means necessary judge\n[noise] well um I suppose we could have an interesting conversation about how it came to be that who are gets appointed came to be so important I mean there's one judge has started um are putting their own gloss on what are actually fairly\nA limited a statement to the constitution that happened a long time ago when when when when when justice Douglas found a right to privacy and what he called him a nation's\nFrom a number of surrounding the other amendments I'm quite clear that some people on the court foot that were that they could make it up if they want a long and so then I guess it very much matters who whose head is popping out from beneath the black great [noise]\nWell judge there was a a woman or I'd never heard of but she was on MSNBC over the weekend who identifies herself as they Watergate prosecutor just Jill Jill wind banks I literally I've never heard of her but\nThen so be it neither now so she\nShe she know express something that I began ... you're you're beginning to here of course on college camps even her hearing it for years but it's actually entered the mainstream namely the race\nOf Brett Kavanaugh has come into play let's listen\nThere is a white male privilege ravens here\nWhich is I'm entitled to this I did the hard work in high school and college and I deserve this was the end of that is not the case no one is entitled to bow on the Supreme Court and no one who has behaved in high school and in college as his alleged to do and no one who performed at the way who did it on Thursday\nDeserves to be even an judge\nYour reaction to that judge\nUm it's [laughter] it's a parody of itself um this got nothing to do with race um I I Can't understand how that gets dragged into it\nUm and the notion that somehow how one appears to be or appeared to be um in high school um determines what one can do in life is I think particularly\nI mean this this is now the new standard apparently but not for liberals conservatives Republicans won't do this to the other side that we had conservative supporting Sotomayor and Kagan you you're not going to have it play the other way but for Democrats\nYour high school\nI I don't know why why high school and I go back to sixth grade wise just high school the limit here but it it it all reflects on your your character and I find it interesting because they're always about you know letting these you know\nUseful indiscretions pass and they're all about well everyone should have redemption and but not for this if you're a conservative you can never be redeemed never\nRight or you have to do is is is have somebody claim that just stepped over the line once and that's it [noise]\nSo now they're actually they have some people on the record saying well we saw him at yeah\nClaim that just stepped over the line once and that's it [noise]\nSo now they're actually they have some people on the record saying well we saw him at Yale we saw him a ... a drunk and he got belligerent a few times and so he doesn't have the temperament so the new question judges as a former federal judge yourself\nThe idea of temperament because he was fairly aggressive in responding to the questions on Capitol Hill a last week that he doesn't have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court after having written two hundred decisions on the DC circuit he doesn't have the temperament\nThat's that's a great I'm no when proposition um if he gets upset um having been accused of um a sexual assault than he doesn't have the temperament if he doesn't get upset that he's guilty so it's you know it's if he loses either way\nRight well how do you think this ultimately plays out I mean that ... Democrats are of course are complaining that there's not enough I guess they interviewed that Deborah Ramirez over the weekend a hopped on that fast\nRight or the president said FBI can has free rein that's the phrase you gave free rein a\nWell free rein to do presumably what the Senate requested um the Senate requested um a limited extension of the background check\nAnd background checks are are not about you know we're not about criminal not criminal investigations and then I ... ... counter intelligence with their background investigations and they interview witnesses lay out what they say and presented to the Senate which ultimately makes the decision to finish the not the president\nYou know the um I don't know if you saw the Jim Comey decided he needed to weigh in on\nOn all of this so that you know he's weighing in on Kavanaugh saying well there and he's\nYeah he's loaded up the the the expectations 'em by talking about the capabilities of the FBI without discussing water background investigation is [noise] yeah well\nAgain if if high school and college drinking is now is now from the free love generation this is this is a this is now what we're going to be judged on I I I don't know who want want these\nYou know these nomination I mean I don't know a lot of people frankly he didn't have something to drink in high school or college a few but not many and we all do stupid stuff and not you judge because you're just a\nOh heaven for fan right yeah no nothing nothing stupid\nNothing stupid at all because you're you're you're him UK is ... what the rest of us\nKnow um [noise] if there's anybody who um would be willing to have every day of of his you've um penned up on a wall and examined then that person I don't think has led to a life of that would give them any kind of experience worthy of being a judge\nOr the other issue I just wanted to quickly weighing on this um [noise] the American bar association a supposedly it was it was of course it was improperly reported\nEarly on or that the a BA had withdrawn its recommendation that a judge Kavanaugh was you know highly qualified to be on the court and turns out it was\nThe president of the of the ADA picked up a pen and at his letterhead a and wrote something he wasn't authorized to writes um he's not the committee and um it was simply another reflection of the fact that the ... is is is generally left wing organization has been for years\nAnd he was a big supporter of Hillary Clinton uh and so\nIs is is generally left wing organization has been for years\nNow and he was a big supporter of Hillary Clinton\nUh and so you know they again initial reports all over cable on friday when I was on the panel on Fox in the morning on friday and it was a BA withdraws and again headline writers and written reporters don't do their work they say oh this is ... that's really bad\nAnd now of course we find out that that's all all not true a judge thank you so much for joining us we really appreciate your insights and and we'll check back with you soon you're listening to the lower income show eight five five forty Laura Jeff Flake a lot of you from Arizona calling in chime in\nA year reaction to what he did on friday and his appearance at the global citizen festival\nWith a with his friends senator Coons and also on a his appearance on sixty minutes on Sunday he's enjoying his little waning power like that when someone has power over you they think they have power over you they enjoy that\nEvery type and level of sport\nIt isn't always clear that a player has had a concussion so parents athletes and coaches need to learn about concussions signs and symptoms the American Academy of neurology recommends athletes start to have a concussion be immediately removed from place\nAnd not returning until assessed by health care professional trained in concussion this isn't just about sports [noise] it's about your brain when in doubt sit it out [noise] learn more at\nA.

that was John Dickerson coming so again men are trying to prove themselves the I care I care I care Alan Dershowitz was on CNN this morning had some very interesting insights and a Fox and friends excuse me with some very interesting insights let's listen\nIt if a liberal Democrat president had appointed the first Muslim American to the Supreme Court\nAnd somebody said oh yeah I remember he was a terrorist when he was Seventeen the ACLU will be all over this case no you can't presume guilt of terrorism but when the shoe was on the other button when it's a white man being accused by the left\nOf sexual offenses all the rules are called off the rules a presumption of innocence okay the rules of due process we know is guilty\nIt was by the left of sexual offenses all the rules are called off the rules a presumption of innocence okay the rules of due process we know is guilty 'cause he's a white man she's a woman she's a survivor that's the end of the information\n\nThat I I Can't agree with that that any more than if you're a white male and you're accused of something you are presumed guilty not presumed innocent you are presumed guilty there has\nTo be a a happy and fair medium here we don't want all we don't want women to feel like they can't come forward of course they should come forward one hundred percent it's a serious serious crime sexual assault doesn't norm is damage to a woman psyche and her future life\nBut at the same time you cannot do this to all men either say that [noise]\n\nIf you're tired of paying maintenance feeds the time she can't even use you need to call resort relief now\nNo you can't and I think it's it has either went up to a facts\nI think half the country is going back to their own history and saying if I have I reached a level of affluence are important or status or visibility in which anything I did in the past now can be used to destroy my career and the other half is\nI'm On happy and is that on happiness due to wouldn't have been by somebody\nElse who's now pretty important and should I use that to express my on happiness and take out here\nSo it's a very polarizing atmosphere they've created I think\nThey don't have any understanding the what the Senate does on national TV given the traditions even if it isn't a criminal case but when they dismantle the protocols of due process of\nA they say it's just a job interview or whatever they call it that dismantling affects all of our other institutions whether it's you know kicking oh a little league coach or saying the teachers in schools should be fired or your neighbor uh shouldn't have shot a gun on where you are how all those disputes when they even then when they don't reach\nA level of criminal a status nevertheless their educated on the spirit of the constitution and these guys are the constitution doesn't really matter anymore in matters of sexual assault\nWell when we when we see the\nFew moments of honesty from the Democrats [noise] ah when they really talk I'm candidly\nIt's about the fifth vote on the corner it's not about whether Brent did this or whether they're and none of that's really what's going on it's about the fifth vote on the court and then Jeff Flake last night on sixty minutes said admitted that if you were running for reelection he never would have\nA he never would have asked for a delay in this a confirmation about\nWell I mean yeah it is about the fifth\nVote but there isn't a symmetry there in that sense that\nWhen the Republicans are worried about a ... a swing vote or they don't do this I mean they didn't go after\nWhen ... I Believe that a wise Latina makes better decisions than a white male they didn't go scholar and so you're a racist and we're going to\nStop your they didn't go after Elena Kagan's so early college years and they they just don't do that I mean they disagree Merrick Garland they tried to use protocol use majority status but they don't do do it in the same way so it is about a fifth vote but it's about a fifth vote\nOr it's going to be conservative and therefore has an asymmetrical response if this was a fifth liberal vote they would be very angry and they would try to go over all the liberals opinions\nAnd say you know this guy's taking down the road to perdition and all that but I don't think they'd go after the person's high school a teenage years on the way they went out that's that's a progressive idea that\nThe noble and justify any means necessary to get there\nYou know it's also interesting I I think is how this has taken on a racial component even though of course both candidate on foreign are white ah but listen to this um tower of intellect Donny Deutsch today on MSNBC Victor let's listen\nFor an entire generation of women do forward they will not be able to look at the Supreme Court the same way particularly post that capital performance at as a man I was embarrassed fan\nOr they will not be able to look at the Supreme Court the same way particularly post that capital of the forms that as a man I was embarrassed than\nIt was an awesome and display of white ... the man who made his money in part by opening up you know PR NPR from selling selling snake around all the people and also um you know hanging out at strip clubs by the way in South\n... I think what's happening in the Democratic progressive movement is that they've created this Frankenstein monster and the doctors who created are afraid of being\nDevoured you see it with Diane Feinstein here in California if you believe that how we appear adjudicate who we are that is race class not class excuse me race or gender then\nYou have to live by that and Dianne Feinstein is a multi millionaire a white woman who's been who's running against by Kevin daily on a person quote unquote of color and the same thing is true\nOf Chuck Schumer and the string things through Coons there's a lot of old white guys on the Democratic side Richard Blumenthal and old white guy but they seem to think that that rule doesn't apply to them because they're liberal and they're joining this new wave but they're also doing it out of fear\nBecause they know that the logical ramifications of their own ideology comes right back boomerang right back at them so you get a guy like Donny dory sure you get all these other people say or white guy old white guy old white guy even one day\nAnd they're all like they're all old white guys it's back to the end of the progressive idea that you\nHave Andrew McCabe said you'd get insurance you try to protest so loud that you're going to get some medieval dispensation that exemption to from what you're saying about other people it's back to Mark Zuckerberg lecturing everybody on the walls where you have this huge wall around all of his houses\nAnd all these old white guys have privilege if you really believe Donny Deutsch you would say you know Donna you've had a good run on TV let's get a young person of color and give them the same type of opportunities and wealth you've\nHad a lot of that that would make me very happy very happy and he'd never happens don't expect it now ah\nThe we have to touch on this Jerry Brown signing into law this idea that women have to be represented on public boards in\nUh in California there has to be female representation on public points at which point at which point I treated out none of the Pacific islanders all Latinas in a black people they should all be up in arms here I mean where do they get to go they go to get their own representation on boards\nYeah I think that's a coded for a lot of very affluent women in the bay area who want to be on a lot of these boards on there and that's where all of the decisions are made and so they want a mandate or inclusion but again\nYou're seeing a fault line because you you hit it on the head and that is once you go down the idea that how we look\nWill be a Jew will Judy Kate who we are and we have to do it in tribal fashion and indeed and percentage fashion of the population\nThan there are so many different tribes with claims of victimization and reparation that's almost impossible to include them all so you're going to have you're going to see a woman say well I I Want to be in that board because I'm not just a woman\nBut I'm black or Latino and you're a woman but you're only white therefore I have I have greater credibility as being a person who deserves you know a set aside on this war a war going down there and I don't know where the ultimate project Korea's but either\nThat ability as being a person who deserves you know a set aside on the sport I we're going down there and I don't know what the ultimate project for years but either people are going to say you know what it's getting chaotic when we go to stop this and go back to the melting pot\nJust look at people by the content of their character not the color of their skin or their gender or we're gonna we're going to go into something like the Balkan\nYeah well I think again it is it's all identity politics at its worst I mean it's never good practice identity politics but you see this even in in the entertainment industry where we have an African American hip hop or\nBy Kanye West he he's the guy who has some guts I mean I don't really agree with Kanye West and I don't like his music and I I'm not here not might not my cup of tea but\nTalk about brave going out on stage on Saturday Night live the bastion of left wing progressive entertainment\nAnd wearing a make America great again hats standing on stage and this is how it went down\n[laughter] [noise] [laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nI Can't hear an airplane that version of it but he was actually onstage on SNL and wearing a make America great again hat he got food you got ... got harassed backstage he said for a for actually having a hat on and supporting Trump the laughter will not tolerate any dissent Victor\nYeah I think there's two things going on one is that this Trump idea that you close the borders to only legal immigration and then you try to get the economy up at four percent GDP low unemployment means that people who are Americans and I've been over look like a lot of people in the inner city suddenly they have leverage\nAnd they have worth and that's the kind of a revolutionary messy so west and others are starting to see and that's a lot better for interests that are people going to be patronize by government the title of the other thing that kind of reminds us that we want to get hung up on identity politics\nWe always have to have the strict its identity politics but it's all progressive so if you're west\nIt doesn't really matter you're black anymore because you have the wrong ideas and if you're ... you know keep all of them um and you're charged with sexual assault well\nIt doesn't really matter because you have the right ideas so ideology actually Trump's in most cases or gender or your race you have to have the proper raise the proper gender but you also have a ... up to have the proper ideology\nWell how do I mean we're almost that time but how how do conservatives stand up to this with with education being what it is today and the in group thing thing all their age I mean how do we as citizens

of Brett Kavanaugh has come into play let's listen\nThere is a white male privilege ravens here which is I'm entitled to this I did the hard work in high school and college and I\nDeserve this I went

on Thursday\nDeserves to be even an judge\nYour reaction to that judge\nUm it's [laughter]\nIt's a parody of itself um this got nothing to do with race um I I Can't understand how that gets dragged into it\nUm and the notion that somehow how one appears to be or appeared to be um in high school um determines what one can do in life is I think would it kill us\nI mean this this is now the new standard apparently but not for liberals conservatives Republicans won't do this to the other side that we had conservative supporting Sotomayor and Kagan ... you're not going to have it play the other way but for Democrats\nYour high school\nI don't know why why high school and I go back to sixth grade I mean why is just high school the limit here but it it it all reflects on your your character and I find it interesting because they're always about you know letting these you know\nUseful indiscretions pass and they're all about well everyone should have redemption and but not for this if you're a conservative you can never be redeemed never\nRight well you have to do is is is have somebody claim that just stepped over the line once and that's it [noise]\nSo now they're actually they have some people on the record saying well we saw him at Yale we saw him a ... a drunk and he got belligerent a few times and so he doesn't have the temperament so the new question judges as a former federal judge yourself\nThe idea of temperament because he was fairly aggressive and responding to the questions on Capitol Hill a last week that he doesn't have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court after having written two hundred decisions on the DC circuit he doesn't the temperament\nThat's that's a great I'm no when proposition um if he gets upset um having been accused of um a sexual assault than he doesn't have the temperament if he doesn't get upset that he's guilty so it's you know it's if you he loses either way\nRight well how do you think this ultimately plays out I mean that ...

as a potential Supreme Court nominee if Romney won the presidential election in any event it took Dr Ford over Thirty years to name the assailant delayed disclosure of abuse is common so this itself is not dispositive\nWhen speaking with her husband Dr Ford changed her description of the incident\nTo become less specific\nDr Ford testified that she told her husband about a sexual assault before they were married but she told the Washington Post that she informed her husband that she was the victim of a ... of physical abuse at the beginning of her marriage\nShe testified that both times she was referring to the same incident but physical abuse is very different from a sexual assault is it not\nThis is more from Rachel Mitchell's investigative report after having done the questioning and

John Dickerson ... so again men are trying to prove themselves the I care I care I care Alan Dershowitz was on CNN this morning had some very interesting insights and a Fox and friends excuse me with some very interesting insights let's listen\nTo it if a liberal Democrat president at a point of the first Muslim American to the Supreme Court\nAnd somebody said oh yeah I remember he was a terrorist when he was Seventeen the issue you would be all over this case no you can't presume guilt of terrorism but when the shoe was on the other foot when it's a white man being accused by the left\nOf sexual offenses all the rules are called off the rules the presumption of innocence under the rules of due process we know is guilty 'cause he's a white man she's a woman she's a survivor that's the end of the information\n\nThat I I Can't agree with that that any more than if you're a white male and you're accused of something you are presumed guilty not presumed innocent you are presumed guilty there has\nTo be a a a happy unfair medium here we don't want all we don't want women to feel like they can't come forward of course they should come forward one hundred percent it's a serious serious

is Armand happy and is that on happiness due to an event by somebody\nElse who's now pretty important and should I use to express my out of happiness and take out\nSo it's a very polarizing atmosphere they've created I think\nThey don't have any understanding the what the Senate does\nOn national TV given the traditions even if it isn't a criminal case but when they dismantle the protocols of due process of\nA they say it's just a job interview or whatever they call it the dismantling of fix all of our other institutions whether it's you know kicking oh a little league coach or say in the future and in schools should be fired or your neighbor uh shouldn't have shot a gun on where you are how all those disputes when they even when they don't reach\nA level of criminal a status nevertheless their educated on the spirit of the constitution and these guys for the constitution doesn't really matter anymore in matters of sexual so\nWhen we when we see the few moments of honesty from the Democrats [noise] ah when they really talk I'm candidly it's\nAbout the fifth vote on the ...\nThat's a when they really talk I'm candidly\nIt's about the fifth vote in the corner it's not about whether Brent did than some other there and none of that's really what's going on it's about the fifth vote in the court and then Jeff Flake last night on sixty minutes said he admitted that if you were running for reelection he never would have\nA he never would have asked for a delay in this a confirmation about\nWell I mean yeah it is about the fifth vote but there isn't a symmetry there and that sense that\nWhen the Republicans are worried about a ... a swing vote or they don't do this I mean they didn't go after\nWhen ... I Believe that a wise Latina mixed better decisions than a white male they didn't go scholar and say you're a racist and we're going to\nStop your they didn't go after Elena Kagan's so early college years and they they just don't do that I mean they disagree Merrick Garland they try to use protocol use majority status but they don't do do it in the same way so it is about a fifth vote but it's about a fifth vote\nOr it's going to be conservative and therefore has an asymmetrical response if this was a fifth liberal vote they would be very angry and they would try to go over all the liberals opinions\nAnd say you know this guy's taking us down the road to perdition and all that but I don't think they'd go after the person's high school a teenage years on the way they went after that's that's a progressive idea that the noble and justify any means necessary to get there\nYou know what's also interesting I I think is how this has taken on a racial component even though of course both candidate on foreign are white uh but listen to this um tower of intellect Donny Deutsch today on MSNBC veteran let's listen\nNow for an entire generation of women going forward they will not be able to look at the Supreme Court the same way particularly post that capital reforms that as a man I was embarrassed for him\nIt was we can both of them a display of of white title met\nThe man who made his money uh in part by opening up you know PR NPR from selling selling snake on all the people and also um you know hanging out at strip clubs by the way and so well\nI think what's happening in the Democratic progressive movement is that they've created this Frankenstein monster and the doctors who created are afraid of being\nDevoured you see it with Diane Feinstein here in California if you believe that how we appear adjudicate who we are that is race class not classics using their race or gender then\nYou have to live by that and Dianne Feinstein is a multi millionaire a white woman who's being who's running against like Kevin daily on a person quote unquote of color\nAnd the same thing is true of Chuck Schumer and the string things through Coons there's a lot of old white guys on the Democratic side Richard Blumenthal and old white guy\nBut they seem to think that that rule doesn't apply to them because they're liberal and they're joining this new wave but they're also doing it out of fear\nBecause they know that the logical ramifications of their own ideology comes right back boomerang right back at them so you get a guy like Donny dory sure you get all these other people say\nOr white guy old white guy old white guy even one day and they're all like\nAll old white guys it's back to the end of the progressive idea that you have Andrew McCabe said you'd get insurance you try to protest so loud that you're going to get some medieval dispensation that exemption to from what you're saying about other people it's\nInsurance you try to protest so loud that you're going to get some medieval dispensation that exemption to from what you're saying about other people it's back to Mark Zuckerberg lecture and everybody on the walls where you have this huge wall around all of his house\nAnd all these old white guys have privilege if you really believe Donny Deutsch you would say you know Donna you've had a good run on TV let's get a young person of color and give give them the same type of opportunities and wealth you found\n[laughter] I Would love that that would make me very happy very happy and he'd never happens don't expect it now ah\nThe we have to touch on this Jerry Brown signing into law this idea that women have to be represented on public boards in\nUh in California there has to be female representation on public poise at which point at which point I tweeted out though the Pacific islanders all Latinos and a black people they should all be up in arms here I mean where do they get to go they go to get their own representation on boards\nYeah I think that's a coded for a lot of very affluent women in the bay area who want to be all of these words when there and that's where all the decisions are made and so they want to mandate or inclusion but again\nYou're seeing a fault line because you you hit it on the head and that is once you go down the idea that how we look we'll be as you would do to Kate who we are and we have to do it in tribal fashion and indeed in percentage fashion of the population\nThan there are so many different tribes with claims of victimization and reparation that's almost impossible to include them all so you're gonna have you're going to see a woman say well I I Want to be on the board because I'm not just a woman but I'm black or Latino you're a woman but you're only white\nTherefore I have I have greater credibility as being a person who deserves you know a set aside on the sport or we're going down there and I don't know where the ultimate project for years but either people are going to say you know what it is getting chaotic when we go to stop this go back to the melting pot\nJust look at people by the content of their character not the color of their skin or their gender or we're gonna we're going to go into something like the Balkan\nYeah well I think again it it says all identity politics at its worst I mean it's never good practice identity politics but you see this even in in the entertainment industry where we have an African American hip hopper\nBy Kanye West he he's the guy who has some guts I mean I don't really agree with us and I don't like his music and I I'm not here not might not my cup of tea but talk about brave\nGoing out on stage on ... ... s Saturday Night live the bastion of left wing progressive\nEntertainment and wearing a make America great again hats standing on stage and this is how it went down\n[laughter] [noise] [laughter] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nI Can't hear an airplane that version of it but he was actually on stage on SNL and wearing a make America great again hat he got food he got he got harassed backstage he said for a for actually having a hat on and supporting Trump so the left or will not tolerate any dissent Victor\nYeah I think there's two things going on one is that this Trump idea that you close\nNot tolerate any dissent Victor\nYeah I think there's two things going on one is that this Trump idea that you close the borders to only legal immigration and then you try to get the economy up at four percent GDP low unemployment means that people who are Americans and I've been over look like a lot of people in the inner city suddenly they have leverage\nAnd they have worth and that's a kind of a revolutionary messy so what else than others are starting to see and that's a lot better for intercity people than to be patronize wide government entitle him on the other thing that kind of reminds us that we want to get hung up on identity politics\nWe always have to have the after its identity politics but it's all progressive so if you're\nWest it doesn't really matter you're black anymore because you have the wrong ideas and if you're ... you know Keith Ellison 'em and you're charged with sexual assault well\nIt doesn't really matter because you have the right ideas so ideology actually Trump's in most cases you're gender or your race you have to have the proper raise the proper gender but you also have the ... have to have the proper ideology\nAnd they were my time but how how do conservatives stand up to this with with education being what it is today and they in group the same thing all the arrangement how do we as citizens forget you know I have a platform but how do how do regular people stand up to the", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city":
