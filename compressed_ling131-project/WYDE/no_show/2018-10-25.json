I had told him\nI'm with the twins and cancer\nA and the woman in the commercial said that if we were a lot of had his way children like mine would be denied health care and it was obviously devastating to my daughter my family myself I pleaded with him to please the commercial down\nThat I felt that was insensitive heartless\nHis answer to me was that both have consequences and you will be held accountable in November it wasn't I'm Sorry it was an hour to realize the parallel it was like I'm going to charge you even more\nIn spite of what I've just gone through a and people in Pennsylvania and I just you know just cannot believe even his friends\nCan't understand what would cause him to do something you see\nI just got you saying that he green let this commercial and he in

and his brother got them and paid for the Mike Miller is the FBI agent posing as a real estate developer whom he had a text message we now learn\nFrom a lobbyist friend who said Mike Miller and the crew had tickets for us for Hamilton tonight at eight PM awesome news Gillum responded now he's trying to shape and shape the story to make it seem as if oh I thought he only reserve the tickets and my brother paid for them and just handed them to me well\nThat this story is starting to slip and slide all over the place\nOf critical race for Donald Trump this is probably of all the races across the country it's the most important or the governorship of the great state of Florida because of its effect on the twenty twenty campaign and of course that Florida is a bellwether state\nFor where the rest of the country's going uh but CNN is even hitting at the FBI probe centers on whether developers successfully influence city projects at one point in the program undercover agent successfully infiltrated Gillum inner circle no one's been charged with any wrongdoing\nAnd Gillum repeatedly said he's not the focus of the investigation but it's attendance at a Broadway show with lobbyists and longtime friend Adam Corey along with his brother and a federal agent\nWho went by the name Mike Miller has been used by political opponents to suggest Gillum it's potentially under more direct scrutiny you want to elect somebody who could very well be down the road indicted by the federal government given this given this story this is getting worse he he could be under even even more criminal trouble let's check in first with chip Roy\nOut is an interesting piece in Politico meet the next Ted Cruz in November chip Roy is likely to be elected to Congress top House Republicans

know that if you want to go on what the house will look like look no further than the Senate issue committees clown show a lost ...\nOh well you see this a situation in Texas where moral Latino and we in Raman array of found this out when he went to the Trump rally or this week are a special correspondent there\nThere are so many Latino voters Latino American legal immigrants into the United states has said what are we doing this is just ridiculous they're all for Trump to offer crews and obviously they're not going to be voting for you are a lot of them are going to be voting for you why do they want to turn this country and to the countries they left\nWell there's no course of the really tell you that the strongest advocates that I meet on the campaign trail and I taught you dropped this district in Texas the strongest advocates for border security are those immigrants who come here whether they're Hispanic or not a particularly bad acts in Texas\nOr come here illegally they know what they've got a note or to walk to separate that\nFrom places like Mexico and Central America and there beside themselves to see what the Democrat Party in particular and frankly some Republican or a supplement to their their beside themselves what they want to do to this country and so they look the message of border security and strong immigration standing up\nFor our country is selling well and by the way through and I know\nIt is much better for immigrants that we have a secure border I'm tired of watching this girl was getting sold a sec struck industry riding on the topic train cars Bob's dying it doesn't we refuse your base are sovereign ...\nShip 'em we know you're going to do really well ah and we know that uh you will be a force\nFor law and order less government a smart fiscal policy deregulatory efforts where we need to deregulate and we can never let Texas ever let Texas go blue\nBecause Texas just like Florida I'm Talking about this Andrew Gillum isn't here isn't he [laughter] and then he has a story to tell jokes ah but yeah we both states are critical I mean all states are important but the the left has taken over California and we see what the result\nCannot let that happen cannot let this have on Texas or Florida\nAbsolutely right as Texas goes so good who goes America you're absolutely right in Florida is much better skate and and they really\nNeed to get that election rock writing I'm quite sure hope will they will but also a say this I Can't thank you adopt grabbing Christian Vargas on your show the other night\nOr on a on Fox and for being a champion for that family of what a wonderful family who obviously lost a crust allows her nephew I'm already Vargas lost her son Jared ... in June they live ah in around my desk or it's not not in the oil but working hard of ever happen\nThat's that's a great family and a thank you for highlighting that in just as they're standing up and willing to do the artwork to save that they want\nAnd while working part of it but that's that's a great family and a thank you for highlighting betting just standing up and the artwork to save it it just it doesn't mean strong border security and the rule of law being reestablished on ...\nAnd they said the Vargas family told us that you were really the the one politician who came out and really gave them support they heard nothing\nUh from the Castro brothers as a zippo from them including walking Castro who's a congressman from that district her nothing from so chip thank you so much I Know you're going to do fantastically well and we can't wait to interview and you become a the next Congress men from the twenty first district of Texas so we've come on come on the show after you win\nI'd be delighted to I really appreciate

thoughts and even read inflame patches Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new Gen yourself sunspot director she says it to go to product every day she has sunspots an eight spots can definitely see a difference in her skin since using it\nUh in one of the most beautiful states or one of my favorite places as Minnesota or a car in a joins us now the races pretty tight\nUh the latest real poll shows that the Democrat is up I'm about six percent\nAnd I think that is within striking distance no doubt about it a car and it's good to have you with us how are things going on the trail\nUh it's gone just great Laura thank you so much for having me and yeah we have closed the gap in the polls\nThat when you're speaking of was done by our our Minneapolis Star Tribune which we sometimes call the red star a and that one had the damage at six and then the one before that and other Democrats all happy down three so it is going really well we are getting throughout the state and meeting and can talk and\nHad a big debate the other night uh are only state wide televised debate and my opponent I chose not to show up the only Democrat who didn't show up for the debate well\nHow how would that be even possible I mean the Democrats have\nMade some fairly significant headway in in ah both the Senate seat since Norm Coleman and\nUh since uh you know we've lost the governorship plenty and then he tried to run again and he he got a defeated obviously I'm In his bid for the Senate ah but where where are we now and trying to\nAnd trying to rebuild the Republican Party in that state Minnesota's economy has been doing so well and the Trump era of just two years we've seen a massive ah uptick\nIn the states productivity this is all positive why would people want to vote against that now\n[noise] will they doubt out we have a or Minnesota is turning Red Cross the whole state people are feeling it they're happy with the way the economy is going and I think Tina let's didn't show up with the debate the other night because she didn't have any answers to this and where she stands on the issue she's so far\nLeft and so extreme and and part of the resistance and obstructing everything good that is happening on the ground a and then she's also\nA for open borders and she wants to Minnesota to be a sanctuary state and she is directly tied to Keith Ellison still continuing to campaign with him\nYet uh being as hypocritical as as they are she's again you know wanting to impeach uh Brett Kavanaugh justice cabin on called for another investigation so\nMinnesotans are are some of the most well educated people when they go to the polls we don't have to register Democrat or Republican were free to move without the cabin when we go vote and they do their research and\nAnd that we have some of the ... we have the highest turn out in the country when it comes to voting and so we go educated so it was really disappointing that Tina Smith didn't want to debate may or at least tell the people of Minnesota where she stands on thing because she knows that's not what's resonating on the ground\nWell a Speaker Ryan Paul Ryan was in Minnesota uh yesterday and warned or the day before yesterday was warning of a green wave of democratic fun\nRyan Paul Ryan was in Minnesota uh yesterday and warned or the day before yesterday was warning of a green wave of\nDemocratic fundraising in a visit to drum up support for uh some of the house candidates Erik Paulsen and Jason Lewis\nAnd there are there are two of them more vulnerable in our house candidates\nAre but the Ryan said there's an enormous amount of Democrat money flooding the state uh last week Gabby Giffords came and did a a star turn there for some of the Democratic congressional candidates a and they they believe that if they can fully turn\nMinnesota blue then that will be another blockade for a Trump and twenty twenty\n[noise] uh and and it's not happening I'm not feeling it anywhere even in the primary what happened here so we go for it and we could have told you what was going to happen\nOn Minnesota is definitely turning red we've slipped our state house in two thousand and fourteen to Republican our state Senate in two thousand and sixteen oh we've got up on the iron range which had voted\nDemocrat for more than sixty years is now going to flip the Republican we've got a great candidate up there and plus Fifteen\nOr all of the rural areas are farmers are really on board with what the president is doing finally somebody it's fighting for our farmers and putting their issues at the forefront of a campaign so it's all\nAll the the uh a fake media and their rhetoric and talking about the blue wave and it's I'm not feeling it anyway and that's just me not just me as a candidate\nI really am not when I'm traveling throughout the state there's a lot of energy the height of the president and and even when he came for the two rallies he's already done to rally this cycle here in Minnesota there's a lot of excitement for my campaign and for the rest of the candidates throughout the state\nCurrent housley it is a fantastic to have you on a ... everybody needs to get out there and vote because the woman who was appointed Tina Smith\nA is even worse than Al Franken if you can believe that and she you know she uh obviously you know thinks that she'll be able to\nJust snuck or the Minnesotan voters for more liberal policies in open borders forget it ... the last thing the Minnesotans need our politicians in the state\nOr in a a senators representing the state who believe that they need more regulations on the small business owners and more problems for the medical device manufacturers who have done such a great job\nTo ... to reinvigorate the Minnesota economy after the uh the great recession so care current housley has got to win the seat that would be phenomenal news\nAs we march or even after this election toward twenty twenty I think Donald Trump can win twenty twenty and twenty twenty Minnesota He he he didn't win it last time around but he made a Mitt valiant attempt at the very end to try to pull out a victory\nA car and thank you so much best of luck in that race or for that Senate seat\nThat was vacated by um the group or Al Franken All right we'll take a break eight five five forty Laura we have

you that this caravan wasn't part funded by leftist politicians out of power in Honduras\nWho were working in concert with Venezuelan officials\nI Know that sounds like a a leap\nBut that they're working together to undermine us sovereignty because they see Donald Trump as a threat to leftist policies in both ... central in ... and the rest of Latin America and you combine that\nWith the groups like ... sedan Marilyn casa de Virginia casa de X Y and Z and groups like publicity and put on Ted us other open borders groups a mall death the Mexican American legal Defense Fund\nAll of them working together have big big social media lists\nAnd through through social media and then word of mouth people are told to gather at a particular place in time and they are told that if they come to this place and gather for a future convoy then they won't have to play the pay the ... money\nI'm headed later by how they start and stop who's organizing the seven thousand people and how do they know when to stop and start again\nWell the caravan started out organized by grassroots organizations in Honduras Guatemala and Mexico I Want as quite as bad as what his people Without Borders\nIt's you know it just shows you that without Roger ales and the formation of Roger ...\nAnd God Bless them um but\nMegan Kelly tried a late night show at Fox as I recall with Michael Douglas and uh I don't either and a lower Laverne Cox and others that she did these interviews with that was not exciting either that was kind of flat as well so why\nPeople thought it was certainly can improve if you moved it under different shingle I don't know they look everybody I thought she was great in prime time she did a nice job she grilled people she she got into the okay she did okay\nUh no no anger mangled is okay or our ochre speaking out now\n\n... now and November I don't have an ogre weed out\nIs a ... while she apologized to the ... she owes a bigger apology to folks and color around the country because\nThis is a history going back to the Teamsters minstrel shows to do to me and denigrate uh a race wasn't right well I'm old enough to have lived through Amos and Andy ... where you had white people in black said he's playing to black characters and it was just magnifying the worst stereotypes about black people\nSo he and accepting the apology\nYeah well look if I can understand how people were offended by that um those were largely shows very traumatized by white audiences and and you know I get it they they thought the African Americans might think stereotypes and that's what people laughing at rather than with yeah people I'm so look I\nI it it really is a question here of context but I think society has moved to a place where you can't put my face on or white face on it's just\nIt crossed a on a society's reached a place in some areas where you can't say Robert illegal is one of the greatest generals whoever lived which is what American\nPresidents Democrat presidents have\nEssentially said and praise him so you can't ever say anything positive about an American general even though he was a ... yeah it was not a slave holder or now and and you didn't say anything positive to anyone in the south\nAnd the antebellum south no I mean they're going to dig up those bodies I'm telling you those bodies and all those Confederate cemeteries are going to be dug up at some point I'm telling you this is is that black faces obvious that just so obvious I mean I don't know why she went down that road and again when someone apologize as you've got to kind of take them at the fact that you get on\nThe line on also on live television and you say things and you're ... you could hear when she was saying if he was trying to trying to balance it out as she wants it got out she was trying to walk it back a little bit\nThis happens on live TV and the heat of a discussion it's not the end of the world it's not like Meghan showed up in blackface okay that would be

to be part of an old house to Halloween or otherwise\nMy job or no so uh eliciting alluring show the ... down on a\nLot of political correctness a of a certain type is you know it's gone\nWay way overboard but this is not one of the cases in which it's gone way overboard\nEr and I don't want to make too much of this most people haven't seen a what a you know they they haven't seen you know the Megan Kelly show they don't even know anything about it I Want to make too much credit Melvin was not happy let's listen\nAnd there was some criticism yesterday on line that this was but let it go correctness run among um that's silly and its mission juniors and it's it's it's just as ignorant and racist as a statement itself [noise]\nAll right a lot more coming up John James up now\n[noise]\n\nThe following is not an actor but a real life story from trinity dead management my story begins with that a lot of debt credit card debt and I heard a commercial for trinity I gave them a call if you're in depth and you need help\nThe way I think they're going to turn out and with John James now getting the media attention in the air time he deserves oh but not as much as Andrew Gillum of course it's who Andrew Gillum is he can't he can't do any wrong even when he does wrong or John James joins us now John it's great to talk to you you were fantastic\nOn the incremental last night we get we got terrific response to your appearance I Know it was short but that's the nature of TV how you doing today\nI'm doing great thanks for having me back on\nA John tell us a first of all I Want your reaction to this a series of comments about President Trump that when he says he's a nationalist that means essentially he's a white nationalist John here comments\nOr I I think that folks get so wrapped around the actual round go around identity politics and it's exactly what's driving a part of the nation we're all Americans and one of the great artists that I've ever had my entire life is leading Americans at the battle in Iraq and bringing them all back home you know one of the things that you look at\nAmericans and one of the great artists that I've ever had in my entire life is leading Americans into battle in Iraq and bringing them all back home you know one of the things that you look at when you look at things like the Olympics are the only things that uh that look the same on us our our uniforms\nAre we are together all American and I don't have a a black message or white Mr said last night but a red white and blue message\nAnd I I feel like you have um the the progressive Marxist on the left who don't have a message\nThey don't have an identity so we need to identity politics in order to keep themselves in power I reject that fundamentally on either side far left are far right and I truly believe that by serving all Americans as as equals moving all up together it's exactly the type of leadership we need Washington\nWell again the lurch to claim racism or at every turn and claim it's either a combination of ... being a wild or racist or Trump being Hitler which is\nWhich is now it's so disgusting on so many levels and insulting to Holocaust survivors and you know all people everywhere but to me that's a sign of Democrat desperation John they have they have no real solutions Debbie Stabenow your opponent\nIn the Michigan Senate race clearly has no ideas she has no solutions for America it's all about insults personal insults a and attacking the motivations of those with home mom you know she disagrees\nAnd this this is a basic this is absolutely basic we we learned the amount of the first day of English class we'd be logical fallacies ad hominem attacks\nOn what you don't have any facts to back up your argument you go to direct directly attacking the individual you go to directly setting up these policies because you don't have yourself anything to stand on\nDebbie Stabenow a it for her part has been a career politician for forty three years has collected for a million dollars from the taxpayers only gotten five who her co sponsored bills into law in the past Eighteen years and ... remain buildings she\nLikes to bipartisanship is a buzzword she's anything but she's a solid a as a New York senator loaded with Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton Ninety five Ninety ... some of the time respectively and the promises he she's made around\n... around Lauren pharmaceutical drug costs around taking care of education and around um funding emergency ah funding for our troops who are deployed and in our veterans were coming back home she's broken promises to what I say to her all the time and I would I tell people in the state of Michigan to ask\nIs why should we believe this time senator staff and now she will say anything to get re elected they will engage in this politics to drive us apart\nWhat I'm trying to do is bring us together because we're all Americans and we need to rise up together to make sure that we in all this ridiculous rhetoric\nI Love this uh I'd love to have established on now claiming she's against sanctuary cities where was she when the Democrats had uh two years of\nOf majority rule in Obama's first two years in office I mean I don't remember Debbie Stabenow standing up for the American worker back then I remember standing up for\nA better trade policies against or China or Mexico and I I don't recall any of that but now because she wants or forty four year year career and politics to continue suddenly she is Donald Trump on immigration I don't think so\nShe she is a selective uh in her position she has a higher survival like you and she does whatever her polling and Chuck Schumer will tell her\nI'm centers to have it on and you can see our debate on John James for Senate dot com and follow around a but senators habanero will do is ever convenient um she voted against ...\nOn John James for Senate dot com and follow around 'em but senators now will do is ever convenient\nUm she voted against case law she support sanctuary cities and uh she will not do anything to secure our borders she's going up in a position to get comprehensive immigration reform done over her entire period over the past two decades or in in Washington and has failed to lead\nAnd so I Would say this is not that we need to get done right now all we need to end illegal immigration\nAnd uh the only way to do that is to get someone who's going to be more than just talk about it but somebody who is going to work with anyone and everyone to get this thing because this is a matter of uh of economic and national security and it cannot be kicked down the road and one thing I Will guarantee if Debbie Stabenow gets re elected or national security will be jeopardized in our ability to grow our economy will also be jeopardized\nHey John what is the reaction among African Americans in your state uh Europe proud combat veteran\nAre you a West Point graduate are you um you're a Republican which is is you know is is not something that a lot of people in Michigan you know are are used to because the Democrats still have a\nYou know still have a monopoly on the black vote but are you finding you're getting\nMore black support in your state is or or does the Republican label's still scare people off\nWell I'll tell you what if people get to know me for me as people begin to disassociate a me from the are by my name or the color of my skin or they begin to realize that hey guys\nUm this this guy made 'em want a Republican primary in a in the state and ah I'm going to be the only African American to the top of the ballot a ... and people are starting to realize that everything that I'm saying a rings true\nAnd you take a look at ... now has failed to do with with with what concerns African Americans and uh and Michigan is regard was raised around the state uh they're taking a look at this keeping an open mind and beginning to come over I\nI I Believe that the only ones who are not are ones who are who can't see past a of a blind hatred or blind allegiance but\nThose who I'm Talking talking to who are keeping an open mind and I recognize the I'm the best leader\nUm Fort Michigan into the future or bringing balance an actual experience on both from a combat environment understanding veterans' issues and national security and from a business environment understanding how to create jobs and how to protect the American dream for future generations to include our children Detroit is the most segregated city\nKnow now it seems like a hundred and it's it's not that I Love those rights but historically one of the most beautiful places incredible architecture incredible history of music and arts and architecture talked and and it's amazing decades of Democrat rule\nHave destroyed so many great American cities like Baltimore and in St Louis and and now are of course Detroit making something of a comeback but\nOut so much more needs to be done John James best of luck to you and your race against Debbie Stabenow in Michigan uh everybody get out there and support a John he's just a fantastic a young man and a ... he has the right ideas for the state\nAnd he ... he doesn't want to be considered a African American Republican candidate he wants to be considered the right candidate for the right time for the state of Michigan\nA and John Wheeler she all the bath and thank you for your service to this country uh we honor at and we support you were going to take a break eight five five forty Laura we're

said what are we doing this is just ridiculous they're all for Trump to offer crews and obviously they're all going to be voting for you are a lot of them are going to be voting for you why do they want to turn this country and to the countries they left\nWell there's no course of the really tell you that the strongest advocates that I meet on the campaign trail and I talked to grow up this district and all the taxes the strongest advocates for border security are those immigrants who come here whether there are not particularly bad acts in Texas\nOr come here legally they know what they've got a note or ... separate\nFrom places like Mexico and Central America and there beside themselves to see what the Democratic Party particular frankly some Republicans\nLet's go and Central America and there beside themselves to see what the Democrat Party particular frankly some Republican\nOr a supplement to their their beside themselves what they want to do to this country and so they look the message of border security and strong immigration standing up for our country is selling well and by the way\nIt is much better for immigrants that we have a secure border I'm tired of

well uh in one of the most beautiful states or one of my favorite places this Minnesota or a car and joins us now the races pretty tight uh the latest real poll shows that the Democrat is up\nI'm about six percent and I think that is within striking distance no doubt about it a car and it's good to have you with us how are things going on the trail\n[noise] ah it's gone just great Laura thank you so much for having me and yeah we have closed the gap in the polls\nThat when you're speaking out was done by our our Minneapolis Star Tribune which we sometimes called the red star a and that one had the damage at six and then the one before that another Democrat or happy down three so it is going really well we are getting throughout the state and meeting ... talk and\nHad a big debate the other night at our only state wide televised debate and my opponent at chose not to show up the only Democrat who didn't show up for the debate well\nHow how would that be even possible I mean the Democrats have\nMade some fairly significant headway in in a both the Senate seat since Norm Coleman and\nUh since uh you know we've lost the governorship plenty and then he tried to run again and he he got a defeated obviously I'm In his bid for the Senate ah but where where are we now and trying to and trying to rebuild the republic\nA defeated obviously I'm In his bid for the Senate ah but where where are we now in trying to and trying to rebuild the Republican Party in that state Minnesota's economy has been doing so well and the Trump era of just two years we've seen a massive ah uptick\nIn the states productivity this was all positive why would people want to vote against them now\n[noise] well they don't ah we have a or Minnesota is turning Red Cross the whole state people are feeling it they're happy with the way the economy is going and I think Tina let's didn't show up to the debate the other night because she didn't have any answers to this and where she stands on the issue she's so far\nLeft and so extreme and and part of the resistance and obstructing everything good that is happening on the ground a and then she's also\nBorders and she wants to Minnesota to be a sanctuary state and she is directly tied to Keith Ellison still continuing to campaign with him\nUh being as hypocritical as as they are she's again you know wanting to impeach uh Brett Kavanaugh justice cabin on call for another investigation so\nMinnesotans are are some of the most well educated people when they go to the polls we don't have to register Democrat or Republican were free to move without the cabin when we go vote and they do their research\nAnd and uh we have some of the ... we have the highest turn out in the country when it comes to voting and so we go educated so it was really disappointing that Tina Smith didn't want to debate may or at least tell the people of Minnesota where she stands on things because she knows that's not what's resonating on the ground\nWell a Speaker Ryan Paul Ryan was in Minnesota uh yesterday and warned or the forest service warning of a green wave of democratic fund raising in a visit to drum up support for uh some of the house candidates ... and Jason Lewis\nAnd there are there are two of the more vulnerable in our house candidates\nOn but the Ryan said there's enormous amount of Democrat money flooding the state uh last week Gabby Giffords came and did a a star turn there for some of the Democratic congressional candidates are and they they believe that if they can fully turn\nMinnesota blue then that will be another blockade for a Trump and twenty twenty\n[noise] uh and and it's not happening I'm not feeling it anywhere even in the primary what happened to your ... so we go for it happened we could have told you what was going to happen um\nMinnesota is definitely turning red we flipped our state house in two thousand and fourteen to Republican our state Senate in two thousand and sixteen oh we've got up on the iron range which has voted Democrat for\nMore than sixty years is now going to flip the Republican we've got a great candidate up there and he's plus Fifteen\n... all of the rural areas are farmers are really on board with what the president is doing finally somebody is fighting for\nOur farmers including their issues at the forefront of a campaign so it's all it's\nAll the the uh of fake media and their rhetoric and talking about the blue wave and it's I'm\nNot feeling it anyway and that's just me not just me as a candidate I really am not when I'm traveling throughout the state there's a lot of energy behind the president and and even when he came for the two rallies he's already done to rally this cycle here in Minnesota there is a lot of excitement for my campaign and for the the rest of the candidates throughout the state\nOur current housley it is a fantastic to have you on a ... everybody needs to go out there and vote because the woman who\nThat throughout the state our current housley it is a fantastic to have you on a ... everybody needs to get out there and vote because the woman who was appointed Tina Smith\nIs even worse than Al Franken if you can believe that and she you know she uh obviously you know banks that she'll be able to\nJust snuck or the Minnesotan voters for more liberal policies in open borders forget it ... the last thing the Minnesotans need our politicians in the state\nOr in a a senators representing the state who believe that they need more regulations on the small business owners and more problems for the medical device manufacturers who have done such a great job\nTo ... to reinvigorate the Minnesota economy after the uh the great recession so care current housley has got to win the seat that would be phenomenal news\nAs we march or even after this election toward twenty twenty I think Donald Trump can win twenty twenty and twenty twenty Minnesota He he he didn't win it last time around but he made a met valiant attempt at the very end to try to pull out a victory a car and thank you so much best of luck in that race or for that Senate seat\nA that was vacated by um the group or Al Franken All

a black cat\nWalks in front of your path right you know the old omen that comes out as especially around Halloween if a black cat walks in\nOf your past in front of your car in front of you and you're walking just if a black cat walks in front of you crosses your path then you probably shouldn't go down that that's the old rumor right that's a really bad side what happens what a Budweiser truck crosses your path\nYou think that's a good sign you think that's a good way to start the day I feel like that's a good omen that happened to me this morning I don't mean one of those Eighteen wheelers I literally mean a representative for Budweiser truck where it was a truck quite literally a truck like a truck with a bed everything like that\nCross in front of my back when I was like that's got to be with a sign for good morning is if a black cat\nThings like that cross in front of my life and I was like that's got to be with a sign for good morning is if a black cat is a bad morning then\nThe ulterior opposite that must be a Budweiser truck crossing my path it's a little too early for Budweiser I Will give you that\nNevertheless it was it it was a good sign he stopped you know we got out we had a couple of beers here before the show was sent it no we didn't do that but Budweiser truck to cross in front of my path this morning anyways that was my morning and the uh commute over here in which I saw like four police officers\nAnd a looked like it was a a rowdy morning out there for the police and the crime of the city because there are quite a few police officers pulling over quite a few people and it didn't really look like traffic\nStops I'm not going to like I mean I got to speculate but it really didn't look like traffic stops but\nWe got a ton of stuff we're going to get into today specifically who an article ... or not an article an argument\nWith a well how do we put this\nRadical feminist that I'm One show host may have\nGotten into yesterday and just a hint it wasn't

been ... I've been trying to figure out what the goods element is right because the black cat walks in front of you know you've been told that that is a bad omen right simple stuff so\nIs the Budweiser truck\nTo get home and and if not what is it depends on how you look at it yeah\nWell if you look at alcohol as a fan you're not going to think the Budweiser truck is a good is it is a good thing that's a fair point but here's the thing if you look at alcohol as us and you probably don't know how to read your Bible then there's that\nEight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three there's a difference between excess and Mir existence eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three so\nI got into\nAn argument yesterday and\nI Want to get your take on the argument because usually you're a moderate can balance me out\nAnd\nPeople know who I Am on campus I don't know if the same as for you Dylan people no I'm In conservative media people know my political leanings\nIt's pretty um it's pretty apparent not in the way that I carry myself or act I don't walk around reiterating Fox News talking points or anything like that you know I'm not somebody that's pioneering the political landscape on campus but people in that I have a very public I have two very public jobs I work in radio and television\nAnd so people know what my political leanings are in social media makes it even more relevant makes people even more aware in this modern age is it the same feeling for you doing when you walk around campus do people know what you do with no kind of where you lean on the political spectrum\nFires he's fine top cheerleaders that are qualified for the role but more importantly fit your culture and add to your bottom line visit fire seats dot com forward slash yellow hammer today for special offer on your recruiting strategy [noise] [noise]\nCan you sacrifice a day of your life changed someone else's life forever sign up to volunteer for the Cajun maybe certain place dot com and eat our Q.

and mood inherently eight six six five five one\nNinety nine thirty three rang out this morning so if you're just tuning in because you just waking up robbing the bags out from underneath your eyes going oh you had another day another dollar it's fine I was there too\nI Love the myth that motivated people um perpetrate and I do when they were going to get back to that story I was talking about so the colors and the garbage give me a second but I Do love the story that are motivated people talk about where they're like\nYou you know the motivational speakers they're like you're gonna wish job excited for each day and at first I bought into that I was like yeah I got to wake up excited for each day and then I thought about the reality of it\nYou're not going to wake up excited for each day especially when you wake up at the time that we do and everybody listening to this program is you know like three thirty four or five you're not going to wake up excited you're gonna wake up and you're going to be tired you're going to read this leap from your eyes and then\nThis program as you know like three thirty four or five you're not going to wake of excited\nYou're gonna wake up and you're gonna be tired you're going to rub the sleep from your eyes and then you have to knowingly make yourself motivated right that's a\nBig difference I don't know if you've ever experienced it Dylan I'm starting to think that it's it's not not possible to wake up motivated there are certain days where you have big tasks we're going to make wake up bona baited\nBut I don't think that it's\nPossible to wake up every morning with this overwhelming sense of motivation and urging the ability to go out and live your life unless you've spent like Twenty years in prison and you know you lost that time\nWell you can either wake up motivated or we kept determined to make that day a good day they both had the same effect really\nI think they're very different though I think motivate is like our boom boom boom you know I'm going to get this done this on this on just on the terminal was like okay I'm going to have a good day even like you could wake up and you could feel like absolute crap\nLike sick but you could just be like I really don't want to do today\nBut you could be like I don't want to do today but I'm going to make it great any way I feel like that's the tournament where I feel like motivation and maybe this is just the wrong definition of it but I feel like motivation in my mind like waking up happy\nHey it'd be like excited like physically motivated like jittery like after you've already had two cups of coffee and I just don't think anyone actually wakes up like that\nOld\nThey are very different like you like you're saying but you can have the exact same outcome of the other one\nYeah I'm saying I think more people wake up determined been motivated I think that's a better way to say it because determination is something that's entirely within I think motivation is like a force that kind of overcomes you over ... overwhelms you rather\n[noise] and um and it takes you with it whereas motivation as something that you instill in yourself and you take it where you want to go\nAnd if you don't sacrifice for what you want what you want becomes a sacrifice so\nMan brother a man I'm gonna get you a ... back there were just don't let you preach for a couple of hours make my life a little easier\nSo before we went to break we were talking about this little story that um\nThat happened yesterday where I got into a a Texas a western style stare down\nI'm a argument of the eyes with a radical feminist how do I know because she was wearing a I'm not sure what what did I say that it's a no bras something crop top no it was a crop top raindrops cropped up um no but it was a it was a um\n[noise] who was a shirt and it said it's a lie it said like no broad necessary or something like that and I thought it was something having to do with\nBreast cancer so I was like that's cool you know go for it do you're saying bring awareness that's awesome and that would be cool right if you're trying to bring awareness to something\nLike I get it because if you wear something like that when you're trying to bring awareness to something people are going to look and then people are going to ask hey what's that you know what I'm saying like what is going on with that and then you get the opportunity to tell them about that\nIt's only there was a way that Christians can do it like it but the Christian example is supposed to be you're supposed to love so radically you're supposed to love so passionately and you're supposed to just show Christ so much in your life that people go hey what's that\nI Want that and that's kind of what it's like when you are when you're pioneering championing championing any cause\nUm and so that's why I thought she was doing and then the back of the shirt said resistance and of course I said I rolled my eyes I was like okay and uh we got into a Texas style stare down and which I just kind of smiled and way because I have no problem\nI I honestly don't think it's that big of a deal\nOkay and uh we got into a Texas style stare down and which I just kind of smiled and way because I have no problem like I I honestly don't think it's that big of a deal to look at somebody if they're wearing something odd I don't think that's a bad thing but let's get your opinions eight six six by five one Ninety nine thirty three\nIt was called the ... ...\nI was seeing their command or nothing at all I always say\n[laughter] [noise] so those are those are one of the same though very much\nYet that's rather be able to figure out but uh yeah Murph I learn something about you did and never wanted to know\n[laughter] [noise] uh let's I wanted to actually go back to something yesterday to ... and ... year are you familiar with the eight can study Bible\nAkin study viable unless you're talking about Troy Aikman than now I'm not familiar with the agreement\nThat the Bible that akin study bio eight in the Bible AI K. E. N. okay got any Charles ... Seventeen eighty one ...\nI was able to commission the continental Congress Seventeen eighty one to the federal government my due to plant and distribute it for the education\nOf all families in colonies all families in the United states and at that time one one per a family was to be printed and distributed at the cost of the\nRight so I Do not think that a\nGovernment should come in and establish anything like if you want to teach that in your area outside of school if you would like to hold meetings for it outside of a school that's fine but I never think religion should co exist in a governmental ... age should\nCoexist sorry that was poor physiology I Do not think that it should be enshrined into the governmental institutions does that make sense I Do not think that religion should ever be a part of government I think the wall between church and state [noise]\nIs [noise] my apologies is a good law um I think that that is a good wall and in terms of precedents\nThere are bad precedent set like we can talk about Dred Scott Sanford and Eighteen fifty seven that still defined a people as property right we can say that was a precedent that was set by the Supreme Court that was later overturned because nobody talked about last rebel eugenics or\nCore to solve the United states\nDoes the president of the Bible does that in ... harm on anybody\nDoes it inflict harm on anybody know but the the the first amendment doesn't speak to harm but it but it doesn't sleep is the president leads to the federal government the presence of the Bible and the Bible alone\nIn a state building is in\nEssence an infringement upon liberty now here me out\nIt's not going in and it's not repressing it people right it's not saying you cannot do this but when you in trying a Bible in a state Capitol in a school in a court house\nIf you were in ... when you were Russia in trying a religious sect therefore people feel as if that ruling over them regardless of if they agree with it or not\nSo that makes sense\n\nGet ... to ... ... ... we're talking about original intent we're talking about the founding fathers wrote the constitution who wrote the first amendment ... that\nSpeaks to the federal government doesn't say anything about the state government actually does have the right to a impose a state recognized religion\nBut see that is that that ... that ... that's the large misconception though is because of the fact that the when people say the federal or or the federal government right that doesn't apply to the states\nAnd with a lot like that that autonomy between states and federal government is a beautiful thing I'll give you that that is one of the things that makes our country so great when we allow it to happen although we don't allow it to happen\nUm in some circumstances are but however the\nRoles of state constitutions are too like you said legislate state rent it it's worth the state showing its autonomy but\nThe thing that is enshrined in our constitution is that state constitutions cannot take away anything included in the bill of rights from a person they can add\nOnto your rights but they cannot take away any of your um inalienable God given rights so the the the argument there is if they're\nCan add onto your rights but they cannot take away any of your um inalienable God given rights\nSo the the the argument there is if they're infringing upon one's freedom of religion that's not\nEven if it's instituted through a constitutional amendment in the state that's still an infringement upon one of your original or in a one of your original an alien ... rights they tend not be taken from you and therefore should be appealed to the Supreme Court would be found is unconstitutional\nAnd by and large I wouldn't necessarily disagree with that I'm just saying you need to expand your ... go to Rachel in ten ... and the fact that the founding fathers that wrote the constitution were still alive when the federal government commissioned a Bible for the education of the public\nYeah but I think we're looking at this from a broad spectrum so say I'm say let's see they were the they came over here simply fleeing repression from the church of England among other things like that wasn't the only thing but a large portion of it was the church of England was a dominant force in England and the founders of the country we're trying to get away from that repressive ideology\nSay that somebody came in and said okay I don't I'm not I'm among my brain is only half working right now so I'm not a a hundred percent sure what else was existent at that point but let's just say Catholicism\nRight and let's just say they took Catholicism and said this is a Catholic nation we're going to teach Catholicism and the school the rudimentary schools they had at that point the state buildings were going to put ... everywhere\nAnd we're not going to acknowledge Protestantism we're not going to acknowledge Lutheran is and we're not going to acknowledge this that and the other at that point would you say that that is infringing upon your freedom of religion if ... if you're not a Catholic but ...\nYou're a Christian but you're not a Catholic and Catholicism is enshrined in the state house\nThat absolutely is and that's the way it was that's why the Anglican Church broke off from the Catholic Church\nSo now that we're in a place where we are not predominantly we're still predominantly Christian in this country but now that we're in a place where we have a large large sects of population that believe in Islam and Hinduism don't you think those same rights extend to them where you say hey\nI don't believe in that so why should the Bible be in the place the gum or it's me if I don't believe in the Bible why should that be way or the people are that the government I mean we make it clear you do not have to swear I mean we remember\nOh my gosh really more as God awful a right hand man that said you know you swear on the Bible when you're sworn into office and of course he got Puerto pieces of many conservatives look bad because there's a you know you don't have to swear on the Bible you can swear on any document you can wear on any well\nThat the Koran tells you it's okay to lie and you're going to swear to God of the Koran that you're going to uphold your oath of office\nI I mean I Want you you you may be able to do\nThat but that I mean that's disingenuous than of it off on the individual particles since for acting on a Bible that he used when he was going after the Barbary Coast pirates yeah so\nBut it but it but it's not a ... it's not a binary take the Talmud are you okay with somebody swearing and on the comment that's not the Bible part is not the\nBible at all but yeah that's ... Jewish stuff you have you on a collector\nRabbinical teaching it's not the actual I Know or if I Know I Know\nBut but it's a it is a Facebook and it doesn't even have to be a Facebook but you swear on but are you about somebody swearing in on the tour of the palm it I mean we can go to Allison get that [laughter] but\nI'm sure there's enough in there that you did I'm sure there's stuff in there that you disagree disagree with right\nNot in the tour I Know that\nDoes he do that [laughter] but\nI'm sure they're self in there that I'm sure there's stuff in there that you disagree disagree with right\nNot in the tour I Know that the tour we got the New Testament out of the Old Testament so\nOkay well the ... whatever whatever is the book that the that ah that Hindus point to\nWrite whatever the book that comprises of Hindu believes let's take Islam out of it let's say Christianity out it\nOf it put into his them in their Buddhism whenever you like\nI'm about to loosen signature I might start breaking up on ya okay or a bad spot that's fine but a is there are are you okay with them swearing and I'm not\nI'm not really know because you know a dictionary I think what a dictionary or the Hindus don't have a specific book because they have over a thousand God mhm uh you know so pick one you got you know ... or whoever you want\nAnd see that's that's that's that's the point in my argument it's not your right to tell them what they believe right it's not there it's not your right\nTo tell them that that's a mano the is the belief is the only way they believe in polytheism polytheism was believe for a long time and a history I mean we can look at the Romans we can look at the Greeks but\nWhat I'm saying is is that we should not have\nA Bible enshrined in our capital and this is coming from somebody that's a Christian we should not have a Bible enshrined in our state Capitol because it is restrictive on other people's right to choose their religion and if you don't believe in Christianity Christianity should not governed over you then that is in essence a theocracy\nWell it it's you still have freedom of religion it is and I think you should exercise that regardless of the religion you practice well the\nThe ultimate argument for me though is that certainly over the last\nTwenty plus years ... Christian has been run out of the schools ... you can't pray at football game I agree with you there you'd answer even being told they can't read the Bible is during a resetting outbreak times watch periods are being told you can't bring your Bible school they have there's no recourse there's no\nI'm backing by any governmental body and you don't want us to buy your own volition or if you're if you're able to even afford to do so to maintain your right to your specific religious freedom yeah\nThen you have to come out of pocket and for somebody to say you have freedom of religion but we're not going to defend\nYour I mean I I mean the government's not going to financially back you if you're in essence suing the government\nRight because of the school that part and it's a public school that's part of the government list them so they're not gonna financially back you because they're only set to lose in that scenario they're probably going to fight the lawsuit but if anyone tells you you can't bring your Bible into school and you don't know the long you can bring your Bible in school if anyone tells you you can not pray you cannot have prayer circles\nThey don't know the lie what it's saying is you cannot pray in a classroom and make everyone in your classroom pray because there may be students and they're just like there may be people in the state house that do not agree with your religion\nAnd actually says the teachers cannot leave ... ... a ... student led down the cannot be teacher led yeah\nRight and and and that's fine and and I and I realized that by saying I Want in God we trust her I Want the ten commandments to be allowed to be posted in a state building I understand that that's opening the door for other religions and other faced do the same thing ...", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "25"}
