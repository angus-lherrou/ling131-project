is doing well it's great when a other countries' prosperity is is rising but the president's point when he when he says you know America First of all it means is all just like with other countries are policies are going to be directed to making our lives better\nNot anti Semitic not racist it's pro American\nAnd for a lot of folks out there the idea of being ... you're pro American itself as

is\nThat's what he's referencing we have a sovereign right to determine our own destiny\nOur own set of rules for our own people our own policies for our own people that's what he means it must fair can understand that I think they get that perfectly well\nBut it it again it does not surprise me that this is where the left goes in the weekend of this the aftermath of this horrific act of evil Mike in Virginia very quickly line three Mike\nYes it's great to talk to you Laura I'm until the media and the Democratic party understand that there's three hundred million people in this country and there's a small percentage that are going to be ... and\nCrazy so\nUm there's nothing we can do about them\nAnd if Donald Trump had not\nSaid America First do you think this guy would have not done this I mean again what I'm saying is that the to connect this a try it's just a desperate last minute push for voters in mid term cycle where the Democrats might not win as many seats as I thought\nTo me that's a cynical play here is bringing Trump into this you're listening to your healthy radio addiction we continue\n\n\nGuys good news the outrageously expensive little blue pill is now generic which means you can get the prescription medication to treat eating an affordable prices\nClaiming Donald Trump or just exposes\nA the bankruptcy of the left and the Democratic party in particular I think the more they try to blame Trump for everything or the less credibility they have the more people will listen to what Trump is saying that's my view\nThere was a um we'll get to this a mom and they were just trying to drag the former rabbi and the current rabbi of the tree of life synagogue into you know political conversation I'll get to that in a moment but\nThe the never Trump ... a former conservatives I don't know if they were ever conservatives again on CNN Today use this as an opportunity to try to smear the President Bill Kristol spoke let's listen\nIf if the president wanted to come to our synagogue Newsweek and make some talk\nI Would say no thank you for now it doesn't mean I don't think he's our president I just think he does bear some responsibility for this climate and that's you know we don't need him we don't need him to help us overcome this\nRight here we don't need him but they're still in office there is no opportunity well I have a different view I think there is an opportunity for him to to speak out a and to anticipate accountability for\nYou know crystal is that these ... these people and there are truckers are just desperate or to justify their positions says Trump ...\nCrystal is that these ... these people and there are truckers are just desperate or to justify their position since Trump has done everything that conservatives have wanted him to what it actually not only him but Republican presidents to do for just that they have never done\nSo the only thing they can do\nIs uh assassinate his character which is what they\nCall it simply do this is ridiculous the uh you know ... one one comment\nA and I I've I forget it was in response to her question which elicited this where one could be done you said it would be ... have been helpful if there was a security guard in the synagogue there were security guards and lots of synagogues perfectly wise\nRecommendation government attack by the Democratic mayor of Pittsburgh the forward magazine which is an extreme left wing Jewish magazine blames him he said that Trump blamed the synagogue and blamed the synagogue he made a a perfectly reasonable point\nA they're a nut cases out there a will kill a and a synagogues and other other centers schools\nShould be defended but the Democrats and the left are so few ranged over gun control issues that practical steps like this are hard to take\n\nWell I think that's the case and the former rabbi a of the\nSynagogue a tree of life synagogue was also interviewed and again I'm not blaming anyone in the aftermath of this because people are so upset\nAbout the media really dragging\nThis into a political conversation and trying to tie Trump's entire\nWorld view to this evil anti he was an anti Trump\nA fanatic that the shooter whose name I Will not use to dignify the airwaves but these airwaves but this is what I'm John Berman on CNN drag the former mayor a former rabbi excuse me of the a synagogue that suffered so greatly let's listen\nHe welcomed the president to Pittsburgh in the wake of this I Do not welcome the president to him I said hey why not because he's the purveyor of hate speech\nOr the hypocritical um words that come from him um tell me nothing um we have a we have very very strong leadership in this city is believing values not just Jewish values leaving values and those are not the values of his friends and that's and I do not welcome him to Pittsburgh\nOr the current event that you know ... forgive me for saying this but I said as a Jew the Jews are out to lunch with these issues\nThat first of all Donald Trump was the first woman to be attacked\n... Donald Trump ... ah you know is of counter punch it basically and he doesn't spew hate for any group nothing like I mean I turn on MSNBC the other day a on the coal lawless at a panel\nEvery single day there were four people on the panel was the Trump and said I I'm a nationalist\nAnd every single one of them linked to adults Hitler why because they were in every one of them said nationalist is dictator well actually no ah Joseph not seeing any of the nineteenth century figure who created the modern state of Italy\nWell actually no I chose this mess see any of the nineteenth century figure who created the modern state of Italy he's the one who claim nationalism is a Democrat they just won't find any pretext\nTo link Trump to Hitler a Lawrence O'Donnell on CNBC he said when Trump said he was a national it said we all know the word that goes with nationalist it's white\nAnd then that translates into Hitler\nThey have against Trump dwarfs anything that you could say that Trump Trump Trump is kind of actually funny it is a tax 'em and light light hearted and everybody understands what he's doing a but these people they have dug themselves into a whole here\nAnd they they continue to defend it I mean the Democratic party this is the first time\nSince Abraham Lincoln that the Democratic party or any major party as a gone to war against the legitimate Lee elected president a resistance\nWhich is what Schumer and Pelosi call their up campaign of obstruction is not a legitimate function in a democracy\nFor political party ... we have a system of compromise we have a system where there is a peaceful transition of power and you wait for the next election and that translates normally into a honeymoon that Gallup\nEstimates is about seven months Trump didn't get seven seconds they were boycotting is inauguration there were calling for his impeachment the hate is coming from people like this rabbi oh who insist\nOn demonizing the president United States which is something that hurts all Americans here's our commander in chief and you know they did that the Bush too they called Bush Hitler the Democratic party is out of control and off the rails\nAnd a ... you know I think as time goes on more people are going to realize that until a ... there are so sober Democrats but there and intimidated by the party left now um but they they will come out of the closet\nJeffrey ... you have one and Alan Dershowitz yeah exactly Jeffrey Maier yeah Jeffrey Myers says the current rabbi\nOr who of course is just devastated by what happened to his congregation to his people he's worshipers and he was asked the same question on CNN Today in responding like this\nRabbi on President Trump has talked about coming to Pittsburgh and coming to your synagogue in the aftermath of this do you want him to come\nAround the president of the United states is always welcome I'm\nI'm a citizen he's my president he's certainly welcome\nThat's a good answer Neal you know every time I go I go to a synagogue I look around ... hopefully that there's a security guard there\nBecause the universities are teaching jewel hatred\nThey they are in our university the curriculum\nAnd the middle eastern studies programs but generally is that you know the Jews stole land the Arab land which isn't to genocide ally\nThe land which Israel was created belong to the Turks for four hundred years previously the Turks have not Arabs and they see the dilemma too because they were on the losing side of the first World War\nA ... it just ... you know this has been a Seventy\nThe size of the first World War a ... it just ... you know there's this been a Seventy year aggression against is to destroy the state of Israel and yet if you go on a college campus today the sympathies are all with the terrorists\nKnow pro pro Palestinian uh the Jews are are the aggressors an on line today and seeing the same thing that did this has caused a buy a both the president's rhetoric and those Jews in the United states who are\nAre helping support him and and continue to give him cover which I'm reading stuff going\nThis is this is a literally insane I I I have no words to this\nNo exactly this is the best president or from the point of view of of a Jewish survival up we've ever had\nA Trump limit you know that in some way his kids are Orthodox Jews for crying out

of course he wants to win that Senate seat against Andrew Gillum\nAnd uh uh well no I mean excuse me the governorship obviously\nAgainst Andrew Gillum and focus on the bill Nelson race against a former governor or the current governor outgoing governor\nA and Brock Obama is in the state this weekend so he's going to end this week you're going to be campaigning for Andrew Gillum and Bill Nelson the both the gubernatorial and Senate seats open a and it's tight stay there [noise]\n\nThis is a court ordered notice current and former foreign Lincoln and mercury owners or less the skin receipt payments and other benefits from a legal settlement related to allegedly defective take on it airbags in their vehicles\nWhat issue right now at this moment in time or is motivating the voters in Florida many are now moving toward you they're panicking on the left clearly but what what ... what one issue do you think is most important\nI think it's protecting Florida trajectory and I'm a candidate who is going to build up the success that Florida's had in terms of our economy\nAndrew Gillum wants to forty percent tax increase that I think voters know that will destroy our economic momentum I'm also a candidate that has a really solid plan to fix some of the environmental and water quality problems they look at Andrew Gillum is somebody that wants to impeach Donald Trump\nHow are you going to be able to get these problems solved which requires consultation with the federal government or if you're out there saying the guy should be impeached so I think they know I'll be able to get this stuff done and then people are really concerned about Andrews record in Tallahassee with respect to crime\nThey've had the highest crime rate in Florida and Tallahassee what he's been mayor and last year they had a record number of murders more murders at any time in Tallahassee history\nAnd I've been endorsed by an unprecedented array of law enforcement groups because\nAt the end of the day they want someone that's going to stand by them and support their mission Gillum is uh he's aligned with groups like the dream defenders who openly attack law enforcement so I think people are looking at safe communities and they don't want a governor who supports open borders and sanctuary cities and abolishing ice like Andrew does\nNow a ... a piece today and the hill Obama to campaign for Gillum and Bill Nelson of course is running for Senate reelection Senate ah in Florida how concerned are you about the allure of President Obama has rock star quality and helping your opponent\nSo I'm not I think he's going to end up turning more votes out for me than he does for for\nAndrew because I think folks will or who may not otherwise one vote if they see Obama's for Andrew they're going to want to support me I'm particularly given his record on things like the Iran deal cozying up to the Castro regime being very weak or when it comes to the ... regime and Venezuela\nSo I welcome President Obama how I should be paying for his travel expenses that come down and don't forget you know we have the president\nOf the United states coming down on October thirty first\nUh to Fort Myers in southwest Florida\nAnd then likely come again before the election happens and so you know you look at that rally that he did for Ted Cruz and Texas\nUm you know that put the race away for Ted and I think we'll get a similar outcome here um after he comes down to Florida for me\nWe'll Gillum is um silver Tunde order I mean that's putting it nicely I'm trying to build a nice today I'm about about my political opponents but he's he's kind of homes bond kind of throws throws off the rhetoric tested he tried to do the cool thing that Obama does\nI I don't think he doesn't do it it nearly as well but this is what part of what he said last debate with you for our listeners let's listen my grandmother used to say I have a dog will holler\nMisses the census has spoken a hit first of all he's got neo Nazis helping him out in this state\n[noise] Mississippi synthesis spoken a first of all he's got neo Nazis helping him out in this day he has spoken at racist conferences not calling Mr dissent is a racist I'm simply saying the racist believe he's a racist\nAnd of course the our ... our lovely is over and MSNBC it's center said oh that was such a brilliant line but we discovered today\nA there was a piece in Breitbart today that of course these boy Connors of Israel these anti Israeli organization supporting Gillum the ... you know he's not sign this\nPledge called dream defenders hum I pledge my support to the freedom papers and the freedom papers are of course I'm also an advocate textbook socialist principles\nThe virtue of being born each of us has the absolute right to adequate food shelter et cetera uh and it goes on and on and of course I'm anti Israeli groups supporting Gillum honey respond\nWell yeah like I mean I thought that that that performance ah helped me tremendously but I thought it was just so outrageous I think the average voter thought it was outrageous\nUm and he keeps going back to that because I think the cupboard is bear on any other ideas are issues and you're exactly right if you want to look at somebody who's just on representative of Florida values\nAndrew is the one who is aligned themselves with the dream defenders\nThey are openly antagonistic to Israel they support boycott divest and sanction\nOf the state of Israel they actually organized boy or a flash mob protests in Israel they take special trips or just the target Israel on and so what we're running for governor of Florida we're not running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip and so he's way out of step on that\nUm and I would never accept an endorsement from a group a that boycotted Israel I Would never endorse them from the debate stage like he did\nUm you know it just a couple of months ago and that group also says horrible things about law enforcement they say law enforcement as racist they say the police and prisons have no place injustice\nUm and that law enforcement should be defined that so that's what he said I'm In terms of the pledge he signed on that I think that that is just way outside of what is acceptable or in the state of Florida and I don't think he's ever successfully answer those questions\nOr another piece out in the Tampa Bay times just a few days ago new Andrew Gillum documents show FBI agent might have paid for fundraising dinner\nAnd of course that's the FBI are aging as part of the investigation into I guess Florida corruption and turns out you know four thousand bucks worth of food and drinks\nBut when a Gillum fundraisers a was paid for by this individual posing as a Florida real estate developer\nThat's right so he said just last Sunday when we did the CNN debate when I was confronting them about all this oh I'm a grown man I pay for everything how dare you all this stuff well then it turns out just a couple of days later\nThere was a text message just showing he acknowledge that this price the thousand dollar ticket to go see Hamilton\nWas actually paid for by and undercover FBI agent who he thought was a with a local real estate developer and then it comes out just a couple of days ago\nThat that same undercover FBI agent posing as a developer under wrote an almost five thousand dollar fundraising dinner\nFor Guillain nation governor campaign and indeed Andrew did not\nDisclose that expenditure and so he didn't even complied with Florida law so he goes around saying that he's not been investigator isn't being investigated\nI'm disclose that expenditure and so he didn't even comply with Florida law so it\nGoes around saying that he's not been investigators and being investigated but I Would ask the question\nWhat other reason what an undercover agent have for Greece and its problems with a thousand dollar ticket for underwriting pricey fundraising dinner if he wasn't investigating on that'd be the only reason you would do any of that stuff so he is under investigation he's been lying about a lot of this stuff and it is starting to catch up\nWith the laser ... down to some really simple in these last closing days it's just lazy this is sleazy politics as usual bribes uh people people dangling little benefits and politicians jump\nAnd they just jump okay what do you need what do you need a lot of ... ... ... ... oh yeah oh yeah I'd love to have that sure it doesn't matter if it's a Hamilton ticket or a trip or restaurants it's sleazy\nCorrupt politics at Tallahassee sadly\nHas has become known for and if if if people want San Francisco in in Florida then definitely vote for Andrew Gillum okay if you think San Francisco has become one of the most poorly run cities in the United states and you better get out there and vote for Iran to Santa I endorsed Ron over a year ago\nBecause I saw his leadership and his vision for the state of Florida and it's unparalleled\nIt's unparalleled so don't mistake the smooth talking Obama wannabe Gillum for good\nLeadership it's not it is it's pathetic and by the way a Ron before we let you go I got to get your take on this caravan I heard the Scarborough absurdity\nIf you're if you're concerned about the care of and you're basically anti Semitic I mean you've got your\nDiagram that sends a but the but it looks like Floridians in the poll that just came out a couple of days ago CBS Hugo poll shows that only I'm\nOnly twenty six percent said that immigration from Mexico in Latin America has made life in the state better\nThirty eight percent said no impact thirty six percent said it's made life worse than forty three percent said the migrants would ultimately pose a threat to the United states uh thirty eight percent no threat that's an overall a poll there but now I'm fifty one percent of Floridians pulled said we should not try to help\nThe migrants and the caravan forty nine percent said we should try to help this kind of a ridiculous question I mean we don't want anything to happen to these people we just don't want to come to the United states that's a loaded question but your view on the care of him well\nThis is one where you cannot allow people to just illegally run across our border the fact of the matter is Mexico offered them a place to stay in Mexico they declined it so it's not like they're just trying to move away from difficult circumstance or the nearest refuge they they rejected refuge in Mexico\nBecause they think they have a right to override our border I think that's wrong Andrew Gillum\nA support the caravan coming into the United states is running mate was out there saying yesterday that we need to welcome in the caravan into the United states um and so you couldn't have a more stark difference um for borders Andrews for open borders I Want to support our men and women and he wants to abolish ice\nDaughters my

borders he supports these radical leaders Chuck Schumer would be as first vote in the Senate and West Virginians are very concerned about returning to the Clinton Obama years and that's why we're going to win this race\nWhy um why would they Democrat ever have much of a chance in the state of West Virginia when Donald Trump won the state by what forty point something like that\n[noise] well forty two points and and I think the reason why the action is\nReally slipping dramatically in the polls is that as we've been able to get our message out and contrast that let them know what the people know that on all the issues that matter not only maps and some price of Hillary and Obama but ... not pro life a match and supports Planned Parenthood\nMatch and supports radical gun control West Virginians don't like that and I think one of the worst things of all is that Joe Manchin doubled down his support for Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work\nSo Joe mansion and the more people learn about his actual record not his rhetoric because\nFor what he does is he says one thing in West Virginia something completely different in Washington DC the more people learn about dishonest Washington liberal Joe mansion they move away from them so it's an education process\nWhat about the um issues of\nJust basic fairness that we\nSaw a rise after the Kavanaugh I'm hearing Joe mansion or voted for cabin on the end but a man\nThat I think most people just saw that as just an example of rank unfairness and treating some ... treating someone who's ... says you know they were guilty just because they were accused\n[noise] well I think that's right and I for folks following at home when you know that Joe mansion literally waited on his name was first called on the Senate floor\nMatch and took a powder and in fact he only came back the vote effort Susan Collins declared her position and whatever people think about the habit of West Virginia should cast a vote there should be leadership out of West Virginia so\nJoe mansion could have defused this whole craziness this impeachment circus this obstruction a craziness that we saw if he had come out just a little bit earlier for\nKavanaugh we know that\nFeinstein held that material for months why because she wanted to play politics with the Supreme Court nominee Joe mansion aided in the bed it Feinstein and Schumer by waiting giving the maneuvering room I think that's the word they used\nThat's what the problem is a guy like Joe mansion you know he may appear to be more moderate and rhetoric but in reality when you're first vote is to empower these\nRadicals then you can't be considered moderate he is a dishonest washing the liberal and\nMore and more voters are learning that\nLet's talk about the economy in West Virginia the president decided early on that he was going to try to do what he could to reinvigorate the coal miners their way of life\nAnd yet he's ridiculed even today I Can't remember I saw just today for his comments about clean coal Patrick\n[noise] yeah I think many\nKilled even today I Can't remember where I saw it but just today for his comments about clean coal Patrick\n[noise] yeah I think many people realize that the president has really follow through on his promises to the people West Virginia let's start with coal as many people listening no I let that twenty seven state coalition\nTo defeat Obama's coal killing wrecks at the U.S Supreme Court\nBut that it has served as a bridge\nTo President Trump and then he fall throughout his promises which were on some of those crazy a lawful walls and that's putting some miners back to work now what we have a long way to do but\nThey're starting to see a lot more activity in the energy area and that's directly related to the optimism people have with the Trump presidency but it goes beyond that\nThe Trump tax cuts are very beneficial for West Virginia not only a doubling of the standard deduction and the lowering the rates but in West Virginia we have fifty five of these opportunities always\nWhich are going to allow impoverished communities to lift up and reach their potential that's huge and that's credit to President Trump Joe mansion said no to the Trump tax cuts and he kind of goes back and forth and say well he was open than he wasn't\nThe reality is he voted no he voted the wrong way because Chuck Schumer wouldn't let them vote for and that's not the kind of leadership we need but we are seeing a resurgence in West Virginia and\nYou have to give this person a credit for so many good things he's done on taxes on regulatory relief on picking rule of law judges that instills confidence in the system which\nAllows a entrepreneur is to spend more of their capital\nOr we are going to be covering this race very closely over the next to seven days election day next week but you can vote early in West Virginia correct\nYes in fact ah

they don't like someone like Trump or actually wins so when you when you must be hating\nDonald Trump loves the American people he loves the American experience he wants more Americans to be prosperous and he wants more Americans to be\nAble to live in safety and prosperity a sound fiscal policy sound foreign policy that's directed to the betterment of the American people\nIt's fantastic when the world is doing well it's great when a other countries' prosperity is is rising but the president point when he when he says you know America First Ali means as well just like with other countries are policies are going to be directed to making our lives better\nNot anti Semitic not racist it's pro American\nAnd for a lot of folks out there the idea of being you're pro American itself as offensive\nThey don't they don't like this idea that you're pro American they think America is the best country in the face of the earth because that means that you by implication are criticizing other countries and that instead we need to be part of a\nGlobal understanding what their global rules in global there is a global order and the and so when the president talks about globalism global\nIs that's what he's referencing we have a sovereign right to determine our own destiny\nOur own set of rules for our own people our own policies for our own people that's what he means it must Americans understand that I think they get that perfectly well\nUh but but it again it does not surprise me that this is where the left goes in the weekend of this the aftermath of this horrific act of evil Mike in Virginia very quickly line three Mike\n... yes it's great to talk to you Laura I'm until the media and the Democratic party understand that there's three hundred million people in this country in\nAnd tell the media and the Democratic party understands that there's three hundred million people in this country and that there is a small percentage that are going to be ... nuts and crazy so um there's nothing we can do about them\nAnd if Donald Trump had not\nSaid America First do you think this guy would have not done this I mean again ... to connect this to try it just a desperate last minute push for voters in the mid term cycle where the Democrats might not win as many seats as I thought\nTo me that's a cynical play here is bringing Trump into this you're listening to your health the radio addiction we continue\n\nIt guys good news the outrageously expensive little blue pill is now generic which means you can get the\nI'm supports students for justice in Palestine this left wing hate group ah nobody does anything about it so you know\nBlaming Donald Trump or just exposes\nA the bankruptcy of the left and the Democratic party in particular I think the more they try to blame Trump for everything or the less credibility they have the more people will listen to what Trump is saying that's my view\nThere was a um we'll get to this mom and they were trying to drag the former rabbi and the current rabbi\nOf the tree of life synagogue into you know political conversation I'll get to that in a moment but\nThe the never Trump ... a former conservatives I don't know if they were ever conservatives again on CNN Today use this as an opportunity to trying to smear the President Bill Kristol spoke let's listen\nIf if the president wanted to come to our synagogue Newsweek and make some talk I Would say no thank you for now it doesn't mean I don't think he's our president I just think he does bear some responsibility for this climate and I see no we don't need him we don't need him to help us overcome this\nRight here we don't need him but they're still in office there is no opportunity well I have a different view I think there is an opportunity for him to to speak out a and to and to take accountability for\n[noise] you know the crystal is that these ... these people and there are truckers are just desperate\nOr to justify their positions says Trump has done everything that conservatives have wanted him to what it actually not only him but Republican presidents to do for just that they have never done\nSo the only thing they can do is uh assassinate his character which is what they\nCall it simply do this is ridiculous the uh you know ... one one comment\nA and I I've I forget it was in response to a question which elicited this where one could be done you said it would be have been helpful if there was a security guard in a synagogue\nOr a security guards and lots of synagogues\nPerfectly wise\nRecommendation government attack by the Democratic mayor of Pittsburgh the forward magazine which is an extreme left wing\nJewish magazine blame him he said that Trump blamed the synagogue and blamed the synagogue he made a a perfectly reasonable point\nA they're a nut case is out there a will kill a and a synagogue and other other centers schools\nShould be defended but the Democrats and the left are so few ranged over gun control issues that practical steps like this are hard to take\nI think that's the case and the former rabbi a of the synagogue or this tree of life synagogue was also interviewed and again I'm not blaming anyone in the aftermath of this because people are so upset\nAbout the media really dragging this into a political conversation and trying to tie Trump's entire world view to deceive\nThe media really dragging this into a political conversation and trying to tie Trump's entire world view this evil anti he was an anti Trump\nA fanatic that the shooter whose name I Will not use to dignify this airway it's much easier and waves but this is what I'm John Berman on CNN drag the former mayor a former rabbi excuse me of the synagogue that suffered so greatly let's listen\nYou welcome the president to Pittsburgh in the wake of this I Do not welcome the president's him I said hey why not because he's the purveyor of hate speech\nOr the hypocritical um words that come from him um tell me nothing um we have a we have very very strong leadership and they're sitting in for leaving values not just Jewish value leaving values and those are not the values of his friends and that's and I do not welcome him to Pittsburgh\nOr the current event that you know ... forgive me for saying this but I say that as a Jew the Jews are out to lunch on this these issues\nThat first of all Donald Trump was the first woman to be attacked the Donald Trump ... uh you know is a counter punch it basically and he doesn't spew hate for any group nothing like I mean I turn on MSNBC the other day\nA on the Cold War our set a panel every single there were four people on the panel was the Trump and said I I'm a nationalist\nEvery single one of them linked to adults Hitler why because they were in every one of them said nationalist is dictator well actually no ah Joseph messed see any\nOf the nineteenth century figure who created the modern state of Italy he's the one who claim nationalism is a Democrat\nThey just won't find any pretext\nTo link Trump to Hitler a Lawrence O'Donnell on CNBC you said when Trump said he was a national it said we all know the word that goes with nationalist it's white\nAnd then that translates into Hitler\nThey have against Trump dwarfs anything that you could say that Trump Trump Trump is kind of actually funny and as a tax 'em an ally ... light hearted and everybody understands what he's doing a but these people they have dug themselves into a whole here\nAnd they they continue to defend it I mean the Democratic party this is the first time\nSince Abraham Lincoln that the Democratic party or any major party\nAs a gone to war against the legitimate Lee elected president a resistance\nWhich is what Schumer and Pelosi call their campaign of obstruction is not a legitimate function in a democracy for political party ... we have a sister both compromise we have a system where there is a peaceful transition of power and you wait for the next election\nAnd that translates normally into a honeymoon that Gallup\nEstimates is about seven months Trump didn't get seven seconds there were boycotting is inauguration there were calling for his impeachment the hate is coming from people like this rabbi oh who insist\nOn demonizing the president of United States which is something that hurts all Americans here's our commander in chief and you know they did that the Bush to that quote Bush Hitler the Democratic party is out of control\nIt hurts all Americans here's our commander in chief and you know they did that the Bush to that quote Bush Hitler the Democratic party is out of control and off the rails\nAnd or the you know I think as time goes on more people are going to realize that until a ... there are ... Democrats but they're\nBy the party left now um but they will come out of the closet\nYeah Jeffrey Maier have one and Alan Dershowitz yeah exactly Jeffrey Maier yeah Jeffrey Myers is the current rabbi or who of course\nIs just devastated by what happened or to his congregation to his people he's worshipers and he was asked the same question on CNN Today in responded like this\nRabbi on President Trump has talked about coming to Pittsburgh and coming to your synagogue in the aftermath of this do you want him to come\nAround the president of the United states is always welcome I'm\nI'm a citizen he's my president he's certainly welcome\nThat's a good answer Neal\n... you know every time I go I go to a synagogue I look around ... hopefully that there's a security guard there\nBecause I got to universities are teaching jewel hatred\nThey they are in our university the curriculum\nIn the middle eastern studies programs but generally\nIs that you know the Jews stowed away and the Arab land which isn't to genocide ally the land which Israel was created belong to the Turks for four hundred years previously the Turks are not Arabs and they see the dilemma too because they were on the losing side of the first World War\nA ... it just ... you know there's this been a Seventy year aggression against is to destroy the state of Israel a and yet if you go on a college campus today the sympathies are all with the terrorists\nKnow pro pro Palestinian uh the Jews are are the aggressors an on line today and seeing the same thing that did this was caused a buy a both the president's rhetoric and those Jews in the United states who are\nAre helping support him and and continue to give him cover which I'm reading and stuff going\nThis is this is a literally insane I I I have no words to this\nNo exactly this is the best president or from the point of view of of of Jewish survival up we've ever had\nA Trump I mean they you know there were there and I sound like his kids are Orthodox Jews for crying out two years I mean it's just in Saturday and are these so called liberal Jews\nEvery time the level of sport\nIt isn't always clear that a player has had a concussion so parents athletes and coaches need to learn about concussions signs and symptoms the American Academy of neurology recommends athletes thoughts of have a concussion be immediately removed from place and not returned until assessed\nBy health care professional trained in concussion this isn't just about sports [noise] the ...

angles last week on Fox that the goal here is to turn Trump into a conventional politician\nI don't think that's going to happen\nJust not a conventional politician he's going to do things the way he thinks are going to resonate that's what the people are going to advance his agenda consumer spending by the way up consumer confidence way up\nA three point five percent GDP last month even with some

wants to win that Senate seat against Andrew Gillum\nAnd uh [noise] uh well ... I mean excuse me the governorship obviously\nAgainst Andrew Gillum and focus on the bill Nelson race against a former governor or the current governor outgoing governor\nA and Brock Obama is in the state this weekend so he's going to end this week you can uh be campaigning for Andrew Gillum and Bill Nelson so both the gubernatorial and Senate seats open a and it's tight stay there\n[noise]\nThis is a court ordered notice current and former Ford Lincoln and mercury owners or less\nThe skin receive payments and other benefits from a legal settlement related to allegedly defective to call it an air bags and their vehicles\nWhat issue right now at this moment in time or is motivating the voters in Florida many are now moving toward you they're panicking on the left clearly but what what ... what one issue do you think is most important\nI think it's protecting Florida trajectory and I'm a candidate who is going to build up the success that Florida's had in terms of our economy\nAndrew Gillum wants to forty percent tax increase but I think voters know that will destroy our economic momentum I'm also a candidate that has a really solid plan to fix some of the environmental and water quality problems\nThey look at Andrew Gillum is somebody that wants to impeach Donald Trump how are you going to be able to get these problems solved with require consultation with the federal government uh if you're out there saying the guy should be impeached so I think they know I'll be able to get this stuff done and then people are really concerned about Andrews record in Tallahassee with respect to crime\nThey've had the highest crime rate in Florida and Tallahassee what he's been mayor and last year they had a record number of murders more murders at any time in ... history\nAnd I've been endorsed by an unprecedented array of law enforcement groups because at the end of the day they want someone that's going to stand by them and support their mission Gillum is uh he's aligned with groups like the dream defenders who openly attacked\nLaw enforcement so I think people are looking at safe communities they don't want a governor who supports open borders and\nUh he's aligned with groups like the dream defenders who openly attack law enforcement so I think people are looking at safe communities they don't want a governor who supports open borders and sanctuary cities and abolishing ice like Andrew does\nNow in a piece today and the hill Obama to campaign for Gillum and Bill Nelson of course is running for Senate reelection the Senate ah in Florida how concerned are you about the\nAllure of President Obama has rock star quality and helping your opponent\nSo I'm not I think he's going to end up turning more votes out for me than he does for for\nAndrew because I think folks will uh who may not otherwise one vote if they see Obama's for Andrew they're going to want to support me I'm particularly given his record on things like the Iran deal cozying up to the Castro regime being very weak\nOr when it comes to the ... regime and Venezuela so I welcome President Obama how I should be paying for his travel expenses that come down and don't forget you know we have the president of the United states coming down on October thirty first\nUh to Fort Myers in southwest Florida\nAnd then likely come again before the election happens and so you know you look at that rally that he did for Ted Cruz in Texas\nUm you know that put the race away for head and I think we'll get a similar outcome here um after he comes down to Florida for me\nWell Gillum is um silver Tunde order\nI mean it's putting it nicely I'm trying to build a nice today I'm about about our by political opponents but he's he's kind of homes bond kind of throws throws off the rhetoric tested he tries to do the cool thing that Obama does I don't think he doesn't do it it nearly as well but this is what part of what he said last\nDebate with you for our listeners let's listen my grandmother\nUsed to say I have a dog will holler\n[noise] Mississippi the census has spoken a first of all he's got neo Nazis helping him out in this day he has spoken at racist conferences not calling Mr dissent is a racist I'm simply saying the racist believe he's a racist\nAnd of course the our ... our lovely\nIs over and MSNBC it's center said oh that was such a brilliant line but we discovered today on there was a piece in a Breitbart today that of course these boycott honors of Israel these anti Israeli organizations supporting Gillum the ... you know he's not sign this\nPledge called dream defenders hum I pledge my support to the freedom papers and the freedom papers are of course I'm also an advocate textbook socialist principles\nThe virtue of being born each of us has the absolute right to adequate food shelter et cetera uh and it goes on and on and of course I'm anti Israeli groups supporting Gillum honey respond well\nLike I mean I thought that that that performance ah helped me tremendously but I thought it was just so outrageous I think the average voter thought it was outrageous\nUm and he keeps going back to that because I think the cupboard is bearer on any other ideas are issues and you're exactly right if you want to look at somebody who's just on representative of Florida values\nAndrew was the one who is aligned themselves with the dream defenders they are openly antagonistic to Israel they support boycott divest and sanction of the state of Israel they actually organize boy or a flash mob protests in Israel they take special trips or just the target Israel on and so what\nWe're running for governor of Florida we're not running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip and so he's way out of step on that um and I would never accept an endorsement\nWe're running for governor of Florida we're not running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip and so he's way out of step on that um and I would never accept an endorsement from a group a that boycotted Israel I Would never endorse them from the debate stage like he did\nUm you know it just a couple of months ago and that group also says horrible things about law enforcement they say law enforcement as racist they say the police and prisons have no place in justice\nUm and that law enforcement should be to find that so that's what he said I'm In terms of the pledge he signed on that I think that that is just way outside of what is acceptable or in the state of Florida and I don't think he's ever successfully answer those questions\nOr another piece out in the Tampa Bay times just a few days ago new Andrew Gillum documents show FBI agent might have paid for fundraising dinner\nAnd of course that's the FBI are aging as part of the investigation into I guess Florida corruption and turns out you know four thousand bucks worth of food and drinks\nBut when a Gillum fundraisers a was paid for by this individual posing as a Florida real estate developer\nWell that's right so he said just last Sunday when we did the CNN debate when I was confronting them about all this oh I'm a grown man I pay for everything how dare you all this stuff well then it turns out just a couple of days later there was a text message is showing he acknowledge\nThis price the thousand dollar ticket to go see Hamilton\nWas actually paid for by an undercover FBI agent who he thought was a with a local real estate developer and then it comes out just a couple of days ago that that same undercover FBI agent posing as a developer under road and almost five thousand dollar fundraising dinner\nFor Guillain Nathan governor campaign and indeed Andrew did not\nDisclose that expenditure and so he didn't even comply with Florida law so he\nGoes around saying that he's not been investigators and being investigated but I Would ask the question\nWhat other reason what an undercover agent have for Greece and his palms with a thousand dollar ticket for underwriting pricey fundraising dinner if he wasn't investigating Gillum that'd be the only reason you would do any of that stuff so he is under investigation he's been lying about a lot of this stuff and it is starting to catch up\nWith the laser ... down to some really simple in these last closing dance is just lazy this is sleazy politics as usual bribes uh people people dangling little benefits and politicians jump\nAnd they just jump okay what do you need what do you need a lot of ... ... ... oh yeah oh yeah I'd love to have that sure it doesn't matter if it's a Hamilton ticket or a trip or restaurant it's sleazy\nCorrupt politics at Tallahassee sadly\nHas become known for and if if if people want San Francisco\nIn in Florida then definitely vote for Andrew Gillum okay if you think San Francisco has become one of the most poorly run cities in the United states and you better get out there and vote for Iran to Santa's I endorsed Ron over a year ago because I saw his leadership and his vision for the state of Florida and it's unparalleled\nIt's unparalleled so don't mistake the smooth talking Obama wannabe Gillum for good\nLeadership it's not it is it's pathetic and by the way a Ron before we let you go I got to get your take on this caravan I heard the Scarborough absurdity if you're if you're concerned about the caravan you're basically anti Semitic I mean you gotta you gotta diagram that\nSends a but the but it looks like Floridians in the poll that just came out a couple of days ago CBS Hugo poll shows that only I'm only twenty six\nIt's like Floridians in the poll that just came out a couple of days ago CBS Hugo poll shows that only I'm only twenty six percent\nSaid that immigration from Mexico in Latin America has made life in the state better\nThirty eight percent said no impact thirty six percent said it's made life worsen forty three percent said the migrants would ultimately pose a threat to the United states uh thirty eight percent no threat that's an overall a poll there but now I'm fifty one percent of Floridians pulled said we should not try to help\nThe migrants and the caravan forty nine percent said we should try to help this kind of a ridiculous question I mean we don't want anything to happen to these people we just don't want to come to the United states that's a loaded question but your view on the care of him\nWell this is one where you cannot allow people to just illegally run across our border the fact of the matter is\nMexico offered them a place to stay in Mexico they declined it so it's not like they're just trying to move away from difficult circumstance or the nearest refuge they've they've rejected refuge in Mexico\nBecause they think they have a right to override all our border I think that's wrong Andrew Gillum\nA support the caravan coming into the United states is running mate was out there saying yesterday that we need to welcome in the Caribbean into the United states um and so you couldn't have a more stark difference um for borders Andrews for open borders I Want to support our men and women and he wants to abolish ice", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "30"}
