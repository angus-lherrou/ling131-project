fascinating as a political conservative I think there's much choice to be quite Machiavellian about is is that the Democratic party is doing it so great great damage\nAnd you know you wouldn't worry if you you know if you're a conservative Republican you were if the Democrats came out and for\nStrong national defense and tax cuts\nAnd morality at home and on the streets and law and order and and basically came out with the same positions as a Republican that because they make themselves competitive with the Republicans and that'll get down to who's better it delivering these things a lot of people still believe that Democrats\nAre better manage in government than the than than the Republicans are so but at the Democratic party was going on in direction but it's going and just the opposite direction they're almost virtually guarantee\nThen the Republicans are so but at the Democratic party was going on a direction but it's going and just the opposite direction they're almost virtually guaranteeing a the reelection of a of a Donald Trump and two thousand twenty by my making themselves so marginal so crazy so\nUh you know out there that they just are revolting to most\nYou know decent law abiding American citizens\nWell in it and you have a situation where the former attorney general\n... the ... the the chief law enforcement officer advocated violence\n... and it's disgusting\nSo he advocated violence a Hillary Clinton says you can't be civil with people who want to destroy your\nYour beliefs so they are two fairly important people in the Democratic party you had Dianne Feinstein um claim that her office didn't leak this confidential document I don't know she league dinner for over\nYeah yeah yeah yeah from the ... let me give you another struggle now gee if I may plays is\nThat in the late sixties the radical left was you know the colleges campuses world claim a radical out being funded by the KGB and the G R U which has historically documented proof the Soviets were funding the ah anti war protests of the sixties is that they became crazier and crazier and more touchy more touch\nAnd what happened was was that they temporarily took over the Democratic party and they came up with a nominee George McGovern was\nA lunatic and who got creamed by Richard Nixon in Nineteen Seventy two so so the Democrats\nSwore that we're going to happen again so they they took ... re control of the party and nominated a centrist Jimmy Carter and won the Republican the Democratic party has now spinning out of control again as it did in ah sixty eight\nVirtually assuring that they're going to nominate a very extreme left is a Marxist Democrat who Trump will have an easy time to feeding in two thousand twenty\nDo you think that because his mass immigration and social media there is more of a chance of the country embracing that\nLeft wing radical ideology than it was Nineteen Seventy two\nNo three social media is just the opposite you know we we we it is taken power this is part of the reason why\nThe left as so enraged because they are losing power and authority the Washington Post is a sad joke itself let's face it the New York times has said Joe CBS NBC ABC I Can't remember the last time\nI watched any programming on any of those three networks except for a football games are on a on Sundays on to the to the networks are but I don't know anybody who does is that their power is draining away too\nYou know the lower income show and the Fox news and to a ... you know Newsmax and one American news and\nConservative talk radio and blogs and ... so they become more and more and rage they become more and more marginal and they're doing just the opposite the repellent their marginal viewers Marshall readers marginal listeners and send them send them all through the Republican Party which day by day is looking more calm and placid\nAnd reasonable just because of the craziness of the Democrats\nSo it's important than that the president himself a I think appear common this storm don't you agree with that and\nI wrote Donald Trump's image is set for the American people you know he can't he can't really altered or change it or what but but one thing they do believe is is that he's done a pretty good job as president certainly better than Brock a bomb and certainly better than Hillary Clinton was\nThe alternative change up or what but but one thing they do believe is is that he's done a pretty good job as president certainly better than Brock a bomb and certainly better than Hillary Clinton would've done he's got a chance to improve his standing\nAs as you know people uh you know a job approval and things like that as a ... economy continue to prove North Korea ISIS other things like this\nUh but it stand is pretty well fish but it's it's in he's in better shape\nThan the Democrats are worth a are at this point in time\nSo go go back and this goes back to the historical moment in we talked about this a bit last night\nSince you're Reagan biographer hum so many great Reagan bucks\nHow Reagan dealt with the ... riots and will will play a bit of sound or those who missed the show last night let's listen\nTo those people told you four days in advance that if the universities to head with that construction they were going to physically destroy the University of many negotiate what she said what is\nWhat it sees a public institution that is right on the universe its own community and for the community in Berkeley that live around all\nOf it began the first time some of you know better and are old enough to know better let young people think that they had the right to choose the laws they obey as long as they were doing it in the name of social protest\nHe gets up any leads yeah yeah that point what do you know construction he was talking about\nThey were there was a there was a park there in Berkeley and they left I Want to do a a build some type of bizarre a memorial to a Vietnam vet north Viet Cong soldier or something like that if it was completely\nOut of control it was just it was basically the left you know a stick in the eyes stabbed which is what it was all about\nBut what I Love about Reagan or old friend Marty Anderson who's to say that Ronald Reagan was he said warmly ruthless and if you listen to rag and he says these professors somebody you're old enough and ought to know better you know the way he just dismiss them but so smoothly and so clearly and so\nYou know a ruthlessly but it just it was the master of this type of thing\nAnd I I just I Love the fact that he he he he went right to the ... the salient point here ... which is that if people are led to believe that there outrage or their emotions\nCan justify any conduct their behavior then we're in big trouble after ... ... it's a huge huge problem\nSure but it is situational ethics and that's the difference today between the modern Democratic Party in the modern liberal movement in modern American conservatism is is that you know rule of law is one thing where is is that the rule of the mob is quite another by the way this idea that are over on CNN you can't use the word mop look up what Webster I tweeted out this morning\nWebster's Dictionary ... a just a a describes a mob as being an unruly group of people set about to cause a political upheaval but that's what they've been doing for the last several weeks was exactly that so you can call them up because you're offended by the Webster's Dictionary\n[laughter] yeah I agree with the mob one of the Tea Party when they're dressed in period ... yeah and that's\nWhy the left doesn't get it because they're incapable most people on the left us that they they're they don't they ... they think in a linear sense and they think well if the Tea Party at a protest and the liberals at a protest they must be one of the same no they're not one of the same id motives has everything to do with it\nNow and it's again it's feeling feeling is enough yeah right\nThat they must be one of the same no ... no one in the same id motives has everything to do with it\nNow and it's again it's feeling feeling is enough yeah\nAs long as they feel and they're on the right side then that's all you need so if you feel like well if you if you want to want to stand up for women in El ... then you then you got to go out and vote Democrat like what\nYeah but but that maybe I've said this before and it showed I beg your part of a habit\nThat difference today between moderate conservative leader mark certain politician in a modern liberal politician is liberal politicians goes before the voters says give me power so I can do good things for you and some voters go oh gee I felt pretty good you know\nIt but it but a moderate conservative ... that's an emotional response because the because liberals going to do the good things for you moderate conservative politician goes before the voters says give me power so I may give it\nBack to you ... have to think about\nIt you have to go through the intellectual discipline and realize what he's talking about which is a Republican form of government conservatism federalism\nHowever whatever iteration that comes in is that but it's about taking power away from Washington and send it back to the states or localities and ultimately the individual where the frame or isn't founders intended it to be there in the first place\nWell again power to power to the people the let me try to show up that slogan but they never really ... but that's\nThe that's the Latin basis for the republic\nPower to the people stays with them not with some big nameless faceless bureaucracies a critic I Want to play one more thing fee then we're out of time now this is Jeane

people lined up by the time I had to make a decision so my decision was do I want to tell people that were waiting ten and twelve hours already\nOtherwise it would have been really unfair all of the people that were weighed again we're talking about\nThousands and thousands of people\nHave five five forty Laura uh what could have done what can he do to satisfy the left I mean look at Fort Point

way on that frankly but it is pretty it is pretty hard when you have all these people there and\nYou you have taken care of business in Florida you got FEMA on it you got all the emergency station set up they're being given all the support they need and you're back in what two hours\nIt's it's I think it would have been a tougher call if it were in like Minnesota or California\nThen it's five hours

appearance is by upgrading your old line shades and shatters\nAnd of course now it's Donald Trump doesn't care about the victims\nThat which is which is nonsense I mean this is very clear that the\nPresident and his entire team had been working very closely with the governors of Florida Alabama and Georgia and I think it an appropriate time the president will go down to visit but as you know\nA head he tried to go down last night it would have been a nightmare because that would divert all Lugar all of the various workers away from what they should be doing to trying to take care of the president's fate so he'll get their president but I also want to see just whatever Donald Trump does\nHe's gonna be attacked\nThese people don't like him they wake up in the morning they say I Know he's done something terrible what is it\nAnd that's kind of their approached everything right now and it makes them frankly a little bit nutty\nWell and I think that uh again the the theory and the frenzy ah has gotten to a point knew that when I was talking to folks and yesterday who were in Washington and in Nineteen sixty eight riots after Martin Luther king and Robert Kennedy or both assassinated\nAnd they were saying that they hadn't seen anything is is angry and frenzied since then do you think that's accurate\nYeah I think I think basically you had extraordinary intensity up through\nWatergate you had a we had a million people surrounding the Pentagon at one point or you had soldiers who found that they couldn't go through airports are being harassed or the new is a very bitter very divisive time\nUh but I think after that\nUh we became sort of more normal for a while\nAnd uh now we're drifting back a because this is a genuine a cultural civil war I mean you know [noise] what Hillary Clinton said that it wasn't inaccurate that shot some people but she's basically right or when we're point or somebody like a justice cabin out\nIt's because we want to return to a constitutionally based court system\nThat uses the American system is this model not some European or South African or other kind of system and as a result if your a left wing a Democrat we we we are at the end of your world ... you know they had hope desperately\nTo change America and now the American people are responding and saying no we don't want to say we liked Being American and I think that has become just an enormously good or blow for the\nUh people who who thought up until election night two thousand sixteen they were ... Hillary Clinton was going to when they go at the two justices you got\nAnd he'll or even ... oh my God you know they'd be so far to the left and so so unwilling to look at the American constitution that will really been a very dramatic difference compared to where we are now\nOr I Want to play for you or Larry Sabato who of course famously bombed in his protections for twenty sixteen but\nNevertheless has this protection for the midterms\nIf there has ever been an abnormal presidency where he had it and the Trump is violated sold\nAlas has this production for the midterms\nIf there has ever been an abnormal presidency were in it\nAnd the Trump is violated so many of the rules of politics in so many of the norms of politics a red wave ain't going to happen it's just a question of how big the blue wave is they could be a suit on me it could be a middle sized way they can be a small way there's going to be a blue wave\nAh what is your reaction thought\nWell maybe he's right but it probably isn't I'm In the first question I asked is how come we just won a you a state Senate special election\nIn Texas state Senate seats in Texas were bigger than congressional seats eight hundred thousand people along the border sixty three percent are Hispanic or and we won the first time on a hundred and thirty nine years what's his explanation\nOf how come a mix Sally the Republican nominee in Arizona is now head or how come that Kramer the Republican candidate in North Dakota is ahead by maybe fourteen points or in his in ah\nTennessee as people begin to realize the British and actually the Democrat actually wrote a book explaining that Obamacare didn't go far enough and explaining how you could get to a government run health system British and starting to fall apart mhm and Tennessee is going to end up affecting reprogram Germans getting a sense of\nYou know it was only out of self sabotage and say oh where's the where's the blue wave in the Senate I don't think it exists\nNow and of course we see these races and some of these governors races the one that I'm really watching is the\nAndrew Gillum versus Ron I'm a dissent is because for me and for so many of watch the growth of Florida and\nHow well it's been a run by Rick Scott an end to the idea of turning that state over as critical as that stayed in the country electoral politics\nTo a guy who is basically a socialist is just that just cannot happen\nThen yeah he's got millions and millions of dollars nude from all the usual suspects\nCharlie Chaplin I mean you'll um is ah\nThe latest great hope because he came out of nowhere as a radical Democrat I he won an upset primary victory or he the key temporarily looks very good\nI think you'll be fading day by day as this goes on but ... but when you say governorships remember that there's a study that just came out the ten most popular governors in states\nAre all Republican every single one of the ten highest rated governors or a Republican or the governor of Massachusetts hardly a red state is gonna win in a landslide the governor of Maryland hardly a red state is gonna win in a landslide and the reason is exactly why we're building a majority in the country\nThey get results\nThey don't just have resistance are they actually have things that work they don't just have fantasies and strange ideas\nAnd I think we have to be prepared to wage a campaign that drives home again and again and again the difference between a the kind of left wing fantasies that are not you can't afford them you can't implement them a long run they're not going to work\nAnd I think that's one of our key jobs this campaign is to draw the distinction between results and resistance and certainly the attorney General Holder was a perfect example of the resistance says the alternative\nYeah I I really think and again we'll see how it translates into turn out I think those images of the protesters banging\nAnd again we'll see how it translates into turn out I think those images of the protesters banging on the Supreme Court doors completely out of control a I think that's I I don't\nThink people like that they might not like everything Trump tweets or\nThey might be annoyed at some of the things he says are exaggerates crowds I what I get that but\nI think the this frenzy people want it all to calm down they just want things to come down they want to come down on both sides and I so I think the Democrats made a really bad miscalculation on this cabinet thing and\nI think it puts them in a much more vulnerable place in a midterm cycle that they thought they you know they were going to just roll right into with you know fifty seat pickup so that's my sense of it in holders comments\nMaxine Waters I don't know I think all of it is it gives people a bad feeling\nWell and I think you can draw the contrast you mean here you have an economy which is\nBooming at a level people said was impossible your jobs being created yoga lowest\nBlack on employment and history the lowest Latino unemployment in history or you have a remarkable achievers would deregulation you have solid conservative judges being appointed so every time you turn around right now you're seeing genuine results\nAnd then you have as you point out uh people who seem crazed\nUh I mean is this really the America you want you really want people who come into a restaurant or harass people and drive them out when people banging on the Supreme Court doors are and I and I think in some cases of course we know the George shores and others actually pay for them or which doesn't you know does that justify him\nBut the whole system that the left has tried to create I think is in the end or not a sustainable system\nNewt I Know you're doing a lot of uh\nOf events before the midterm elections and there's one on October fifteenth or\nWhere you can register to um attend an evening with Newt Gingrich and you'll be able to hear you talk

honest\nAnd these political with their own agenda\nThey were so taken in by the allure by the patter by the look of the Obamas\nThey miss the deeper policies that were undermining the very communities and the safety at the end the prison reform and all the things that they really wanted to they didn't get down and write that it'll get done this is what my my my wake up call to everybody would be let's talk policy if we're talking politics and separate the rats\nYeah right it'll get done this is one my my my wake up call to everybody would be let's talk policy if we're talking politics and

you know what I'm referring to um what kind of\nPeel back another layer the onion about how the liberals the media don't give a rip about minorities you said you said they want to model climatic voting bloc they do because it's a means to an end that and is absolute power\nI think it's it's always been about power and the power is to change the American social construct\nThey want to destroy the foundations of this country so they can rebuild it no way that they think it should have been built in the first place they hate the founding of this country they think the country was founded on corrupt principles and a corrupt way that it was that from the American Indians and the Mexicans and it's now time to restore the order\n\n\nThis is Renee from Boulder, Colorado reading about the brand new Ginny cell sunspot correct her she says she loves it it should go to product every day\nBut I got to get all Riley to comment on what are you seeing in the uh crazy town or he joins us now bill how are you good to talk to you\nLaura congrats on T. V. doing very well on everybody to know that I'm big numbers for you and the show is a very interesting thank you I mean what okay Bill O'Reilly dot com is going through the roof 'em and very happy with that although I'm working harder than I wanted to work\nWell the no spin zone a podcast on Bill O'Reilly ... dot com and of course ah you know bills of books are among the best selling books of all time and literature and history a bill I Want to\nTalk about what you see because you're one of the smartest political analysts out there with all your experience reporting over decades or what you're seeing play out now in the country is is worse\nThan um you expected and are we approaching perhaps in Nineteen sixty eight style a type of frenzy in the streets\nWere borrow beyond that now I think it's worse that I've seen in my forty five year journalism career yeah basically a nexus of or the media the corrupt media I'm now a promoting embracing um whatever word you want to use the most\nRadical\nOh a promoting embracing um whatever word you want to use the most\nRadical progressive movement\nEver seen in this country ever in the history of the country so you have\nA guy's like and everybody knows this named George Soros but others as well with unlimited amounts of money we're basically um formed organizations to attack and destroy people with whom they disagreed\nThis is why it's different than the Tea Party or the or a hypocrites on CNN and MSNBC who you know from day to day will change their story depends on what they're told to do um you have now a bevy of organizations so he saw it in a cabinet hearings\nThat send people out these aren't mob people these are targeted\nPeople who are paid to do certain things you know to confront senators in elevators or with the CNN camera right behind them to ah prevent um Senator Cruz and his wife from having dinner the these aren't accidents are right to get Bill O'Reilly off the air\nNot an accident mhm\nOkay so you have this and in the past journalism reporters would have investigated it because this huge money behind it but they don't now\nInstead they promote it\nThey're in business with the radical left in business with them\nCNN and MSNBC make money lots of it promoting the most radical progressive organizations in the country which will stop at nothing including violence to get political power so that's what we're looking at\nDo you think that uh the president's handling of this ah the star and the way he's addressed it has been health saw has it been illuminating\nI don't think he knows what's going on the way I just\nLaid it out to you and your listeners I I just don't think he knows what's going on I don't think he knows the seriousness look whenever you have\nOrganizations that are in the shadows that people never heard of I'll give you one color of change our it and you've got\nTwenty of them and they take their orders from big money to radical left people All right they say okay you pay us this and we'll do that the woman who confronted senator\nFlake in the elevator is paid one hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year\nBy George Soros funded foundations\nWas widely reported Laura you hear that\nMm no no no\nOkay and so people think it's spontaneous all this woman just showed up to yell at a flake because she's a victim or whatever she said she is that's not what's happening\nAnd you know I I draw the correlation between what's happening in America now what happened in Germany\nIn the late Nineteen twenties and Nineteen thirties where you had a fanatical movement Nazi ism accumulating power behind the scenes by violent methods and there and it was big money in it as well okay while the population was looking away wasn't interested wasn't engaged\nAre there and it was big money in it as well okay while the population was looking away wasn't interested wasn't engaged and the media in Germany basically we're afraid of the Nazis and they wouldn't tell the truth about that\nThat was more of a fear thing than than a what we have now is that the media in America is ideologically in line with the progress ones there cause in the media is the same cause a George Soros so it was a little bit more extreme than the editor to the New York times but not much\n[noise] so this big picture that's formulated over the past I Would say ten years um I don't think President Trump understands it\nUm and I'll give you another thing if I were President Trump I Would order an FBI investigation into the cabin or debacle\nBecause I Know and I think you do to that it was no accident Dianne Feinstein held back that letter from Dr Ford for six weeks that was not an accident\nIt was no accident it was leaked against Dr for its wishes which I'm not exactly sure were sincere\nBut let's say let's take it for face value that letter was leaked putting the woman in danger and it was leaked by somebody in Congress because only two people have the letter\nSo the FBI should be investigating that and should get to the bottom and I'll tell you if they start that investigation which I Would order if I were president that scandal that whole thing is going to unravel fast because that was no accident what happened a cabinet\nAnd the women were all on the one hour all lying by the way they were all line\nTwo and a couple of people are looking into this who actually knew or knew both of them now now you two of them and\nWhatever it was ... I went through this I went through this myself mhm right and and I saw things leveled against me that were insane and\nI you know at this point in this country people are going to have to want to make a decision right the progressive left this figured out that they have the media in their pocket and they can do what they want\nThey can do exactly what they want and they almost got cabinet they almost got him and this is kind of country one\nIs is it you're not going to get an honest take from the media they're not going to investigate things they're not going to try to find the truth except it\nExcept that because it's been ... been in play now for quite some time so who do you depend on\nTo get the truth the only the apparatus is the criminal justice system and I'll put forth a President Trump should really see a bigger picture he takes everything personally any fights back effectively himself but I don't know if you see in the big picture what's happening here\nYou know once you start to erode basic rights like presumption of innocence you process what'd you say they don't matter as the senator from Hawaii say no matter\nThe presumption of innocence if somebody accuses you of misconduct none you're guilty\nBecause in the past some women have been abused I mean think about it\nThey're they're attacking the fundamental rights that Americans have and have that\nAnd nothing what is what is being done nothing\nAnd I think bill you know I mean it's a division but I'm just so worried about it I Can't tell\nI Am I Am petrified of this I I I completely agree with you and I was slammed the last three weeks\nI Am ... I Am petrified of this I I I completely\nAgree with you and I was slammed for the last three weeks for saying just because someone alleges something and says this is my truth\nDoesn't mean that you can just say okay this person has to be fired this person has to be boycotted this person has to be a thrown to the to the curb denounced um put up on a cross crucified lose a promotion this has got to stop\nThat 'cause I got to have it anybody well and it had happened it happened to me it has to have obviously things happen to you look what happened to you things yeah and it it is a brutal unfair situation and and once you're accused of something where do you go to a regulation that way\nAnd there isn't anybody in place to rectify it although President Trump could do it by trying to get to the bottom of this cabinet mess my new column posted on Bill O'Reilly dot com as it is about this issue mhm is about ... exactly about how are your truth has replaced the truth\nOkay so and I and I take it off the University of North Carolina which now wants to honor Christine for 'em and and I I I never comment on a doctor for one way or the other because I don't know what happened\nSuffer concussion each year that includes boys and girls every age\nEvery type and level of sport\nIt isn't always clear that a player has had a concussion so parents athletes and coaches need to learn about concussions science and symptoms the American Academy of neurology recommends athletes start to have a concussion be immediately removed from place\nAnd not returning to assess buy health care professional trained in concussion [noise] this isn't just about sports [noise] it's about your brain when in doubt sit it out [noise] learn more at A.

me tell you a short weeks long we can never come soon enough the week is not over but the work week almost is\nIts friday's ladies and gentlemen we notes on multiple friday's is one friday it's friday ladies and gentlemen and we are entering into the weekend and it couldn't get any better than that you want to know why because the weekend is an amazing time where we have college football\nPro football if he's still choose to watch like I Do and just a little bit of the Sabbath going on that but he was really good I heard a a nice teaching last Sunday on the importance\nOf the Sabbath and it really made me think you know 'cause a lot of times on the show we talk about you know how you're living your life and how you're working and if you want this goal you got to be tunnel vision right but we also talked about this work life balance and the Sabbath definitely goes into a work life balance because if you are not\nSchool you got to be tunnel vision right but we've also talked about this\nWork life balance and the Sabbath definitely goes into a work life balance because if you are not taking that day of arrest\nYou will just be absolutely run down trodden I mean think about it with any type of mechanical anything if it is not given a break at some point\nWould be run down isn't engine's not given a break every now and again we'll it overheat I mean there's just so many things that you have to go into and that time is like when you're in an engine where you are where you check the oil where you where you replace fluids redo all that kind of stuff it's the same thing with your life when you take the Sabbath\nYou take time to really sit and think about\nUm the week ahead what's a week in the past held and how you can make the week ahead better and focus on God for twenty four hours\nAnd as much time as we spend working and slipping away to a system I think we spend twenty four hours focusing on God I don't really think that that that big of an ask especially since it is your eternal salvation but not to get too deep on you this morning we're going to have more of a light show today because we've talked a lot about\nThe Kavanaugh situation we talked a lot about Supreme Court law we've had to delve into some deep deep and really muddy topics where there's a lotta legally and a lot of difficult stuff so today we're making a concerted effort to just stay away from the deep legally topics and\nMe and Dylan got some fun stuff for you this morning not like that fund that they tell you to do at camp where you know it's like uh what what are they called organized fun or it's like arts and crafts and you know there's always that one kid that's excited for it but that kids weird nobody really likes the arts and crafts time\nLike let's be honest I don't care how old you are you remember camp you remember forced upon you remember that when your kid that was like oh yeah I Love arts and crafts turns out he was just eating glue behind the table that's why he liked arts in class crafts but we'll have some fun stuff to get into today specifically\nKanye West goes to the White House we'll talk about how that went\nOr the right\nLoves it the less lost their minds\nAnd Tanya a well he was just ... so we'll we'll talk about that because you know it will be in the news cycle for the next twenty four forty eight Seventy two hours so we'll we'll cover it a bit he went for the same reasons that came crashing and went which the left praise but now since he's going for a different reason him because he's ... he's wearing a ... hat\nApparently he's just not the same and I'm Wondering did they know that they're married to the left no they're married\nI think going one fact past what is\nEvident on the surface is really hard for the left and therefore\nUh they're not too sure about that but I'll let them know that they're married a little later in the show so without further ado though I got to introduce the man behind the play on the man it's bringing some of the fun topics to help us get out of this quagmire that Supreme Court laws of light bill and how you doing this morning\nNot in the bone in line snow in June or a bomber\n\n\nAn interesting commentary on the era that we live in now called\nBro country does it all potentially down the exact same maybe we'll\nEver be on the level of the only King George I'll ever served George Strait definitely\nNot eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty\nThree King George never had to wear skin tight jeans\nTo get a point across yeah I'm Talking to you Brian I still like some of your music eight six six\nThree King George never had to wear skin tight jeans to get a point across\nYeah I'm Talking to you Brian and I still like some of your music eight six six [laughter] one Ninety nine thirty three I Hope somewhere down the road I get into entertainment in that line comes up I ... I Hope they pull that audio while I'm entered a interviewing Luke Bryan\nThat would be hilarious eight six six months' time one Ninety nine thirty three let's go to David on line one David how you doing this morning\nHey how's it going very good how about yourself yeah\nWell I like the content of this morning show you know I wanted for years and years who would be able to replace George ... but now I think we've found are man you are the future coast to coast man you got it may do you go from work at an early morning overnight and then you'll be home\nAll this time but what I was gonna say words you you know\nHe has no prior those are big series the failed man you know I didn't think he would make it when he replaced art bell but hey you know he's still here I'm pretty anyways yeah what I'd like to talk about is um I guess about I had a falling out with\nA light it well in a small town called ... and had a small had a falling out with a lady at a local Methodist Church there me and my wife had worked as a social youth pastors yeah under the regular you faster mhm and uh so he left to go back home to a\nFlorence Muscle Shoals area\nAnd nobody was going to take over the youth group for me and my wife you know we said we'll do it\nAnd for some reason now there's this one lady that\nAlways seems to be the cause of controversy Mm uh she was just vehemently opposed to us doing it you know and we said look you know we're not looking for any money\nWell you know we'll see them out of our own part you know she absolutely she control the board that controls the church so anyway we left\nSo I guess that was maybe seven or eight years ago and I really started studying astrology I said you know I've always heard of this thing astrology you know me and my son yeah but I didn't know anything about a star\nBelieve it or not here to seven years later really gotten into it I read various books on it\nI study my a personal chart every day and then uh there's like two or three sources of a\nTerrible car radio what do you call them or they don't call them Terrell card readers I you know whereas I read your tear cards for the money then they\nKinda go way over my head David I'm not somebody can answer that yes well that's okay but\nUh yeah uh yeah but they read your your they raised the terror cars and they tell you what each one Maine's and pack can pertain to you as you're signed but anyway um\nUh so I started really getting into this and I've been documented over the years and I have found that on an average I found it to be eighty five percent correct\nAnd you know very specific\nYeah and ah you know 'cause I had a lot of doubts when I went into it but they've got all goes about how the planets are lined when you're born it goes about how the all the planets like right now I'm paying a Venus can be saying underneath the ...\nWhich say Saudi wearing the aries managed to October twenty four and it tells you what all the means to me as a sign you know and everything that's cool though but I found that ... years it'd be a Ninety five percent accurate and I mean that's why I thought maybe\nTwenty percent of the most ... but I was really shocked at it's eighty five percent accurate you know on an average so interest you know that's\nTwenty percent of the most mhm but I was really shocked or five percent accurate you're on an average show interest you know that's my little tail\nInteresting I appreciate David thank you but thanks very\nAll right you have a great day right talking about a little bit about astrology you know I've never really understood is like I I don't get the correlation\nLike\nI was there are people like David to believe in it vehemently like not seemingly that's the wrong word that's an angry words that believe in it religiously right obviously it's not their God that they believe in it a lot let's just use that word religiously to mean a lot so\nI never really understood what the concept behind it is because it just seems like in Delhi correct me if I'm wrong it seems like something having to do with the moon and the planet alignment is going to affect my body in some way and listen I don't think what's happening on Pluto\nIs going to effect if I get a raise tomorrow you know what I'm saying I just I don't see I don't see the correlation but there are some people that live by that man check that horoscope every day\nI mean ... somebody came up to me and said I I don't even know my birthdays December twenty second if anyone can tell me what I Am that'd be perfect but somebody came up and said something I don't even know the science that shows you how good I'm going to do on the test\nBut they said something like you're a knock one man isn't that one of them are ... are Aquarius or not ... as a superhero I'm a knock one man but they come up and they said you're an Aquarius and I said\nWhat\nThen they said you're an Aquarius so it was like what does that mean and they're like you're going to win twenty dollars today I was like I don't I don't understand how that works you are a Capricorn a Capricorn yeah no it's pronounced candy corn\nI like candy corn I don't know what a Capricorn is but I like candy corn as well like I just don't understand the strategy do you are now at all\n\nI understand well enough to know that every single one of the horse gets put out there for every sign\nAre done in such a vague way to where you can interpret it and it's going to apply to you that you that day\nThat's what I thought I thought that horoscopes where along the lines of an uh no I'm going to catch some flak for saying this but like Joel all seeing evangelists and\nLike you go out and you say something that's really vague that you could take any amount of success and it could be a attributed to that you could say yeah yeah yeah Josephine really had it right like yeah yeah yeah the sign really had it right you know what I'm saying\nThere's also a lady that wrote a book I Want to say it was in the early Nineteen hundreds that was about some signs that really kicked all of it all sun science old that's another name for a all of these other uh astrology sign\nSo do people believe that it dictates your life like a guide sit or that it's something that just predicts it rather\nUm people think it dictates that\nI don't see how that would go with the religion like I don't see how those could intertwined if it dictate your life than that saying that God is in dictating your life and therefore it's kind of flaky waters there\nIf you believe in previous nation you can I can see an argument being made where they do intertwined yeah\nDon't know we're getting too deep this morning let's go back to talking about kicking cats in the moving traffic just kidding just kidding but there was something funny that I saw the other day but uh but I thought you'd like in so peta is going around trying to get you to stop eating meat ladies and gentlemen they're trying to get you stop\nSomething funny to us all the other day that uh that I thought you'd like and so peta is going around trying to get you to stop eating meat ladies and gentlemen they're trying to get you to stop eating steak\nAnd they have a bold new tactic they go out and I believe it's pita\nI don't know the organization wasn't attributed here but it looks like a pita right it's either a pita or the girl down the street that doesn't showers really hairy and tells you she's begun when the conversation starts\nSo she she came up and uh she put something on a pack of a burgers and steaks right and the burgers and steaks they say\nMy name is Chloe I wanted to live your quote personal choice killed me don't buy it and it's a picture of Chloe the cow on that and Chloe the cows all smiley in anything\nAnd so they have made the mistake of putting out a tweet that that would you still eat it but even if they had this message that said\nMy name was Chloe I wanted to live your personal choice killed me don't buy it\nYes I Would and I we just call that meal Chloe I was gonna say I put something like I'll have the Chloe special plays a lot of lot of people were saying some really weird things that that's just such a weird tactic in my mind\n[laughter] you put a name on my food I'm going to call him that name while I eat it now see that's weird 'cause then you start getting attached to it\nWell that's absolutely there's there's been a which isn't all that kind of stuff for thousands of years matter of fact ah though back and read about saw the first king of Israel he got in trouble because when he was when the spirit has left him and he was getting ready to be replaced\nHe actually went in and acquired of a witch or to have his fortune told\nAnd there are familiar spirits\nEnter he's talked about this before um if you have the word Jeanie Jeanie comes from Jen Jen was\nAn Arabic term that's the only way or the ... gene is appearing some gym\nYeah but it's it's a word for spirit and it would be a spirit that would come and tell you information matter of fact Mohammad when he started Islam a gym came to him and started giving them information and that's where and those gyms are evil spirits\nInteresting so I don't know that you\nKnow you got to mess with terror cards we gee boards horoscopes all that stuff you asking for trouble\n... do you know what your sinuses so I can at least give you your horoscope before you go\nI I Am from the Chinese year of the dragon and the irony of that is that dragons ... considered and secular world and taking the world's to be very wise\nOkay I I'm not good at horoscope you've got to break that down for me what is the Chinese you're the dragon is that a horoscope\nWell it's it's a Chinese horoscope like the rest of us do the rest of the Greeks everybody do months and you have vertigo and Leo and all that which I fall into the vertigo thing or\nThat's what I'm looking for them or if you
