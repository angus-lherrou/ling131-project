beat that drum why why do they beat that drum\nYou're listening to your healthy radio addiction your reaction to Trump flipping the script will it actually result in more African American votes for Republicans or at least get them to look twice at the Republican Party\nEight five five forty or I Want to hear your reaction OK so cognac continues after he talks about the the fact that he didn't have a lot of it was basically saying you didn't have a real ... male role model at home and then he continued\nHillary everyone writes but in a cafe\nJust sitting making you know the guy that he can get to see my dad all the time like a guy\nWas it was something about when I put his hat off it made me feel like Superman made a Superman that was the favorite superhero and you made a Superman case for me\nSo Donald Trump or as someone who defied the odds to win the presidency that is what Kanye West is is referencing there I Believe like anything's possible in America\nAll said you couldn't do it they all said you your campaign would flame out they said you would get trounced by Jeb Bush they said that uh the Hillary was then going to destroy you it was going to be a member of the other productions that Trump would lose in a massive landslide you remember that I Do we played 'em every night and every day\nWell all of that was false and Trump became president and Kanye West I think is a man who you know he didn't have a lot of male role models Donald Trump has been a friend for a long time it doesn't mean Donald Trump gets everything right personally we know he hasn't none of us do but I think\nYou know he didn't have a lot of male role models Donald Trump has been a friend for a long time it doesn't mean Donald Trump gets everything right personally we know he hasn't none of us do\nBut I think that there was something profound and what he said there the ... the Hillary campaign slogan was I'm with her\nAnd for African American men they love their moms of course a lot of these women are heroic are trying to raise kids on their own it's not easy and but they he's saying and it's it's probably in today's day and age not politically correct but he doesn't care to\nI I wanted a male role model to follow\nAnd I'm someone who is going to bring male energy to the office of the presidency Hillary slogan didn't speak to him it's just his personal opinion\nI mean you can disagree with it you can say it's well it's kind of off off base Hillary was just really smart and she would have been a bit better president how we obviously no that's not true\nBut the do you notice that Don Lemon et cetera did not actually speak about any of the substance economy I brought up let's keep listening to Kanye West let's listen to\nThe needs of all the other I mean someone to help him and if the guy them and then he's a hug more than anything calling you back away from the cameras do get some help and then come back and make your case nobody if you want to be conservative is you want to support Donald Trump that is your business\nAs you're doing it have some sense with it make sense educate yourself\nOh wait a second so Jay Z and Beyonce who were\nAt the president's side and on speed dial I think they joke they're big policy experts\nAnd George Clooney because he testified before Congress he used to be on and on human rights and in Africa I mean I guess I woke up okay he knows more than all the diplomats and all the people have devoted their lives for this well I mean you could raise a question about that right but no one ever did\nThey never raised the question about any of these folks and how about Miley Cyrus running from dorm room to dorm room\nKaty Perry running around college campuses ... trying to explain domestic policy to\nStudents okay these people wouldn't know a domestic policy of a bit I'm In the back side\nWill take a break John Cornyn coming up your calls eight five five forty ... we'll get to all your calls Kanye West helps Trump and the Republicans flip the script this is a unconventional moves and we'll see if it pays off it certainly is interesting don't go away\n\nThis is Michael ... and here with Mike stole from health markets helping folks find the right Medicare coverage that news reports say that the rates might be going down the cost of many Medicare plans\nAbsolutely I mean the Democratic party that I used to know has gotten hijacked by people who disrupt hearings are normally mild mannered senators like Cory Booker proudly proclaim I'm breaking the rules by releasing confidential information during the hearing\nAnd then you see a senators being assaulted in airports run out of restaurants with their spouses and just people being threatened and you know it wasn't a ... college should Rand Paul could probably\nJust a part of this best but you know at some point it it gets to the level of incitement we're not talking about free speech we're talking about inciting people to violence like Eric Holder did which is a dangerous and I don't think ah I don't think we ought to reward that at all\nNow and it seems to me that the more successful Senator Cornyn this administration is the more Congress unites with the president on issues such as this statement actually and United\nIt's almost like it's driving the last ... into a uncontrolled frenzy and they can't stand it the better America is doing they are there more and more angry\n[laughter] well as you know war the holy grail for the left as the Supreme Court and they can't stay on the idea that President Trump has now Puerto two outstanding nominees to the Supreme Court as well as our confirming a number largest\nAnd they can't stay on the idea that President Trump is now pointed to outstanding nominees to the Supreme Court as well as\nOur confirming a number a larger number probably the largest at this point in the presidency I'm a court of appeals judges and a district judges and this is the driving them I think to a\nA too that there's a unattractive uh to say the least I'm sort of activism which frankly I mean do we want to turn the government over to these people after the midterm elections I don't think so\nThere was an interview with a colleague Ted Cruz's challenge or the other day Beto O'Rourke about on the confirmation of Kevin I'm going to play it and get your reaction let's listen\nLet me get you on the record on on judge Kavanaugh would you voted\nTo confirm him I Would not have we the Supreme Court justice who believes in voting rights\nA justice who believes in a woman's right to make her own decision about her own body and have access to the health care than ensures that she can he fails the bar on each and every single one of those tests so the next justice to be nominated can only be confirmed if she or importantly she can meet those qualifications\nYour reaction to that well they do ah I Know they do pretty well and he's a he's a he's a nice enough guy but clearly he's not\nRunning for the United States Senate from Texas I'm he's out of step with a with Texas values and and this and every other important area mildly suspicion laws he's running for the Democratic nomination for president in twenty twenty because he's appealing to the national Democrats and the hard left\nOr who are who are ah we're seeing a create these the sort of mob rule\nAnd Senate or what is your best take right now on the Republicans in the midterms me you heard ... are very confident that the Democrats are going to swamp the Republicans in the house and Senate but how does things really look we'll start with the cruise seat\n[noise] well I think Ted's and that's in good shape the latest Quinnipiac poll shows him nine points up but as you know this was all about turnout we know the left as angry the people that are still angry that Trump won and twenty sixteen\nAnd mid term elections we usually see a down dip in turnout but uh I think the Kavanaugh hearings shove energized our our base and um we've seen people like governor ... in Tennessee said well he would have voted for a cabinet shop but I'm the truth is\nIf you are what the Democrat this mid term then we're going to jeopardize our ability to conform more federal judges and a Chuck turn the Senate over to Chuck Schumer and uh I just don't think ah ah the country is ready for that\nNo well I certainly I certainly hope not speaking and just back on the ... issue for a moment I devoted a lot of time on\nMy show senator to uh discussing what next when the president if the president gets another Supreme Court pick\nThe incentive to me seems to be still\nThere for that type of circus we saw\nFor Kavanaugh in namely there's no there's no repercussions for leaving a FBI report or or a or a letter or anything confidential that's not supposed to be public there are no repercussions so given the fact that there were no repercussions at least now there hasn't been yet\nDo you think it's appropriate for the president or would you recommend that the president authorizes an FBI investigation into how this information about Dr Ford ended up leaking out to the press\nTo recommend that the president authorizes an FBI investigation into how this information about Dr Ford ended up leaking out to the press [noise]\nWell I have a pretty good suspicion about how it leaked out to the press has you know after Senator Feinstein sat on the SAT on the letter\nAnd then a leaked that set it to the FBI after the initial um initial hearing that it was returned by the FBI to the judiciary committee's background investigation file where it was available to every senator on the Judiciary Committee\nSo much suspicion is that uh one of the one of the Democratic senators or their staff are the ones ultimately responsible for leaking\nThe letter or um this cat's a doctor forge warrior although she certainly didn't serve Dr Ford interest very well in the way she handled all of this but yeah we're going to we're going to get to the bottom of this ah I pick up they'll probably be an ethics committee\nInvestigation and my hope is the Judiciary Committee will get to the bottom of this because this is simply unacceptable and thank goodness we didn't reward this with a\nA success and killing the nomination of of cabinet or this would be the new normal\nYeah I I agree with you senator I I just think it's so important for the country going forward that names when we need to know names we need to know who did this and we need to know the extent of the a\nCollaboration with outside groups many of them funded by the political ... of the Republicans and how that coordination occurred that means people have to preserve their emails text messages I I just think you know getting involved the ethics an ethics investigation is fine\nBut there is nothing like an FBI investigation really trace what happened who did it and someone is lying someone dying here\nWell I guess what we need to do is identify the what are the jurisdiction of federal district whether a federal crime was committed here uh I'm I hadn't really thought that much about it but perhaps there isn't that would provide the hook for an FBI investigation and if there has been\nA federal crime committed I wholeheartedly support that investigation by the FBI\nOr Senator John Cornyn uh here in the lower income show senator uh for the next ah you know three and a half weeks on this is going to be a sprint to the finish for Republicans I have the sense that the Republican Party is more unified than it's been\nI don't know since when I mean it just it seems like all hands on deck\nPeople are working together they're not back biting each other as much I mean Jeff Flake is is not a fan of the presidents he wants a primary challenge but Marco Rubio said the president will win re election Nikki Haley saying she's going to campaign for the president twenty twenty\nOr what is your sense of the Republican unity right now\nA lot more optimistic that I've been in a long time law I mean the record of accomplishment with the Republican majorities in the house the Senate is pretty darn impressive I Know\nThe mainstream media doesn't cover a lot of the success that we've had here but really this focus on the judiciary and the fact that the Democratic candidates for the Senate are not going to support President Trump's nominees this has become the crucible and which I think a\nA has United all all Republicans and people all across the political spectrum from the center right uh uh to the right\nAnd so I'm I'm very optimistic but we just have to keep that energy up but the fact of the matter is people like John tester who didn't support either Gorsuch or a or an cabinets\nAnd just to have to keep that energy up but the fact of the matter is people like John tester who didn't support either Gorsuch or one cabinet or some of the other Democrats on the ballot Catskill McCaskill exactly on Missouri\nI'm did not support President Trump's nominees and that I think is going to be the issue that's going to pick up seats force in the mid term\nSenator your reaction to the Kanye West to parents in the oval office yesterday\n[noise] I just think it's hilarious that are that the mainstream media is hyperventilating over that uh we all know that President Obama had rappers and other celebrities in the oval office during his time\nBut there is a double standard as we all know uh for this president and I just thought it was a I thought it was pretty hilarious\nYeah I mean Michelle Obama invited that profane rapper common to the White House to read poetry his his his stuff is filled with every expletive on earth but he was up there reading poetry so and now and everything like that is great we're reaching out of it is wonderful it's authentic and Trump has is that near west in there\nYou have to admit Senator Cornyn truck makes things pretty pretty unconventional and in in kind of holds up a mirror to

rocks at a tree with no apples all so if\nThey're firing there's a reason they're firing the they've been given something shooter or they just leave you alone\n[noise] [noise] yeah well it's the great political influence that Kanye West obviously wields\nAnd builds on his cultural influence the guy is a big cultural influence or now you and I may not be listening to ... but their millions of people who are and young African American men who are watching them\nAnd that is in part it legitimize Donald Trump among that community\nAnd there are some in the political class that find that offensive that Kanye West would do this and that this phenomena is happening this is why Donald Trump in that recent Rasmussen poll was it thirty six percent\nAnd my bet if I had to do so today is if it's only going to go up thank you Randy for the call or let's go to Gerald in Florida I Know you've been holding Gerald you wanted to say\nThank you for having me\nIs it that's only going to go up that you're ready for the call or let's go to Gerald in Florida I Know you've been holding Gerald you wanted to say well\nThank you for having me I I Am a\nPatriotic American assertive which I Love my country and I know Kanye West is an American he loved his country I respect that I may not be a fan okay I'm not really a fan of Tanya west but he is an American and British him as a brother now what offends me is that lady's or whomever saying that\nThey tainted the White House I haven't I don't like to go back a few years or member when Obama had\nKnown terrorists in the White House but the media sure didn't claim that uh that was anything bad entertaining the White House\nYeah well there do the the assault on the White House that Stephanie rule mentioned will bring that up and a little bit when we come back um this is selective selective\nOr we saw a parade of celebrities say all sorts of horrible things and they were applauded not Kanye West says I Love this president that's a problem will get

entertainer and any American to get politically involved and raise your voice about the things that you were concerned about\nBecause you do something well\nLike you know building a building or we're painting or dancing or singing or acting because you might do that well doesn't mean you have any magical understanding of other\nAreas and disciplines of life including politics I've been covering politics for almost twenty five years I don't pretend to understand all of it\nI Know the machinations of the human side being in Washington on Capitol Hill at lobbyists offices watching how the sausage is made with legislation it's ugly so I\nDon't have blinders on when I talk about politics but I sometimes think my friends and I have friends in Hollywood writers and directors and producers and actors and singers\nI think they flipped through a newspaper or read a magazine article and because they know some politicos assume they have insider knowledge or understanding that dilutes the audience I Would argue they don't\nAnd sometimes there because they have a louder and larger platform their voices are heard more than others and that can obscure reality for them and for the people listening to them so with Kanye West here's what I say take it with a grain of easy salt\nListen watch it it was quite a show yesterday I got to say but I don't think no matter what you think of Kanye West I don't think it was an assault on the White House he sat at the resolute desk talking to Trump respectfully he yeah he used language that I wouldn't have used but\nThat that that's that's how people in in ... who talk it's how people in his line of business at all and the president didn't seem overtly disturbed by it\nSo you kind of let it roll you've got to roll with this and see where it goes but I think trying to write him off as a crazy person or\nUm you know or someone who's mentally disabled or or or or uh you know a ... save your slavery deny or that's not productive talk about

movement has also had many victories it's great that that accusers can come forward and tell their stories and if they're true the guy should be thrown in jail if there's statute of limitations not in place\nBut it is also unleashed a kind of toxicity between the sexes and the feeling that all men are predators and that all men should be somehow beaten into a corner and are asking girl to dance or

they're supporting cognac Jim Brown is a highly respected individual on the black community he is opinionated and outspoken\nAnd the fact that he supported a car gay add some very nice things to say about president after the meeting is something I think that is\nPerhaps as significant or even more significant that Conyers because of the impact of Jim Brown throughout not only the black community but the white community as well\n... well the ... yeah I agree I think that you know both of these figures represent in\nThe in the arena of sports as well as the music and and pop culture a these are two huge influence there's huge\nOr let's go to David Illinois why do you think everybody so up in arms and angry about this all meet and greet and\nWhite Raymond I I think the damage has gotten so

term your house slave you're negro who's not reading they sent him I mean this is it's so personal nasty end beside the point so you can't have a black person sit\nOn an IV equals footing at the

that's what the reaction would have been in the media but the moment someone makes another political decision for themselves and decides to talk to a Republican president in this case someone they

how hateful they are and how out of touch\nRatings are lower than the food network people\nIt also where a show exactly how hateful they are and how out of touch\nRatings are lower than the food network people like tiny are reaching an inch and\nTheir return angry about it and it's it's quite amazing\nYeah no that that there there is reality there there's truth there um I think you for the call but there there's no doubt I mean you look at the ratings CNN is just\nIt's tragic I mean it's really tragic and on big nights like during the cabinet battle and things that they were they were really hurting I mean in comparison to Fox Fox was having four six million people watching and CNN had half a million people\nVery interesting what's happening out there but again it's that runs been

Don Lemon point CNN was running the event live to just like everybody else they were desperate for every moment they were not going to miss Kanye West meeting with Donald Trump\nIt was a big moment it was a big moment\nSo to say take the cameras away spare me okay then you you go back to talking about you know the trade surplus in Indonesia on CNN International and we'll watch ratings continue to create or lower than they are no\nBut I you know I see I Want more cameras I Want to see more I Want to see the other side of crazy I Want to see the cameras on Capitol Hill and a lobbyist shaping our our our every bill and pushing legislation that the American people don't want let's see that\nYou went to public service let's show that crazy\nSee we we we hyped but we also hyper focus I think all things like this this is important to the African American vote as a bloc it's very important because a major influential are agents of influence in the middle of that community\nHas decided to come out and say you know what I think differently from what I'm supposed to think\nI'm going to right outside the lines here and that is dangerous talk\nDangerous strong but beneath that was something else there was a cultural critique about something happening in the black community about father listening about what it means to be a man and not only in the black community in the wider community as well thank you for that call um I Know I wanted to talked kept in Kansas now cat you're in the mid west\nOr the Roseanne show was originally designed to appeal to people like you and that is where the heart of\nThe viewership for that show came from and I think returned when it re booted some of the highest ratings of last year without Roseanne will you watch the Connors and why not\nFor you know I Will not I I Can't say that daughter ours um I like John Goodman and I don't mind her sister but I without Roseanne she was the center of the whole show without her that show is nothing\nAnd I felt bad for John ... just stand there I feel like he is kind of a whole life so there are I I Will I Will watch it basically because of how they pretty good throws in and they I I Can't stand ... daughter first\n[laughter] well I think you know John Goodman in in um interview said you know I think my character is going to spend most of the season moping around or you know feeling sorry because he lost his wife and I think that's probably right that look there's no reason for the show to go on without Roseanne that's the reality\nAround or you know feeling sorry because he lost his wife and I think that's probably right that look there's no reason for the show to go on without Roseanne that's the reality\nThe only reason is ABC was already out of pocket so they were either going to do some show would these people or they were just going to be right paychecks of these folks who go off and have a vacation\nBut they were on the hook so that's why the Conner says going forward but is it going to die you bet I think it'll be canceled after a few shows that's my prediction will see\nThank your cat for the call mark Florida you wanted to say what then we'll go to a break in a moment\n[noise] yeah right I mean if you recall back er during Katrina Tanya way turn in West spoke out against Trump or I'm Sorry against Bush and that a ... black people\nAnd the announcers amazing approximate and out that he's a ... for crop of a sudden now it's got a mental illness and so on believable\nNo no well this is the again that because as as one of the caller said earlier it's almost like stromboli in in ... when the puppet is doing what you want it to do yes yes this is great when the puppet cuts the strings then it's a problem\nLook I ... and this is why I'm not saying Kanye West is you know a a ... this is he's not Lincoln here let's not get ahead of ourselves\nI think there are people on the right who want to suddenly crown Kanye West is the leader of you know African Americans in in Republican circles well look to somebody like Clarence Thomas or a you know Walter Williams or somebody who really has a\nFull slashed philosophy\nOn politics and race that is informed impassioned and thoughtful I think that's where you look for that kind of leadership so let's not get ahead of our skis here an annoying Kanye West is somehow the sum total of a black conservative thought\nAnd I\nMy name is Taylor\nI've gotten a little ...\nPaying very now [noise]\nFamily got me how I learned how to live\nYou can find it odd to each other and in the army\nOr lean to make a lifetime from\nTo find on the\nOn the line [noise] W.

get them to look twice at the Republican Party\nEight five five forty or I Want to hear your reaction OK so cognac continues after he talks about the the fact that he didn't have a lot of it was basically saying you didn't have a real ... male role model at home and then he continued\nHillary everyone right but they have\nAnd make me feel that the guy that he didn't get to see my dad all the time like a guy\nWas there was something about when I put his hat off and make you feel like Superman made a Superman that was the favorite superhero [noise] and you made a Superman case for me\nSo [noise] Donald Trump or as someone who defied the odds to win the presidency that is what Kanye West is is referencing there I Believe like anything's possible in America\nThey all said you couldn't do it they all said you your campaign would flame out they said you would get trounced by Jeb Bush they said that ah the Hillary was then going to destroy you and it was going to be a member of the other productions that Trump would lose in a massive landslide you remember that I Do we played 'em every night and every day\nWell all of that was false and Trump became president and Kanye West I think as a man who you know he didn't have a lot of male role models Donald Trump has been a friend for a long time it doesn't mean Donald Trump gets everything right personally we know he hasn't none of us do\nBut I think that there was something profound and what he said there the ... the Hillary campaign slogan was I'm with her\nAnd for African American men they love their moms of course a lot of these women are heroic are trying to raise kids on their own it's not easy and but they he's saying and it's it's probably in today's day and age not politically correct but he doesn't care to I\nI wanted a male role model\nTo follow\nIn a ... someone who is going to bring male energy to the office of the presidency Hillary slogan didn't speak to him it's just his personal opinion\nI mean you can disagree with it you can say it's well it's kind of off off base Hillary was just really smart and she would have been a bit better president how we obviously no that's not true\nBut the do you notice that Don Lemon et cetera did not actually speak about any of the substance that Conyers brought up let's keep listening to Kanye West listening\nCan use the cloud of other need someone to help him if the guy's him and he's a hug more than anything calling you back away from the cameras\nDo get some help and then come back and make your case nobody if you want to be conservative if you want to support Donald Trump that is your business as you're doing it have some sense with it make sense educate yourself\nOh wait a second so Jay Z and Beyonce who were at the president's side and on speed dial I think they joke they're big policy experts\nAnd George Clooney because he testified before Congress he used to be all and end all and human rights and in Africa I mean I guess I woke up okay he knows more than all the diplomats and all the people have devoted their lives for this well I mean you could raise a question about that right but no one ever did\nThey never raised the question about any of these\nFolks and how about Miley Cyrus running\nAnd it's much more hate filled\nAbsolutely I think I mean the Democratic party that I used to know has gotten hijacked by people who disrupt hearings up uh normally mild mannered senators like Cory Booker proudly proclaim I'm breaking the rules by releasing confidential information during the hearing\nAnd then you see a senators being assaulted at airports run out of restaurants with their spouses and or just people being threatened and you know it wasn't a I think Steve ... police and Rand Paul can probably\nJustified to this best but you know at some point it it gets to the level of incitement we're not talking about free speech we're talking about inciting people to violence like Eric Holder did which is a dangerous and I don't think ah I don't think we ought to reward that at all\nNow and it seems to me that the more successful Senator Cornyn this administration is the more Congress unites with the president on issues such as this statement actually and United\nIt's almost like it's driving the last ... into a uncontrolled frenzy and they can't stand it the better America is doing they are there more and more angry\n[laughter] well as you know or the holy grail for the left as the Supreme Court and they can't stay on the idea that a President Trump has now Puerto two outstanding nominees to the Supreme Court as well as\nOur confirming a number a larger number probably the largest at this point the presidency I'm a court of appeals judges and a district judges and this is the driving them I think to a\nA too that there's a unattractive uh to say the least I'm sort of activism which frankly I mean do we want to turn the government over to these people after the midterm elections I don't think so\nThere was an interview with a colleague Ted Cruz's challenger the other day Beto O'Rourke about on the confirmation of Kevin I'm going to play it and get your reaction let's listen\nLet me get you on the record on on judge Kavanaugh would you voted\nTo confirm him I Would not have we the Supreme Court justice who believes in voting rights\nA justice who believes in a woman's right to make her own decision about her own body and have access to the health care than ensures that she can he fails the bar on each and every single one of those tests so the next justice to be nominated can only be confirmed\nIf she were importantly she can make those qualifications\nYour reaction to that well they do ah I Know ... to ...\nIf she were importantly she can make those qualifications\nYour reaction to that well they do ah I Know they do pretty well and he's a he's a he's a nice enough guy but clearly he's not running for the United States Senate from Texas I'm he's out of step with a with Texas\nValues and and this and every other important area my only suspicion laws he's running for the Democratic nomination for president twenty twenty because he's appealing to the national Democrats in the heart left uh who are who are ah we're seeing a create these the sort of a mob rule\nAnd then it or what is your best take right now on the Republicans in the mid terms mean you've heard ... are very confident that the Democrats are going to swamp the Republicans in the house and Senate but how does things really look we'll start with the crews see\nWell I think Ted's and that's in good shape the latest Quinnipiac poll shows him nine points up but as you know this is all about turnout we know the left as angry the people that are still angry that Trump won and twenty sixteen\nAnd mid term elections we usually see a down dip in turnout but uh I think the Kavanaugh hearings shove energized our our base and um we've seen people like governor ... in Tennessee said well he would have voted for a cabinet shop but I'm the truth is\nIf you let the Democrat this mid term then we're going to jeopardize our ability to conform more federal judges and a Chuck turn the send it over to Chuck Schumer and uh I just don't think ah ah the country is ready for that\nNo well I certainly I certainly hope not speaking and just back on account on an issue for a moment I devoted a lot of time on\nMy show senator to discussing what next when the president if the president gets another Supreme Court pack\nThe incentive to me seems to be still\nThere for that type of circus we saw\nFor Kavanaugh in namely there's no there's no repercussions for leaving a FBI report or or a or a letter or anything confidential that's not supposed to be public there are no repercussions so given the fact that there were no repercussions at least now there hasn't been yet\nDo you think it's appropriate for the president or would you recommend that the president authorizes an FBI investigation into how this information about Dr Ford ended up leaking out to the press [noise]\nWell I have a pretty good suspicion about how it leaked out to the press has you know after Senator Feinstein sat on the SAT on the letter and then leaked that set it to the FBI after the initial um initial hearing\nThan it was returned by the FBI to the judiciary committee's background investigation file where it was available to every senator on the Judiciary Committee\nSo much suspicion is that uh one of the one of the Democratic senators or their staff are the ones ultimately responsible for leaking\nThe letter or um ms cats or a doctor forge warrior although she certainly didn't serve Dr Ford interest very well in the way she handled all of this but yeah we're going to we're going to get to the bottom of this ah I pick up they'll probably be an ethics committee\nInvestigation and my hope is the Judiciary Committee will get to the bottom of this because this is simply unacceptable and thank goodness we didn't reward this with a\nA success and killing the nomination of of cabinet or this would be the new normal\nI I agree with you senator I I just think it's so important\nWas a a success and killing the nomination of of cabinet or this would be the new normal\nYeah I I agree with you senator I I just think it's so important for the country going forward\nThat names when we need to know names we need to know who did this and we need to know the extent of the a collaboration with outside groups many of them funded by the political ... of the Republicans\nAnd how that coordination occurred that means people have to preserve their emails and their tax messages I I just think you know getting involved the ethics you know an ethics investigation is fine\nBut there's nothing like an FBI investigation really trace what happened who did it and someone is lying someone dying here\n[noise] well I guess what we need to do is identify the what the jurisdiction of soldiers strict whether a federal crime was committed here a ... I hadn't really thought that much about it but perhaps there isn't that would provide the hook for an FBI investigation and if there has been\nA federal crime committed I wholeheartedly support that investigation by the FBI\nOr Senator John Cornyn uh here in the lower income show senator uh for the next ah you know three and a half weeks of this is going to be a sprint to the finish for Republicans I have the sense that the Republican Party\nIs more unified than it's been\nI don't know since when I mean it just it seems like all hands on deck people are working together they're not back biting each other as much in Jeff Flake is is not a fan of the president's he wants a primary challenge but Marco Rubio said the president will win reelection you haven't had Nikki Haley saying she's going to campaign for the president twenty twenty\nOr what is your sense of the Republican unity right now\nA lot more optimistic that I've been in a long time ... I mean the record of accomplishment with the Republican majorities in the house the Senate is pretty darned impressive I Know the mainstream media doesn't cover a lot of the success that we've had here but\nThis focus on the judiciary and the fact that the Democratic candidates for the Senate are not going to support President Trump's nominees this has become the crucible and which I think a\nA has United all all Republicans and people all across the political spectrum from the center right uh to the right and so I'm I'm very optimistic but we just have to keep that energy up but the fact of the matter is people like John tester who doesn't support either Gorsuch or\nOr cabinet or some of the other Democrats on the ballot ask Jill McCaskill exactly in Missouri\nI'm did not support President Trump's nominees and that I think is going to be the issue that's going to pick up seats force in the mid term\nSenator your reaction to the Kanye West to parents in the oval office yesterday\n[noise] I just think it's hilarious that are that the mainstream media is hyperventilating over that uh we all know that President Obama had rappers and other celebrities in the oval office during his time\nBut there is a double standard as we all know uh for this president and I just thought it was a I thought it was pretty hilarious\nYeah I mean Michelle Obama invited that profane rapper common to the White House to read poetry his his his stuff is filled with every expletive on earth but he was up there reading poetry so and no one ever think that's great we're reaching out with this wonderful it's authentic and meanwhile Trump as as I was in there\nYou have to admit Senator Cornyn truck makes things pretty pretty unconventional and in in kind of holds up a mirror to the Democrats\nYou have to admit Senator Cornyn truck makes things pretty pretty unconventional and in in kind of holds up a mirror to the Democrats does he not I\nCareer ended after I suffered my fifth concussion did you know that over a million athletes suffer concussion each year that includes boys and girls every age every time the level of sport\nIsn't always clear that employers had a concussion so parents athletes and coaches need to learn about concussion signs and symptoms the American Academy of neurology recommends athletes\nThought to have a concussion be immediately removed from place and not returning to assess to buy health care professional trained in concussion this isn't just about sports [noise] it's about your brain when in doubt sit it out [noise]\nLearn more at A.

and a feel of apple trees throwing rocks at a tree with no apples or so if they're firing there's a reason they're firing where they've been given something shooter or they're just leave you

... but their millions of people who are and young African American men who were watching him\nAnd that is in part it legitimize Donald Trump among that community and\nThere are some in the political class that find that offensive that Kanye West would do this and that this phenomena is happening this is why Donald Trump in that recent Rasmussen poll was it thirty six percent\nAnd my bet if I had

Capitol Hill at lobbyists offices watching how the sausages made with legislation it's ugly so\nDon't have blinders on when I talk about politics but I sometimes think my friends that I have friends in Hollywood writers and directors and producers and actors and singers\nI think they flipped through a newspaper or read a magazine article and because they know some politicos assume they have insider knowledge or understanding that dilutes the our audience I Would argue they don't\nAnd sometimes there because they have a louder and larger platform\nTheir voices are heard more than others and that can obscure reality for them and for the people listening to them so with Kanye West here's what I say take it with a grain of use these salt\nListen watch if it was quite a show yesterday I got to say but I don't think no matter what you think of ... I don't think it was an assault on the White House he sat at the resolute desk talking to Trump respectfully he yeah he used language that I wouldn't have used but\nThat that that's that's how people in in the who talk it's how people in his line of business law and the president didn't seem overtly disturbed by it\nSo you kind of let it roll you've got to rule with this and see where it goes but

I'm Sorry that's just what it means Charles so now we have all these issues rolling together and even some local municipalities in counties are saying look we don't have a place to put them so we're just going to let him back in the town the sad part is\nI Am more worried about your safety your family's safety your properties safety than I Am about that person's comfort or discomfort and the easiest way to stay out of\nJail is don't commit the crime\nWell Scott ... are you familiar with what's happening today about the the three murders in a gun or all of the grandmother the grandson in the night and and the guy got out on parole and nobody had watched you done anything about him and ... and ... and in a case of murdering these people and\nUh he said that she's going to look into it I was ... that's actually a person is saying that this individual and that's my point these people are going to get that guy says something is done early to prove it\nWell let me tell you one last thing before I let you go Charles I had somebody in law enforcement that I greatly respect and I was asking them about this\nThis urban legend and you've heard it before we have people in prison because they got caught with you know when one marijuana cigarette and send in prison in in this person said look I'm not saying that's never happened\nBut in the day and age that we live right now\nA huge number of these people that are that the left is advocating for that says well they got put in prison for a non violent so and so he said look\nWe know they robbed the store we know they shot the ... we you know and you don't know 'cause we're innocent until proven guilty but they got this long list of the stuff but the but the charge that was absolutely no way around it\nHe had a pocket full of drugs that's the one that we can make stick and that's\nThe one that sent him to prison he's a bad guy but but you got these people that they're going to well you know it was not about a fifth chances are\nThat person has a long history of other things they think he did but this one was the one you can be found guilty of easily\nAnd it bothers me that we've decided we're going to lead a bunch of these people out because it's going to make us feel good well if I could make these people stay in the legislature doors neighborhood instead of mine\nWell\nBecause it's going to make us feel good well if I can make these people stay in the legislate towards neighborhood instead of my neighborhood I'm good with it but that's not how it works Charles\nWell I I just I like it the checks and balances on seem like they're waiting for some reason\nThey're falling apart because we're losing her mind in common sense is not common like running\nA lot so yeah we gotta keep on rolling I got other stuff to want to talk to you about but at the moment you don't want to keep talking just wide open on friday let's do it gray welcome to the program\nMan I'm doing fantastic I Hope you are good\nI was watching last night at the Milan ... interview\nOr can I I Believe in nine o'clock what shows the question is how you see as our say is I may say you're not blaming it on a call ... asking her about a ... a fire and she she got on a plane that was signed\nOn the commercial advertiser something about it\nAnd that that's what's important that that's one of the reasons that folks have gotten to where they don't really pay attention to the news the fact that the code getting on the plane make the news the fact that she she wears make news the\nFact that when I started topping ... from the first thing that my computer search engine wants to talk about was that uh she wore clothes in Africa that resembled\nUm something the Nazi sympathizer Warren war in the first the Indiana Jones movie\nThat that is not news to me it's it's crazy so you're going to watch the interview or not\nI don't watch a record or something the other and so I can see and see what he wanted some by al ... I think it's just something like in the Trump about\nYou got it at the ... they can they can drive away thinking am Maloney a mad at the president or remind her she should be mad at the president or whatever they're going to do it I mean these are the same people that you know give their son a hard time reaching anybody\nYou got man thanks they the Louds used to be ... in cotton looking now their dollars\nAre and they're not always been string you know call Jane are called ... span\nAnd they're using these hurricanes and stuff they're going to start using them in war\nWould that be\nMore against us again I heard that on the other [laughter] well maybe I'll do the other night while you're a yeah thrown into the sasquatch and welcome to the program\nAnd we had another wild discussion today\nThis is a Jew education did you McCain ... I don't remember which one it is\nAnyway but I Do respect to one of my favorite color is Joe yet actually watch these people put these cameras trousers down and there are different from jak calm trails 'cause I've seen that too and and the ... about forty thousand fifty thousand feet these chemicals are much lower in our eyes and\nAnd they not only are doing it deliberately I've seen two or three planes in the horizon the same time Criss crossing each other putting that these long plumes that only grow and expand and take a blue sky into really hazy day and not only that sometimes it's a company with a uh\nA chemical smell but once I was trapped at in an editor breathe that longer than I wanted\nTo know you have seen ed ... you're you're telling me that this is absolutely through and you have seen it\nI've seen that more than one occasion 'cause one time I the first time I saw it I was actually listening to early morning Michael heart show okay in a caller called in to live in that same region I went outside and I watch them there's more than one planning that arise in at the same time\nAnd they're putting down low finder delivery making these patterns what's this stuff is uh people have said bury him an aluminum\nOr whether that's true or not it's not something I don't think I Want to breathe then\nUh they keep saying I Love and it was bad for you and everything and if there is mercury involved we definitely don't want to do that\nBut there's just there's why they're doing it I don't know but uh I've heard that they're trying to patch the ozone layer I've heard they're trying to give his Madison occupations\nAre vaccines against a flu viruses and stuff I've heard all sorts of theories pro and con on this is good for us just as bad for us and the truth\nThings against a flu viruses and stuff I've heard all sorts of theories pro and con on this is good for us just as bad for us and the truth is I don't know but the thing about it is what if it is good for us why are they doing it in secret and not telling us\nAnd if it's bad for us obviously there is not they're not going to tell us but as far as uh the marijuana situation I Know we've kind of laughed and make jokes about it but Joe is right about this I mean it it ... faster Jim level\nWhich I definitely would take it would affect your sperm count if you're a man ... and so and I think that that's something that will do that for a long time\nAnd by the way I I was a ... I was a pot head I mean I I was into a really strong for four and a half years\nNearly all of our listeners and we're into part I'm a little worried about myself when\nI'm One of these old corrupted baby boomers you know I got too many skills is in my closet and run for office I mean by skeletons would be real you know and I don't I think that like the label let's just say let them stay buried as long as they\nAre going away but like I said you know I run for office but are allowing my butt but Jesus Christ got a hold of held him all the ... holding my wife I kept my early twenties and change those desires but I I Will say this I don't want to put anybody in jail for marijuana but I Do think it might be a gateway to\nNot merely other drugs but to maintain the the cult that we're worried about the cult that connection\nThat's why big day ... other people I Know man I don't\nI don't know about sasquatch I'm more worried about what judge him from Marshall County testified to having been a part of exercises and then people that smoke pot or a festive with theme was much more concerned about and whether it leads to other drugs\nI got you appreciate it I got to go to Greg real quick you've been very patient Greg thank you for listening\nHey Scott I'm a first time caller but I've listened to the many many times thank you and I hope that you can continue on the air some way or another we're going to try and uh I've been listening to the conversations about a Kim trails you sir\nI don't know anything about them going on now days but uh it made me think about ah my grandfather fought in World War one in France\nAnd I guess you've seen or heard stories about the trenches that they do to protect themselves when the ... came a standoff in the Germans flew airplanes over those trenches jumping out poison gas on the soldiers\nYou know that was some of the first airplane so that was probably the first came trails of history probably\nAnd I just I just wanted to point that out because I think a lot of people don't know about it or have forgotten about it and uh it's something we should all remember\nYou got it things Greg appreciated you buddy thanks for listening yes are we going to take it will take a break early and they will get right back to your calls\nYou're listening to Scott these radio\nWe got to build a wall and everybody said oh that's

you were in the market for a new Honda you need to visit Honda and they only the best the best ... disease and the only Alabama Honda dealer president\nSatisfaction with restraint whether it's silver service Honda jasper's carry over Seventy five cars and they have to certify union\nIn fact she was three strikes you're whether they over service Honda jasper's top notch they carry over Seventy five

program everybody what other quick things that you want to know for the weekend Rand\nPaul was on Fox and friends I never saw this anywhere we talked about this over and over when the congressmen and senators were shot at the baseball field did you know that\nThe man who almost killed represented represented the skull the wounded for others was actually shouting this is for health care\nHow how did how did that not get out\n\nHe says I was there at the ball field was the ... almost died from a very very angry about a man who was inside it really about rhetoric on the left and this has been reporting enough when he came up on the ball field with these semi automatic weapon barring probably close to two hundred shots shooting by people almost killing Steve he was yelling this is for healthcare\nDidn't they decided they didn't know why he did it\nAnd that's why we wonder why people think the government will say or do or hide anything Danny welcome to the program\nAnd Scott I'm OK you could comment on is talking about the Sabbath earlier yes um\nThe the thing that convinced me I I'm a Christian I've been observing the seven states habits for Fifteen Years now okay\nThat'd be Saturday right so I understand ... ... okay\nAnd what convinced me is that the commandment says the seventh day is the Saturday at the lord\nSo if a if you if you believe in keeping at St commandments thing clearly the one that says remember the one that we've forgotten when it starts out with the war remember says what David Savage is and how you should keep it it's it's simple it's one of the tent\nI Wonder if we messed up gallon or somewhere maybe it's really on Thursday\nWe but we know Easter is the first day a week every year\nAnd it really but that'll rated ... but don't we just say Easter is East I'm I'm just being it's I'm just be an ornery now\nYeah I I don't know I've had people say that before but Sunday is always the first day it's always on Easter right Easter Sunday so the day before it's always a seventh day it's right Saturday\nAnd I guess I mean I guess the Jewish people probably were fairly good except for some of those years with all their pagan leaders and stuff it it remembering which day was actively the original seven day\n... yes the Saturday is football is hard to keep it wholly yeah you're on the Sunday to breathe a sigh of it [laughter] so that I don't go ...\nWe got an advantage though we have um a CBO weaker record everything in the ... you got it yeah yeah it's er watch layer a couple of other things um if you want it really gets conspiratorial you can go into a project blue being about the camp trails that's something they were talking about eliminating the good project\nBeam and that's I don't really believe in that stuff we'll see how it works out I really don't follow too much that stuff anymore but it was kind of interesting and one more thing\nTeam and that's I don't really believe in that stuff we'll see how it works out I really don't follow too much that stuff anymore but it was kind of interesting and one more thing about you being on the radio Scott appreciates it I can only hear you on Fridays which is
