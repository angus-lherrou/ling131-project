[laughter]\nSo here we are Russell's waiting on the computer\nTo get a you know up in a runner and uh for me to calm down well it's a while\nThat's happening again I'd take a moment to tell you that I I Want to set your mind at ease a little bit and I did this with Michael heart a little bit\nEarlier today um you know all the\nThe complaining people have had about the new space movie about Neal Armstrong first man the one with Ryan Gosling but Katie and [laughter] I don't believe in American and I don't remember where it began but there was concern that it wasn't nearly patriotic enough that in some way\nIt downplayed American commitment to beating the Russians\nTo the moon right yeah yeah I'm here to tell you that's fake news really I saw the movie last night and it's a driving factor in the movie that we've got to beat the Russians there\nNews really I saw the movie last night and it's a driving factor in the movie that we've got to beat the Russians their weapon or tails and the space race of the first into space of the first to orbit the earth this that and the other we've got to beat the Russians and we're going to do it by being the first one to the moon that is\nThe dialogue so that was heard in the movie\nYeah that layer cut absolutely so the guy from friday night lights I don't know his name but if you saw it on you but another guy yes I Do have these kind of like uh the guy I guess in charge of less playing out these missions let's figure out what we have to do\nYou've got parts of the JFK speech you were going to do this and we know it's hard but we are going to make it happen right now I'm paraphrasing but um\nYeah it was definitely a space race and we win and it's great there is some concern that there's there's not you don't see them plant the flag but there's a\nThe way they they follow the Neil Armstrong character in the movie Ryan Gosling playing him by the time at the end the movie you finally get there\nWhat you missed by following had one on one superstitious on Twitter or simply go to Facebook dot com and search for super station one on one government while you you\nYou can take us wherever you go through with a super station ... former radio on the Web on your phone rung of what the government at all the surveillance come your hometown garden seed superstitions one on one\nWho left the lights on in the studio\nProbably the folks doing a show of the\nLocal host Thirteen hours a day [noise] super station one oh one W. I. D.\n[noise]\n[noise] and getting\nThem back to the Ford faction Andrea ... for for brown this wonderful friday with Russell Peters across the way to help me out but first our\nAnd as um as we were coming in off the break I looked up at Fox News they're talking about the ... the murder but someone had them when they put in ... and I was like well I Hope no one's reading that on air cars that can that that can won't go well All right let's go to merge Jason and days on the line and\nLet's have them weigh in on do you have something to say about the first man movie a Murph\nAndrea and the wall um I have not seen the movie I'm not particularly interested in seeing it\nIs that because ... is a Canadian is that it\nNo I don't I I may wait for it to come on TV I don't okay [laughter] but um here's the thing though that the producer of the movie it's some big time left the global as type\nHe's got some French lady working for them then they get a Canadian to play the the hero of the story\nAnd so you have a whole bunch of I'm not going to say anti American folks here but definitely not pro American folks are trying to promote a movie about American exceptionalism\nAnd there's a lot of them do I need money backing it too from what I read\nTime at the movie but when you say that the the movies about American exceptionalism we understand\nThat the landing on the moon was that but that doesn't mean that the movie has to be that specifically may doesn't matter let's not forget they're actors they're paid\nTo pretend to be somewhat I don't need someone to come from the Neil Armstrong bloodline could be qualified to play him it's fine the guy play Superman is also English that he's not from now what I'm\nSaying Russell I like representing what you say [laughter]\nI what I'm saying is that in the promotion of the movie you have people that do not buy into American exceptionalism and and I would\nOf course they do and that's why they live here and work here of course they do they may not say it but they say what their actions yes they do that is why they're here\nThey're not going to say what their words now when when they set foot on the moon he said it was a giant leap for mankind and that was certainly the hope in the attention because the both the bullies behind the space race wasn't just American exceptionalism we're going into space\nAnd that was certainly the hope in the attention because the book the bully behind the space race wasn't just American exceptionalism we're going into space whole world's gonna be unified where do you think Star Trek came right idea that when we get into the space race we're all going to be one big happy peaceful\nA utopian earth and then we'll be the center point of the galaxy of the universe for all other aliens to come together but let's look at the reality of it is it hasn't happened like that it hasn't United the western world it was a ... point of tried for America\nThat we planted that flag on the moon so regardless of the intentions behind it being some world peace effort\nOr you know in a grander scheme of things it hasn't been that it is still a point of American exceptionalism nobody else has ever gone\nBack I Know in the movie it's protected that way in the movie is portrayed as American exceptionalism all I'm saying is when they were making the movie\nThat didn't have to be their only point of storytelling that is woven throughout the movie at no point is it may not to simply be a human accomplishment the dialogue in the movie is we've got to beat the Russians like five times they keep saying that\nI'm going to put myself in is a peacemaker here between Russell and Murphy and just say if you want to see the movie ... based on the plotline eat is pro American yeah don't want to see the movie based on who's a directing it producing it paying for it all that because you don't feel that they're\nBuying into American exceptionalism than exceptionalism then I guess you can with ... hey thanks for for the call appreciate it All right we're going to go over to Jason see what he has to say how are you going to go see first man\nOh no it's not it's not a form of protest it's more or less and I just I just really don't go watch a lot of movie yeah but I'm not here I listen to Russell puppy\nTo opt in and saying so many things in a row so I figured I think you're the nicest guy who was a closet liberal I think the biggest hoax ever played on superstation little one is it Russell is going to come out of the ...\nWell you know we all even hadn't have [laughter] you know they're about to have another opposing opinions so we\nWere not but I did have a I had a federal funny anecdote about the flag on them and I used to work in the oil fields and I traveled a lot\nAnd I worked with a lot of uh a nice nations and different nationalities as it during that line of work and one of the things that are caught so much crap about about from America and how do you guys not use the metric system they just never\nNever let up and so I got to the point where would I Would go on these trips I Would take things with me\nTo kind of a passive aggressively or women's arguments for instance I bought a shirt that said that about World War champs America\n[laughter] oh [laughter] what are the one of the\nThings that I just got so sick of about the you know what are you what do you what are you guys speaking without using the metric system I used to just say hey whose flag is on the moon\n[laughter] would always just starts you shut up all that crap [laughter] and now we got there without using\nThe metric jaded and ... and I I don't think I'm a closet liberal but maybe I'm a closet global if because I Do think we should move to the metric system it just makes a lot more about that\nRussell pie uses the metric system I bet your caller ... kilometers\nA you know you have to see the next two hours that you know we we count that way you're going down to ten and then a hundred and ten times more than a thousand attempts our brains work that way the fact that we don't\nUse the metric system to me is American arrogance it's a simpler\nSystem but it's also not ...\nBrains work that way the fact that we don't use the metric system to me is American arrogance it's a simpler system\nBut it's also not worth the retro activity that would take place to convert over not worried about\nThe rest of the world does this was this was this was absolutely true this is another one racial throwing their first and they speak English you can use the metric all you want to but when you buy tires because what you buy those in\nIs that right even around the world I didn't know that this is another thing a lot lot every part of the world but a large part of the world but not use the millimeter socket but they're telling them that sock it with a three inch Dr rhetoric [laughter] go go go straight for taking my name's\nJason I appreciate it and you know what I'm okay with is not going to the metric simply because I have a little streak and me that doesn't like to conform when everybody's going that same route and I it's not it doesn't appear all the time but there are certain things and this is a case where people are always\nTrying to persuade you and it makes sense and and even have a little snooty attitude about it and that makes me my me bristle and\nI I I can lean on the nonconformist in okay I don't feel the need to conform but if you were to lay them out which is the simpler one oh\nI agree it makes total sense so why don't I don't know why I don't want to purpose going to use the more difficult ... why would I Do that because America is coming to the ball game with the ball and they were coming to the ball game with a ball we set the rules and we're not going to metric that there have been out fairly guy you there Dave\n... gas or a seasonal job was was the uh the the head a engineer over the slums for they they were the laws that built the fastest or most stealth aircraft on her\nIn the Nineteen fifties wow you're Seventy years ago that said oh\nYeah and he had a big part in in the space program all these guys you got to remember these guys were were most of ... these guys were aircraft all they had the biggest bullets coming at them\nOr war too so that we are tough as nails um there was a a an extra say that came out about ten years ago there was some of the engineers that they fired and and the only real lead up to this\nThe Russians would would lie about stuff that you can't get when you have a totalitarian rule a country like they had\nYeah um and I think that'd be capitalism now by the way of that it would ah if nobody will work for you know your your dictator man they're trying to get out of work for you and um but that would roll out a shell of an aircraft so this is faster and what you got\nIt won't even in even in it right I mean it was pathetic and a propaganda yeah now this is\nA way we had projected uh what was it Nineteen sixty dollars I'll be the first one was the the lander nothing was working a lot and some of the mayor said we're not a lot about this that is said and I did a film actually that was like an hour photo Graham and came home\nClinton's eight I Can't believe I'm bringing her back into the news this is grace you gonna run and twenty twenty is what this guy's talent it raises my blood pressure just looking at a picture of her but apparently he's just he's saying what so what is the age of saying we don't know that she'll come back and run twenty twenty but it's a shame that nobody's even thinking about\nYes he is he seems a little irritated that no one is mentioning her as a possible oh candidate all he his girl he's saying it's not he doesn't necessarily think she will run but it's not a done deal that she won't run\nAnd they point out that uh you know plenty of other some some of the reasons that she wouldn't run is she's already run she already has um competed twice before and last but so have Joe Biden and a good chance that he's going to run again\nSo simple because she's lost before should not disqualify her according to the uh the eight and then also her\nAge where she is old is she is not as old as Bernie Sanders and she's not as old as Joe Biden's used a year younger than\nTrump if I remember the story yet Iraq clearly and so the thought is hey don't be so quick to dismiss her she did win the popular vote that she did have support two years ago who knows if their support will be there two years from now but ah Felipe I think is a guy says\nPhilippe ... Filippo reign\nHe's saying you know John Glen don't give up on on Hillary just yet so wouldn't that be funny if we get Trump Hillary round two\nOh yeah really you know what again I have to say Philippe Reines along with Elizabeth Warren are completely completely over estimating the situation we've got two weeks ago\nYeah for um the ...\nAnd with Elizabeth Warren are completely completely over estimating the situation we've got two weeks ago yeah for um the midterms and you want to throw out the idea of Hillary coming back into the scene I don't think any [laughter]\nMore Republicans were riled up an out to the polls to make sure\nThat there is a Republican Congress Senate and house yeah if just to secure Trump and give him the uh go ahead to continue with his agenda because uh the thought of Hillary reentering\nOh my I mean I Know we're two and a half weeks away from the mid term but we're really three weeks away from the next presidential cycle\nThe moment the midterms are over we're going to start hearing from Democrats who are going to run and it's going to be a bloodbath trying to win that nomination to be in their mind but Trump killer But Trump's lawyer yeah in twenty twenty\nAnd so I mean we're basically a month away from it all beginning a new\nAnd you may have vitamin you may have burned you may have Hillary you may have\n... Harris and a Cory Booker\nAll that to you know all that just that just reminds me once again I was going to talk about this after you leave\nHow important it is that we do get out and vote because the only way to to tamp down on these Democrats and their maniacal obsession with power and the fact that they will like you said one week after the election be all claws out all hands on deck um\nThey're going to be motivated because everybody else and the only way to go down as for them to lose rights are like we need to um I hate to say this this sounds on Christian we need to crush their spirit [laughter]\nDo they need a come up in the New York to be brought down to the lowest level right humbled and in humbled and defeat because right now they they keep thinking Trump's an anomaly yeah they keep thinking\nThat he's a cork that needs to be corrected and the only way to correct it is for us to us as ... the Democrats to threaten you to that if you don't put them in office um they're going to come they're not going to go way\nSure and I don't think anyone knows exactly how this election is going to play out but we're getting close to and a half weeks ago news as it is there still could be another big news story or to between now and then but Democrats they want the house they had hopes on the Senate the likelihood of that is pretty slim I think at this point based on some projections\nBut who knows I guess anything could happen\nI think I think you're right I think that some where the statistics are showing that the Senate is is good because all of a sudden I've noticed in the news all this and they're talking about the house right before it was all about the Senate sure and it's like ... what have you been told\nOf a sudden you got to shift in pivot and go for the house hey speaking of Hillary in her again or at least for aid tried to throw her name back into the mix apparently the New York times isn't even happy about this so apparently the grey lady is going after the grey lady [laughter]\nWant her to go away yeah so you apparently the editorial board um has said that the broadly unpopular Hillary Clinton might want to stay out of the crucial midterms\nBecause she has the risk of firing up the GOP based see your point yeah yes so they already see that she comes back in she shows or face people get scared and panicked and concerned you know and they say I Can't let this happen again\n\nAnd and panicked and concerned you know and they say I Can't let this happen again [laughter]\nSo hey whatever it takes I mean I I Would hope that people would be voting to continue that Trump's agenda but if a little fear ways in and get you there faster so be\nIt now what do you make of some on the left will use a Joe Scarborough over a long time was a Republican I guess he had done it by now as an independent but he has no fan of Trump was for a while\nA performer led up again feelings hurt either gotta feeling her girlfriends and his uh his sweet lady that as well but he he was out he said this on a show on MORNING Joe but he was on Kobe on CBS this week saying that he doesn't think\nThat Trump is going to run for reelection and twenty twenty he thinks he's going to kind of cash in cash out I did my thing I gave you a term I'm Out\nDo you think that's a possibility of Trump not seeking reelection\nOh no [laughter] no Joe Scarborough is just he wants to remain relevant and somehow so we've got to throw out an oddball theory yeah and see the sticks right just last night Trump all that money in Montana and he's already referring to twenty twenty you're a neat\nTalking about what you're going to do and how he's gonna you know\nGo back and you know run for reelection so I don't see\nThat the hat I Want to have or one of the the slogan is make America great again again [laughter] neither have\nI don't know when they're going to switch to this other one keep America great because magma has really caught on and I don't think you can slow it down right I really don't think they're just going to have to keep it up because keg\nThat doesn't go to work at all [noise] All right we got to take a break you're listening to the

down at the bottom\nAnd along that those that southern most border\nOr it shares a border with Guatemala and I believe they'll Salvador I don't have a map in front of me but uh several Central American\nCountries they've chosen to go through Guatemala at the checkpoints there and it is chaos and I see them now moving it looks like I see the word image ... known and Spanish which means immigration it looks like a little um checkpoint little\nA kiosk and they're all marching around it so apparently they are moving into Mexico as we speak I don't know what's gonna happen here because as you know President Trump has called on the Mexican president to put a stop to them even entering Mexico\nSo that they don't get anywhere near the U.S border and the reason why is because Trump knows that if they make it on to us land according to our own\nRidiculous immigration laws they can't be turned away and they'll claim asylum and then they get a\nThey get a slap on the wrist or they get a court date and they're told to come back to that court date in the meantime\nThey're letting loose into the United states where they begin to filter through to all the points where they know they can um access whatever they need to survive be it\nFake IDs be it welfare checks be at jobs um on on the black market because they're not legal\nWhatever it is that they do when they get in here in the United states so it's actually a very scary thing is what we're watching right now or is about four thousand people trying to stage an invasion\nAnd it's an invasion that appears\nHarmless in a sense in that they don't have weapons\nThey're carrying bags and even some of them have on a bunch of red hats and I don't know that they're ... but there it's very American looking um they have on backpacks there's kids mostly men though I noticed there are some women and children as I watch this and then and there just walking slowly so you know ...\nWhat are you going to do you can't mow them over\nBut at the same time they're not turning around and going back to the automobile so this is going to be an interesting show down to say the least uh how you turned back a wave of four thousand people on a road without getting forceful\nAnd run the risk of appearing\nHarsh and violent I don't know it's a good thing it's up to Mexico right now\nA Trump has said that he will send\nThe military to the Texas Mexico U.S Mexico border if need be\nDepending on where these people decided to try and cross so that's what's happening right now and um I almost can't believe my eyes a that was on Fox News if you want to be part of the show and weigh in on this whole thing or you can at nine four one one zero one one or toll free eight six six\nI had Joe on the line we've been talking about these these caravans in Central America that have reached the Guatemala and Mexico border and our it appears to be pushing their way through slowly but surely just because there are four thousand of them and there's only so many\nOfficers there and unless they're willing to bring in tanks and brigades and blocks that you know trucks to block it and everything I'm it looks like they're making it through so which means they're going to go through Mexico I don't know what the hell is going to play out this is going to be interesting and we also talked about the fact that even Trump alluded\nTo what caused this whole thing to ramp up at this point in time and he suggested that there's other elements at work behind the scenes\nShores are um other people working to organize this get to people in a large enough mob that it's very hard to disrupt\nAnd this is clearly nothing but\nA tactic along the lines of what liberals do uh I have yet to see Republican I'm I'm not saying Republicans are as pure the wind driven snow in angels with halo but you don't see Republicans out there organizing mobbed and causing this but you do we know for a fact that\nAre elements out their George Soros even Iraq Obama behind the scenes with his community organizing group I don't know the name of it but they they organized\nSoros even Iraq Obama behind the scenes with his community organizing group I don't know the name of it but they they organized people at the least to cause these protests in Washington and abroad um\nAnd and at worst they pay him we know Soros is paying and let's see what you have to say about this whole thing Joe are you there\nHey glad to have you on a\nPer shut your show always appreciate you are your views and stuff on it so like listen to the um [noise] yeah that no is it I've got to say exactly what you said I mean I this obviously started with during the Obama administration and we know George Soros was involved in that\nUm and I think it's no different I personally think\nThey're the reason you made the comment that it seems to be the majority of man and and that doesn't surprise me I think they're going to push this thing\nBy force um that's my opinion and it seems to indicate that that's starting to happen anyway and the fact that they're getting through our at least some of them are my guess is probably going to break up some of the\nPeople that are quote unquote a while for the ride a but uh you know there there's not that I really can't see this thing going ah being stopped without force\nYeah you know Joe as you're talking to me this whole thing's kind of crystallizing in my mind that this is two weeks out from the mid term election this is all planned\nBy the time they get through Mexico because they're on foot they're walking it takes time by the time they get from the southern border of Mexico to the U.S Mexico border it is right around the time that people are voting and what they're looking for I have no doubt in my mind if they want they want violent\nConflict on the media on the news\nEvery night leading up to the time that people vote and they want to make it look like the military is out to destroy men and women\nWho are seeking shelter from violence in poverty and it it just coming before me as I sit here\nYeah no absolutely not only that\nHow many what percentage based on the figures you gave us earlier are ISIS who are definitely going to be forceful ah you know because they have the cover of\nA innocent or not and I'm Carrying non weapon carrying a people right uh so uh yeah they're going to be they're going to be the\nPeople back during the election sue war of the black mask ah although there won't be wearing a black mask and were you know\nDoing things beating people up shooting a young girl I remember with a tear gas\nYeah and that\nShot a guy a so so that that's my opinion what's what what they're going for a and it just I I mean it it's sick is may\n... I I'm angry really sick and you know because it's not something that I can individually do something about and\nAnd and you've got to be diplomatic about the way you do it but the way the Democrats are tri ... I've always felt they were a lot she still and even in some cases kill right to get there like a bunch of wind babies who are so we're losers I mean look look it from the\nTrump or in in the end\nIs there like a bunch of why babies who are so world losers I mean look look it from the top of it and you know in the in the beginning when the uh rallies were going on they were they're starting fights there I just spoke of\nAnd and it goes on and on with Kavanaugh from there to have it on all points in between of their uh antenna four and a black lives matter all those things are pushing vowing they're pushing 'em\n... real rebellion and and even revolution in the ... the word right ah upon upon our society and our free nation then just a just angers me to know yeah\nIt absolutely is a very frustrating to watch Joe because you're right they act as like the they had the same level of outrage\nAnd I'm a retaliatory rage that a pimple or a drug dealer gets when you when you impose on their turf I mean there's no did that and so there's like how dare you\nDiscuss in twenty sixteen we're not going away quietly and we're going to cause a ... a everyday leading up to this election um it you're right it is you just come down to mobs versus jobs is that the most truest slogan\nOut there for this upcoming midterm elections that could ever possibly put out their back in twenty sixteen it was drain the swamp it that kind of emerged organically through Trump and all of his rallies and he was ... it was a rallying cry I think\nFor Republicans and independents and now it's mobs versus jobs we're seeing it there is a mob in Mexico\nAnd they're headed our way thanks for the call Joe I appreciate it let's go to Dorothy Hi Dorothy welcome to the foreign faction\nHigh um yeah this is so [noise] you know where it's sort of I mean I hear it keeps growing like you know people are just\nMillion and adding themselves I possibly ISIS people like you brought up about I Know well that's not going to talk about a lot you know you won't hear about it our son's them ah you know a quiet little station on your somewhere you\nInto like what you guys are doing or a ... it's\nI I don't know I hear that's going to get some military down there out you know we we can do what we have to do to keep people out we should be able to use all means possible I don't care care gas and water cannons rubber bullets wasn't allowed to step foot over here\nIf people are making us sectors are either it's a strange ... an ounce bottles that disease\nRight that we are like oh yeah yeah polio live virus killing ... yeah and that's\nYou know when when we have to go somewhere in travel we have to get shots you know like uh you you got us some you know island country uh overseas uh Europe\nDon't you have to have shots to keep yourself well from whatever their diseases are they don't want to get your you have to make sure you has their shots right foot people over here you know it just yeah come on you know and like I say\nYeah they're they're they're not just the whole world leaders everybody wants to come here\nA lot of factors on I'm dangerous factors involved in this whole mob scene it's moving towards our border you you brought up the health issue yes there's a lot of things going on that have been reintroduced into the United states uh we we don't hear a whole lot about from the CDC other than um you know that story you mentioned about the polio like\nA virus or illness or the CDC said it's affecting a hundreds of kids in twenty two seats but they would not release the names of the state and I'm fine\nOh the CDC said it's affecting a hundreds of kids in twenty two states but they would not release the names of the state and I find that interesting\nWhy that why normally you release the names of the state so people can be warned it I could put it in a newscast in if something's happening in Alabama like salmonella poisoning or whatever else going on you know it's probably California for short and all these other border states and its you know ones that have have welcomed\nUm illegal immigrants it would be interesting to find that connection if we ever got the list of the state's thanks for the cold or the appreciate it um\nYeah we're about to head to the bottom of the hour so in the meantime yeah we've got this mob moving its way through Mexico they seem to be a good gaining ground or at least making it through the checkpoints\nAs Dorothy and the caller before I think Joe said ISIS can easily infiltrate in fact they don't even have to join the crowd they don't even have to be part of the moving mob\nThey'd just as long as they wait until the mob gets to the border of the U.S and the ... in Mexico\nOr whatever happens there is not going to be pretty\nWhen the military has to push them back it's not going to be pretty and as with any criminal you always use a distraction to your benefit so while whatever's happening at in the ... in Texas is going on at the checkpoint there that I can bet you they're going to be you know fifty miles away and another border crossing\n... we know that the press is more than willing to try and craft the image try to craft that weaponized headline that we know they're really good at\nThey love to weaponize that headline and make it look like horrible things are happening in Trump's behind it all and it's nothing makes them happier than to try and do this\nDays and weeks ahead of the November election so I guess for the next couple of hours that I Am here we're going to talk about different stories but the the bottom line is going to come to the same message at the bottom line is don't fall for it you're being played and make sure you go and vote\nAnd get your friends and your families and everybody else who's\nAware of the facts and willing to act on them to go vote as well but do not fall for this phony emotional propaganda that is being pushed out there is nothing\nLess than what happened in Alabama when we were we had the ruined more special election and outside forces came in and and tried to disrupt it there and cause all sorts of grief and we now have Doug Jones in the Senate who by the way didn't vote for Kavanaugh and regardless of the facts or\nActually wouldn't even know meet with Kavanaugh so he just\nWasn't even going to consider it\nWe have a guy now representing Alabama who won't even give consideration to what\nThe president is proposing even though Alabama voted President Trump into the White House so I Would think as a representative that's the least that you can do and still be able to say you're doing your job\nAnd if you can't do that then you're not doing your job and the countdown continues on that old story\nYou want to be part of the ... the show then I'm feel free to call in nine four one one zero one one eight six six five five one nine nine three three is the toll free number and you can share your thoughts on all of this um by the way the whole\nCabinet I one of the things that was very clear about the whole cabinet situation was that they were hoping hoping it was a it was a Hail Mary I Know that they were hoping the Democrats in the Senate\nDianne Feinstein and all the other people that were playing into that Chuck Schumer for sure we're all hoping that this Kevin uh issue would be delayed more into the upcoming elections and if they could play it um they would and if they could stretch it out they would\nIf they could actually do the rail it that was the ultimate goal believe me they wanted that to be derailed because they knew it would have a huge huge morale affect on Republicans if Trump\nCouldn't get his Supreme Court nominee through so this you know that\nThey that was the whole kitten caboodle that they wanted that would that would have been the the ultimate dream and they know you know if they failed but hey they'll take whatever scraps they can so if they can at least scratch out a delay and make Kavanaugh look\nTaint Tim taint his image taint the appearance paint taint his record then they'll do that\nAnd if they can't uh derail him and cause him to withdraw because of the vicious\nPaint taint his record then they'll do that and if they can't uh derail him and cause him to withdraw because of the vicious attacks they've made on him his his wife has children and all the people associated with them\nThen they'll just settle for a putting it out there that he's a rapist or at least implying and putting it out there that the me too movement has just been set back\nYou know and uh women now have have had the delta blow it'll settle for anything they can\nFor them to be in control and and help you help being the\nThe questionable word help you interpret it the correct way the way they want you to see it and I'm\nSo that didn't work and I believe that what's happening now I'm Down in Guatemala and Mexico is another round of the exact same thing a slightly different form you know same song different verse let's cause chaos\nLet's see if we can get this to time out just before people are going to vote let's see if we can get a big enough mob that a a riot ensues at the U.S Mexico border\nOh when we even love it if the U.S border patrol uses tear gas or water cannons cars will will be there with our cameras to make sure that we catch a little two year old getting blasted with water even if we have to do the blessing ourselves hey well whatever it takes\nWe're going to make sure we've got that that photo op to make everybody mad and to make everybody convinced that ... ... these are the true colors of Trump are coming out now he's out for the kids\nHe's out for war he's out for violence never mind don't ever fall for this never mind what has taken place in the weeks leading up to this election okay I'm just here to remind you this is my service to you for the next few ... a little while\nAnd this is my service to you I'm just going to remind you that um several ... congressional\nSenators congressmen and candidates have been threatened some of the even been attacked I think it was in North Dakota I don't have that story in front of me or I Do know that as of today in New York they've arrested a man who threatened to assault and killed\nTwo senators they would not release the names of those senators I'm Glad that's fine they don't have to do that\nI be interesting to find out the name of the guy\nAnd where what his story is and where he's been for the past couple of months at have you been in Washington DC clogging up the doors of the Supreme Court I wouldn't surprise me if that's the case\nSo we there's been a of a lot of violence we've got moms in DC clawing at the Supreme Court doors we've got antifa in Portland, Oregon causing all sorts of\nHaving their most recently we've got threats we've got a congressional members like Maxine Waters are pushing for this idea that you got to not let them eat in peace we've got people getting disrupted during their dining experience\nUh that's the that's the minimum\nAnd and now you know we've we have a ... you know Rand Paul's wife sleeping with a a gun by your bed because of all the stuff that's happened to her husband\nNow remember Rand Paul had his ribs broken by his neighbor but he was also shot at on a baseball field and and don't let me let you forget this that just didn't that happen just a little while ago Steve ... was\nAlmost killed and two of Alabama's ... congressional members mo Brooks and Gary Palmer\nSteve ... was\nAlmost killed and two of Alabama's come congressional members mo Brooks and Gary Palmer were on that field as well\nSo again I'm coming back to the slogan\nUm that we're going to be chanting all the way to the polls it's mobbed versus job and they said that that's different we're going to take a break love for you to join the show\nOr you can call and be a part of it nine four one one zero one one eight six six five

me\nHey she got to hold you to your word I bet you made a prominent I'm sure\nI I I did but I have been so busy I really have we but but\nWe didn't have enough our what we had to ... we had to break up chairs and pull up linoleum from the floor in order to have five ...\n... you had to break up the furniture in the house\nYet or used to ... chair we had to break up the war chairs\nAnd to ... from the floor in order to make a fire\nTo keep more All right there that support that I certainly don't know and probably a great many people that are listening to this can't even relate to 'em you said something about going next door to use your your neighbor of water or did your neighbors have an open door for this I mean did they understand that kind of poor what they equally as poor or they just open their Web\nAt baggage and it'll tell you what back in ... you could always go back next door to a neighboring ghetto a cup of sugar a cup of flour were\nSo if you will water or if you are the sugar back in the day that I grew up in you could do that and they didn't think nothing of ... and they didn't mind sharing that when I came up they would share they would share well\nI grew up in you could do that and they didn't think nothing out at the end and they didn't mind sharing that when I came up they would share\nThey would share well let me let me ask you this could you talk about another thing or in the book and and I want to say something here when you when you first start talking about this you were talking about the pain and the shame what was that Shane\nShane was when I was at school I didn't have enough food to eat so the key is made fun of me and he laughed at me because when I walked\nIn the lunchroom\nThey would look at me and smiled because I didn't have any money to even buy my own food\nThat's that that's something there and ... and speaking about that I I Want to say this because this is a really heavy topic uh during these times because when you were actually experiencing was bully you yes hey did you are perceived as being bullying even back then are these are just mean kids\nBack in time that I came in ... it wasn't called ... and you really do think of it as it is kids just being me just give me me because now they call it bubbling but it would just mean kids back into time I came\nMhm mhm and I'm I'm going to sit there for just one minute because you know to day you've got bullying and you and as a result of that building and social media of course you've got kids doing things like\nUm committing suicide or being under that kind of pressure where they're always trying to fit in making a difference wouldn't want to make a name for themselves you know wouldn't want to be falling in with the crowd this this popular or whatever\nHow does a kid growing up when you did so by that kind of pressure did you ignore it\nDidn't you did you did you meet back what you know to\nSee she read a as a young child my mom taught us about prayer\nShe taught us about Jesus\nAnd then my book if you will by\nYou wouldn't know that my mom taught us all about prayer and all about Jesus and we knew all about it so we knew we didn't fight back with fish and bus well we'd be we prayed and God blessed us\nAnd and he did and that's the thing about this book it's I was going through this book it I Love I Love a story like this because every time you talk about it yesterday or something that you went through\nYou talk about how God brought you through it yeah it relates to scripture maybe or is not you know you don't go to a whole book and then you talk about God guy carried to even through this book\nOr someone to talk about um you know when people buy this book um what is it that you want them to get out of it\nYou know what what part what part of this book do you think is probably going to have the most impact on them\nI Would like to tell a young person and my my book is can relate to young people and old people should read\nIt will take you back to where you are and where you want to go now young kid have goals they're in college now and they have goals to where they really want to go and what and what they want to achieve what they really want to be\nBut one thing I Would like to tell them this year reader you can't do anything not unless you have God in your life okay fees and you can count the number one then you'll be able to achieve anything you want to do anything that you want to\nIn your life okay fees and you can count the number one\nThen you'll be able to achieve anything you want to do anything that you want to\nDo yet and they have to keep that top of mind all the time all that match that\nThat have that mindset you know and and Joe talked about this earlier about when he wrote this book and and you know that sort of inspired you to ... to write your own books yet when he wrote that book and you were going through it or that chapter ah the he wrote and you were reading it what was it about that chapter that made you say you know what\nI'm gonna tell my story\nThe reason why they gave me the idea to write the book with Joe invited his dad and I to come to his book opening\nI got home that night and read the book but the thing to inspire me the most when you start talking about radio ... he said I came to my mom and my dad\nAnd he said I told them what I Want to do he said but my mom told me San you could do anything you want to do and he said from day you know he went on through and he made\nBut in a spat me because I'm saying like\nIf he can do it mhm uh sixty seven year old lady I feel like I can do it to you could do it too oh yeah\nYeah and I and I love that because um you know Joe being being grown Joe okay he obviously learned some lessons as Joe yeah and I what I'm saying so a lot of times we don't see that until they get to be a be an adult but in that chapter to me mhm both you and pop a lock it would very apparent\nThrough those lessons to Utah to him and I think that this book or the like you say young and old yeah learn something from his book up I Want and I want to talk about the book process to because I think that everybody has a story in them\nYeah okay and I know as a young person my cousin I always talk about if we can write a book when you can read book\nOkay and everybody's got a story tell so tell me about that process can do\nIt right in a book I have learned in my time in writing a book you have you have to put yourself in it spiritual why\nIt's already in your head when you write in the book only thing you're doing is just putting you know they just put it on pay you already have it in your mind mhm what you want to write about\nBut you really you are with nailing it to the world when you're putting it down on the paper\n[noise] do you have any reservations about that because you know I ... I remember the first one of the first books that I was a\nCoauthor on my my chapter just happened to be about depression and thoughts of suicide and so when I decided to write that I wrote the whole chapter I came up with I just wrote it probably about about Fifteen twenty minutes and then I'll pull bad because I was like\nOh my God do I want people to know this spot me so some of the stuff that you talk\nAbout it here being poor you know going to school being bullied a your sickness did you have any reservations about rebuilding that people\nKnow ... I did not simply because I rode it outlawed it the world to know do never forget where you come from ... and I'm not ashamed because I was poor but I wasn't the only one being poor my sisters and brothers\nFrom ... and I'm not ashamed because I was poor but I wasn't the only one being for my sisters and brothers was poor alone with me mhm and God have brought our last through to where we are today\nSo I don't have anything I'm Lynn every any anybody know to date and its listening at me you can be poor but you don't have to stay there you don't have to stay there\nGod can bring you from Paul to the richer but you got to ... and you got to God that he is doing and now you're not doing this on your own\nWhich ain't got to stay there and you ain't got the ... [laughter]\nGot to walk because he'll pick you up I don't care how far you fall into that show right he will pull you up and he will shake you off and he'll turn you around and not what are you all about that won't be doing what he'll do you do it every\nIn church and you do it every time I Know that I don't know I'm ...\nI'm a witness you'll do it I don't care how far you go had darkest thing I don't care what situation un\nI don't care if you feel like you want to commit suicide by God and I as a living God he will bring you don't\nAnd I've been struck just grab the personal but we don't talk about the judge Joe luggage oh we got married in a house and some God is the wrong way to tell her why lawyer on the way back he goes up from a studio goes for the ...

Mr Brooklyn where it was the team he used to play or and you know they say a point guard extensions of the of the coach on the floor\nAnd he was able to do leave the nest the play offs and the bone in Milwaukee and make things happen I make a comparison the President Trump's the only difference is\nUm the the nets went to the playoffs we're still figuring out what President Trump is going um and and leadership is the difference you know you have to lead by example and um you know you have ethics involve you have other things involved but\nAll that aside Saturday I don't like how old the alienate people who are just near me what I Will say that um I think it's a change in the guard of people putting in your home and have you with experience\nA and their respective field and I think that's kind of representative of the times right now is a ... bad the book is still being written\nExactly exactly and the other thing is I Know that you know you talk about politics you talk about sports right now in our society when we're looking at sports and politics we have seen lately where politics have entered the sports arena\nMhm and you know with that being said what are your thoughts own\nYou know should athletes actually just you know play football and leave their political stance on the sidelines or do you think right now with forces going and going in the direction where people are able to use that platform to speak their political beliefs\nI was raised to speak truth ... even when people don't necessarily want to hear it and I'm like I said previously I think that sports\nAnd folks are sports have always spoke their mind and I'll tell you when it's happening on the sixties and seventies outlet e bill Russell they were outspoken about their uh their stance or the early in the ... and you have more than that max you had\nAll these different people speaking up about things I write write a but then with it I Believe ended up happening is that\nThe major contracts came along\nUm Nike Reebok Adidas and whatever and um and so I don't know if they voluntarily were quiet because they knew that maybe it would mess up their paycheck ... uh but then along came probably capital make them along in the brawn James and none of these other ...\nAnd the money wasn't necessarily issue I'm standing up for what was right in their opinion is maybe what their their their their meals and I think that um when you're talking about how we can frantic I think we'll get lost in translation is it about the flat\nAre sounds good right I got my med school be he's locked in was on the other side we got caught with a lot of news when we come back and talk more about this we will get into political they brought I wanted to jump in with a dog so maybe you got the most I [noise]\nDo you why do you have for Komen W.

I got to give them they want to do my ... my life that's why I say it doesn't matter I don't think I can do is encourage people to go vote and I go vote after that man is what what else can\nYou do and don't be afraid to go to the wrong point I think a lot of there's a lot of fear that's being stoked out there about going\nAh you know ... voter purging or that you've moved in to where you may have gone to the previously if you didn't get the card sold and send it back to wherever your secretary of state is\nThat you can still go to the same polling place and you can get a provisional ballot and you just have to later on prove that that's where you are and your vote will be counted\nLet me ask you there who are we talking about the young people you know devote my this is where it really is when it comes to these local elections in your professional opinion about what are we doing wrong be\n[noise] um I think that the identity of what a candidate is has changed mhm have used this analogy\nUm I fell in love with basketball with Ninety One you know my stepfather from the west side of Chicago and then my Uncle Billy introduced me to back it was a commission of parks in Harlem for years I was when all the NBA players like Katie Anderson's ... anybody that came from New York ... uh but here's the point I make it\nIn my opinion\nMichael Jordan revolutionize what it meant to be a basketball player he was a rock star\nUh but here's the point I make it\nIn my opinion Michael Jordan revolutionize what it meant to be a basketball player he was a rock star um sneaker contract see one multiple championships in my opinion\nUm you talked about the social media aspect with Obama Obama change what it meant to be a candidate ... black white green yellow whatever ... you have to social media you have to drive traffic in that way\nUm when I look at Donald Trump\nHe is a media mogul uh\nThat's a New Yorker light duty that knows how to spin controversy or you know it did he ... his daddy P. Diddy a coup buddy love today what is it to me that's the comparison so Trump and just the different things that he has going on and so I Believe that someone like Mitt Romney was ahead of his time in\nThe sense of people were mad about the forty seven percent comment and he was very wrong for what he said he got caught on tape saying it um but\nIt was true yeah how was he wrong for what he said I mean it it's it's accurate I mean I Would say that there's about forty five percent mental the one way forty five percent of the ... and you're not only by and looked\nAt me and I say that my grandmother taught me that she may be better off than someone you may never you you may never be you're may be better off to somebody but you're never better than anybody in the comment he made to some people sounded like he's up here and they're down there there's certain things the kitchen table talk that maybe you shouldn't say\nAnd he got caught on video saying it at a at a function\nSo maybe the runaway said he was he was saying he was naming data that maybe that should have been left out of his speech because you never knew who was recording\nRight\nDo you see where I'm coming from a no no I I mean you know I get to be there and I'm I'm I mean I don't I\nHave a problem because I saw more statistical what he was saying I didn't see it as you know on better than you and here's forty seven percent of the country that you know doesn't fitness elitist\nClimbed definitely made you that's what I mean you've already bumped ... brown because it's perception right from your perception of what you've experienced and the perception of what I've experienced and so we can get assigned to instill a totally different about it\nBut that doesn't make him a bad person either so back his experiences his experience my experience is my experience for me I was one of four black kids to graduate from a prep school\nI went to prestigious prep school I had to close which every day of my life and so for me I've been in different experiences where I've had to adjust to people in and learn different things and see different things and all from my point of view as they had to offer there's for\nMe it was a tone you know if there was a tone that was head but that was my experience based off of what I heard when it was said he didn't see anything wrong with it because he felt that you know Romney was was was offering empirical data and that was it but\nYou know I grew up where you know my father and his ... and my father's family was blue more blue collar my mother and her family was were well to do and white collar and I've always had mixed between both worlds and so something my mom is said to my dad my dad I might have felt that it was wrong or was that buddy\nAnd my father might have said some to my mother and she didn't like it it it's all based off of experience and how you and how you interpret that so when I heard round the set\nI did I I I since it was a tone I understood what he said but sometimes you got to self edit yourself because you just don't know how people are going to take what you said if it's a well she didn't want it to be right but but but the initial question that you asked me was I Believe it was about identity I think the same way that Obama came across as this\nIf it's a well she didn't want it to be right but but but the initial question that you asked me was ... I Believe it was about identity\nI think the same way that Obama came across as this rockstar um whether you agree with his policies or not I think that the Republicans are are going to have I think Trump is their best candidate in that aspect [noise] but I still step I what I said I Believe roundly what's that rock star I just think that he was maybe ahead of time\nIn that instance I think that that forty seven percent comment changed the way certain people view I also think on me being an east coaster and people voting if you remember when Romney ran against Obama the north east was hit by treacherous stone\nForm a hurricane that a lot of people were voting during the election day\n... and ... that changed some well so to answer your question I think that the the role of the ... of the politician I'm as has has got the chance I I I had a few people from all walks of life and you know I often talk to the athletes as much as I talk to politicians as much as I talk to\nRappers and um I spoke to a to a to a rapper recently I said you know I'm\nCertain people in the church community have been turned off by the pastor or the person who you know the man and a woman of God and given the word and because of various reasons things have gone on in the church people think that they're not ethical and I said when you look at hip hop\nArtists do you look at them as the modern day preacher and they told me yes because they're speaking they're good news this week and there were there speaking the truth and people want to hear what's real\nI think it and and in in pop culture and even just in politics people are tired of being lied to you know I think that\nThe gentleman who called on the phone um he didn't like Obama policy I respect the fact that he was respectful of President Obama and he said he didn't trash him and I think that um we have to find a way to find the jets the position of respected demand whoever the man is an office while also\nThe person who's in office has to tell some troops and has to be ethical and I think that's a hard a bar\n[laughter] man you know you said a mouthful if you've got to me right now that brand of robbing the one on Scooby Doo there with us and we're discussing politics and you know the good bad and ugly and I think we can all you know um agree on this right here that\nWe all want our country to succeed we all want president Donald Trump to succeed\nI don't think that I I don't think that's ... I don't think that you can say we all want Donald Trump to succeed because I Do believe that there's a vast majority of people out there who do not want to see him succeed just as there were a vast majority of people out there who did they did not want to see\nObama's sick but here's the thing I Would say to those people you idiots okay I'll agree on that because if you're saying that you don't want the president is exceed because how he comes across how you two weeks of what he said you're\nBasically saying you want failure for yourself\nBecause unless you live in the late to Trump I think the delivery of what he says and tone on Twitter takes off those people but\nPeople are falling alone with what's out there it didn't like the Democrats are just coming to saying let's do this let's rumble no\nThe rhetoric is out there and they're fighting back on the rhetoric that's already out there and they're stupid justice low they are causing a problem and they ... at you at that level should never say anything like that to your constituents you are so wrong and honestly they should not be an office\nHonestly they should be if they could be ... I think they should Maxine Waters Cory Booker the world all of them Eric Holder the crap that there are ... to the people for them to go vote ... shows me how weak you are because if you're strong enough\nIn at the end of the day people will vote for you\nI don't need to get into my with President Donald Trump ... without him being a PC I don't need to go and they call a mob and they doing this and they don't need to do that just happened to Elizabeth Warren's you know that's what he is president Donald Trump wants to do let him do that if your message is strong enough and what the Democrats are showing\nThat they don't have a strong message that they don't have a strong message or a messenger so at the end of the day they're fighting back on the same thing ... you're trying to fight the bull in in in in the pool if it were you don't know how to fight yeah they are they they\nCannot be Donald Trump it's you're not but in the same thing was said you know when rock Obama was an office there wasn't a Republican\nOr a conservative candidate or somebody that was a good messenger for the kids are her to me because rock Obama was a rock star at that point in time I was the first president\nAh in modern times that had a form of celebrity status which I think is an unfortunate thing because I Do not think at this\nUh in modern times that had a form of celebrity status which I think it's an unfortunate thing because I Do not think that the president of the United states of America needs to have that celebrity is I'm about ... ... ... what do we have right now but ... right and been in as a you know ... said you know\nObama was the one that orchestrated originally and you now you have Trump who you know Trump is a celebrity in God help this country if we continue down a path\nOf celebrities Bert are having ... and because we we get in to an eye dollar treat type of celebrity worship in we can't separate\nTheir celebrity from the actual person and that's a problem\nThat is a huge problem that's what I always try to stay you know middle ground about\nThe candidates or the people in office I don't get to have them I don't get too low and then I just call it for what I see I don't look at the party that they belong to if you're in an office and you are doing that job I'm looking at the job that you're doing I may not like your policy more like a puzzle and I look at president Donald Trump\nI have to say when he did a six minute interview I found a new ... found respect for president Donald Trump\nMeaning that the guy's going to say was on his mind he's going to say what he feel and you could see he don't think a lot of things through and a lot of things he said he don't really mean he's just saying them am I giving me much use for it no\nIs that refreshing to a point to see somebody actually telling his truth is still a tell him what he thinks the right thing should be said is refreshing to a point but at school basically ...\nYou do have to know what to filter president Donald Trump and this is a great example\nWhen we found that ... she was missing president Donald Trump before you got any facts start talking to the public went out on Twitter strongly and say what that if something has happened to him Saudi Arabia gonna be still films just punishment is wasn't there before he knew anything in this because all the all the national\nAgainst rumors that that particular time were pointing in a direction that the Saudi Government and the Saudi crown prince had something hands on to do with the disappearance of the time right uh and it was speculated that he had been murdered right\nAnd so once he found out and what was going on now you see Donald Trump president Donald Trump during my conducting Milwaukee backtracking ... because now he's saying well I understand is that he he tweeted\nJust like he did a alone with or was it under the Russian President of about ... he said well he said he didn't do it well he now he said he didn't know\nWhat does it matter if you knew or not you said if this had happened that we're gonna be still filling the ... but then you say but we do have this arms deal so it looks bad\nAnd that's the end of the day like I said I said it's on my team is almost anything on his radio show today\nEvery president has had to backtrack when it comes to Saudi Arabia ... president\nThey cannot stand up to Saudi Arabia to a point because why would they have us with our parents around our ankles to a point to ... and so no matter what President Donald Trump say or do they are not going to be able to do what they are saying and I'm not mad at president Donald Trump for that because he cannot no and that's\nProbably what the whole fight and the west wing that yeah ... a secretary boom and I'm like Terry Kelly that you did that the ... that's the route the reason why we have to unfortunately I don't I don't want\nTo be doing business with Saudi Arabia we have no choice and unfortunately in the position that we've been in for\nWe have unfortunately I don't I don't want\nTo be doing business with Saudi Arabia we have no choice and unfortunately in the position that we've been in for the last almost a hundred years and we have no choice at this point in time when\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted out this statement a few hours later what did the Saudi Arabia's come on and say you want to do that yeah okay they caught his bluff nobody want to talk about that but that's the truth\nWill because we're we're engaged in our proxy but that right well that is Russia in ...\nBut that comes from inexperience right and speaking off the cuff and sandwich you feel that you want to go do without knowing the consequences and because it's just like the Saudi friends there\nBut it's also something that he campaigned on like he wants to pull us out of the middle east unfortunately we have so few allies in the middle east and you're right you know he he off the cuff you know this is what I promised in the campaign I Want to do this promise because he wants to do what rock Obama never could do was fulfilled his\nPromises and he spoke before he had all the\n... and this is what I Am I'm telling people\nPointed out ... when he's right\nPointed out when he's wrong yeah I understand he's not American sort of understand that you know we shouldn't do anything but that is not what President Donald Trump's it just like the wall may get Bill but president Donald Trump did not say we was going to build the wall\nWho he said it was going to be a little while to pay for Mexico's okay but that's not the case now people say oh we just don't get the wall bill okay I get that but let's make sure we like you always say ... right and so we cannot\nOverlook President Obama when he started out with the first one I Want to for ... microphone you say we keep our doctors yeah you and we did I got a problem with you sir for the the red line the red line and you and and I was allowed his radio saying it I called it out because he has a say\nA broke loggers right twice a day I don't care what part are you from if you're right you're right but what President Donald Trump deal with this was an experience now he spoke before he knew it he got to backtrack and you ... people walking away like okay now because you know well\nRussia started getting involved they said they were they were ready to start doing arms deals to Saudi Arabia after President Trump had a sin experience I don't necessarily know if that\nSays you know ... Russia has been trying to make them build around April ... players you know the players you know what could possibly happen that Mr that's an experience but you know I I I'm One of those that he's not listen to his people know off here to ensure the British or his people told him before he went out there\nIf this was the situation is these are the possibility that can actually be happening you don't know you you don't get to a situation with the Washington Post and does it get national news without being advised by your people\nOdd to me there's a bigger story and all but it's a bigger story but the thing that I'm pointing out and see what's going to come to you\nThe biggest thing that I'm pointing out is when the president speaks ... off the cuff stuff is fine sometimes I guess 'cause people like I don't like it but sometimes when especially when you're dealing with this stuff here yeah it can become nuclear\nSee I Want the repercussions against Saudi Arabia you know they're they're they're the one to remember one humanitarian\nIt it is but I guess what plump pale went over there\nAnd sat next to the friends that had that got killed ... to ... and it looked great the opposite of that look horrible but Steve ... been pulled from a financial conferences right but but you but brown what I'm saying is for everybody to see color ... had to go he had to go that day had ... yes\nFinancial conferences right but but you but brown what I'm saying it's for everybody to see color for what it ... had to go I had to go that day had yes he had to have that sort of walk yeah that was but you know but what I'm saying is\nWhen it happened on the other side people called for Rome\nAnd I understood at that point in time will soon as the president ... it had to be done when the Saudi Arabia deals and all those people call up okay I kept saying back then he had to do those ... people were in people with el enemies that no that was up for the Democrats ... no no no I'm telling everybody I must say it again\nWhen it comes to Saudi Arabia ... those deals we have to do their print came out Saudi Arabian government came on a few hours later as the president Donald Trump still um and they came out of ... and stuck it out you know what happened and then a day\nLater the the story about them spinning yeah meaning this oh well he ... he died in a fight but don't send Eighteen people were interviewing constantly room he ended\nUp ... I Know you're trying to spend it so it can be easier for president don't you want to make it that just what the us but the but the thing I Want everybody to look at is when president Donald Trump stuck his just understand what he said America strong ... what did it for instance what what did they say ...\n\nWhen the thing to remove\nEndangering its\n\nW why do we a coma WD J.

actually one of those uh\nWinter snows bargains and I can understand that because when I walked outside this morning I thought we had entered a new ice age\nI'm so I'm just not excited about what's going on\nThis morning in Alabama can somebody get a bear on the phone today I these trustee sidekick and can we see if we can bring the temperature back up to the seventies\n'cause I Am not about this forty degree weather good morning Alabama welcome back in this is Monday morning and we hope you're having a good Monday morning here on the wake up call we got a lot of stuff to talk about\nToday today we're going to talk about feminism yeah\nWhat a great Monday topic right I Know you're sitting in your garden what can we talk about today that's right we're talking about feminism and I'm specifically we're going to talk about building this was a surprise I had for you that I told you about a lot of hype it up somebody\nIs kind of hinting that they're going to run for president who could it be let's put two and two together we're talking about feminism and we're talking about president show runs on twenty twenty who could it be\nAround to find out eight six six five five one Ninety nine\nAbout feminism and we're talking about president show runs on twenty twenty who could it be stick around to find out eight six six five five one\nNinety nine thirty three is the number to join the conversation we'll be talking about a little bit of everything today though but most of the day is going to be stuck on this topic of feminism and a new article that was released it's all about man hating\nAnd why we should just accept it and so everybody that's ever critique third wave feminism and called it man hating to be held down and ... and do that it's not that it's going yes\nThis is exactly what we've been saying right in your own articles we agree we see exactly what you're saying\nBut it only makes sense when it comes out of their own mouth to leftists so I mean we'll just let them get their at their own pace jolly eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three before we get into all the complex and just arduous political topics of the day\n[noise] Monday\nLet's go over to the man with the planned the man behind the boards the man who was just up and add them all weekend Dylan\nHow you doing this morning\nIt's cold it's very cold I'm a big fan of the bargain look well when you wake up and is forty degrees outside\nAnd every window on your car is well probably five degrees away from starting the ice and you need some kind of to Bach and when you've got half an inch long hair that doesn't even richer ears [laughter]\nGot that receiving hairline alert right\nOh I just got a hair cut last week oh yeah that's true you chose the wrong time to get it didn't you get the memo Dylan we are about to enter winter which means it's about prehistoric here in Alabama you're about to be supposed to be bolting up and getting fatter and growing more hair to survive this complex winter\nThat we have here but the worst thing about winters in Alabama\nIs that that some of the humidity from the summer's sticks around so not only is it like ... it's kinda cold it's like wow it's kind of cold and I still feel like I stepped on the YMCA swimming pool so it's twice as cold but when\nDid this happen because even though I was sick still kind of sick I was here I I every day last week it was not this cold\nThan other nowhere forty degrees this morning\nI think I Know why but tell me why\nIt was fairly chili yesterday too I Know especially with the window is coming through yesterday [noise] mhm [noise] I get built nice if the wind went away yesterday this ... this morning and it's just cold we'll see can I admit something to you and not get judged for it\nPromised I won't get judged for it I don't promise that but I'll Try\nListen I I'm going to need a promise I Am a a feminist that needs a ... a safe space in me talking to thousands of people who never ridicule\nMe is my safe space so can you can you please give me a promise they're just so I feel safe to a safe to speak to my feelings speaking my truth which is an oxymoron concept but nevertheless I promise\n\nAcross the floor\nAnd I'm already losing\nTo this one goes out to Haley's comment that shooting across the sky right now apparently or my mother to be paid a feeding me fake news which I'm than passing on to thousands of people in the state of Alabama if so don't blame me blamed my mother\nEight six six by five one Ninety nine thirty three was an I'm an astronomy class I should know of Haley's comment is coming anywhere close but cannot be honest with you\nPlease can be honest with you so we were in this set astronomy class and I'm I'm not\nVery good at paying attention in that class not very good at paying attention\nAnd so this week\nJust fell asleep multiple times and you know when you're sick and you get all ... you know what I'm Talking about without me getting disgusting on air but you know you just get all that congestion that like [noise] all that stuff and that's what I was when I fell asleep and glasses week it was all just oh\nIt was it was all just snoring in class and it was really uncomfortable um people kept waking me up I didn't understand why they kept doing that uh it was just it was an uncomfortable scenario they should've just let me sleep but apparently the snoring was impacting the class I just don't I just don't\nMe up I didn't understand why they kept doing that uh it was just it was an uncomfortable scenario they should've just let me sleep but apparently the snoring was impacting the class I just don't I just don't get it eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three is the number to join the conversation\nWe have a lot of stuff to talk about today but I think the first thing I Want to start with Dylan\nIs if I were to tell you just on a basic level not in the United states not anywhere in particular\nIf I were to say what's in the military\nTo the White House and lead to a well I gave the country away listen let's let's let's re start this analogy over\nIf I was to say let's send the military to the place where the leader of the country lives the capital the capitals there we go thank you and use the military to take them from their place in the capital and to restore a different powers that\nWhat would you call that\nA military\nToo yeah that's what it is and so I mean it's very interesting that you make that assumption\nBecause wasn't had\nRosie O'Donnell who is just a pillar of intellectualism coming out and speaking\nThis past week weekend I don't know when she did it I just know she's an idiot\nAnd she came out and she said quote I stick with me here Dylan let's see if this means all our criteria so what what are the criteria for a military coup before we go into before we get into what Rosie o'donald so what would you say the basic criteria are for a military coup will you need military support okay military support and the military has to do would\nBe willing to overthrow the sitting a leader\nAnd they have to do what just go take the leader from his home essentially take the leader from his place of governance right either or yeah yeah so we've got three things we've got military support willingness and just them going out and doing it so\nIn advocating for a military coup you just need to out of those three right\nYou need military ... you need a willingness and military support right well we got the willingness here with Rosie O'Donnell coming out and saying let's do that and a bunch of people cheering her on let's see if this meets the criteria okay it says quote I Want to sit in the military to the White House to get Trump\n\nDoes that meet the requirements for our military coup definition\nThe military have not commented on whether or not they a plan to install this coup yet or not they won't oh you don't think so no I'm just waiting for the press release because I'm pretty sure you know I think they're debating it right now it's like fifty fifty they're like maybe maybe we could Mattis could become president maybe\nI'll come on it works so well for Cuba come on Venezuela is prosperous\nI don't foresee us having any kind of military or otherwise any kind of coup for like the Next Fifty to a hundred years in this country\nLists and Dylan that's far cited and that even if this political divide keeps widening see that's just far side and\nI think right now the military is weighing their options as to what rosy said where Rosie o'donald are steamed a leader and leading intellectual in this country came out and said I Want to send the military to the White House to get Trump She speaks in such simple sentences like can we just point\nWant to send the military to the White House to get Trump She speaks in such simple sentences like can we just point that out she she speaks like\nIt's almost like grunting at this point it's like I was in military to White House to get drunk\nLike it sounds like one of those cartoons like I remember there was some cartoon man that spoke like that in the seventies or something like ... or something like that I don't know I didn't watch cartoons but it just sounds like somebody grunting but let's get into this article if you want to check it out yellow hammer news dot com WWW dot ... dot com\nIt says it says earlier this week in an appearance on MSNBC comedian\nRosie O'Donnell made a startling call for the military to be sent to the White House to get Donald Trump I don't think it's startling like I Love the people over ... news dot com bosses are the people that send me content I'm what I can talk about not like what I can and can't talk about but here's some stuff you might want to talk about\nBut I don't think it's really that startling I expect this kind of\nIgnorance from Rosie o'donald like if I was to say Rosie o'donald said we should send a military White House said we should send the military to the White House doing are you that shock\nI've been expecting it to happen as to who it was I'm a little shocked that it wasn't wasn't some kind of sitting representative\nI don't think Maxine Waters this far behind but we'll get to that\nIt says and to get president Donald Trump it says in addition to her call for military for the military to supersede the civilian control the executive branch O'Donnell also referred to Trump as evil and dark and said she fell physically sick\nOf it is funny on election night in twenty sixteen she added that it took an entire year to overcome that sickness holy crap people are we are like\nI Am so sick of this right I I honestly am like people came out and they said trumped arrangements syndrome and I was like that's kind of silly\nThat doesn't actually happened the only place that happens is and that one gender studies class and like Yukon where they just they they really need their space I don't know why I chose Yukon sorry you can't but the one gender studies class at Yukon where they're just really worried about their rights you know rights that\nHaven't changed and women that have the exact same amount of rights as men in this country and its people that misconstrue the idea that equality of outcome is the same as equality of opportunity but that's neither here nor there but\nShe was she felt physically ill in twenty sixteen and it took her a lecture night and it took her an entire year to overcome that sickness\nI have a suggestion see it Dr Mayer says yes I Love it I Love it and then there's no better way to start the morning but seriously man stupid like we can't be\nA fellow physically sick tonight Donald Trump won I think it's so laughable how leftist come out and they say look we knew that if Donald Trump didn't win the twenty sixteen election his supporters would riot and never accept the results and would be so uncivil\nNow where are we now\nTrump won the election they're sitting representatives calling for violence there are sitting representatives pushing claims that have no factual basis\nWon the election they're sitting representatives calling for violence there are sitting representatives pushing claims that have no factual basis and there are people saying that they were physically sick\nFor a year after the election well ... let me get you a bottle and send you straight to Canada because no one really gives a\nShape I can say that on their their ego eight six six five five one Ninety nine eight [laughter] save myself there eight six six one Ninety nine thirty three\nBut is it not true Dylan is there's not a ridiculous also if you're sick for a whole year I don't don't you I don't know go see a doctor have masses yeah you're not going to answer me this whole show you're just going to play that\nSoundbite aren't you\nHad mass and be a log show funny show too I Love that soundbite that came on during one of the NFL games as we get couldn't be happier so\nLet's continue with this article it can't get any worse than her saying she was sick for an entire\nYear and it took a year to overcome that sickness that was sparked by the Trump presidency oh\nSounds like a bad romance novel despite those unfortunate circumstances plaguing O'Donnell beginning nearly two years ago she has been active financially in politics including Alabama\nAnd it's called why can't we hate men\nI Can't read past the first paragraph of the snow we're going to stoop and we're going to read and all we're going to read at all and we're gonna we're gonna break it we're going to break down all of it because doing I have a serious question why can't we have men\nAnd also what are we supposed to hate if genders on the spectrum I Am so confused by this if I'm being honest all of these claims about sexism and stuff like this it's like\nYou said this but then you said this in this has come directly contradictory to this believe all women well what about\nIf I Believe I'm a woman and there are a woman a woman if I Believe I'm a woman if I Believe I'm a woman and then I make a claim do you believe me automatically\nBecause you're supposed to believe I Am a women I'm a women I'm a woman and then you're supposed to believe all women\nAre just a little confused and I believe all women stuff is nonsense listen listen to women that's a good one verify or this or disapprove they claim that's a good one but don't just believe people that's silly\nEight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three we're also going to talk about I just got to break it to you I just got a pretty good teachers real quick just real quick we're gonna rip that went off like a band aid I'm Sorry I'm Sorry here we go you're listening were ripping off Hillary Clinton may be\nRunning again in twenty twenty there is more speculation that thinks she is All right I'm Sorry I got through it eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three let's go to Henry on line one Henry how you doing\nI'm doing great what a great up to the show either a thank you I I'm behind your one hundred thousand percent or\nOr a legitimate donations to the uh [laughter] just blows your Donald ... it's a it's a clinic paranoid whatever she is\nWell as long as you're behind me one thousand percent and you know you're at the one thousand out of one thousand twenty four percent like Native American like just like Elizabeth Warren is here we're going to make a veiled Elizabeth Warren references\nI mean I think I think we're going to go far Henry\nExactly\nYou know if the left can do anything I mean anything that they should snatch out of the blue sky whatever the Republicans are the what did you try to reflect a little bit and Portugal and things out of the rabbits at about ... but I got to tell you if if if the rafters got Rosie O'Donnell\nThe has uh an energy just ask bear\n[laughter]\nHey ask Baird do we have an unhinged Henry\nMan says yes [laughter]\nThat's just part of that I'm gonna go ahead and vote for her just for the ...\nAnd stuff it was as chairs there was a big step or whatever that saying\nThat she also gave talks to\nKnow she's got that accent is jumped in that you know we lose as we work\nFor whatever that saying that she also gave I thought she\nTalks to you know she's got that accent is something that you know we lose as we work around the world is you know everybody always tells us how what a ... a cute accent we got until they see the cowboy boots and that they want like Bill Maher did when I met him up in his house\nHe wanted to kick my butt bill Marr is a jerk\nHe's lucky I didn't like a map that day\nWell you've shown in his home\nYeah a friend of mine were I was visiting up does actually during the little school and you know when I was in my ... in my twenties still yeah and um yeah and they wanted to go over this guy's house turned out to be back Bill Maher they were looking for some weight\n[laughter] and no I was in his basement watching uh the Johnny Carson show and he and his parents were in Europe and uh that's all he did was sit in the basement in a bark a lounge or watching the bill models are watching that show all day I guess to learn ... is a trade today\nYou know it any way he saw me and cowboy boots and a cowboy hat and he jumped up by those who is this blank kicker [laughter] cause you to know me he knew the other guys anyway come come at me like he was going to what my book\nAnd uh I just respect all my buddies glad the whole million\nMe out of there but uh like you know like in real time on Bill Maher well ...\nYeah well he's still a clown\n[laughter] I I tell you I bet you don't even remember me today unless I put back on my ... in boots he would probably remember mean then you should have seen here heard the tie rate he went on about the southern people ... and everything because this was in New Jersey in his house is on a\nOh I Can't believe I'm forgetting alpine street alpine road up in a way in New Jersey [laughter]\nWhat we're getting ready to contact information out anymore we're not responsible for anything that comes about\nYeah don't forget it's alpine road in a way in New Jersey [laughter] anyway it was always told\nThe place by now his parents are are they probably still in Europe that the education he got you know I I I got off track there but you know Rosie odonnell with the FCC and all this ... she didn't do anything different whatsoever then didn't ask just shoes are ... and do that as soon as it's been a year in jail\nBaylor yep and he is now or he was until President Trump did away with that was considered a felon gave him a pardon ... exactly he was considered a felon though so why Israel Donald not considered a felon well not only that why it right and left are held to different standards\nWhy is that I mean are we just cowards is that what it is or or we hold ourselves to a standard week at a you know hold our own selves too like we're supposed to be I think that's being holier than thou\nSomething that we're all supposed to we're not we're not to be ... and you know if you're holier than now you'll never win and\nBecause you think you're better than the other person so you don't want to hold them to to the same standard because you're better than them you get what I'm saying here because yeah yeah I think that may be ultimately what we think it's just like how we treated 'em\nA Roy Moore you know\nThere was no ... ... and a double evidence and yet we went on word of mouth and all of these accusations and we're too good to you know that they were kicking around the world pedophile and yeah\nAnd on word of mouth and all of these accusations and we're too good to you know that they were kicking around the world pedophile and yeah of course we're better ... being a\nShow Christian like we would never go to a man like that in uh the senator ship ... so I think we went a little wrong there we should have waited for real evidence or or you know I think most people will just couldn't\nGet anything done once you did get in Washington because of how much a ... Mitch McConnell hated him yeah and probably didn't even know but you know there is this different standard\nAnd I think it hurts us to a great deal because when when we don't do anything when you do not reprimand or\nCorrect a child you know what to say they're touching the stove the classic and your reprimand them say knock ... and not do it and then you show them the danger well if you don't do that you end up with a ... child or they're going to pull down a boiling pot of spaghetti water on the base and you're going to end up with a child that\nIs a good to blame you later in life for not\nCorrecting them and then that's what we're living in right now they blame us for not correcting them ... I Believe this I'm really believe that they blame us for not putting them in a place for not holding them to the law they allow law was people\nThat they're there for word\nYou look that word out ... I'm an R. O. W. A. R. D. that there were people they refuse to abide by the law yet we hold ourselves to the standard of the law\nAnd if we really truly wanted to do that then we got to hold them just the same laws that we live by they should live by the next to Susan ... if he was wrong he he should have a paper what he did but mostly Donnell is getting to talk\nUh and uh she's put out there because nobody's held her to the ... to the standard of the law nobody's\nOr reprimanded or nobody gets onto these people and what did they do they just keep on and on and they're not going to stop now they're violent\nOver seven hundred violent acts against anybody that was a ...\n... I think um if I got it right it was a McLean Andrew maclean and his show on the line yeah he he\nEvery once in a while he gives the number that that it's up to I take your last time it was like three hundred years it's been going up and up and up ... we have Steve ... and uh all the Freedom Caucus of the Republican Party talking about a a soft coup this wasn't this is not a bloodless who\nThey attempted to change the direction of our government\nAnd the way or the results of an election by going out there and trying to assassinate as many conservatives as they could which would've changed the direction of our Congress and the direction of this country's political ideas and and the way we\nAre well we're not really doing what we should be doing but at least we're trying to I mean this Congress ... regardless of how we disagree with it I say in the last Twenty years is has done to try to do more", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "22"}
