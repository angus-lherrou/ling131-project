columnist for the Washington Times and the editor in chief of ...\nIt's nine thirty five by Todd would former air force pilot a national security columnist for the Washington Times and the editor in chief of ... dot com it'll be talking about uh the national security aspect and getting into\nThis interesting theory now\nSee I understand a little bit more about me I have a background in Russian studies actually have a degree in in what was Soviet Studies at the time now Russian studies and so following the Soviet the former Soviet Union ah what's going on there and the U.S Russia relations is a an area of great interest to me\nUh and in fact I I'm I'm Still very close to my college advisor or and we spend a lot of time talking about especially in light of what was happening with the elections and the so called election meddling by Russians um about about vitamin putting them what Vladimir Putin wants\n[noise] and it's interesting because she said to me and and this is always stuck with me and putting does not care does not care who is in charge in America\nWhat why don't report and cares about is selling as much chaos as possible and using the very things that we consider our greatest strength and our Democratic Republic to use those against remember what am I putting some martial artist\nOr and so when he wants to do is feed chaos now when this issue happen obviously lots of chatter amongst people about about a a\nYou know who might be behind this what the motivation is who would help so it hurts a lot of folks talking about uh uh someone who might be a progressive because as we know progressive is like to use\nA a bombs as their tools of of terror that's a fact they don't like guns they like they like bombs um but the reality is that the you know so so that's that's but as we're talking about this someone said to me\n[noise] you know what about what about the possibility\nWhat about the possibility that this could be\nA a a Russian effort and then FSB effort now I had a conversation yesterday with Peter joy ... a Russian expert he was actually attacked possibly by a a potent cronies present I I ... anti puente stances\nHeat heat specifically said to me no he did not believe that this was a Russian effort this would have been sort of beyond the pale but isn't it interesting\nI had it if you're that Chuck Todd was talking about this uh yesterday on ... on on MSNBC\nI have this fear that it could be some Russian operation to designed to do what's happening now more of this you know I think it ... and so in some ways we shouldn't rule out of me and I think it's an allied extraordinary strange moments and and we have no idea where it\nComes from we have no idea where it comes from it's absolutely true and remember I said context\nIs everything right when we talk about when we talked about uh the Peter Struck Lisa Page the FBI situation with regards to the Trump campaign contacts with everything what that timeline you had to understand the timeline in order to understand what was going on\nThe same thing can apply here and get knocked conspiracy the horizon again I Am just trying to find meaning in what is a very bizarre situation\nVery bizarre situation how how do you have ten bombs or a fake or otherwise go through the postal service without a without a um a post mark on them and without that post mark on them\nHow do you discovered that they came out of Florida now that's very strange to me but but the point is this is interesting [noise] so this all up at the episode\nHow do you discovered that they came out of Florida now that's very strange to me but but the point is this is interesting [noise] so this all up at the episode started happening a couple of days ago last week\nLast week the United states announces\nThat they are pulling out of the intermediate nuclear intermediate range nuclear forces treated the I. N. F. treaty signed by a a signed by um I'm President Reagan\nIn negotiations were pulling out because the Russians are violating that treaty Vladimir ... turns around and says if the United states starts deploying missiles\nIn Europe\nThen the Russians are going to have to retaliate they're gonna start targeting those countries and that's a that's a very direct threat\nAt the same time us backed forces and us equipment is being used to kill Russian or or to kill a Russian soldiers on the ground\nIn Syria the Russians are not happy about this\nAnd so to me given what the Russians have been willing to do\nIt is not beyond the pale wasn't remember the Russians were literally killing people in Great Britain or trying to to people in Great Britain I should say\nLiterally trying to kill people in Great Britain we notice\nSo ... it to me it's not it's not beyond the realm of possibility\nThat they would turn around and send bombs that were knocked that we're not real bombs fake bombs dummy bombs through the post office to a bunch of democratic targets in order to turn the left and right against each other even further that is what ... wants\nAnd I think it makes a heck of a lot more sense than either a right wing or left wing or sending fake bombs through the mail\nIn any case when we come back we're going to be joined by Todd would former air force pilot editor in chief ... dot com national security columnist for the Washington Times taking your phone calls eight five five forty war that is a number of taking your tweets at Andrew underscore lender on Twitter I'm Andrew longer I Am sitting in for ...\n\n\nIt's your last week to get the genius sunspot correct or for free for sunspots age spot that even read inflamed patches Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new Gen yourself sunspot director she says it's her go to product every day she had sun spots and eight spots can definitely see a difference in her skin since using it\nAs much to visit and chaos as possible in in American political circles this is what he wants to do\nI mean given the fact that I Want to talk to you about your thoughts about America pulling out of the INS treaty 'cause you've written about this given the fact that we pulled out of the IMF treaty last week um uh and and given the fact that there are Russian soldiers that are being killed\nOn the ground in Syria isn't there even the barest possibility that this could be an FSB operation a given that the timing of all this or is the time and just to die for it to be that kind of an operation\nWell it is possible I mean look at just ... nerve gas all over the u._k. yeah feel several people or one person and so it is possible however I think it would be incredibly reckless and literally an act of war targeting you know former political leaders\nFor you know the vice president's et cetera uh of the United states I don't think the Kremlin is that reckless at this point now that's just my point you know I have reporters\nAll over the former Soviet Union and I I just don't believe that they would do that\nAt this point in time let me ask you this because getting getting back to this high enough treaty and you've written about it I agree with you wholeheartedly the time has come for America to pull out of it um but ... has now turned around and said that that if the U.S starts placing intermediate range missiles\nIn central Europe he's going to target and I don't know what do you mean by targeting maybe you can lose it hit us on that but what you know that he's going to target these countries I can talk so what is it what does that mean\nAnd and how are you what does what does it mean that he's going to target and how seriously should the u._s. be taking various threats by putting on the IMF treaty pull out\nWell that that's exactly what you would think\nHow seriously should the u._s. be taking various threats by putting on the IMF treaty pull out\nWell that that's exactly what you would think he would say I mean what else is he going to do except threaten you know the U.S in countries where we may\nDeploy intermediate range nuclear missiles just like we did a you know in the eighties under Ronald Reagan with the person to is against the ss twenties et cetera that were deployed throughout the Warsaw Pact against western nations\nAnd so when he means by targeting is is really just putting the court and it sort of Warsaw or you know hungry or whatever in the in the uh targeting part time I suppose that carry this\nTime and this is so you're ... it's literally he literally means targeting like like when when I'm a Michael Moore went to Russia to try to find the nuclear missiles that were targeted at a at Detroit is literally he's talking about about changing target coordinates\nOh for sure he he what could I mean my point of that article is that we've seen this all before it and this is how we bankrupted the Soviet Union there is no way that Russia can keep up with us economically especially under the Trump academy which\nIn two years maybe pushing seven percent growth there is just absolutely no way they can keep up and he's trying to Boston and then I noticed he went to the United nations and they tried to drum up support there to force us to not what you often the treaty but this is classic Trump negotiations that you know threaten to try to keep them in the treaty to begin with I had them stop violating what they're doing\nMy guess is Todd more he's a former U.S air force pilot a he's a national security columnist for the Washington Times this piece in the Washington Times an arms race with Russia bring it on I think it will go up on on more as a a Web site\nCertainly will go up on the Andrew anger show page on Facebook so go and check that out there explain to us a little bit about what ... dot com is because that's that's fascinating to me\nYeah well I Know I had a long history or in Russia studied it at the air force academy the language I you know learned about the Soviet Union flying for the air force I traded emerging market down on Wall street for almost Twenty years\nFocusing on Eastern Europe and other countries and so I Know a lot about the region and I just really realize that the west especially Americans in you know middle America don't know anything really about what's going on over here so\nI have built a team of reporters and we're growing rapidly the traffic is growing and and we're really just trying to bring news analysis culture opinion as to what's happening here\nWell and the important point and and you and I own a gun to talk more about this because I was I was a Soviet Studies major in college myself and so and I also learn language are you at the very least I Need to brush up on my Russian so I've I'm always looking for people to talk to the show dog she was on a show [laughter]\nSo my but my my question a lot of sleep people what they don't understand is it is that this is really it's not for ... and it's not about\nReestablishing the Soviet Union but it really is about ... the trappings of the Russian Empire and and and uh you're exactly right until the end of things like me well thank you but you got a [laughter] thank you ... [laughter]\nPlaying that a little bit explained to explain what that means in the modern context of what a modern Russian Empire looks like\nBut I don't know what a modern Russian Empire looks like but I'll tell you what the ultimate looked like it stretched from Poland and people don't notice all the way into San Francisco there's a Fort roost you can go to in San Francisco yeah it'll exist today as a monument\nAnd so bizarre empire was huge Russia before the Soviet Union was one of the most productive successful countries they said do you\nReally half the world with their economy and their agriculture and\nAdjust now a hundred years later got back to that point and so that tells you what the ...\nA really half the world with their economy when their agriculture\nAnd adjust now a hundred years later got back to that point and so that tells you what the Soviet Union did to them that destroyed them economically destroyed them politically culturally I mean what Russia last with the Soviet\nI'm a you know the ... revolution is just astounding and I would I Would I don't want to happen here so we had a lot about\nThat but I mean this is this is why this this changing stance visa V. Russia is so important I mean the the idiotic Russian reset that's then secretary of State Hillary Clinton was talking about was completely ineffectual the the the you know it's not just that the Russians only understand strength it's not quite that\nBut the Russians have to respect your ability to push back and and to know that you're serious about what you're doing I mean don't I mean that that's what makes what we're doing now so different than what the Obama administration tried to do with my right\nOf course and if you want collusion I mean the bombers or their their entire demonstration on down with the ones that clear to Russia and still probably are in some ways uh you you look at a uranium so you know those sales you look at what's going on with the Trump dossier cetera I mean there were\nIntricate interaction with the Russian security services by the bomb in his administration against a political candidate and and so\nIt's just amazing to me that people don't get that still or they don't want to be\nTaught how to folks have folks find out more about what you're up to the good working and doing it was it how do I get in touch with you when I Want to talk Russian whether you\nWell I don't you can always go to our them dot com the S. A. R.

I'm not sure I don't believe in the FBI doing it are nevertheless on the other hand the idea that the Democratic establishment doesn't want the bombers to be found uh that that is a a distinct possibility here\nI'm ... and unless we're sort of watching this uh they've I'm watching this on TV they've got these all the eleventh and twelfth\nPackages that are found if you haven't found that out um there is one package address to a a James Clapper that was found in New York a package that was addressed to Cory Booker found in Florida um so that's sort of what we're watching what I don't understand I I still don't understand\nAs maybe this is just because the FBI hasn't released it yet but how packages without uh any kind of a post mark\nOr how they were able to track those to Florida and how they're finding them they're also very odd that the and this was the ... one of the bizarre as a [laughter] that the package that was being sent to old wanted to make sure I got this uh my notes uh the package that was being sent to a Eric Holder\nAs a way that the package that was being sent to old wanted to make sure I got this my notes uh the package that was being sent to a Eric Holder was somehow return to Debbie Wasserman Schultz was office that's bizarre to me in any case\nWhen we come back we're going to be taking your phone calls eight five five forty Laura eight five five four zero war that for the phone number here also reading more of your tweets to me a tweet Abby ...

I've said that a couple of different times but I Want to make sure that a hammer that point home so that we talk about these things um but that's also why I I Do think that we cannot discounts\nWe cannot discount or that the Russians might be involved here in some way shape or form that usually when I had this conversation or yesterday with a a Russia expert who who did tell me he did not think\nDid not think that the FSB the Russian foreign intelligence service was involved in this he did nevertheless say but on the other hand there is strong evidence to indicate\nThat those are ... you know the camera linen his brother up as your car up in Boston that they may very well have been trained than influenced by the Russians\nThat they are all sorts of weird things that were going on with their radicalization and and that the way that they built this they're bomb the pressure cooker bomb is not something that would have been readily available on the Internet and so uh that that I found fascinating there is a real benefits\nAre real benefit a continuing benefit to a lot of foreign powers or by this continued a discontent in a in the United states affect somebody tweeted it I don't have it in front of me you know or that the Russians would very much like Democrats in power that's true to an extent\nBut the what the Russians are really wants is they want chaos or my thank

Gillette businesses thrive is what we need to do I mean we ... government the fundamental belief and I'll get Senator Tom Davis in the state of South Carolina credit because he told it to me and it's been part of my ... a\nDemocrat fundamentally believe government is to set up problem and Republicans believe government is the problem and that is what Trump is doing the government's the problem is getting rid of it\nFinally we've got Congress working with him on that and we have to keep them a mental going at paramount I was ... like ...\nAs my colleague at the Competitive Enterprise Institute Wayne Cruz says you don't have to teach the grass how to grow you just have to remove the rocks or marijuana and he's already been a little bit that sort of by one of my other barely works is is the is this issue of regulations\nBut but you know and it's and it's interesting because you talk about this issue of negotiation and and and Trump [noise]\nUm I I have a I had formulated a theory on what I call Trump's rules of acquisition I'm a star trek Duke uh this is a ... and rule number one is always be willing to walk away from the table\nRight rule number two is sometimes in order to demonstrate your opponent\nBut you're willing to walk away from the table you have to walk away from the table and rule number three is don't pre negotiate with yourself I mean this is this is the great folly of a of a a you know democratic negotiators ... over the years\nIs that they've always print negotiated and eventually inevitably sold out American interests\nAnd so we are you understand probably Boeing is unhappy about a tariff on let's say aluminum or steal or what have you but nevertheless it is in go shooting tempted to take the strongest positions don't you think\nOh absolutely and we need to remind ourselves that that you know I look at what we're going through right now it's like a child getting inoculated we know they're going to have a fever for a day it's going to be a

president it's going to stand tall against\nThem I just you know I was gonna ask you about about how your constituencies are looking at this this bomb possibly but I really want to focus more on substance here\nI mean what about what is your what does this sort of your opponents response when when he talked about I mean he literally I'm assuming he's you know for the rest of the Democratic playbook which is to undo all of the great games here\nWhat how does he proposed to housing where most of the ... the economy jumpstart it\nUpon it not that smart [laughter]\nThe only thing he's\nThe

Carolina well yeah no one is because there's no oil out there [laughter]\nOnly thing he he\nIs running on a platform I'm going to stop offshore drilling from South Carolina wow and I said yeah and well number one he doesn't understand the job of Congress that's not their job that the president fire\nBut that aside and then he comes out what he's the only one who's had bipartisan experience well

when MSNBC change their\nTheir uh their their teaser there at the bottom a man in his fifties arrested in connection with the bomb probe in any case we're talking about this are taking your phone calls here or let's go to a Ross in Arizona Russ welcome to the war Ingram show\nOh thank you how do you get on a great job or talk to you about the St ... so called caravan ways and I think I have an\nAnswer the answer for President Trump who's been but\nMoaning the disgraceful laws which the Democrats passed which is tied his hands the answer is in plain sight all you have to do is they got your dictionary and your constitution and uh because words\nMean the absolutely of course and\nOur every definition of the word invasion this is an invasion check your\nShow no absolutely I Believe me I've I've seen those dictionary definitions I listen to it as a force of large numbers coming to try to cross the border illegally believe me I I get that was the first time I have to let you go 'cause I I I Want to get John on before the break or because he's calling in an answer to my earlier question\nYou're a former postal worker you can help a elucidate us on this uh these issues\nDid you say John or Sean I said John ... yeah I Know where it's yeah it's the same yeah I I I was\nI worked for the postal service as a clerk and I fell in postmaster for ten and a half years after my uh twenty seven\nI work for the postal service as a clerk here and I fell in postmaster for ten and a half years after my uh twenty seven years of air force service anyway\nVicious not better unusual when you consider the characteristics of these packages [noise] um I don't I have received things in the mail personally that are the things that are more go a calculator or something with stamps on there that have not been cancelled wow the region or not and Andrew is because\nThose are called SP ours which stands for small parcels in roles that can't go through the processing machine sure\nWhen you get a letter that goes for the machine a machine just spray it the cancellation on there for efficiency of speed it doesn't do that with those types of packages had those packages had a pipe and they're not a PVC pipe of actual lead pipe or something\nThat could do damage yes it would have way too much and it would've alerted people that there's something wrong with this sort of it's not a gun through clerk clerk at the counter will look at it ask a bunch of questions and cancel the spurs are stamp shore\nSo for the fact that they're not canceled there's not that unusual\nWell let me ask you this and ... who are running short on time here but real quick so it without it being cancelled how would they be able to track them back from New York to Florida\nWell I think that's probably a a they're basing it on the fact that one of them was mailed and then ended up with a ... being returned to Florida I'm I'm I'm not exactly how they got FBI's a lot more clever than I Will say well\nThis is what some of those I appreciate that that is that is incredibly helpful information and in the end right I mean we can speculate I can offer my opinion I can offer my perspective but we're also in the business of providing facts so Sean thank you so very much for giving us that you have a a great weekend All right\nYeah so I'm no expert but I think I Know enough from working\nWith it you know just to be dangerous and make us all more dangerous addition I appreciate that was when we when we come back\nWe're going to be talking more about these issues were going to be joined by the court as we're going to turn our attention to the Caribbean we're going to be continuing to take your phone calls a at a a five five forty Laura also your tweets I'm Andrew language sitting in for Ingram you're on the ...\n\nHave you ever taken your car for an oil change in your mechanic find something wrong and surprised\nYou're a hit with a huge repair bill\nTo these countries and the reason that's important is right now under US law is crazy but if a Mexican comes across illegally or he or she can be repatriated almost immediately\nBut if you're not from a continuous countries shore um Central America that's not the case it's a crazy loophole that needs to be fixed um but in the meantime what can we do then to repatriate them if they actually do get across\nA through executive order I think that that makes a lot of sense to effectively make it an extension of travel ban but I think Andrew here's the bigger point I don't want to have that confrontation\nLess incentivized Mexico and find something else to make kind of threatened or threatened Mexico\nTo take care of his problem because they should for too long Mexico has not been acting look Mexico's a friend and ally but they're not acting like it on this issue and they have gladly pass the buck and allowed in facilitated these care of it has to go north and become our problem well they've got to do their part\nWell this is part of it we have leverage on them particularly a trade\nIt happened I'm Sorry I don't know but this is what's happening in Europe I mean let's not forget that a lot of our friends in Europe are struggling as a sort of the same issues a mass migration\nAnd you have a situation in which you'll have migrants refugees from the middle east coming in arriving in Greece and they will be facilitated and crossing certain countries so that those countries can get them out of their their continue was ... ... it's interesting you talk about this he talked about the issues of national security\nAnd I've been down to the southern border and I urge anybody in every one if you've never been down to the border go down to the border in in\nDirty and I've been down to the southern border and I urge anybody in every one if you've never been down to the border go down to the border in in uh in Arizona and California\nAnd watch you know there's highways that that travel right along the border I Want to say I five I don't remember I Know it's on I think that that goes north south I think it's I tend interstate ten goes right along the border there\nAnd I've watched people cross the border it is a scary prospect even if people are not coming you know into commit harm but the idea that something like and I simply walk across this patch of land and and my great that that is a frightening prospect to me and I'm thinking as he was ...\n... of course and by the way you know people want to make us seem like we're a xenophobic\nA you know paranoid people because we talk about uh the the danger of a lawless for of course border here's the reality the president wasn't far off by the way when he said that you know there could be middle Easterners or for example we had no idea it was causing here's what we do know\nAnd this is a conspiracy theory nonsense this isn't from so far right you know ...\nThe Laredo station of the border patrol tells us that this year they have already arrested six hundred and Bangladeshis are crossing illegally now why do I mentioned that because obviously Mexico's a very long way from what I'm saying that that also happens to be a country that has a real problem with Islamic hairs\nAre so there are reasons for us to to fully that anyone coming here from Bangladesh even coming legally but the fact that they're coming illegally through Mexico I think it's very I\nSure and tells us you know that that we don't know who's kind would be caught six hundred comedy have we not caught um so it doesn't make sense for economic security it doesn't make sense for our national security\nIt's not fair to legal immigrants there are just so many reasons why we have to stop it and I think we need to get Mexico\nTo do their part when you use trade as the leverage and say we're gonna start trade restrictions and by the way\nThat doesn't work if it comes to it we will seal the border there will be no trade from Mexico I Hope we don't have to get better ... but I think that option has to at least be on the table so that we don't have the prices of them actually crossing the border walking across as happens too often as you mentioned\nAnd by the way the interstate that I was looking for the interstate eight this south of interstate panic goes right along the border in Arizona and California and my guest is Steve Cortez and we're talking about this it it's funny because I I come back to set a thing about being a phobia and I I Want to also make it very clear I've said this a little bit earlier on on the show\nBut one of the one of the great things about America the thing that makes America the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth is affected anybody can come to America and become an American right that that is that is an essential element of who we are it's a wonderful thing it's something you can't find anywhere else so you go just about anywhere you go in the world but\nI can move to France today I could live in ... in France for another Thirty years I Will never be considered French\nJapan in the same thing Korea the same thing but anybody can come to America and and become an American it's the beauty of who we are we're just saying that you have to do it within the process you have to do it legally you can't you cannot expect\nIf you're going to come up here on moss\nAnd and do something about it so the president's talking about deploying troops down to the southern border\nUm there is a lot of discussion as to whether or not this violates posse ... I don't believe that it does having read the various statutes that are out there where do you come down on this\nRight now I don't think so because it's it's a clear danger to our orders external danger so you know I don't think it done by the way I'm so glad you made that point two of you know look the mainstream media you played that Joe Scarborough and he was just\nRidiculous morning yes totally insulting to America trying to make us a racial issue they often do that by the way when they don't want to talk policy what are they do they just call this race of course and and try to dismiss us but here's here's ...\nSalt into America trying to make this a racial issue they often do that by the way when they don't want to talk policy what do they do they just call us race of course and and try to dismiss us but here's here's the reality of America's not a race or you know as you point out right and if you believe in our values and our constitution\nAnd if you're going to bring work ethic and skills that we need a than we want you to become a legal immigrant and you're so right the second you are you're an American\nNo questions asked that doesn't happen in the rest of the world oh so this is not about race remotely a it is about citizenship and it is about borders and it's largely by the way I pointed out to the Joe Scarborough is largely about protecting\nAmerican citizens many of whom happen to be minorities a black and Hispanic American I Believe sucker more than anyone from tolerating illegal immigration\nA why because many of them are working class people who have to compete in the labor market against illegal immigrant labor so it actually harms black and brown Americans perhaps the most of all to tolerate porous border\nYou know my ... my my my colleagues see motley less government dot dot org has talked to a great deal of about that issue about sort of the economics of this as well in the end for me it comes down to issues of national security it comes down to issues of sovereignty\nIf we don't control who is migrating here on them in any nation any nation that doesn't control who's coming in is pretty soon find himself without a nation and we certainly don't want that sea of Cortez how do we find out more about what you were up to\nYou know I'm On CNN most nights be on air and we're not tonight and on Twitter at court as the

the president speaking tonight at a gathering of conservative African Americans are they're going to be posted at the White House today and then they're doing the gala event tonight here in Washington

the national security aspect of getting into this\nInteresting theory now so you understand a little bit more about me I have a background in Russian studies actually have a degree in in what was Soviet Studies at the time now Russian studies and so following the Soviet the former Soviet Union ah what's going on there and the U.S Russia relations is a an area of great interest to me\nUh and in fact I I'm I'm Still very close to my college advisor or and we spend a lot of time talking about especially in light of what was happening with the elections and the so called election meddling by Russians um about about ... what Vladimir Putin\nWants [noise] and it's interesting because she said to me ... and and this has always stuck with me well am I putting does not care does not care who is in charge in America\nWhen a lot of reporting cares about is selling as much chaos as possible and using the very things that we consider our greatest strength in our Democratic Republic to use those against us remember what am I putting some martial artist\nOr and so what he wants to do is feed chaos now when this issue happen obviously lots of chatter amongst people about ...\nAbout a a you know who might be behind this what the motivation is who would help so it hurts a lot of folks talking about a someone who might be a progressive because as we know progressive is like to use a a bombs as their tools of\nOf terror that's a fact they don't like guns they like they like bombs [noise] um but the reality is that the you know so so that's that's but as we're talking about is someone said to me [noise] you know what about what about the possibility what about the possibility that this\nBut as we're talking about is someone said to me\n[noise] you know what about what about the possibility\nWhat about the possibility that this could be\nA a a Russian effort and then FSB effort now I had a conversation yesterday with Peter joy ... a Russian expert he was actually a tax possibly by a a potent cronies present I I ... anti pollutant stances\nHe he specifically said to me no he did not believe that this was a Russian effort this would have been sort of beyond the pale but isn't an interesting\nI have it if you're that Chuck Todd was talking about this uh yesterday on ... on on MSNBC\nI have this fear that it could be some Russian operations who designed to do what's happening now more of this you know I think ... and so in some ways we shouldn't allow 'em I mean I I think it's okay to lie to ... to ... strange moments and and we have no idea where it comes from\nWe have no idea where it comes from that's absolutely true and remember I said context\nIs everything right when we talk about when we talked about uh the Peter Struck Lisa Page the FBI situation with regards to the Trump campaign contacts with everything that timeline you had to understand the timeline in order to understand what was going on\nThe same thing can apply here and get knocked conspiracy the horizon again I Am just trying to find meaning in what is a very bizarre situation\nVery bizarre situation how how do you have ten bombs or a fake or otherwise go through the postal service without a without a um a post mark on them and without that pose a mark on them\nHow do you discovered that they came out of Florida now that's a very strange to me but but the point is this is interesting [noise] so this all up at the episode started happening a couple of days ago last week\nLast week the United states announces\nThat they are pulling out of the intermediate nuclear intermediate range nuclear forces treated the I N F treaty signed by a a signed by um I'm President Reagan\nAnd negotiations are pulling out because the Russians are violating that treaty Vladimir Putin's turns around and says if the United states starts deploying missiles in Europe\nThen the Russians are going to have to retaliate they're going to start targeting those countries and that's a that's a very direct threat\nAt the same time us backed forces and us equipment is being used to kill Russian or or to kill a Russian soldiers on the ground\nIn Syria the Russians are not happy about this\nAnd so to me given what the Russians have been willing to do\nIt is not beyond the pale and it was an remember the Russians were literally killing people in Great Britain or trying to kill people in Great Britain I should say\nLiterally trying to kill people in Great Britain we know this\nSo it it to me it's not it's not beyond the realm of possibility\nThat they would turn around and send bombs that were not that we're not real bombs fake bombs dummy bombs through the post office to a bunch of democratic targets in order to turn the left and right against each other even further that is what Vladimir Putin wants\nAnd I think it makes a heck of a lot more sense than either a right wing or or left wing or sending fake bombs through the mail [noise] in any case when we come back we're going to be joined by Todd would former air force pilot\nSending fake bombs through the mail [noise] in any case when we come back we're going to be joined by Todd would former air force pilot

since using it\nAs well mom in you know it's it's it's a situation in which we know that we're putting wants to do is foment as much to visiting his and chaos as possible in in American political circles this is what he wants to to do\nI mean given the fact that I Want to talk to you about your thoughts about America pulling out of the IMF treaty 'cause you've written about this given the fact that we pulled out of the IMF treaty last week\nUm I and and given the fact that there are Russian soldiers that are being killed on the ground in Syria isn't there even the barest possibility that this could be an FSB operation a given that the timing of all this or is the timing just to die for it to be that kind of an operation\nWell it is possible I mean look they just ... nerve gas all over the u._k. yeah feel several\nPeople or one person and so it is possible however I think it would be incredibly reckless and literally an act of war targeting you know former political leaders for you know the vice president's et cetera uh of the United states I don't think the Kremlin is that reckless at this point now that's just my point you know I have reporters\nAll over the ... former Soviet Union and I just don't believe that they would do that\nAt this point in time well let me ask you this because getting getting back to this high enough treaty and you've written about it I agree with you wholeheartedly the time has come for America to pull out of it um but ... has now turned around and said that that if the U.S starts placing intermediate range missiles\nIn central Europe he's going to target and I don't know what do you mean by targeting maybe you can elucidate us on that but what you know that he's going to target these countries I talk so what is it what does that mean\nAnd and how do you what does what does it mean he's going to target and how seriously should the u._s. be taking various threats by ... on the IMF treaty pull out\nWell that's exactly what you would think he would say I mean what else is going to do except threaten you know the U.S in countries where we\nMay deploy intermediate range nuclear missiles just like we did a you know in the eighties under Ronald Reagan when that person to lose against the says twenties et cetera that were deployed throughout the Warsaw Pact against western nations\nAnd so when he means by targeting is is really just putting according to who Warsaw or you know hungry or whatever in the in the uh targeting a time out of that period of\nTime and this is so you're literally he literally means targeting like like when when I'm a Michael Moore went to Russia to try to find the nuclear missiles that were targeted at a at Detroit is literally he's talking about about changing target coordinates\nOh for sure he he what could I mean my point of that article is that we've seen this all the Ford and this is how we bankrupted the Soviet Union there is no way that Russia\nCan keep up with us economically especially under the Trump economy which\nIn two years maybe pushing seven percent growth there is just absolutely no way they can keep up and he's trying to Boston and then I noticed he went to the United nations and they tried to drum up support there to force us to not what you often the treaty but this is classic Trump negotiations that threaten to try to keep them in the treaty to begin with and had them stop violating what they're doing\nMy guess is Todd more he's a former U.S air force pilot a he's a national security columnist for the Washington Times this piece in the Washington Times an arms race with Russia bring it on I think it'll go up on on more as a a Web site\nCertainly will go up on the Andrew Langer show page on Facebook so go and check that out there explain to us a little bit about what ... dot com is because that's that's fascinating to me\nYeah I Know I have a long history or in Russia studied it in the air force academy the language I learned about the Soviet Union flying for the airports I traded emerging market down on Wall street\nIt's a study to at the air force academy the language I learned about the Soviet Union are flying for the air force I traded emerging market down on Wall street for almost Twenty years\nFocusing on Eastern Europe and other countries and so I Know a lot about the region and I just really realize that the west especially Americans in you know middle America or don't know anything really about what's going on over here so\nI had built a team of reporters and we're growing rapidly the traffic is growing and and we're really just trying to bring news analysis culture opinion as to what's happening here\nWell on the important point and and you and I own a lot of talk more about this because I was I was a Soviet Studies major in college myself and so and I also learn the language are you at the very least I Need to brush up on my Russian so I'm always looking for people to talk to the hottest show dog she was on a show [laughter]\nSo my but my my question unlawfully people what they don't understand is it is it this is really it's not for ... and it's not about\nReestablishing the Soviet Union but it really is about reestablishing the trappings of the Russian Empire\nAnd and you're exactly right until the end of things like me well thank you but you're saying it was supposed to give up all sure [laughter]\nJust laying out a little bit explained to explain what that means in the modern context of what a modern Russian Empire looks like\nWell I don't know what a modern Russian Empire looks like but I'll tell you what the ultimate looked like it stretched from Poland and people don't notice all the way into San Francisco there's a Fort roost you can go to in San Francisco yeah all exist today as a monument\nAnd so bizarre empire was huge Russia before the Soviet Union was one of the most productive successful countries they said do you really have to world with their economy and their agriculture\nAnd adjust now a hundred years later I got back to that point and so that tells you what the Soviet Union did to the end it destroyed them economically destroyed them politically culturally I mean what Russia last with the Soviet I'm a you know the full civic revolution is just astounding and I would I Would I don't want to happen here so we had a lot about\nThat but I mean this is this is why this just changing stance visa V. Russia is so important I mean the the idiotic Russian reset that's then secretary of State Hillary Clinton was talking about was completely ineffectual the the the you know it's not just that the Russians only understand strengths it's not quite that\nBut the Russians have to respect your ability to push back and and to know that you're serious about what you're doing I mean don't I mean that that's what makes what we're doing now so different than what the Obama administration tried to do with my right\nOf course and if you want collusion I mean the Obamas or their their entire administration on down the ones that colluded with Russia and still probably are in some ways\nUh you you look at a uranium ... you know those sales you look at what's going on with the Trump dossier et cetera I mean there was intricate interaction with the Russian security services by the bomb in his administration against a political candidate and so\nIt's just amazing to me that people don't get that still or they don't want to I guess\nTaught how to folks have folks find out more about what you're up to the good where are you doing tonight to listen to how I get in touch with you want I Want to talk Russian whether you're\nA well I can always go to ... dot com T.

we're talking about speculation and how it is\nIt's just who we are human nature to speculate as to what's going on when you're dealing with the unknown let's go to Janice in Alabama one of my favorite names uh since my wife's name as well Janice welcome to the lower income show\nThank you [noise] did you turn on the radio please it's\nOK down [laughter] good how are you doing what's on your mind\nI'm I'm well I'd like to pose my the area that they um please I Believe that it is a democratic suit um emphasize they're sending they non mountain\nCave a that most likely papal ... criticized president\nTrump in order to get that and uh they they ... the Democrat said pool have work to discredit and this is their lighted tall I close to the election to try to get the\nYeah I was I I I think there's that is the thing possible that's why this piece this morning and thank you very much Janice for the call 'em you know we've got the situation MSNBC has been pollens us just in the mail bomb suspect reads the Drudge Report and Fox News Sunday at one of the earlier callers would was hinting at\nWhich is sort of these false flag operations I I'm Sorry I'm not going to call it that we step back I don't mean that in ... when I mean is that you have Democrats who will\nPerpetrate these kinds of crimes\nAs a way of raising the stink you know I'm a there was a of feminist activists in Wyoming or who had claimed that she was being threatened to turned out she was sending threatening emails to herself on the same thing happened just recently with another democratic activist a on a college campus or you know at this issue of\nFolks who who claimed to put up I'm the founder of anti Semitic graffiti are only to racist graffiti only to find out\nThat it was in fact done by the people who they claim that we've seen this happen before\n[noise] so that's why I tend to discount of these things are let's go to a let's go to Mike in Texas Mike welcome to the lower income show\nThank you a question that should be at is the one that we heard many times over and it got five weeks ago by liberal under our during the cabin on hearing and that was who benefit\nFrom this not a word for it couldn't possibly by testify against have it so I Would act even though I disagree with that on that it completely left going back to their own ... who benefits from the delivery of the package or to\nAnti Trump people walk course it's the lack of course it is and I agree with the last caller there was never any attempt to hurt anybody\nIt's it was obviously the question has to be asked though\nIt's the Latin missile unquestioned in in in in the law cui bono who who who to whom is there a benefit to this and I think you are you are correct in that regard I mean this is the again if it fits in with the outcomes razor here\nI'm a you know the the simplest explanation is usually the correct one and I know I I've said that a couple of different times they don't want to make sure that I hammer that point home so that we talk about these things um but that's also why I I Do think that we cannot discounts\nCouple of different times but I Want to make sure that a hammer that point home sort of we talk about these things um but that's also why I I Do think that we cannot discounts\nWe cannot discount or that the Russians might be involved here in some way shape or form pictures when I had this conversation or a yesterday with a a Russia expert who who did tell me he did not think\nDid not think that the FSB the Russian foreign intelligence service was involved in this he did nevertheless say but on the other hand there is strong evidence to indicate\nThat bizarre ... you know the cameraman and his brother up as your car up in Boston that they may very well have been trained in influenced by the Russians\nThat they are all sorts of weird things that were going on with their radicalization and and that the way that they built this they're bomb there pressure cooker bomb is not something that would have been readily available on the Internet and so that that I found fascinating there is a real benefits\nAre real benefit a continuing benefit to a lot of foreign powers or by this continued ah discontent in a in the United states affect somebody tweeted it I don't have it in front of me you know that the Russians would very much like Democrats in power I that's true to an extent\nBut the what the Russians are really watch is they want chaos or my thank you very much for the call listen when we come back\nOn because I didn't want to talk a little bit about the primaries in a couple of folks have asked me to talk about the caravan and the chairman situation we are going to talk about that in the last hour the show are going to be joined by Steve Cortez\nA because it it all fits into what's going on here about we're going to be joined by state representative Katie Arrington uh she's from South Carolina she's running in the south Carolina's first congressional district\nI Want to talk a little bit about what I call the fly over effect on how we cannot discount what is happening on the ground in the states in a whole host of areas\nAre and so she's going to be joining us we're going to be talking about the mid term elections where are we talking about what she is seeing and hearing on the ground there but in the meantime you can get you didn't it's we I mean at Andrew underscores anger on Twitter you can call in eight five five forty Laura I'm Andrew ... sitting in for Ingram here on the lower income show\n\nAre you worried your identity could be held hostage you should be because ransomware does exactly that this is Tom Kelly studio of my id care making every American safer from the affected by itself does a tall order but that's my goal so here's a tip the best thing you can do to help protect yourself from ribs and we're just a back up your computer often\nHere's one reality right and again the the thing that makes America great one of the things that make makes America exceptional is that anybody can come here legally and become an American it is the beauty of who we are as a nation that being said\nBorder security is an essential aspect of sovereignty if you don't protect your borders you lose your ... Stanley McChrystal General Stanley McChrystal not some you know right wing bomb thrower was on CNN this morning talking about uh he was asked about the Caribbean and one of the things that he said was that a a\nA a a border security is an essential aspect of sovereignty\nAnd your uh it's clear your constituents in your potential constituents get that why is it that but what is your opponents say about this I won't get away our power how would the Democrats and it's just ridiculous\nSo my opponent Joe Cunningham rough the mayor of Los Angeles are SETI\nHere to campaign wow do I need to go any further\nDo you really you really don't I mean that that seems to you know it's one of those things I often talk about you know when you do public speaking you have to know who your audience is I Can't imagine that a guard said he from LA played well in the first congressional district of South Carolina it's\nThat because it let's be brutally honest with everybody on on the right yeah Democrats don't have a platform is year\nNot to say in the past Democrats haven't had something good but they don't have anything to talk about we should be focusing on the fact that we had the ... economy we had in generation no yeah the lowest them whine than ever\nWe should be focusing on the fact that we had the best economy we have had in generation no yeah the lowest them wind that amber and if people don't see that they I I just can't\nPut my arms around it but I Believe the Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters are toxic to this country they are toxic they're all about the rhetoric is all about the negativity they embody the exact opposite of what an American should be we should stand proud and strong together\nAs a country my ... my justice South Carolina state representative to the Arrington choose the Republican candidate for Congress in the first congressional district on and on that point you know nobody ... obviously off the front pages today\nBut this was we got a the the third quarter GDP a measurements today we knew we were going to be getting those obviously nobody is talking about them because of um ah ah because of the other things that are in the news the suffix bomb story\nA and and we now have a a GPA of three point five percent of the third quarter\nA President Obama when he was an officer we were never gonna see\nGDP above two percent of the Trump economy is turning around obviously this is very important to other folks you're talking to the see this in terms of jobs and more money in their pockets are how are they on those sort of uh the Trump ... tax and regulatory agenda one of those same to you about that\nOnly a lot more money in our pot you know the Trump the you know tax agenda is positive it's up to Congress to get tax judo path we need to ensure that small businesses and the middle class\nGet permanent tax relief absolutely paramount we have to do that that is that's going to be a huge focused on going in that fashion but other than that when you know we're looking at the regulatory you know I have some big manufacturers in my area of bowling being one of them shore and they just four hundred new people [noise]\nThe terrorists no one likes to terrorists no one likes a tariff\nBut President Trump is standing firm and putting America First and that it's imperative we need to remember that this is the the world's best negotiator let the man do his job you don't regulate it got\nNo go ahead go ahead please reducing regulations\nAnd using ... to let businesses thrive is what we need to do I mean we ... government the fundamental belief and I'll get Senator Tom Davis and the state of South Carolina credit because he told me and it's been part of my ... a\nDemocrat fundamentally believe government is to set up problems and Republican believe government is the problem and that is what Trump is doing the government's the problem is getting rid of it\nFinally with Congress working within on that and we have to keep the momentum going at paramount as my ...\nMy colleague at the Competitive Enterprise Institute Wayne Cruz says you don't have to teach the grass how to grow you just have to remove the rocket marijuana and he's already been a little bit that sort of my one of my other barely works is is the is this issue regulations but but you know it's and it's interesting because you talk about this issue of negotiation and and and Trump [noise]\nUm I I have a I had formulated a theory on what I called Trump's rules of acquisition I'm a star trek Duke uh this is a for a new thing for a new rules that I was ... and rule number one is always be willing to walk away from the table\nRight rule number two is sometimes in order to demonstrate your opponent but you're willing to walk away from the table you have to walk away from the table and rule number three is don't pre negotiate with yourself I mean this is this is the great folly of a of a you know democratic negotiator\nFor three years don't pre negotiate with yourself I mean this is this is the breed folly of a of a you know democratic negotiators trade negotiators over the years is that they've always pre negotiated an eventually inevitably sold out American interests\nAnd so we are you understand probably Boeing is unhappy about a tariff on mostly aluminum or steal or what have you but nevertheless it is going to go shooting tactic to take the strongest position don't you think\nOh absolutely and we need to remind ourselves that that you know I look at what we're going through right now it's like a child getting inoculated we know they're going to have a fever for a day is going to be a little bit cranky for a minute they're going to live a lifetime and never get sick\nWe have to prepare ourselves I mean this is it it it really is our country group you are the greatest nation on this planet because of hard work perseverance and the guts to stand tall\nAnd we need to do that right now China is not our friend they're never going to be our friends and I know that we have a president is going to stand tall against\nThem I just you know I was gonna ask you about about how your constituencies are looking at this this foreign policy but I really want to focus more on substance here\nI mean what about what is your what is the sort of your opponents response when when he talks about do you mean he literally I'm assuming he's you know for the rest of the Democratic playbook which is to undo all of the great games here\nWhat how does he proposed to housing ... ... the economy jumpstart\nUpon it not that smart [laughter]\nThe only thing he's\nThe only thing he runs on as you watch it on and he says I'm for offshore drilling in South Carolina well yeah no one is because there's no oil out there [laughter]\nOnly thing he\nHe is running on a platform of I'm going to stop offshore drilling from South Carolina wow and I said yeah and well\nNumber one he doesn't understand the job of Congress that's not their job that the president or\nPut that aside and then he comes out what he's the only one who's had bipartisan experience with the only thing he has experience doing is lying to some people about offshore oil getting them to endorse him otherwise there's no platform\nHe has nothing I debated him it was it ever get to a point in your your you know in an argument with somebody and you're down and there's just no response from them\nThat was my debate with this guy boil turn Democrat\nNancy Pelosi's funding his campaign ACLU and he has raised a ton of money so your listeners are out there I Need help sharing dot com on an elite support Republicans wherever you live across this country the port\nYour Republican candidates we need to stand strong together and not let this\nYou know and I don't even call the blue wave I just have to say that fake news of the blue way keep the how read\nWell there you go to the current events and what's the website is Katie Arrington dot com really appreciate you are sitting in with a ...\nOh my gosh thank you for the opportunity into all of the listeners out there we are the greatest nation on this planet we are full of goodness and we are the party of the people and it's nothing GOP anymore it's a great opportunity part\nYou go listen I appreciate that stays strong stay healthy really we really are above are doing

not independent anymore it's conservatism partially communism that's what we're all in all of us down to your your and Iran yeah agreed I think it shows now more than ever\nIt does I Need to start saying that the problem is nobody knows what can I mean nobody regular folks many of them on the labs don't know what communism is you say are here to talk about no don't\nRealize what they're headed for they're asking for it they just don't know what they're asking for\nExactly SARS that caravan goes I've got an idea for that it's a little bit out there but but listen to him here Yes sir when those people get to the border and before they cross eyed guy on TV last night and Lou Dobbs show say you know he's with the military on the border would expect to live with their anti out and say you

will start you know start digging around here on the Rio Grande we want to do we want landmines whatever you want to put out there that the calendar snipers I don't care you know eat them all down that border\nI Wonder if we can do it like we used to do in the Alabama Legislature we had to be done on the last day Mr Big by midnight and\nI always saw it a couple of times but they would just unplug the clock we had this continent has held so midnight never came\nAnd he just kept working and you get work and so what if we just said uh\nThey never they weren't they never touch vote on American so what do you mean I just telling you they never did foot old American Soul where are you talking about well that dirt dirt road there is not American Soul okay if you have to go to Mexico by dump truck full of fans spread a little bit out\nWhatever you have to do just they didn't they did not make it to American Soul\nBut it wouldn't ... a month\nIf you want to line them up and

we're we're pretty close our\nCoast can't agree on everything thanks Mr Big haven't gotten a surfer you buddy Scott Murphy Murphy welcome to the program\nYeah it's not a yeah we do a race highway from the Mexican border straight to the Canadian border and they can take their buses and trucks and drive straight up there and give them a little way to turn around and say drop their people off [laughter]\nYou know what those patterns a bunch of global as they were saying well murder if we tried to build a North American superhighway and all you right winger wouldn't let it happen for the problem was ya head exit ramps on it we didn't say we won't it exit routes\nAh we just only straight shot there were making the toll road so we make some money only forty ... pesos a buck fifty an axle um [laughter] what's going on\nIt's speaking a right wing or so that I just thought floating around in my head\nA buck fifty an actual um [laughter] what's going on\nIt's speaking a right wing or so that this thought floating around in my head and you know\nThe interesting to see people say that bombings really aren't a Republican kind of a thing and and that's pretty true most of the bombings throughout the history in this country had been done by left wing Democrat type people\nBut for all of their below the aiding about how bad we we Republicans are clinging to our guns in our bibles and all that it would seem to me that if we were just so adamant about getting rid of them why wouldn't we just go out and have target practice one day\nI mean that would just be much quicker much more efficient which I'm not advocating\nSo they don't know I mean it just doesn't seem like a oh ... what did you go ahead and look if you go over and if I had I guess I could put it out on my Twitter\nThere is a picture now out somebody was pretty don't grown closer had a good camera view of the suspects what they're calling the Trump mobile now\nAnd when you see it y'all we'll see what I'm Talking about with the details now I could not tell from the vantage point we had here at the station\nThat it was a lot of ... stickers I can see the ... better but it is a ... it's a ...\nIt is what a leftist would think a typical Trump supporter would do to their own vehicle but you got to check it out I mean it is very well done it is all lined up\nIt is yeah I mean it it's\nIt's amazing I'm a I'm going to see if I can get this big draw during the break in posting Rio and Twitter are so check it out Twitter it's gotta be some Murphy thing else\nMay just seem to be able to get it out I was ... you know\nIf we're your bracket up Maryland but you're right if if we if the left the right wing was going to do something I don't think it's this I think you're right\nI that's my point you all have a good weekend you got a buddy you have a good weekend to let's go to ed\nAnd the way I can talk while I Try to get this big drop it how you doing buddy\nOh doing okay well yesterday I disagree but they have a great with him I think there's I think mindlessly voting a straight Republican is not a good thing I Do think this time around concerning the context of the modern Democratic Party I think we do need to vote for consistent alternatives man libertarian constitutional party or Republican\nI sometimes I vote Republican I voted for one Democrat in the last like thirty forty years because there's only one conservative Democrat that I've met\nWhere was that I had to be I had to be way back and\nThat's actually a few years ago I Can't even remember what position was running for it I Can't remember his name\nBut I did vote for him and uh but I I think that are\nNow in hindsight are you sure even conservative already just tell you is conservative\nWhen we had around and talk and I got out it's not good and but uh now I think that the I've kind of third party it anyway because I think we do need an alternative party and I think um I think we need to do this for freedom site because I think if you just get so locked and\nA one party then we can be easily manipulated by that one party and I think we have to have real alternatives and we have better freedom and better choice but unfortunately considering the modern mentality of the modern Democratic Party I don't see it as anything but socialistic\nChoice but unfortunately concerning the modern mentality of the modern Democratic Party I don't see it as anything but a socialistic they didn't tell us church attendance charities show\nA fact or what if we agree with somebody on principle like that's what would you vote for him I wouldn't vote for a third party when judge wars there\nAre also other politicians that I agree with\nThat we don't agree on principle well then you know you're shooting by your lights and I respect your choice even if I don't agree with that I respect your ability to make a choice in those tax so I just I just don't think we need to be\nManipulated by the Republican Party or the Democratic party I don't even think of myself as a Republican\nI'm more of an independent and if the Constitution Party becomes relevant gladly identifying with that the Libertarian Party it's good but fortunately what you get an a Libertarian Party is a lot of liberal Republicans effect that way I Am I I think that my mission legalized drugs\n[laughter] but I think you're right back then we got to take a break we will be right back\nYou're listening to Scott ... radio\nIf you're in the market for a new Honda you need to visit Honda jak they only the best the best we're talking
