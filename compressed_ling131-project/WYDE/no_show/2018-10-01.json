Russell be joined by Jessica hello my friend our us all it's been a while it's been some\nSide has I yesterday I think I think\nIt has what typically I just pop in with some you know not go headed commentary here there are ridiculous story\nFriday now you're on the captain's chair I Am in the captain's chair and if you see me in the in the I'm In the building I been pacing with a level of nervous energy I've not had in a long long time you know I saw that and I don't know what that's all about Iran all professional writers nothing it'd be nervous about\nWhat I'm nervous about is what I have to say is my opportunity\nTo be on the record with this\nHistoric moment when you're talking about the Kavanaugh stuff right right so\nI have um some notes prepared I have some thoughts to share phone calls to take or going to have some fun so ready to go\nOh I'm looking forward to it I've been looking forward to this since yesterday that's along the yeah I Know [laughter] let's start with story time can we are ready for\nI went to a story about Mrs Johnson Johnson is a woman that ah I used to have daily interactions with ms Johnson ... an older woman miss Johnson did not hear the exact name it would be\nA improper for me to offer that but I worked at a retirement community\nI was a concierge I worked at the front desk of this I did not know it was a it was pretty fancy that was actually a back when I was on the morning show here on superstation when I was on the guys in the evening I work at the front desk this retirement community I worked there for two or three years it real nice facility community in Shelby County so right down the road\nAnd I would be there for like three or four in the afternoon till ten or eleven at night after about five or six just about every bit of key personnel was gone for the day and just about all the residents had retired to their apartments for the evening but about eight or eight thirty one particular nightmares Johnson came to the front desk and she\nWas in a panic she was in a panic because she had not gotten hurt evening meds she tells me that a lot of the residents we'd get medicine in the morning at breakfast medicine in the evening at dinner which was served early five thirty or six and she should have about eight o'clock in a panic that she did not get her medicine\nAnd she was near tears that they've forgotten her these are for diabetes if you didn't get them she was going to go into cardiac arrest it was terrible somebody needs to help now at this point all of the nurses have gone home all of the the medicine had been administered but she is freaking out so\nI the concierge is my job to freak out for her to stay calm but to come to her aid life so I got on the phone and we we\nTried to track down family would try to track down the nurse so many phone calls talking a man's and all these things eventually we tracked down the nurse she was like in a movie or something she comes out and she calls he's like hey what's going on\nAmos Johnson here and uh she's in a panic she didn't get her medicine\nShould I Know she got her medicine I saw it and the other than the dining room oh now she's actually you know pretty worked up she's really believable like that maybe I've got the notes right here I gave her her medicine come to find out she had gotten her medicine and what began that night took place every single evening\nOf sheep gave what was a very believable story right but she suddenly simply could not remember the accurate details of what happened so we set up some protocols to where the nurse would go to her apartment\nStory right but she ... simply could not remember the accurate details of what happened so we set up some protocols to where the nurse would go to her apartment administer the medicine signed her name put a time stamp and everything but that wasn't good enough she had a\nAn account of the events that was believable if you will but simply was\nOn true so it was her reality and that it was it was you know we hear this raise her truth was hurt truth\nBut yet it was untrue I mentioned that to start because believe is not the same thing as truth\nWe watched the Kevin I hearings yesterday we heard from Dr forward in the morning we heard from judge Kavanaugh in the afternoon I Would say and welcome you know your\nThoughts Jessica [noise] to me they were both\nBelievable sir they both had very I'm passionate in their own different ways stories to tell that we're one hundred percent at odds with one another and both concluded that they were one hundred percent certain\nOf their accounts of the facts\nThe problem is both\nProjects are the most dreaded task\nFrom childhood to adulthood no one is motivated and no one wants to do the work selling your

forward today Jessica here as well taking your calls\nTwo oh five nine four one one zero one one or two free one eight\nSix six five five one Ninety nine thirty three the votes out of committee here in the next few minutes a Senate Judiciary committee will see which way it goes keeping our eyes on a handful of kind of undecided Jeff Flake did say a little bit earlier today\nBut he does plan to vote for Brett Kavanaugh he was a face with some protesters in the elevator earlier today in the Senate building it's interesting to me when it comes to\nThis notion\nThat all accusations have to be believed I think it's worthwhile for all act\nAccusations to be investigated and considered for accusations to be heard but this idea that accusations just on their face have to be believed to me is nonsense\nOh I think it's also dangerous in a yesterday you heard a lot of the Democrats staying on and they're supposed to be questioning um it's just for but it said that you see that opportunity to make statements grandstanding if you will\nAnd a lot of them said um you know it's just for it I Believe you and and every time I thought based on what yeah I mean her testimony contains no evidence which is the burden of proof right and she did not present that it was nothing new other than what we've already heard\nSo they're they're saying that both on based on emotion and I think that's a very dangerous place today\nAnd it's just this idea that if I say I'm not yet ready to\nBelieve you or I'm trying to stay neutral and your sexist exactly yeah it's it's received a perceived and reported as though I'm saying you're lying you make a claim I don't have evidence to draw a conclusion\nRussell says he's lying she's like no I'm just trying to listen to what you have to say where is the way we're supposed to do one with the right to the phones we go nine four one one zero one one one eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three to four faction we go to the phones I think this is Clark welcome\nHey Russell yet or are you doing man buddy it's good to be here\nThere you go so is there any doubt whatsoever in your mind that the Democrats\nAre you doing man buddy it's good to be here\nThere you go so is there any doubt whatsoever in your mind that the Democrats held on to these accusations until it was most advantageous for them to release them\nNo not at all so I don't think that Dr Ford herself is is behaving as a partisan hack I Do think the Democrats are right\nAnd Republicans Republicans you know I think in some ways are getting what we could expect will be coming as retaliation for stalling the Merrick Garland nomination back before\nTrump was elected back during the um the election in twenty sixteen because you had Antonin Scalia dying in February Merrick Garland nominated in March and Republicans just refused to have a hearing on him and wanted to run out the clock until election day and they did so for eight or nine months from now obviously\nDemocrats are angry they are going to retaliate now they're doing so in a pretty ugly way but I'm not surprised by their tactics\nWell if they held on to something one time until it was most advantageous to release it do you have any reason to believe they wouldn't do it another time\nI don't know if it works it works it works yeah sure but at the same time so this is where I kind of want to make the distinction okay just because I think these lawmakers might be crooked doesn't mean that Dr Ford is lying and so you know we we we do kind of have to wrestle with these things\nNow here's what I think I think they deliberately have given no corroboration to this point and\nI have an all to be confirmed and probably a week and a half to two weeks before the midterm election\nThey're going to come forth with a more substantial evidence and they had so far\nAnd the narrative will be the Republicans wouldn't listen they wouldn't even investigate they put her rights is on the Supreme Court this was what's terrible people they are and we're leading up there doing a rope a dope right now leading up to their surprise yeah\nHey good call call and we get to some other calls here I appreciate your phone in and thank you very much either next step who's this\nThis is Mike Mike why you do for faction\nThank you sir is good to hear from you again next\nUh you know after watching this thing with Kevin ... I've come to the realization there's no way I could run for political office\nBecause I happen to remember back in the early sixties when I was in second grade a buddy of mine and I uh would catch the girls as they can down the slide as they hit the bottom and kiss or\nHowever we did get caught and uh we\nReceived quick a punishment for although it was cruel and unusual because we had to kiss\nAre a hundred and eighty year old teacher on the ... [laughter] oh I was so [laughter] I was so traumatized I never kissed another girl in my mid\nTwenties wow well I'm a I'm Sorry that you had such a rough go thank you for the call I appreciate the body [laughter] it's the forward a faction here super station one on one W why the high there who's this\nAnd that hey go right ahead\nIt's just a quick observing what most of the rating yesterday a hearing I guess you might say is that what your caller but I noticed that she left Jack's to leave that come up also or you give her arrow sold so that his show it is so far\nThough that a little something something do we have any idea what that is\nWell Sheila Jackson Lee or she is senator I Know she's at one she was on a talk show here\nSome something that we have any idea what that is\nSheila Jackson Lee he or she is senator are no shoes at one she was older talk show here are here local or state or steak he had a chance to ask her early voter id program where they had for years ... let's see if we can get them or not do it for years and she fell apart and they are they're all\n[laughter] I hear it yeah it was pretty strange told her it was the first stories the one thing\nYou know what let me let me let me stop you there because I didn't hear a whole lot of inconsistencies but rather I did hear she was unable to fill in some of the details and not on air but off air I say you know that matches up with how my brain works honestly\nI think of all the important things in my life they were um they're just a little brief moments in my mind I Can't give you detail about every little thing that happened is a part of that day eight ... my brain doesn't work that way so I don't hold that against her\n... well I remember my heart is the arm member the words I don't remember anything that does is it\nIs true which is a judge and the lawyers are happy to distance itself from mark judge yeah but if you're in a Warner's did not have trouble that the judge will help with that not the only thing that they're embarrassed about warmed up I got jeopardize that\nThey can age today there as a user what for women to not abused their bodies ... straighten up the world a little bit and I feel like they wanted to do it\nSets a gut Oh thank you thank you buddy I appreciate it two oh five nine four one one zero one one or two a free one eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three a little bit later this hour I Would like to get into the nature\nOf accusations and this idea that whatever accusation is offered accusations must be believe actually learn something new today Jessica I didn't ... it was exciting\nNow I've heard plenty of times the biblical principle of an eye for an I write a tooth for two that's an Old Testament principle that Jesus modified in the New Testament but in the Old Testament I'm actually that comes up in I think it is a book do around me chapter Nineteen I learned this today\nIn relation to false accusations\nThat God takes him very seriously than if you are going to slander your neighbor if you're going to say something accuse them of something that\nIs proven to be false you knowingly tone a lie about them whatever harm you meant to bring them\nShould once it's been determined you're a false accuser that punishment should then be brought on you and that's where that phrase is used just one of the handful of times and the Old Testament so it's not hey someone\nGouged out your eyes you take their right right it's mentioned that way elsewhere but here in this particular passage into ... is listen if you meant to bring harm on someone on your neighbor and you falsely accused them whatever harm you meant for them should be given to you and I think about how\nTwo oh five nine four one one zero one one toll free one eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three this is the Ford faction will get back to the phones here\nHappened to take your calls George welcome up man your next time recipe welcome\nThank you for taking my call at\nThe shore ah\nYou know would come out of people's lives are much right for everything their work\nOr do you know you're not just where I'm sure about it you know there should be handled the\nFor coming out and just when somebody and I'm not just south of capping off fast sports we've got a lot of people that are so low smile about things and they are definitely people's character and everything else there should be able to be for that and there is it called for all\nYeah let me let me ask you to do again to specify a little bit more clearly if you can so are you making the case that someone should be punished\nIf they can't fully provide enough evidence are you saying simply they should be punished if they're telling something that's known to be false\nWhat I'm saying is whatever the case is okay\nIf you're coming come in after somebody and ... ... ... I mean there's lots and destroyed or no matter what happens is whether or not I mean it just is is that it is\nI mean it's like no matter what happens is whether or not I mean this is a it is put on a different ... even that there should be able to in a fan so\nWell she he's been defame if\nIf he didn't do the things that she claims but if he did and I don't think that's him being the famed isn't\nWell well the thing is you know whatever the there ought to be the option there ought to be the opposite of a ... or ... or ... or\n... you know I'll say if I was going to hold anybody responsible honestly it'd be the Democrats because they're the ones he made a dog and pony show out of this you know they could have done all of this and confidentiality and non front of the American people which is what has led to his reputation being tarnished but instead they chose to drag it out to the public square and they did that intentionally with political motivations\nAnd that's what's led to all of this I mean and I'm not saying she doesn't hold some blame in that because I don't know what her motivations were but there have been pretty clear\n... absolutely I agree a hundred percent\nLike George my gotcha we appreciate that call do oh five nine four one one zero one one toll free one eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three that some of the hypocrisy that I find so maddening that the Democrats want to\nAct as though they're the party for women and yet they had if we're led to believe these are credible allegations of wrongdoing by cabin on\nThe case should have been made much sooner but as everybody pointed out they sat on that information so you've got Dianne Feinstein who was up there sitting as though she's a champion for this woman and we can't tell us how the information got league doesn't know how the letter gone out there doesn't know how her name was published and yet\nRepublicans at the eleventh hour are supposed to make all sorts of concessions they haven't made every concession but I think they made a lot of concern and they've gone out of their way I'm at the end of last week they were talking about okay if she wants to testify will go anywhere we need to go to take her testimony\nAs she has until Monday Monday became Thursday so she had an opportunity she had an opportunity to speak before\nThe committee yesterday it seemed um\nThat you know she was treated with a level of respect he wasn't punished\nWhen I even brought in a prosecutor brought out by themselves and\nI felt like there wasn't the level of scrutiny that anyone needs to have it was just almost the assumption that you are telling the truth we believe you the accuser right we don't believe you the accused\nWell look at the level of disrespect they treated Kavanaugh with you know and then compare that they were really an search for the truth and I'm Talking about the Democrats why didn't they ask her more questions because when they had their chance when she was before then had to dig more into her story because we are told they they want to get they weren't FBI investigation as they want to get the truth of the matter\nWhy did they spend their five minutes just praising her and there's nothing wrong with throwing a line in there about a or courageous we appreciate there\nBut you need to ask her questions into your due diligence and I don't know that we saw that\nI Do find it annoying for all the lawmakers and uh I ... I think Ted Cruz is still talking you know when he had his comments today he went on a forever and ever and then the senator from New Jersey\nA Cory Booker who also wants to run for president and twenty twenty his grandstanding these lawmakers they just wear me out of depending upon where they are they're districts and how they're going to be perceived by their constituents how they're going to be perceived by the parties\nAir me out and so depending upon where they are they're districts and how they're going to be perceived by their constituents how they're going to be perceived by the parties at large as possible national candidates I'm\nIs what you get for them and they just go on and on and on and blather on\nThat's why I loved Lindsey Graham yesterday oh I'm not a huge fan and Lindsey Graham but what I felt he said was a natural response to the situation as he saw it absolute worst Ted Cruz on the Republican side Cory Booker on the Democratic side they just go on and on so they can have more and more face time on TV right it just wears me out\nWell I mean I think they're exposing our motivations it's all about them than Riley actually trying to make a point\nI mean my thing is we are talk show hosts it is our job to fill time where they are talking today are lawmakers I what they think their job is to talk show host or TV cable news pundits no because senator\nMr calling it'd be\nSo two oh five nine four one one one one it's all free one eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three I'm One of the Democrats that has gotten a little pushback from people who I actually didn't mind was a Sheldon Whitehouse\nIs democratic on a road island he's on the committee um\nDuring the questioning of cabin I he was kind of getting a cabinet to to explain some of the references in the year book and in the moment I was irritated and like come on it's just stuff in your book but then upon further review I have some have some people say that maybe Kevin I wasn't as\nForthright with some of the definitions now some of them were told her about flatulence or drinking games are but come to find out there are online definitions that suggest these aren't drinking game yeah sniff is a matter of flatulence it was much worse behavior than that\nAnd that Kavanaugh wasn't forthcoming I don't know these are not terms I was familiar with but\nI thought that he wasn't just ... for the camera I thought that this this particular Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse yesterday I was trying to get to the truth today in his comments ahead of the vote this ... this afternoon\nI thought was a pretty grounded so I can deal with him I don't want to be the kind of person that all Republicans are good all Democrats are bad I I Want if you if you're\nWe're all going to have our own\nPoints of view world view biases biases um but at least try to play fair and I felt like to the best that his ability he was doing\nThat but I don't remember his questioning as much I Do remember the year book and I guess the euro but just ended up itself irritated me for the same reasons you were just talking about 'cause it seems ridiculous yeah well and because if you think back to really more than your book was like you know in the in the center of everything\nBut I Would say this about the year book as part of us wants to roll their eyes I Can't believe the year book but if\nKavanaugh is going to use things he wrote as a teenager on a calendar as a defense right\nThen it's fair I think to use what he wrote or his friends wrote in a year book at least for consideration not that you're sending him to the death penalty based on these things but hey okay it sounds like you were running pretty loose with your language and talk about partying you present yourself in this testimony as though you're a choir boy but\nSome of these things here give us pause I I don't think that's out of bounds\nI don't think it's out of balance it was just personally irritating and even

choices we make and it's been very clear that\nSeedlings are now prominent in our society and feelings or whatnot if someone is did if someone takes outlook or or the wrong way now in other countries that can be prosecuted because they made similar to feel\nDifferent instead of you know fact which is they committed a crime they did something very evidence and she is simply saying that this happened but there are no facts\nTo cooperate so you know yes she should get a day in court or day before the hearing to say what she believes happened but at the end of the day it is a simple personal beliefs it is not sexual or\nYou know able to cooperate her story\nThank you Lynn for the call sister nine\nI appreciate your chicken and well a follow up on that here in just a moment I Want to check in and we've got a Senator Lindsey Graham is\nTrying to trying his best to\nBring the country together and vote the best where he knows how so I don't know that the agreement I'll get back with you and that sort of home loans I don't uh so I'm going to go talk to him right now would be a good idea to honor the last time I look do you need ... votes [laughter]\n[laughter]\nWell all I can

going to take what it is up to the majority leader it's up to Mitch McConnell to say yes I'll concede to wait a week and have an FBI investigation a kind of a chuckle when the snicker there if someone's going to have to explain this to the president\nAnd I guess that's my job Lindsey Graham says I'm so we have moved out of committee that has happened were\nI might be with who met here 'cause he maybe ... maybe he hears it that way I go home and let me get let me jump in here and be squishy for\nA second I'm Tucker Carlson I don't like always refers to him as creepy porn star lawyers are just ... get just call him by his name and his appropriate title and if you don't like what he has to say challenged him with his ideas but the mockery doesn't seem to be helping I my I myself I\nDon't like when that happens if if I Am convinced that my ideas or ride and your ideas are wrong I shouldn't have to miss characterize your viewpoint to make mine\nExactly not only find that I see that he ... they don't like and he ... total lie about your thoughts\n[laughter] that's true [laughter] that sounds\nGood who may have a good good to hear from your buddy we got to take the

great options behind the scenes like guy to garage doors free re photo after more more than a race to sell a Degas\nWas forty of 'em the Ford faction traditions of the original state inspired\nApparel companies they offer upscale casual quoted including shirts hats out a way of ties shores and accessories was subtle stage civil West I'm guessing you probably want to represent our ... you don't have

you mean as I said well you said to bump sacrifice a lot of\nMoney [laughter] [noise]\nI read that will get\nThe most to her lungs superstition mortal one do you want to do [noise]\nOn a Sunday that new for insight bill Wilson right here on the one on one of you why do you\nCountry station superstition one on the ...\n[noise]\nIt's more action Russell bead Jessica here in for for to be back with us on Monday appreciate him letting us um have an opportunity to enjoy this forum in the midst of this cabinet story there is an aspect of it which is discuss but not given perhaps\nThe moral focus I think we would be wise to heat if I may just a moment the allegations brought against Kavanaugh on that while he was drunk\nHe did these terrible things further more\nDespite his passionate denials Democrats questioning him yesterday kept coming back to his drinking and his drunkenness and his lack of judgment memory lapses impairment\nHe can't deny that he drink to excess at times\nThat doesn't mean he did these things that he's accused of doing but I Can't help but think how the Bible warns us against drunkenness\nAvoid drunkenness it says because drunkenness leads to debauchery drunk and this leads to the kinds of things that get people in trouble get people pregnant get people into a lot of lot of bad situations and\nI Know we want to ride off that well\nEverybody does it everybody did it what's the big deal but the Bible is true and there is wisdom in it and so it's not just haphazardly mentioned but that we ought not to be\nConcerned\nAnd there is wisdom in it and so it's not just haphazardly mentioned but that we ought not to be consuming so many\nThings whether it's alcohol or drugs or prescription med whatever may be that its clowning our thinking because once our thinking is clouded than our behavior is just completely run off the rails\nAnd so it's hard for him to offer a defense I didn't do this when part of the accusation is he was drunk at the time and there are a lot of people can say yeah he used to drink a lot in my own admission he used to\nDrink a lot and he still enjoys every now and again\nAnd so just a you know we would do well to slow down on the Bruce ... just to touch it's the fourth faction back to the phones we go let's get to Danny Hi welcome\nHey man I'm so proud of what you're saying about the drinking but he says he didn't do it because they don't remember it so that's kind of a a a kind of a way that they could twisted around and say well you you probably did it but since you got drunk you don't remember\nIt right it does seem like it's kinda like circular logic you'd go round and round and I never did why didn't you do it well because I Would have remembered what uh what if you didn't remember well right I don't remember right that they prefer that you know [laughter]\nOh one one thing that I had to really really settle into with this whole situation is\nHe's not going to be prosecuted for any thing that he did way back then uh it's essentially a job interview and when you're interviewing people for the job I Know this is a big job it's a lifetime position being interviewed by people that are that come and go\nI'm what has he done for the past thirty six years what's his record what's as witnesses how he votes how he's voted and I asked her how he's judged\nUm that should come into play here more than what he did when he was a dumb high school kid at a party\nUm their their bowl and its way out of proportion because uh if they were trying to prosecute him for what he did back then I can understand but there's there's no there's no prosecution involved here it's it's all ears here say and\nI don't I don't disagree here's a maybe a just a point worth considering though is he is definitely qualified to do the job but based on the damage inflicted by this process\nCan I still state definitively that he's the best person for the job he could clearly do it but he went from the short list to the number one candidate after all of this do we still\nSay he's the number one choice and all of the country who could do it if the answer is yes you vote yes but if not you know that's ...\nYeah I mean we're for somebody with a record that judge may have a clean record like he does I mean imagine if Cory Booker Booker was your judge\n[laughter] dude has been found guilty of that stuff he admitted it\nRight he wrote a he wrote an op ed about it he did he put his hands all over and I'm sure no doubt what rat that\nSomebody had the judge me when they are they're worse than I Am there they're judging on based on the law not their personal actions of course\nIn a good called in I got him other costs to get to I don't mean to cut you off but I Want to hit them before the bottom of the hour to the phones we'd go Brett you're on the Ford faction\nHire all if I Want to say that we are we are and they're like the happy I can start off with Marilyn did a report on it do you have always been bothered here you have to be armed but the guy\nAnd there it is a good call thank you buddy it's a Ford faction Ryan your next step and two oh five nine four one one oh one one recipe and Jessica here go right ahead\nHello how are you doing today\nA faction Ryan your next step or two oh five nine four one one one one recipe and Jessica here go right ahead\nHello are you doing today\nMan we're doing we're doing well we're we're seeing here that the Senate Judiciary committee they've moved the votes that they passed it through by a vote of eleven to ten Jeff Flake the Republican out of Arizona wants you to be an FBI investigation that may happen that's up to Mitch McConnell will think\nYou're going to do on them in office anymore or at least some of us don't yeah but uh you know some of the other Republican some of them just\nTo our a biometric or a mother you're from Arizona when you're impressed that I knew the accent I'm making that up [laughter] [laughter] I noticed\nYou said that I think that you were studying or when he came back in the last a major break or what do you have to break he said that eleven Republican David yes and eleven Tony Republican voted no\nI'm Sorry I'm it was like oh like already [laughter] it's a ... by a moment we're all coming together and hour division\nSo yes eleven Republicans and Democrats voting no\nYeah now I can just make them understand where exactly is ending for him because he he wants to appeal is not only a\nConservative Republican voters that are in Arizona which is a red state but he also wants to be able to come back and say hey I or you know I didn't hear it diligently to all of the ... justice lawyers\nWe're we're in a better position if this has to happen in order to gain flakes ... does it not for the Democrats know it would be solely to get the Republicans in the squish is on board so they can ... get past I Need to embrace your inner square [laughter]\nNow the show began believe is not the same as truth yes I heard in a sense of not the same as not guilty the there are different and\nConfirmation is not the same as endorsement right that there are things that are similar but they're not quite the same yesterday to me and I have give you an opportunity to share your views [noise]\nThat to me both were believable both witnesses Dr Ford in the morning mhm judge Kavanaugh in the afternoon both had what felt like believable testimony about what happened or didn't happen I could believe them both\nBoth can't be true one is untrue one is true I Can't quite tell I tend I don't know I kind of go I'm squishy I go I\nGo back and forth I Would say as as many have said there wasn't enough information from Dr Ford enough evidence for me to say Brett Kavanaugh you're guilty there just wasn't but they're certainly wasn't any evidence that was offered that she's lying she seems to really believe that they had a\nLong ball she named who said didn't happen\nWell and except for all the vague answers the on specific answers that are clearly a an opening for liars to get away with it because they can't be contradicted with actual fact sure so here's this was like those I got a couple\nOf at a time so it is true that the people that she wanted the back of her story couldn't\nBut two of them certainly weren't Brett Kavanaugh was not going to say yes I tried to rape you\nA mark judge his friend who's also accused of being in the room and who isn't going to say yes I tried to rape you and then it's the the the accounts of the friend Leland whether when she was downstairs good she know what was potentially happening up there I'm not saying that I Believe\nThat it did happen all I'm saying is I Can't tell you right here and now I promised that it did and I don't know if they left the gate and needs to continue a little bit\nFine let me remind you of what ... said she didn't just say I don't know what happened up there she says I don't remember interacting with Brent Kavanaugh ever okay and I don't remember the party ever happening\nSo it she's not even so she's not saying yeah I knew Brett and we had party but nothing I don't remember anything happening and I don't remember running away she doesn't even recognize the fact that she knows Brett Kavanaugh or that the party ever happened\nHad the Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse earlier today Democrats of Rhode Island and he held up um\nA display of part of Brett Kavanaugh's calendar and the diary and there's one particular date that has a gathering mentioned and it seems like if you\n... that the conclusions that he was drawing is that there's like six or seven boys going to a particular house around the time that it may have occurred that looks like if you decide for the the the writings of a high school boy that there may have been going for beer\nHouse around the time that it may have occurred that looks like if you decipher the the the writings of a high school boy that there may have been going for beers with the group of people that may have been the\n... question I Know what you're talking about it's July first okay that's that injury is the one opening they think might be when it happened so if you give\nThe FBI Seventy two hours to look into that possibility and she doesn't have a lot of things you can't quite remember where it happened when it happened exactly we've had conversations in the hallway the last couple of days in my life I Can't remember all the specifics of everything but I can remember\nDefinitive moments but if you ask me all the details I ... I I Can't offer those details it doesn't mean those things didn't happen so if it takes another Seventy two hours to get to the bottom of this and I do understand in a kind of a slippery slope thing of right if you let this happen well then what happens when the next allegation comes\nI get it but if you watch Jeff Flake devote\nYes I understand this is the only path forward yeah yeah I yeah I agree with you just look at this sets a bad precedent on process but here's the other thing too you're dealing with\nSneaky snake [laughter] flaky like you're dealing with sneaky snakes all of those Democrats let me tell you if this goes on for a week they will be dredging up everybody on the streets of Maryland that's where I find out who they could get to make another accusation and to lay it\nFor a while and they say it it'll say within the scope of the current allegations but I just I don't know that I have any confidence that will be the case let me tell you why your both terrible [laughter]\nWe'll get some phone calls in a minute and I love you both in your very smart very passionate and very well informed\nHere's why I take the approach I take and I'd love to give you a hundred an opportunity to explain why you take the path that you all I'm rare and okay [laughter] [noise] the things that come out of my mouth are not simply for the people who agree with me\nOkay they're mostly for the people who don't agree with me\nI Want to persuade people of my point of view because I think my point of view is right I'm open that it might be wrong\nI'm squishy but I Do believe based on\nNot just for this but we use as an example of hears of you that I have and here's how I arrived at the conclusion that I reach kind of like in school when you have mathematics show your work here so I arrived at the conclusion that I reached\nSometimes the things that I here on TALK radio or in politics are so\nCombative even if someone on the other side might possibly be swayed by the facts that I have\nThe approach that I have is going to be so off putting so I don't want if I have a Democrat who's listening I don't want to call them a snake or a flake or I mean I Know a joke and we laugh but\nYou know whether it's in sharing our faith are sharing our politics I don't want to demonize the other side I Want to say listen to his how I see it tell me how you see it and let's find the truth sometimes the truth is in the middle sometimes not sometimes or a hundred percent wrong or maybe I'm a hundred percent wrong\nBut\nI think we can say this is what I Believe and this is where the Republicans got it right and this is where the Democrats I think got it wrong without saying they're all a bunch of snakes I Can't\nGo there well I I think the and I'm answering for her like she needs it but I think the reaction\nThat you're experiencing are sensing comes from the passion that we all feel from seeing this man who is a ... I mean volunteers and purposes an upstanding man of God having his life ruined you know and he talks about a ten year old daughter praying for Dr Ford and I think that ripped everybody's hearts out whether you believe it or not it was\nHaving his life ruined you know when he talks about a ten year old daughter praying for a doctor for it and I think that ripped everybody's hearts out whether you believe it or not it was an emotional moment and I think the reaction and calling them snakes and everything is because they are willing to burn someone at the stake for political purposes\nI agree Jessica and yet it is partly because of what's going what's happening to Kavanaugh but at the deeper level or here's the problem\nThese Democrats already transmitted where they stand that they were going to oppose him sure we're never going to vote for him and this had nothing to do even with the actual sexual assault allegations I had to do with his judicial record\nSo they already transmitted this is a bad face engagement there is no good face here they already projected where they stand and where their outcome is there for\nAny other they did that at the start so any other maneuvers that happened afterwards where they pretend to be a well we just really just want to you know do a thorough is to get we just really want to we really want to make the process for the sake of America\nAnd the American people who are watching we want to know that we did our due to the ... let me stop the problem is they're lying and if we're going to fall for the lies we're going to get trampled every time\nIf there are a liar you call them out a liar you treat them like a liar and you don't engage in further contracts or process is with a liar where you allow them to win now to be\nClear Jesus company will brutal vibrates as well so you're not alone and going to say it was ... [laughter] that's the Hebrew translation adult him snake he said it it I'm or main four\nVoters so this is a political right so we want the votes for cabinet but we also want the votes in the mid term we want people to vote not just\nFor a candidate but for a way of thinking okay\nThey may be snakes and they may be liars I'm not trying to convince them I'm trying to convince the people that may vote for those liars did not vote for them and I want to convince my side to be men and women of integrity\nWell and I think that that's fine that's great and the first start is to put the line down and say we don't engage with liars yeah\nThat was what you're saying that you don't want to be so polarizing that you turn away the other side exactly that I bought it for it [laughter] I can I can actually does push people away I get ... I understand\nThat I really do you don't want to be abrasive and bras in just a a hard person to live with\nBut there is a point now where we have to draw the line and say this is a point where you guys have already lied we cannot trust you this is a matter of trust and we would rather in um build up the trust we have with the American people who voted as in\nBy standing firm on the truth and the process and the fact that you guys are delaying and sneaky snakes\nAnd we're not going to call for it I Love it when I read gone back full bank a golf here on the board ... America where common sense is not so common is [noise]\n\nDo anything the ramifications are going to be very painful especially in the next midterm elections and the next election is going to look as if the Republicans were not sensitive towards an issue\nThat has put Randy Randy Randy consider this they had the woman up on Capitol Hill tell her story and she did not provide any more accurate\nIf he were out of time is the Ford faction the two oh five nine four one on one on one one toll free one eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three Russell be Andrea ties Jessica and your phone calls next [noise]\n\nDo why do you have for whom do you do do we do we're we're superstitious one on one there'll be ...\nThe following program was a ... program and does not reflect the views of station management or sponsors\nYou wanted FBI investigation you could have come to us what you want to do is destroyed this guy's life hold this seat open and hope you win at twenty twenty you this is the most ethical\nTroy this guy's life hold this seat open and hope you win at twenty twenty and it's just a note on ethical\nSham since I've been in politics and if you really wanted to know the truth you sure as hell wouldn't have done what you've done to this guy is this is going to destroy\nThe ability of good people to come for because of this crap you have interacted with professional women all your life not one accusation you're supposed to be Bill Cosby when you're a junior and senior in high school\nAnd all of a sudden you got over it\nIt's been my understanding\nThat if you drug women and write them for two years in high school you probably don't stop here's my understanding you could live the good life people recognize\n[noise]\nPlan inform decrease which is what people have got to know whether or not their president as it is a crisis of confidence I have a job\nThe governments in this town is excellent and uses your tax dollars [noise]\nWe've got to do a better job of getting close to the moon\nTo the truth is that\nWill keep it from the American people [noise]\nThat would be the merits [noise] almost most mostly [noise]\n[noise]\n\nConservative [noise] controversial who's the man was for for this country [noise] and he's not afraid to watch on his mind [noise]\nOr law [noise] sure [noise]\nGuinea\nJobs are the ones on getting the job\nMarket rate would be in vain indicating the brain\nYou're not getting\nThe Joe\nAll right American is two minutes after they all of your lucked into his radio show and America someone on a hundred thousand what station yeah we're the number one radio talk show in laying the Joe ... show where we love we hate and we definitely going to be debating what's been going on this week in the new\nO.

I Know that for a fact that said this woman said she did not want this to come out\nShe wanted to remain anonymous\n... they're they're in a day and one Senator Feinstein said the same thing yes so my question has always been everybody's talking about it now but my question was back then how did it leave Senator Feinstein this how did he get the committee\nWill end and it never got the committee that's the thing but I'm saying how do they get from her death to the public somebody she did from her office either her and one of her staff or she ...\nShe was in charge when they see in the state wasn't going to go that way and I don't care about somebody from her office she she gave the lady gave it to her ... okay if I give you a piece of paper said brown don't tell nobody but let this be something that you know the go to your judgment you when you're making a judgment on on this person\nI trust you know Brian for you not to put my name out there but I'm I feel I'm doing the right thing because you may not know this right okay it it leaves your office Brian\nI'm not mad at your office you know I'm ...

I think and I and I and I was thinking about this taking that information into consideration ... that the reason Dianne Feinstein didn't release the information is because it can't be corroborated it was an anonymous tip\nShe wanted to remain anonymous and she knew that even with an FBI investigation that it could not be corroborated mhm and I think that maybe one of her staffers\nWere so upset that they had this information and they were sitting on it\nThat they ... instead of dying Feinstein ... less conspiracy theory and all but I read it but it's taken in some additional information that was provided to the American public if you were listening\nOkay even if that may be so okay let's just say hypothetically what you're saying is actually correct ... almost say that you give somebody give you something in my office on on a lock it in media ... right you decided to leak it out\nIt is my duty to come to the American people and say someone in my office this out this is the problem that happened and I need to fix it or I Need to lose my job\nYeah period you feel that I live with that that that's what I'm saying yeah she did nothing I don't care what part of her off but it was leaked from as Ronald Reagan fame nearly ended up the buck stops here right you didn't stand your behind\nWe go first to get something by the uh we got to get through [noise]\nThe governor of other story within a couple of uh [noise]\n[noise] so we want to do you ever told me why do you do you do thirty seven and a bourbon W we do do do\n\nDo you find yourself wearing the same thing over and over how about not knowing how to apply your make up for enhanced your feature ... is what you've\nBeen looking for the last offered one on one styling for drug shopping closet reconstruction beauty classes and much more to help you with your fast at work or at\nFor Siena a sequel ups today and take advantage of our radio only special offers call to five six six to for several uh Ninety five right now or head to W.

and I go do my duty and you know it it takes to get this out here in California right this is a citizen see are actors I had a guy was say sure I Can't come to show why not he goes I gotta go door to rolling a biker zombie movie I'm like Los Angeles excuse I ever heard\nLike you're you're not going to be larger while [laughter] a colonel or you know what you get into kind of\nA little bit current topics um\nYou know obviously we had a a\nA a hearing this past Thursday and uh it's kinda gripped not only our country um but it's also grip the world from one of the reports that uh that I've been seeing in reading\nUh what is your assessment on a you know what we're witnessing right now and current politics based upon not only this past Thursday but in the past few weeks in general\nLook I I I Can't tell you how a a just point and worried I Am about what to\nIn the past few weeks in general\nLook I I I Can't tell you how a a just point and worried I Am about what this says about our country look I served in Kosovo I saw what happens when the rule of law disintegrates becomes a rule of power\nOr the rule of law has foundations\nSome of the foundations include the presumption of innocence the right to due process that means confronting your accuser with hard questions asked by zealous advocate trying to under cut\nThe story that's how you test the truth if someone survive cross examination you've got a pretty good idea that person's telling the truth we haven't seen that because we're being told you're not allowed to question accusations you've got a presumed guilt that is the most American thing I've ever heard it's dangerous it's what a dictators too\nAnd and it's gotten accepted by a lot of our all eat a lot of them and that's very very dangerous\nI totally agree with the corona um you know I'm very disappointed in the system I'm very disappointed that we're allowing this to happen and after this FBI investigation is over oh I'm just coming up I think they really need to investigate the Democratic party they need to investigate on Senate upon the and I do want to find out and I want to know as an American citizen\nIn any fashion really write a during their preliminary hearing sessions and you are going up to the usually the interview takes place after they've been confirmed or to uh to the seat\nAnd I think he he felt he had to do that 'cause he kept saying even um during the hearing that I wanted to come in the next day and speak so I think he just thought his character his lab who has been attacked and as a man you want to defend that\nYeah you want to defend this honor he wanted to just send a lot of ... a mischaracterization of who he is and and then as any person I think I don't think it's a man or woman or you know singling them out I just think any person\nThat is going to be attacked in the way that he's attacked regardless of how ... what I Believe in the lower and whether or not he's guilty or innocent um\nYou need to defend yourself I I\nI have no problem with what he did ... right because of a demand I've probably been ... been on Twitter about I've been doing some kind of Facebook Live you know going after it right um so I get that this is the question that I have just like I had questions for Dr Ford even though I didn't get into this but the doctor for things\nShe threw me bra okay with the airplane thing I wanted to go before before I get back to what you owe me oh you test them\nOh yeah I Want to say that 'cause I'm going to go in and we just got about one back because I Want to be fair to both of them as I'm Talking about all I Want to treat him fairly owned the doctor for an issue mhm it look bad and this is where it looked really really really really really really really really really\nReally bad for her she postponed it hurts that it had endanger doc device that she postponed it because she says she was afraid to fly right okay\nWhen ... acts about all these other places they she went to Costa Rica or Australia whatever other places where it was a litany of list of things you went to vacation and she said how does she get there she says she flew\nBut it's easier for the flack has gone for a vacation than it used to come for here okay that was like you look really really bad when you said that because now mhm it made me question her\nWell and then there was another thing that at the beginning rather she gave her testimony in it was either the first or second a five minute questioning that was provided for her ... where they were going into the letter in the statement\nAnd she went through and she started correcting\nThe letter ... that she had invited and changed her story ... ... skin and that's that and that's where I question her credibility on judge Kavanaugh on whether or not\nHe did it and he his guilt is on those two instances and especially when you're sitting there and I'm watching and she's like okay alright scratching making notes okay I'll get in and just I Need to ... to correct that ... well we already know that you've changed your story now about four times ...\nIf this was true one you would have to be reading it mhm to it would be consistent and two thousand twelve and it has been inconsistent\nI agree with you on that and here's the other part that I Want to say that I'm as she was talking about the airplanes the situation and she could not fly\nShe postponed because of that ... okay\nNow when she postponed it says she wanted to do it on Thursday on Monday or Tuesday another woman came out ... okay she postponed says she couldn't fly right we all said OK blah blah blah come to see somebody on Monday\nYeah okay she postponed says she couldn't fly right we all said OK blah blah blah\nCome to see somebody on Monday or Tuesday another woman came out of it too it was almost there when they when Michael von ... Lynch chase creepy porn where um that was that was when I was out when they are but the uh Deborah Ramirez came out on Monday\nShe must have one right yeah it was at Yale Law right that's that's the one okay but it\nEven if it it may have been may not be I don't know but what am I say what it looks like to me ... okay like I said I'm from politics to the side yeah there's just a logic\nYou postpone because you hear something else will come out with other women can come out of support what you do if you wanted to postpone and you lied well now you're making it to where because of the biggest thing that they were trying that they were trying\nTo solidify ... was that in cases where a man 'cause it's generally with with in the gender of the male gender ...\nThere's a pattern right and what she was talking about the statements that contradicted her stories over the last few years there was no pattern would judge Kavanaugh especially if it's a highly live that life what he's doing for females\nIn my right and the law profession right is antithetical to who he was in who he is ... and their ... and there was no basis of\nContinuing patterns now all the sudden because that criticism comes up\nBeside you lay host Conan route with in Monday through Thursday you now have two additional story\nRight both of them are moving further and further but um but see but you got to think about his Ron\nI'm Sorry to cut you off but he I think about this this is why I say it it made me question back up on my break right because our money somebody's came out they wanted to do it on Wednesday the Republican Party wanted to have this thing on Monday remember them yes but they held on Monday she says she couldn't do it they said let's do it when\nShe says she wasn't going to do if she wanted to do it on Thursday said okay what happened in the twelve hours on Wednesday Julia sweating it came out\nMight live on okay be born where again now this was like inside information be unfair to hold off as long as you can stole you got caught in a law\nNow even what she said is true I'm going to say this it looks bad it looks like you're playing politics now you know even though you was it\nThis part of your story that they're made me say a come on baby girl that's wrong okay she\n... and here's another thing that we learned or about her testimony was one that both of her lawyers are doing this pro bono even though\nAn omelet loop was slip to them or by Sheila Jackson\nAnd do they mean it looks at you you want to say about things that look bad that look bad and the other thing is within six days of senator Feinstein's office receiving the letter ... with out in discussing with Senate Judiciary committee chairman Senator Grassley ... they contacted her\nAnd got her in connections with lawyers\nLike I said the way it started off a doctor for it she was she didn't want to be in this ... once she got ingrained into this in my personal opinion politics aside she started playing a game yeah that's the way I look back\nAnd and it does look bad and then it in the credibility of your story goes out the golden ... is a big time yeah and then almost goes out the window because again even if you want to fight for her right it don't look good because\nThe other women when it came out if you want to get caught fly all the places okay I get you write I would've had a little bit more credibility idle sway one way\nThe other women when it came out if\nYou want to get caught flat other places okay I get you write I would've had a little bit more credibility idols way one way or the other one is because like I said I was not that there are six years ago I don't know what happened but she has some holes in her story that people who did not who wanted to believe are probably pushed away at that\nPoint well and even the the sex crimes prosecutor that was brought into question both a judge Kavanaugh and Dr Ford and she sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary committee based upon the evidence that I've been able to see in witness you both testimonies I could not bring this to court this is not a nice that can be no ...\nAnd caught this when I went in with judge Kavanaugh would have been nominated as good a good a good move on to the doctor I'm ... not like a full but just having a judge ... three three um but I Want to make sure that only showed that we've been fair yeah flowers or you know there's like a ... to ... I don't want to be talking about one person and they leave out the hose and that story\nI'm just Kevin Oh we got ready to go to break out well before I go to break 'em I'm On the whole oh I'm I Want to put it out just Kevin ... gave to testimonies okay um this past week ... woman's on Fox News\nAnd one was that the here mhm\nI got a question and if we can answer to the ... hit me also because America on the other side with a with a real judge Kevin up please stand up eight six six five by one no not really why not see 'em come to you know that you're locked in to the job market\nShow [noise]\n\n\n\nAre you tired of the daily hysteria in hyper sensationalism of CNN and MSNBC and Fox News joined means Brian people every Saturday Seventeen Eighteen as we cut through the noise the station was and bring you the stories you need to know who are the people with Brian\nEvery Saturday seven or eight new was it was a market [noise]\nAre you a male suffering from urinary frequency pay Romney's disease or a reptile dysfunction while we have a non invasive and a painless treatment that is a low intensity shock wave that improves blood\nAnd we got to the realization that you do the same [noise] All right guys when we come back we're\nGoing to continue this conversation about the judge Kavanaugh will catch it on the other side while as we get the as soon as we come back [noise]\nDo you why do you see a coma do you do you see when we were super six of one on one W windy\nYeah\n[noise] do you find yourself wearing the same thing over and over how about not knowing how to apply your makeup for enhanced you feature that is what you've been looking for the last I for one on one styling for drug shopping closet reconstruction beauty classes and much more to help you with your fast at work\nChristina as people have to sit down and take advantage of our radio only national offer cost to fix fix to for Democrats Ninety five right now our heads to W.

Kavanaugh\nWill go ahead and continue out on the phone lines wallets how're you doing this evening\nThat you're sure I was doing the right to me up there so the investigation will be judged all the judge or will it be equally between the two of the lake which is you know they let on\nIt it's going to be an equal investigation they have to uh basically what the FBI is going to do\nAnd this is the only thing the FBI can do is it's information gathering and so they're going to be talking to Dr Ford they're going to be talking to mark judge they're going to be talking to Brett Kavanaugh but they're also going to be talking to um the other two women who have come out with the allegations as well\nAnd then they were going to a form of those in two statements and provided to the Senate\nOr it is more wound up it's not like a super\nIn depth investigation where you know you're going to try and uncover everything basically what what the FBI investigation is going to be it's going to be very similar to the other investigations that\nThey have conducted already I mean they've already accumulated all the sworn testimony provided by mark judge 'em Leland\nI'm Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh I'm\nSure it's always a pleasure to talk with you on hold on your show that you're so much for your chocolate milk Jay\nOh You're welcome also if you have a wonderful a receiver we can think of living or shark alright Joe meant so\nWe saw two different Brett Kavanaugh's this week we saw a very stiff rigid cardboard ... response Brett Kavanaugh on Monday on Fox News and all that interview right but then he came out\nFire in his eyes lumping his throat\nRight\nOn Thursday defending himself and he plays the question ... which ones the real Brett Kavanaugh pleased end up and it while we were discussing this something similar kind of pulled back from our history okay\nLet's go back to Nineteen Ninety two All right\nBill Clinton and Hillary Clinton the United states 'cause I Know how much you love talking about the Clinton but let's go back to when he had the allegations us\nAnd Hillary Clinton United States 'cause I Know how much you love talking about the Clintons but let's go back\nTo when he had the allegations he was running for president United States of America right right\nSo we have a Bill Clinton that is the has an interview being conducted about the rape and sexual assault allegations that there are actually some lawsuits that were present to him and Hillary Clinton was sitting by his side\nHe was answering the questions but he was a different Bill Clinton ... than the bill Clinton that we saw in Arsenio Hall's show where he came out with the saxophone he was laughing and he was cutting out he was showing emotion she was very\nStiff and rigid\nOn the CBS interview that he had ...\nSo there's not a whole lot of difference if you look at our house because now because the Fox interview was pertaining to the hearing right here we was pertaining to the Fox interview Arsenio Hall being compared to those to his total of two different thing not apples and oranges I'm saying that you have two different\nInstances\nWhere you have to reinvent Brett Kavanaugh was not a politician but I'm saying you sit on the Senate or house show with a an entertainment late night show that's entirely different into getting in the hearing well how about the President

I can to from the pain in your voice and the person that you have about you know what should be happening I have to um go to you\nAnd your bravery\nAnd what you went through on that I have to lean on you so I'm going to leave with suicide when the ... and again you know I Do I Am very sorry that what happened two years ago\nLeno you so I'm going to leave with suicide when the ... and again you know I Do I Am very sorry that what happened two years ago\nWhile I was shocked to learn anything is All right thank you so much can we love you\nWrite about All right\nAnd this is why I say I'm rubber give it a company or Steve I see your brand is where we always say on the show you have to be careful ... um how you address the situation that you talk about ... uh hopefully I've been ... yeah um to make sure that I don't see in space and nobody wants to expand the women\nAre because this is a serious situation that happens to women's every day and I'm Still not saying that they did not happen to Dr ... we don't know\nBut uh they're women out there that had gone through this\nAnd we do have to respect their feelings and emotions how else would they feel to accept this case or not accept this case I have to respect it it\nIt's not just women that go through the I mean it's we don't in men men I think a lot that gets lost that you do\nIn there are a lot of erroneous accusations out there that have been living in that do destroy people's lives and you have to take that into consideration that's why we have due process you know you have to make sure that you know you look at\nAll aspects Senate agree\nAll right let's continue to go out to the phone lines that Robert how are you doing this evening\nHey Brian I'm fine how are you there in the Arab either going to the team and it was on one side and graduation is on your immediate expansion things were thank you Robert Wilson and the last time I call you and I had a had a little conversations back and forth\nAnd I thought it was pretty good and I I wasn't going after you I was just um was the my opinion but at the end of the conversation outside laying off ... says something about enough money\nNow you really oh I Hope you're not meaning he hears guy I'm Sorry did you see I said something to you about you not winning\nThat's what you said when Iran last year it seemed like when I used to be hard he said if I don't care he didn't win\n... it's not about it's not about winning or losing it's about people sharing your feelings\nAnd their thoughts and I'm opinions and so I Hope they don't feel at the end of this conversation that I'm trying to win over you I'm not I'm just trying to voice my own opinions\nAnd or move on to it I I read something in America who the other day\nAbout ... fellows know that the Seventeen percent Seventeen Seventy one percent of the things that talk radio ... popular radio hosts say\nWe're listening audience\nWere listening audience of horses that and takes it because of bank as though it real as though it is absolute loose actual mhm and I just know\nA valid point valid question because um you know on a\nMore reasonable yeah you know didn't know 'cause I mean that makes sense I mean if you as she said that in the hippocampus a ingrained is the laughter these two young um boys that to you would assume\nThat you would be triggered every time that you would hear something similar\nTo a type of laughter and you would they were of a panic attack or an anxiety attack at that point in time because that's how ... D\nUh-huh and I thought too that it would be interesting that you would see a lot of the\nUm you know young male antics Oliver college campuses because that's what happens there and that would not be a good job choice for her I wouldn't think if this was a major problem that had so impacted her life and I also saw that\nIt was interesting how she mentioned that they host Google interns at their house and and I just think to what you will strangers us I'm assuming that some of those with the male\nI'm coming into your house she mentioned the part after she talked about having that the extra front door installed\nUm and how they usually it sounded like it was kind of walk up poor cherry or something and they ask like what she does and that faith and she said sometimes they entertain the Google interns there and I thought\nSince then and they ask like what she does and that faith and she said somehow they entertain the Google interns there and I thought to that just doesn't add up to me the calls\nIf you again or traumatized and you've had things your and your hit the campus um probably\nEncountering strange young males with not based on and that would sit well with you and that you would be able to function through and they said that he you know has had um she's been able to\nProduce sixty five purebred publication\n... and I imagine there's been a lot of collaborative working that I'm with research and she's probably had to work with all different types of um you know male college students to like this happened so I just don't believe her testimony\nAlso as my experience as a nurse when I hear these things that are a lot you believe all women\nI doubt I'm part one of my jobs in my career I worked at a health department and we would have women come in and bring other people's urine so that they could get a positive pregnancy test and get a little statement written out to say like when\nThey do they what they ... and this was to you know basically

our I'm\nStacey how are you doing this evening\nHey doing good or listen to just about all your show I enjoyed it ... let me let me throw a different angle at you right here starts it it has an ... what think about this and I work in the large prison to stay but imagine you are a low income or middle income individual\nYou see what's happened to these high profile people accused of things I imagine if you got a court appointed attorney and some lady said that you've done something to or\nThey're just a lot of people in prison um that probably shouldn't be a lotta people should teach but now I imagine this on a scale of somebody that did not have any money no education about anything they were law or breaking the law you know what I mean people you could just really mess up\nTheir lives you yeah no I mean I I don't I think that's one of the biggest concerns that we have with the criminal justice system a as a whole um and you know oddly enough it's one of the things that's out in California that I kind of applaud in support is removing the debate on the bond\nRight yeah that's a good one in you know\nOne of the things that's out in California that I kind of applaud in support is removing the debate on the bond\nRight yeah that's a good point and you know you just get it you can get accused of anything you see how it destroys these people and very powerful position and things of authority and then you look at these people like step for middle income people which the majority of the prison system\nAnd you get some kinda somebody comes up and says some ex wife comes up and says hey you did this to mayor you did this to my stepdaughter and then you know\nShortly you're in prison and and then they come back you know a few years later and say oh well I didn't mean that mom just got mad at you and they're still in prison for that so I mean that is a lot of things we need to do differently but you can just imagine bring it home\nThere's a there's a lot of people in prison shouldn't be there\nThat can appreciate the phone call man we love you ... yeah All right I think the phone call ... five one nine three three preaches you guys Conan away by one time

W. dot ... dot cow and when you go check 'em out let them know that Baylor from the wakeup call\nCensure and you won't regret it I promise WWW dot meals fit dot ... so let's get into a little bit of this motivational Monday you know it seems like two weeks in a row were coming from this idea of um of Gulf so\nI don't know whether or not I really am turning into a cranky old man that ... the young kids to get up and go on and therefore does and plays golf on the weekends more stuff like that I don't know maybe I'll start bickering about taxes here soon who knows what will come\nBut nevertheless we wouldn't play golf this weekend and\nIt was it was really fun it's you know I work\nFive days a week I work two jobs work a job or not including this I'm doing right now although I Love this is my favorite job this is what I'd love to do [noise] um so I work two jobs and take Eighteen hours which is a full course load so we are pretty hectic you're going going going going going but then\nThe weekends are kind of like a slow down period I'm Still working during the weekends not physically but I'm working to prepare myself for the next week as everybody is you know the weekends we'd love to just say that we can just sit on the couch for two days straight and watch football but there's things you gotta do\nGuys you know you've gotten a honey do list more than a few times ladies you know you've gotten the hey can we do this this weekend requests where it's like can we I don't know just paint the whole back half of the house like it's just it's stuff like that that everybody has to do\nAnd it's a stuff you can't do during the week because you're too busy and the\nIssue is stuff that you have to do to prepare yourself for what's that whether it's the week ahead the next month ahead hey maybe you're having a kid and you all had to get together and you had to build a whole nursery right\nYou had to build the nursery I Know a lot of people I'm I'm In that age range or that starting to happen right a lot of people are having to take that time there and to go find a house or I'm going to build a nursery 'cause they got kids on the way I\nTotally understand that but that's why I Love the weekends\nBecause there are the specific times you know there's that one game when the Alabama comes on you go All right honey I'll go to the mall and you will shop will do whatever you want I'll get the honey do list done but I Want you to know\nThat at noon central\nThe Crimson Tide are coming on and I'm not doing a thing\nFor that three to four hour period everybody's got that right\nSometimes is that sometimes it's half a day but you know what I'm Talking about everybody's got those times\nWell for me I work most of the friday most of the Saturday and Sunday\nWe started setting aside or four hours where we go out there and we go play Eighteen holes of golf\nAnd I am terrible at Gulf but I still enjoy it\nBecause you know I both of my jobs are inside right both of my jobs in studios once in a ones in radio and television so and then the other the other part of those jobs on social media so everything's inside so it's really nice to get out into the environment really because like that that if it feels good that's where you feel best\nSomebody around would you rather be in like a cold house instead of specific temperature right or would you rather be outside sunshine and Seventy five degrees wind blowing it just feels good to me it makes you happier so we go out and we play uh Eighteen holes of golf almost every weekend made a couple of buddies of mine\nAnd it always baffles me\nSo we go out we play uh Eighteen holes of golf almost every weekend mean a couple of buddies of mine\nAnd it always baffles me because we go out there and I'm just excited man like I'm excited they are excited but they're not as excited as I Am and we get out there and they get so mad and so in their own heads\nAnd let's see it none of\nThem really work as much as me and I I'm not saying anything bad about them it's everybody's choice I'm not saying that don't work one of them is going to be a doctor one day he works a lot harder at school than I Do you know it it's where you choose to allocate your time but none of them work two jobs like me I don't think any of them have at like a five day a week job like I Do\nAnd so I don't understand why they're so or whether they are they're so uptight going into it 'cause I'm just happy for the break like I I could literally shake every single ball into the trees are into the water which I did yesterday I think I hit six in the water yesterday but at that point like it's still fun\nAnd we got to the point where we were just playing through and plant there and this guy got so in his head one of my good friends but it's not a hot headed by any stretch of the imagination and he was slamming his club and he was out driving me by probably a hundred yards like he was ... and it was the straight down the fairway it just wasn't exactly where he wanted it\nAnd so I went over to him and I swear I'm turning into like the cranky it sometimes wise old man because I had some advice for him and when I told him the advice he looked at me\nWhy are you still mad you know we're in a good scenario and he was like oh I'm Still mad because I hit the ball so bad and it it made me think\nI feel like a lot of the times when we get upset or stressed about stuff is because we're looking at the micro right if you want to look at this from economic terms you've got the macro and the micro and I feel like when we get mad or looking at the micro situation we're looking at I didn't\nListen my plan was to execute and do acts and I didn't do acts so I'm mad but regardless of what happened between here and acts\nYou gotta look down and see what's happening from why does the ... you got to see what's going on down the path so let's say\nYou're you're you're trying to get in a relationship right let's take a relationship scenario and you go and you go on a first date and it goes horribly like you're both nervous I've been there both been nervous doesn't go great just kind of awkward but you want to see each other again because you like each other that much even though the first day went horrible\nYou really didn't do well on the first one that you got the second chance you've got the long game right you've got the ability to say okay I get another opportunity that's awesome it's the same thing with the job\nWe all have bad days on the job [laughter] unfortunately you also hear mine when I bet they on the job you know what I'm saying like I commend near if I'm not prepared or if the message just isn't good then oh like yeah he's having a bad day and ...\nEverybody's got a bad day on the job as well but that doesn't mean that I just give up that doesn't mean I don't come in here the next day what on\nEarth is on the television Dylan I'm Still trying to figure that out I spit on there for an hour now what on earth is on the television do and\nOkay so for those of you are in in Studio with me and Dylan I just got completely derailed I don't even remember what I was talking about me more\nBecause there is we're watching MTV too and I think there is a drag queen hugging a half naked woman\nAnd so I'm pretty sure oh I'm pretty sure it's a spin off of like the ... and like ...\nThis is this ... this is the bachelorette no it's a spin off of that it ain't called bachelor at\nWhat's it called do we have a name for it you can we can we find the info on these channels that thing\nIt's been on there for an hour and I still can't like I'm not endorsing\nThis by any stretch of the imagination some of the stuff I just saw was terrifying\nBut we'll get back well ... ... oh we're not even going to break I'm so disoriented right now I'm Sorry we just saw [noise] I don't even know how to describe that I think it's better that we don't yeah\nI don't even know where to go from there so base why on earth okay I didn't turn them\n[noise] I don't even\nKnow where to go from there so based why on earth okay I Need to turn them I have to turn the TV off the off button for those remote\nOr can't turn it off great great great okay\nSo that was by far the most uncomfortable thing I think I've ever seen 'em turned it on a music channel but it was just MTV too and they were showing some modern day content where you know within thirty seconds you turn the channel and everybody's almost naked at that point you're like Mm twenty Eighteen really wholesome place but\nBack into what I was saying so everybody is looking at the macaroni micro\nRight everybody's so focused in on this micro and this idea of\nWhat is important in the short term and they're not really looking at what do we have over here what's in the long term category and when you do that you get so wrapped up in what's going on now\nThat you're not able to enjoy hey maybe you made a steak but you can learn from it because you're not done after you make that mistake so like I was saying if I have a bad day here\nRight as long as I don't cuss on the air say some really stupid I'm not fired right\nNow I have the opportunity to come back in and learn from those mistakes if you have a bad day at your job one bad day\nAs long as you don't mind you mentally mess some something up you're fired you've got the opportunity to move forward and continue working and to learn from that mistake that day\nAnd so I think that it's really detrimental to us a lot of times when we come in with this mindset right of I have to do everything perfect every single time and if I don't that I'm going to be mad at myself\nI'm Sorry but who were you last time I checked that wasn't perfect\nRight can I can name in from the can I get an a man from the people in the bleachers right now and again they meant\nI'm not perfect you're not perfect\nSo why are we expecting perfection and every single thing that we do right where are we focusing in so much on the micro and when the micro isn't absolutely unequivocally perfect\nThen we just fail to see the rest of the stuff that's going on right we fail to see the rest of the macro why do we get so caught up in that\nI don't know I mean it's an obvious question why do you think we get so caught up in that don't\nHave any idea\nPeople just to focus on what's going on with them here and now in\n\nI don't have an explanation is just but did you think I'm On a something here because I see like\nEverybody's got this long game right we've all got dreams about plans voted aspirations whether you're Fifteen Years old or whether you're fifty five years old everybody's got plans for what's next\nRight what they're going to do next and want to say next I don't mean tomorrow I mean you know what they really want to do what they really want to accomplish everybody's tunnel vision get to a goal next question you know what I'm saying next idea next subjective\nBut it seems like we get so caught up in like part a out of a plan that goes all the way to\nAddress and I don't know why\nBecause I get it and ... those momentary losses they hurt but it's the same idea would why people choose temporary pleasure over a long term relationship it's because in the moment it feels good\nLet me take that and apply it to your losses right why do people get to\nTemporary pleasure over a long term relationship it's because in the moment it feels good let me take that and apply it to your losses right why do people get so caught up in temporary a pain temporary upset and this is because in the moment it feels bad\nIt stings\nBut go another thirty minutes to an hour and there'll be on with your day and you'll be onto the next thing\nWe have to take that same mentality and I feel like the Christian Community right is really really really really really good\nWith this idea of temporary pleasure right and for going temporary ... pleasure for a long term game\nGame right I mean you see this and just like a biblical mindset but yet I don't see it translate into the opposite side of the spectrum a lot of times and it should 'cause Jesus preaches that to you know it don't be slow to anger don't get so essentially don't get so mad so quickly\nAnd so I I heard a quote from my grandfather fought in World War two I've always loved it\nI was really stressed out about a situation that was going on a couple of years ago and just the situation I was in didn't know what to do was coming to him for advice and he could tell I was stressed out and he looked at me and he's like Ninety years old so he's got all the wisdom of having a life that is literally Ninety years long you looked at me he goes Baylor\nAnd I knew that I was about to learn something big when he said it like that I was like because he usually doesn't say that I was like\nYeah he was like this too shall pass\nIt's always a\nWhich when you were in a moment you're like oh give me something more you know [laughter] like come on thanks that really helps that really help soccer teams can we open up another fortune cookie like [laughter]\nIt it it really it really doesn't
