up but first we're going to talk to Trey Trey welcome to the Ford faction with Russell go right ahead\nBy ... but he is good to hear your voice I don't think you know\nI don't get to a through your area or or a here too much of it was right here at\nMy oh my dog for the day or was um\nWhen Kevin all go on and when I was finally confirmed the first thing that came to my mind\nWas I wanted to hear that lasted Big Jim gave you that morning ... was elected\nAnd you're playing\nAccess but uh I bought a Big Jim would've been happy and I was happy\nTo is not that I didn't want a cabin ought to be elected but I'll be honest I don't know if you've got to hear the show last week I was surprised before Susan Collins came out and gave that hour long speech explaining why she was voting for Kavanaugh I was I was\nNervous she was going to spend an hour explaining why she wasn't but uh yeah I think our buddy Jimmy big time is a likely very very happy with that outcome\nI Would say so overloaded I shouldn't call time yeah I thought you were\nThat was fun yeah he did that almost like a lion's roar I remember we are talking about\n... haven't thought about that and some time but uh yeah part of me to be part of the guys are me Jim Jeff and uh [laughter]\nHave completely forgot about it because we came in the the morning after the election that November November twenty sixteen and our buddy Jimmy ... big time he just he was a loud and crazy and in my face [laughter]\nGood stuff Dr ... with the money I'd forgot about that too oh five nine four one one oh one one happened to take your goal is Russell be for the Ford faction today to three ... and Andrew Jessica will be here three to six\nLet's talk a little bit about the interview ABC News having with millennia Trump I think that airs tonight if I have that correct it was a\nRecorded last week during her trip to Africa\nWith millennia Trump I think that airs tonight if I have that correct it was a\nRecorded last week during her trip\nTo Africa and they were asking her about the allegations of sexual impropriety amount of her husband of things he's done in the past um maybe cheating on her and things and and her basic responses like listen this is [noise]\nThose things are not my concern I've got bigger things to worry about I'm a mom of a first lady I care about these things now I'm not I don't love hearing them it hurts sometimes to hear those allegations but uh she's going to do what you can as a first lady I appreciate her saying that she is a pretty private woman we don't have\nAll that many interview opportunities with her that's why when she sits down with ABC it is national news I go you get to hear from her\nAnd I got to be honest I I have gone to a soft spot for millennia Traub I imagine she lives what seems seems we don't know\nIt seems like a pretty lonely position to be in that it does seem sometimes if you're not immediate darling\nI had the four twenty nachos earlier which is basically the contents of sushi on top of a bit of to read those [laughter]\nOr was it made me happy All right let's get a I I I see that you've come a plenty of material will get through your material that's kinda iffy half rifle through here are your initial thoughts on Kanye West and Trump in their Oval Office encounter from earlier in the week\nMy initial response is I'm a\nHe was there for a reason you had to do with gun violence okay in general and maybe parts of Chicago where he's from ... I'm not a hundred percent sure and that's that's my job will take on yeah I'm I'm really ambivalent [laughter] she was there was there\nThe um [noise] you know he was calling yeah and I guess that's what you you know\nKind of does his thing yeah it's it's kind of hard to make sense of of all of that he says and what that a means because he's such an enigma and he does his own thing like we don't really have a a frame of reference he just kinda does and says his own thing which I applaud at least he's willing to do that\nWell it's a lot like Trump lady but in a different arena the unpredictability you just never know where his mind going and what is going to bring up\nI think what's from at least as president we have a little more\nIdea of where he's going to go because he's in an agenda mode right and he's signaled what is the gender is I'm In that and that's a little more I don't know I take more comfort in that now than I did you yeah but when he was elected because you're like what is he really ...\nBut he was calling yeah I don't really follow him so I\nI don't know yeah I mean he does seem unpredictable I seem to have the same level of ego maybe that Trump\nUm has until they probably get along great\nIt is interesting the the atmosphere that we've reached politically where politics and pop culture collide in a way that they're almost indistinguishable from one another\nYou got Trump junior and Michael ... challenging one another to an M M A final like mixed martial arts and part of me thinks they're being silly but then\nJust as easily it could be for real you know you never know it was part of the WWE throwing down of the uh the guy in charge of that I Can't remember right McMahon yeah yeah I mean\nIt's funny to think that I and I know he didn't do so when he was as president but you think of a\nObama slow jamming the news with Fallon or doing between two ferns with gallon that gifts and before that you had and that was while he was pretty that was well it was president sure and I was thinking about um Bill Clinton almost saxophone on our city or ... years ago\nUm but yeah it's just I I was watching the news and we talked about Trump just about every time we're together Andrea but just seeing him\nIt's not that I actively disliked it I just can't believe he's our president it's just wild and not just that we\nI guess I keep waiting I keep waiting to wake up you know what I mean the end it's not because I'm Upset with anything he's done it's just I cannot believe we reached a place where Donald Trump is president of our country I just it's ... it feels new to me and it's almost unbelievable even though we're two years and\nWhile you have you know what amazes me really\n\n[noise]\nDo you want to do just with your house to address and joined us every Saturday morning we got a great show is gonna be a lot of good information on the phone from briefings to drown duty shooting truly basements across races whatever's affected your home so if you do that if you call the show was how stores in Mali to walk out every Saturday morning\nTend to run your own superstation woman to be more\n[noise]\nEverybody to join us on friday night from unemployment die on the best in high school football [noise]\nWe'll have special get coaches interviews and take your calls thinking you're ready for your college for the call center\nRight here on your high school football leader in all of Alabama [noise]\nIt just you know\n\nWith with ah the wondering why only because I'm not sure what's going to look at and you you don't want to chase\nThe moving one but part of me wants to only because I Want to know where it's going if you've got the one that wanders get it almost work to your advantage if you had that because I think as you can see more than the average person in terms of just you know field\nOf vision going on a road trip see in the world that's what I'm saying you don't even someone out the window you just you're always looking out the window like the panoramic feature on your iPhone I think that says like very undiscovered advantage I mean to be talked about well I think we don't have enough lazy I've even college before I don't think about that on a lazy I\nI thought the lazy I Wish it when it just wasn't ladies\nWho [noise] you know leave [laughter]\n... your ... your Endeavour [noise]\nAll right it is the hometown tour here that's ... highway two eighty hope you'll come by that got a handful of locations and we would love certainly love to see you a recipe\nAndrea Tice here as well we're having to find a way where they get cut off there for a minute so one's pick right back up we appreciate big Dave uh in Studio we appreciate jak here on location Brittany with us as well and uh\nAnd the when the when the weather's good I mean I take it because it felt like\nSummer what's going to go all the way till Thanksgiving I thought were never going to go down\nI Know I saw a headline of weather headline that we've gone like a hundred and sixty days without temperatures heading down to this point okay you know since the beginning of the summer yeah so it's been a long\nStretch it was kinda nice to wake up this morning it'd be a little chilly I'm not much of a jacket guys so it can be snowing and still probably wouldn't wear a jacket but I did feel good knowing that that the sun would rise and the somewhat set and I would not sweat one time today which has not been said probably since April\n[laughter] not Alabama that uh\nIs good so we we did get cut off a little bit but we were talking I'm calling about yeah they they clash of politics and pop culture another kind of blend together and they're almost woven together I don't know how can separate one from an ...\nYeah they they clash of politics and pop culture another kind of blend together and they're almost woven together I don't know how we can separate one from another\nRight but I guess at least for me uh the reaction of the media has been more appalling and shocking or do these people forget that are beyond say and Jaycee walk the halls of the White House do right they're acting like ... lost his mind\nAnd uh I don't know that he's any different than he was you know three years ago he just became politically outed himself and that's all the different ... and it's\nInteresting and I do want to be careful not to attach myself to county too much politically I appreciated his\nConfidence to speak his mind but remember back in the town of Katrina ten eleven years ago is that George W. Bush doesn't care about black people because we could without him I don't really do\nThat with them and get a complaining that you didn't do enough to protect the people of New Orleans I get either before Katrina or after Katrina and he's the one who's rushed up on stage for these awards ceremonies and been upset because Taylor Swift right or I Do\nRemember that yeah you have the aged her in a sort of self there\nYeah I I don't really I Would never ascribed to whatever con you may be pushing but the fact that he is breaking from the monolith of the liberal left in Hollywood and in the music industry and and in the in the media\nHe's raking away he's thinking for himself I applaud that the problem is the interesting part is watch everybody else just uh go into these reactions these are fads make right reactions of him separating himself from them and in doing so they feel the need to you know\nBasically do what Trump does and character assassinate him going crazy [laughter] like you know it gets attacked by the Washington or New York times the failing\nNew York times and it's funny how he could be seen as an artistic visionary and now he suffers from mental illness or have some sort of intervention and we go to John unions they're making fun of him and\nYeah it's okay to you know a straddle that line between uh insanity and artistic like as long as it doesn't get political short ... they'll let you go wherever you want to go on that ride but um yeah you can go into religion and do all sorts of crazy stuff all in the name of artistic\nRight but don't go to the White House and uh it is interesting how\nI think sometimes as people they're not Republicans I'm just people in general we\nOn some level seem to be made nervous by people who think for themselves but don't we don't we need that right to somebody it just seems a little differently they live like a differently\nBecause she she dared to talk about this uh to these reporters and and a media outlets so uh\n[noise] so does now does our history as an elementary school child is it protected like OSHA I mean is it are they the sort of\nAbout us off limits selling some cute stories about the kid when he was eight years old do I care I don't care and has she violated his his privacy are you against it when you say\nWell I think it's just petty and silly and they're trying to drum up some sort of insidious implication from that that you know he's weird and so the White House has weird people in there and so you should be even more afraid than we've already told you to be [noise]\nUm yeah I you know my question is if they're going to catch up with the teachers who spend her which is a spokeswoman said they are concerned about ... release of student information including allegations that the release may not have complied with the political laws and district ... okay so there you go there's the official\nBut they're they're trying to cover their own high yeah yeah I mean I get it I guess it does seem it seems a little silly so\nNot knowing the legality of it\nAnd you have someone high profile whether it's President Trump or someone who works for him could be a celebrity it seems pretty standard and say who knew him before you know he's these this person now she's this person now as a grown a person of influence as an adult\nAll wonder what they were like as a kid and if you're gonna find their third grade teacher and they got a funny story here or there that's good enough right I mean that's I'm not going to change my vote for or against whether he ate glue or not when he was nine years old\nRight I agree uh I think every average normal American will\nThe vote for or against whether he ate glue are now and he was nine years old\nRight I agree uh I think every average normal American will look at it that when they have a laugh but we're we're the accountability I guess my question is where the accountability for the people actually published this and made it a try to make it look like it's a legitimate story\nAnd I didn't mean accountability and made me chuckle if click bait it is funny I like uh I'm I'm I'm if I'm appalled you're not appalled reporting on it\nBecause this woman got by the way let me\nRemind you that uh Fisk happens to be a registered Democrat and she supports causes associated with liberals according to gr Facebook account right\nSo yeah there is not that political there [laughter]\nThat political Amy as political arguments political or not it's\nFunny if let's see let's say someone wanted to get the goods on you a hundred size was there a particular teacher or Sunday school\nTeacher whether somebody from your childhood who might have some stories that would surprise us [noise] um\nGosh I don't know I probably my my family members that there'll be there'll be it would be the first to go to I think of my\nScience teacher and I have a hard time remember I remember who she is she was ... cook I Can't remember if she was my eighth grade science will be my last year of middle school where she was ninth grade science first year of high school\nBut she's in that early ... she's in that really your high school years and it was run around the time that I decided I wanted to figure out my sense of humor that I went from a pretty quiet compliant kid\nChurchgoing kid didn't get in trouble at home and\nNever got into ugly trouble at school but it was it was the first time runs out I was going to be the funny kid I was going to try to be at least oh are you saying establishes or expand I\nWould say establish I'll Try to establish it because I wasn't particularly funny then I'm not certain um all that funny now but that was the first year part of my teenage life like I'm going to try there's a particular girl in my class I wanted to make her laugh and so I didn't I care what ms cook did to me [laughter]\nI said what you said this is science so I'm I'm a I'm anticipating this involves formaldehyde\nIt all in a frog for ... I Would like to say so no I don't really get into crazy trouble it was simply I\nWas if there was going to be a kid who got sent to the hallway for speaking out of turn for making too many jokes for not wait until he was called that would have been me at that time a column saying no there there were no pranks involved nobody got their cells burned by boats and bird or anything like\nThat what was his teacher I have to say your effort that I was\nA a might or\nMight have been annoying you know [laughter]\nShe would be the only person I think she'd be the first teacher to say that I think the issue is the first of many who might follow\nWell it's clear you're going to have to go back and reach out to her and and have her sign a nondisclosure agreement I think you know take me down I think\nIt would happen uh it's it's no good here All right let's take a quick break shall we we got a big day of and master control Jessica Andrew shown up here\nAt ... here with me and we're going to

heard the name but I'm not familiar\nPerfect Russell you're exactly right many people you mentioned progress progress to\nProgress as new to Birmingham they actually are here as a result of a purchase I made last year with first partners bank okay and uh actually I was part of ... the name changed first partners has actually south Citibank started vis Davia hills Alabama in two thousand seven so\nUh but as a result of murder progress has actually has real they're ten roll back\nA little over a billion in assets and we have a seven locations in uh\nUh but as as a result of murder progress

branch and we have two and a Florida ones in dust and the ones in in the beach uh fortunately Justin's opened with him as in the beach as of this morning\nThat NATO and so anyway well here the course of our time Steve I\nInvite you to speak to me in the the most basic terms because I have a couple of questions about when it comes to choosing a bank and maybe we'll talk mortgages a little bit and that you're not going to if you make it super simple that's not a bad thing that's missing it's probably good for them to talk with him when it comes to choosing a bank we could go with like a super big national\nBank or a local bank what are the differences and and what are some of the uh the the valuable sides of going with the more local thing well I think\nWhen you boil it down and comes back to people were not a big bank here obviously we\nI think we have maybe a twenty five or thirty people in the Birmingham area so it's not large but a lot of people like the fact that they get then we get to know them really well ah people a lot of people have been around a long time even though we're just new to the burn him but they they do a lot of folks and um\nI think people look at it because we can give the services that they may not get it a large institution and a lot of times people will come in and so I'm just tired of wherever that may be for different reasons and uh a rival to hopefully capitalize on that and really make them feel welcome and uh\nYou know that they're that they're part of of a group that cares about them and their success\nAnd I apologize for this yellow jacket that's wanting it to make yourself feel welcome 'em when we talk about people when it comes to our money and these big decisions I mean money is an important part of our lives whether we like I was on um do you really have the flexibility does it help when you know your customers that come into play\nIt sure does a because all the decisions are local here and uh we had the ability to depend upon you know if it's somebody already banks with or maybe they're new to the bank and what they're trying to do that we have the capabilities to be I Would say much more flexible than a than a than a big box player\nThat's uh that's good and you think about it you know whether it's you're checking your savings it could be credit cards I presume you need to get into investments and you get into mortgages\nIt's just all these ... these big areas of our life and um I think some of us maybe art in banks simply from ... you know we chose the bank and ... and it got bought by somebody and it got by by somebody and now we're part of the banking institution we ourselves actually didn't choose it just got gobbled up\nHow do you encourage people to make the jump from a bank that they just kind of ended up with the progress man that's a great\nPoint because personally I was at the south trust bank which was a big bank headquarter out to Birmingham and then it got purchased by what Coby and briefly I went to Wells Fargo and\nBut that being said I I mean I was just talking with a young person the other day I mean what they're paying rent if they can just get into the home yeah their payment oftentimes is maybe just slightly equal or slightly above so\nAnd and it gives them a chance to set of being in their five ten years that you could build some equity and that may not be there forever home right but it can help position them maybe five ten years down the road when they do move to the next one to have some equity versus just feel like they're kind of\nI mean I Know rents a big deal a lot of people they can't they just can't get into home yeah but I think generally that I Would say that homeownership is still a great thing if you can uh uh participate in\nSome of the tightening of restrictions in the aftermath of the economic collapse of ten years ago have any of those been lessened is it easier maybe to get into a home now than it might have been seven years ago or is it still tight as their opportunities out there\nI think it's still pretty tight yeah I Know I hear about a President Trump relax and regulations on the corporate side I trust that kind of falling down to the mortgage side and the backside and general big\nBecause it's tough for smaller banks especially not that it's easy for the big bang again because it's not but yeah I think are the regulations though I mean\nFifteen Years ago you could have stated income and you could just like\nTo say about you know it's not easy but you're the guy [laughter]\nFifteen Years ago you could have stated income and you could just like I say he's about you press easy but\nIt's not like that you had to prove it all out and you you know from having a great credit score but asset your income and and they're still pretty much that day you know that way today now you know obviously some lenders may lacks that but um\nWe we're we're pretty tight and I think most people are today it seems to me that is where a a local bank really helps rather you have someone who is working on your behalf whereas if it's a big national bank maybe that's just working in volume if you're not an obvious candidates you know hate about it for you to go somewhere else you're\nOut on a ... step in and ... you know I\nI help people from the very start to the finish you know how I got to just do a little bit in the front in and forget about it yeah of course that's probably true of most people I mean you have to be engaged is a it's a process is not easy right I think some people want it to be easier than it is sure why I've already\nGiving you that well now we need had one the other day a few need\nBank statements made to four months all pages it can't be five or six or ... even though the six pages or when you use to balance your regular you got to have it doesn't matter\nSo you know ... you know still a lot of that but that's what I Do and try to help\nPeople you know uh get that information in and atomic fashion and make it where we can\nMake a good turn times say thirty days or less we've been\nTalking here with a Steve owner from progress bank and I want to talk if I can about just Steve demanded back because what you say is just it just speaks\nTo my heart because I Am that guy and he will tell me these are the documents yeah and I get I get in the ballpark there's so much of my life is is that in the ballpark it's close enough Steve God do I need all these ... and I feel so back here and I don't know you're right but I'm that guy it's close enough\nWell I mean there's a sign of a red at the anyway uh gossip you know you remember your parents growing up and they said well why do I need to do that because of ... right yeah look this is\nThe here and you can't be close to all the pay is not not one not sure exactly\nRight and it and it does frustrate people in times things are at the last minute and that's typical but are can be typical but you know if you if you get on the front and there's always gonna be something but hopefully just monitors and get but you're exactly right is it\nThat way to say it's not not as a representative of the bank just you in life have you always been detail oriented this way to come naturally to you or you had to learn to discipline\nWell I Need help and help help me [laughter]\nI'm the first child I wanted I got two brothers that was the first jobs more responsible okay I don't know about detail now my wife is a very detailed and all that she's a tech person or has been in her past life but uh but you know probably just my nature I guess you know I've been in the\nSet off an insurance I actually I tend to insurance side and kind of morphed into banks side and I have my securities license him and my insurance uh those licenses seal usage of sea so now they're mortgages which doesn't have anything to do with that so much in a way but yeah that's maybe been part of my bed\nIn a row in the documents and this has to be right and this has the right in for me so much of my life in my career has been I guess more by feel then exact you know of what I eat in hospitality or now caster ministry you know it's and that's it has its areas but they're not necessarily\nPrecision yes exactly right because this is pretty much like either lung condition early here's the conditions and yeah\nIs it not necessarily this precision yes exactly right because this is pretty much\nLike either lung condition early here's the conditions and yeah you gotta do this I mean\nThere's some that I'll tell my bars are Clyde say look this doesn't make any sense but look just do it you get it and they just do a show or in any way that is good let's give you an opportunity to let those who are listening to our conversation and you've been a delight thank you for being here uh\nWhat's the best place this the best way for them to\nTo reach you to learn more about progress bank if they if they're interested in the mortgage can they contact you directly\nYeah my direct well so I give up my number here walking anyway however you want to do that I'm at the ... location\nWe have to in Birmingham and that's our Birmingham corporate office okay and moderate number seven oh five one six six eight ... sixty eight lay the general number seven five Fifteen hundred to the bank\nOf course you could Google that or make sure that's the correct one yeah but uh you know we you know we're right there and I'll be glad to talk with anybody in in any way I can almost great so the ...\nThe office right here highlands um and then we've got seven locations in Alabama's Iraq seven suing Florida one didn't make it out so good at her I ain't got\nTo here and we got to see what's that made a five and like Huntsville Madison Florence Decatur\n... anyway we've got a lot of locations goodness super station now we reached Birmingham in up in the Huntsville so just a what a what a great fit progress bank is and again we've had time with some of these hometown tours we just get out in the community much as as your bank does and uh it's good and you know we talk about money\nWe talked about home ownership and it's a valuable asset whether you're looking to buy refinance the one that you have it's just such a big part of who we are I think all of our memories oftentimes\nTraced back to home and family and where we were and yeah we just you can't really remove myself fan and we shouldn't yeah I don't think now is Alabama home for you to live elsewhere\nNo actually I grew up in Kansas I was born actually in Las Vegas how nice and my dad was a pilot and the Korean War for ... ah just turned ... this year but he's still with us my mom's not but uh we had a big birthday celebration for him but I ... born in Vegas actually on male is Airforce base okay to move to Huston Kansas\nEarly on for a couple of years I moved to Wichita to high school there and I went to school in Springfield, Missouri Drury college which is ... oh you can't go very well and uh so it's like that but I've been in Birmingham for gosh thirty I say thirty\nSeven hundred I feel like it's home yeah think after thirty some I oh yeah yeah it's great\nI've kind of bounce back and forth from Birmingham to Atlanta back to Birmingham couple of different times but ah so I was born and raised in Georgia more of a man Birmingham is home it just seems like\nGun ... live I used to get people I'm On my way since I was doing the big ... going to the keys but yeah I\nThink I'll start right that's a good at it but they're going to have to stand with the hurricanes\nIs no kidding uh but now it's kind of wine with the hurricane seeing a place a lot of as a vacation and we love el shores and Orange Beach Panama City desk and I spent so many memories there\nWe got friends in Mexico beach to yeah got trying to sell this house it may not be there right now one of our bank partners I just yesterday said that she had friends just a month ago moved to Mexico baseball so and they ... they went to mow bill I don't think yesterday I couldn't get back in yet you know\nNot good for any of those people just pray for them and yeah\nWe talk about you know being sometimes underwater with your mortgage your house you look when I literally was Eddie being ... being underwater yeah it really is a crazy Steve thank you for taking time with us ...\nWith your mortgage your house your look what I literally was Eddie being your ZIP Code being underwater yeah it really is a crazy Steve thank you for taking time with the ... it's been fun to see our own all with the progress bank my progress bank dot com\nAnd uh if you're looking for a mortgage if you look into by looking to refinance Steve it's got to talk with a progress bank one of our\nProud sponsor tier of hometown tour which continues on super station wanna won W why do you were at a time you want highway to\nEighty I don't know if you've tried Steve one of these uh but I'm getting ready to go into the burrito there really wanted they are good and they've got these nachos which are really good it's God's spicy tuna on top of it to read those\nBut it is so good I've already lunch but my dad but they're telling me they're going to bring me one of these desert options here in a bit and I read this to you\nRight before he hit the brake it'll hit here in the next minute or two\nAnd that is a fruit sushi option they call it fruit she proves it is coconut\nInfuse rice and the tele strawberries apples and some more rice\nAnd uh that's pretty good our buddy ... have in master control it but I Want to do it yeah check it out state thank you so much for the auto progress bank my progress bank dot com give him a call banks to them and will continue hometown door next [noise]\nHurt anybody I'm a Christian believer I'm trying to spread the love of God as best I don't know how give me a break if I don't use right terminology\nRight and I think that's probably why they use the even the word try because it it does fracture yeah of using that try ballistic um mentality breaks these people into very a smaller groups with their particular set of identity markers if you will\nAnd you know you're right it it it's very hard to keep track of all of that which is the beauty of just saying hey I'm an American right it just and it's only competing and hopefully we get back to that\nAnd what's interesting about that particular study of hurt some people talk about it is that this is not just white people complaining about political correctness but black people are complaining about political correctness right and Hispanics and straight and gay and just all these different areas of\nYes we all need to be nicer and more understanding of one another but at the same time we're all just a little weary of being lectured to buy a select few who are telling us our actions are wrong our motivations are wrong our privileges wrong our words are wrong everything is wrong\nAnd and actually even want to go so far as to remove you from your job or your pension or or wherever you are your if your status whatever just for using those words incorrectly yeah according to them and it is it is strange\nTo me in the world of politics where you hear some on the left and I hearing a whole lot on the right but on the left I guess you you are having a push maybe from women and the younger generations who are saying you know we want to see it at the table which is fine you shouldn't be discriminated against\nBut at the same time they're saying older white guys need to give up their power and just let us have a turn ... I'm Sorry it's just not really how it works I mean if you if you can gather a majority of people to vote for you or a candidate who shares a similar position that's how it works\nYou're not going to get widespread people resigning saying you know what young lady you're right you take my position and\nDoesn't work that way I Know it's not very practical yeah\nBut they would love to make it wields power because believe me they got away with it on a regular basis it would only increased quite honestly anyways I thought this was interesting because it it interviewed eight thousand people a lot of people so it's not just a small sampling sure any in the bottom line is again\nNot to go into all the details of the just basically eighty percent\nSo like you said it isn't just a particular race of let's just say you're patriarchal white European\nAncestors sure type people because eighty percent of the population is an all white yeah so it's clearly across the board\nThey went and must tough is when you can you can hear in someone's voice when they say something they're not quite sure if they're saying it right where you can hear the question mark\nAs are saying do I call this person black ... first African American\nYou know one of the time it slurs which is like actual terminology dress and my wife and my Caucasian\nI don't even know what to say anymore and so you hear people sometimes with a microphone in their face\nAnd you can tell they're nervous they're they're treading lightly they're walking on eggshells they don't want to get in trouble they don't want to go viral moment and they were trying to make a point about something else but it's distracting you can tell there's fear in their minds as they're talking about an issue\nTrouble they don't want to go viral moment and they were trying to make a point about something else but it's distracting you can tell there's fear in their minds as they're talking about an issue you know I think\nThat the general rule that a habit if there if there's a character flaw today where someone's motive is is is bad or\nFull of malice that will come out yeah I mean that and good always comes out and it'll come out in the form of a habit so you know get the person the benefit of the doubt and I can guarantee you they'll trip up again if if it's really the motive is at heart and and it's a problem they'll come\nThey'll mess up again it always happens eventually\nWhen it comes to political correctness one thing that is\nInteresting to me one thing I think about is what is my own motivation of I Do want to be a good representative of what it means to be a faithful Christian so I Want to be a peacemaker I Want to be kind I Want to give people latitude you I just I don't want to be a stumbling block to them right\nSo I Do want to be kind and if there's a term that they don't like to hear I Want to try not to use it for the sake of Christ\nAt the same time I don't want to be guilty of letting them brow beat me and to not speaking my own mind you see what I'm saying like I don't want to be political politically correct for their benefit but I don't want to be\nUnnecessarily rude or unkind or [noise] um I don't know rough around the edges\nOr you can always getting that you can just play into their manipulations for example if someone we don't have this year in Alabama necessarily but if someone comes up because I demand that you call me Zee sure I don't know\nI Do I Would be like that that's a sure fire way to get a lot of people to avoid you yeah because who wants to deal with changing the pronouns that they've used all their lives his e gives you know what the pronoun\nThings like I really really tried to even understand it's like some of the terminology\nI'm thankful honestly I'm not in middle school right now trying to go through those basic things of of what these terms mean because you know what's coming up in in school public school right so they're teaching our kids all over the enter teaching them and grade school\nI don't even know what that means and are there are boys and there are girls I Do wish\nI think that some of this could have been avoided if we allowed for a broader spectrum of what it means to be male or what it means to be female and what I mean by that is\nWe sometimes have these narrowly defined expressions for masculinity or femininity so then people who didn't fit into those narrowly defined terms now have rejected the whole notion of gender and so they I'm just well I'm not this so I'm not I'm going to be this other thing instead of\nGiving people weekly wiggle room and what I mean by that is not every man is going to be the mainly is man that you've ever met but that doesn't mean he's not a man and the same with a woman\nThat they don't have to all have the same interests have all the same dress the same mannerisms and I think we've done them a great disservice by calling them mean names and alienating them so then there pushback is fine I Want my own new term you tell me I'm not\nFeminine enough you tell me I'm not masculine enough well then I guess I'm not a man and must be this other thing so in some respects we've kind of created the problem we're now crying about I see what you're saying I I think I um I Want to play a Barbies and I want it to be okay uh that\nI read it towards eating glue [laughter] and I ... I don't know what the described that the gender everybody does that maybe too much clip art to forty six were going to take a a final break here on the Ford faction we've got Andrew in just\nNo no I'm just glad that the gender everybody does that may be too much clip art to forty six were going to take a a find a break here on the ... got Andrew Jessica coming up at three hundred ties hanging out may Russell ... it'll continue next\nThe Ford faction making radio great again\nUp the crew and head out the Talladega super speedway for race weekend October twelve to fourteen ticket holders but the one thousand votes dot com five hundred can enjoy free camping in three different camp grounds around the track this is more than a race this is Talladega\nDo you want to melt the cat get toned and had the body you always wanted then you need to check out iron tribe fitness through high intensity interval training and nutrition education I even tried to help you trends that and gain muscle\nI even tried to currently looking for forty locals who want to participate in a three six week challenge that is guaranteed to get your results with that challenge you'll get accustomed meal plan personal accountability grocery list and so much more\nAs long as you reach your goal wait the challenge is absolutely free contact your closest tried today to find out more\nHad guys this is Thomas talked from ... we're talking about our service milk that meals which is\nMeal prep but you can pick up on Monday afternoon so what we do is we have meals and we have food by the pounds which you can take it home and have food\nAll week long what this does is it makes your life easier it keeps you out to dry food and keeps you also point with what you're trying to ... to the top right that you get older your milk ... males today\nSays talk radio has to stick to just the era where you can find out about what's coming up what's going on or what you miss my following had one on one super station all this would have for somebody go to Facebook dot com and search for super station\nOne on how old are you are you can take us wherever you go through with a super station one on one hand it's like having your own personal news anchor in we're\nNot creepy and all your home town God and country station it's super station one oh one WIP\nThis Friday and every Friday be sure to set your radio FM one on one point one W why the man\nYou spoke with school board show me the best in high school football game of the week\nAward winning announcer Jamie you're more complete maybe taking all calls and given story from all round the state of Alabama\nThen in the final our listen for the team prognostications up the next day's college football\nThat's the best in high school football once you open till midnight here on your super station every one on one point one W why the\nAnd country station superstation one on nobody windy and\nHey leads thanks for listening superstation little one [noise]\n\n\nDo you are you afraid of Coleman's there'll be a junior she takes these two earlier were super restrictions one on one there'll be ... you\nHey this is Michael ... got in a vet that would make for the perfect hometown tourist stop we'd love to hear about it\nOur website a one on one W.

that sounds a lot better than it does it sounds better good ... good morning to everyone out there do not forget the number here is eight six six by by one now nine three three if you will to be a part of the program\nFive states are dealing with the aftermath of hurricane\nMichael way is that story here we go me tell you an interesting story I ran across this over it daily caller's by Jeff horrible\nThey tell you are an interesting story I ran across this over it daily caller's by Jeff horrible I don't want to review the headline I just want to I just tell you the story\nThere's a there's a meteorologist for a website called whether ... dot com his name is Joe ...\nAnd about a month ago he was on a a big national radio program and while he was on that program\nHe predicted that there would be a big storm in the Gulf of Mexico in October\nNow that sounds a little Nostradamus no stood Thomas ask somebody might say well what do yeah he um so why does hurricane season and\nYou know anybody can say there's going to be a big storm especially the climate change experts say there's gonna be a big storm\nHe appeared on Sean Hannity's radio show on Wednesday afternoon just after hurricane Michael made landfall told the radio host here's the thing with this storm folks the first thing this is not climate change or any evidence of it\nThis is what I thought was interesting\nAnd it was only shown show back in September ...\nYou could see this coming you could see the whole pattern coming but start he said we talked a shown on the sixteenth of September I said I'll be seeing you again in October probably because of a big Gulf storm\nIt's not because of your s a SUV this is what nature is capable of doing and you could see this pattern setting up pretty far in advance early in the day\nEarlier in the day started with into more detail explaining the quote patterns that cause the intense storm in a separate interview with the Christian broadcasting network\nHe told CBS News quote I don't want you to think this is anything mysterious about this this was a textbook case for why ice storm should become very very strong but this is the interesting\nThing to me he went on to say this is what we call the Newfoundland will be a\nBig high pressure system over the northeastern United States that steers hurricanes end of the United states\nHe was asked how unusual this was to have a storm hit the United states at its peak the meteorologist replied will in the thirties forties and fifties it was an unusual at all\nThey all were doing that which is why those years were legendary\nBut I Do think there is a linkage between the warmth of the globe\nAnd again I Believe it's all natural compare what this guy's saying\nTo some of the pundits you've seen on TV who just continued to\nSay this is the sad thing\nThat there are so many Americans we say it jokingly here all the time that Americans apparently believe when someone says it happened in a year or two hundred BC that it means before Clinton\nWe jokingly say that\nAs it happened in a year or two hundred BC\nIt means before Clinton we jokingly say that but how many Americans\nActually know\nThat in the Nineteen thirties the Nineteen forties that team fifties we just got battered by hurricane how many Americans know that in the Nineteen thirties the Nineteen forties in the Nineteen fifties you could buy huge\nExpanses of beach front property for nothing\nBecause no one wanted it we\nWeren't we didn't have condos everywhere we weren't wealthy enough as a country for everybody to move to the beach\nAnd because you know why he didn't want it because if you build something there it was going to get wiped out and you can grow hardly anything there because it's just it's just not the greatest soil\nA story of my family is it I think is my great grandfather now have the opportunity to buy\nI forget how much it was like one point eight miles of a beach that I think you now it would be called Miami Beach is like what am I going to do with that\nBeen around a\nAirplanes and stuff for almost forty years I'm ... as you go out to to the temperature gets colder going to have hot hot jet engine\nPutting out exhaust just like any motor does and it ... it freezes and with ice crystal ... and so it it it's a paper trail not to travel back and change its phone is his combat regarding that's why our males\nAre more feminine that's because of divorce that's because the single moms doing the best they can to raise boys and the man and they weren't designed for that the father was designed for that and we as men have let down\nOut of the nation world by\nVoice right and even if there's no other white button divorce staying in that child's life and raising that side and not having the uh differences and focused on raising a family that's why we have a film that man is because they don't know how to be\nA good ... that's the point that I Would jump on the bandwagon and say that our society has told me and that they are bad aggression et cetera et cetera which can be focused in horn is to do great things is bad\nI'm exactly all of\nThose things but I Do have the question of the the fertility rate or the um sperm\nCount reduction or whatever across the world I don't know what it calls that I'm just going to blame it on the Democratic to actually actually marijuana there since there we go you know man I\nKnow I Know it's God's ... every day about for twenty five years I've I've given it up but but the point is it does lower sperm count it does affect\nAnd it is a gateway drug I Know you might charge on that but I've been there there's not I like I say I loved it for Twenty years I grew up in the I I don't\nKnow a single person that

Alabama dot com or give them a call or two or three six six to ... to\nBother you tell them you heard about the movies got Lisa show you get a special own a service called for only\nDollars a the Alabama dot com I remember\n[noise]\nLittle breaking news Andrew Brunson remember the American pastor who had been\nI told you don't go to man don't goes broke I with you on that he is a raven day go ...\n[noise] as much as a matter of fact I got to we're going to miss [laughter] so you\nDo have a drink [laughter] but I'm I'm agreeing with him Merv welcome to the program [noise]\nWow [noise]\nWhat are you know I've given up thinking everything is out there I mean everything is crazy because every day I'll find out something that I was told for my whole life there was not through and now is to think about the things that we are that are kids actually believe are facts let me I'll set everybody off\nEvolution\nThey just believe it's a fact we made it up it's a theory we can't prove it\nThe ah folks hope it's true so they don't have to believe in a creator God but our children in many Americans just leave it as an absolute in fact I'm now we can go to climate change made up\nHoax yep but people bone leave it so so I've gotten to the point now where I think there are things the government or governments just tell us innovate and we believe him because they told us that\nI I don't disagree with that Scott and I'm not going to disagree with Paul uh but I Am going to go back to something somebody said earlier\nI I don't disagree with that Scott and I'm not going to disagree with Paula ah but I I'm going to go back to some somebody said earlier it is not the Sabbath yet\nIt's gonna be the ... is that where we are going I'm going through with any\nExactly got in the book of genesis but it's also observed by cry in the New Testament days the Sabbath is still in effect\nOr a mother of what's interesting murder murder I Know\nYou took the Rome because most of them would die but go so you know the other day who go to him and goes you know we're not talking about ... ... ... ... we're talking about the ... so I was getting by got him\nI that's fine but it's something everybody needs to hear because I've sat down and explain this to people they go oh well it's still just it's Sunday were worse when the war on Sunday I not what we're talking about this crisis that if you love me you'll keep my commandments and one of those commandments is keeping the Sabbath now here's what's interesting\nAll right about the mentality of it when you read genesis good the darkness and then the light the first day your day\nYou we sleep at night in the darkness we are awake in the daylight hours when God is there so you enjoy your day with God in the light you go to sleep when it's dark you wake up with God in the white therefore you're always with God and\nWe are on the Protestant side of things just are very dismissive of that and you know the Greeks and the ... and everybody when they got in and and started messing with the church\nSwitched it around where we end our days in the darkness and we don't need to end our days in dark as we need to end our days and the white and\nSo you know always being with God now Kim trails are real I drive around out here in the sun you know you've you've featured my\nOperations on your program yes as I deliver pick up dumpsters and when a plane to leave a trail in the sky that looks like they're trying to play tic tac toe and it's still there three hours later\nThat's not a con trail that's Kim trail and that's very real\nGood have idiot scientists out there just like what Paula brought up and somebody else I think that think that they're going to stop global warming by spraying these fake clouds which only happened to appear over major metropolitan areas\nAnd you know aluminum causes all ... nobody wants to talk about that the aluminum industry certainly doesn't want that to come out um you know it when when everybody gave up all of their steel and World War two and they started using lunar for everything why do you think of the baby boomers\nAre have so many cases of Alzheimer's\nI

you have a trail that Israel all the way across the sky and white merge that you come back three hours later and it's still there and it spread out that is a ... they are usually in tic tac toe patterns and you will notice on days that they spray young thrill\nThat uh by late afternoon the sky as they sort of Bill White quality to it that's right ah\nIt is partially or climate control that ties into the whole geoengineering thing\nUm but also bury him an aluminum that they spray drifts to the ground ... late in the soil and then plant there is a documentary you can watch on this problem what in the world are they spraying on us\nThey didn't take them home town of ... or I'm sure you can find it on the Internet\nGood but it builds up it changes the ph balance of the soil builds up and the three ... three\nAnd why they're doing now is it just so happened that a Monsanto has engineered aluminum resistance see\nTheir non airline seats which means they produce one drop and then they die so you have to go back to Monsanto all your ... okay it's all in the documentary what in the world and they spraying on us or I can speak to death\nI have to go back to Monsanto all your proxy okay it's all in the documentary what in the world are they spraying on us or I can speak to death I used to be a pilot back in the early nineties when I was in college so I've been around aircraft all my life\nHave you ever seen him loading the stuff up or actually seen the injection the injection devices rented out sit at the new plan jak\nDevices what I've heard is\nHe I think they should they put it in a few\nThey put it into fuels commercial aircraft and\nYou know they don't even know there spray the fact that they're putting out exhaust there spray but yes uh if you look at the heart of aircraft is free agent orange Vietnam you stick one thirty aircraft right you are spraying apparatus on the bottom of their wings\nThey pumped it out like you would liquid fertilizer or whatever round up\nI tend to believe that you've got both that kind of aircraft spraying a probably\nA\nA following seven ... seven like a Casey one thirty five tanker right and also commercial aircraft unknowingly spray\nHuh All right you are getting me the only bad thing about ruining my weekend actually the only thing about this New Yorkers talking\nAbout uh-huh ... you know he said is

was you know you start studying a name you engage sundown\nOn Saturday yeah that was the correct you know\nJust did ... years after his resurrection\nEstablish change to the Sunday because of the fact that that was like he can he raise again resurrect yes yes and say your ten minutes\nYou know he lays again resurrect yeah yes\nYes yes and the name of the fact is that because of the fact that you know the ... ... is Jesus ... good and she\nAsked ... ... ... ... and the day you know Jews especially the nutrients that he has the payer and your baby to change\nThe you know the day that we observe the Sabbath and\nWell that's why we're going to make it into isn't it wrong\nToday yes disenchanted like yeah yeah he came in they tell them carrying yes\nI'm I'm with you I ... and I've always wondered and I don't know this answer if Peter and the other apostle\nPaul if they had did\nThey observe on Sunday or were they doing the Sabbath on Saturday and Sunday is that how we have a weekend I don't know I don't I don't that's just part of it I've never studied you're actually ... they did they did so they did it on Sunday and I figured they were closer to the um you know they probably had a better line than we do\nKnow that\nI'm with you on that one that's got about understanding you and I agree on that Ryan anything else\nNo that's all you got a brother or the ...\n[laughter] I'm

listening to one of those as you say conspiracy thinkers are we are talking about the vaccine's yes ma'am\n[laughter] and I think he said sixty five I don't know how many vaccines he said and I always wondered and I could see your [noise] I don't know if you've heard all these we get so many more vaccines these days well I have to believe former one of my kids and I don't get out and I counted\nThere are fourteen vaccines given now there's thirty six immunizations actual you know like like tea that's given laptops or\n... oh you got to take it multiple times we get right with shots right okay\nThat's the that the up and the Syria technician whooping cough has one vaccine\nBecause I'm so they they bundled them together right like cable\n[laughter] but you\nKnow I always wondered it's like when I thought yeah you know there's a lot more vaccine\nGiven but you know Canada there's fourteen\nWondered it's like when I thought yeah you know there's a lot more vaccines given but you know Canada there's fourteen aiming Mm\nFourteen wholesales but what if what if you break out the bundles so now we got\nThe six thirty six thirty six the breakdown Jackson's injection that and let's

I Know exactly\nOh no they moved them tables out and we had to walk about ... what what are you doing\nAnd I was seeing all these people in front of me crying and everything I got scared I start crying\nYou're much better witness than I'm miss board was\n[laughter] I don't remember the day but I remember my mom drop me off and pick me up\nYou do you knew how you got video goes up or down our home I was like how dare you listen to me like the\nWallace welcome to the program\nLike you're sure I'd like to respond to other call just before the break to share that Democrats were hoarding and cutting up little faith is okay sure if you're still is a lot like to respond to you by saying you're opposed Donald Trump\nOkayed each individual state if they wanted to contribute to show as far as I'm concerned that live so yeah and that's what I think he is going to stay in for something and he says he is like ...\nOkay a lot okay here's a liar and I just I just I had\nThere it is got to keep a world safe for democracy on a daily basis\nYou got it All right\nLet's keep on rolling man this is good stuff you think we got any listeners\nLeft Charles welcome to the program [noise] Hey Chris declared I'll just step up\nGrass head to head back down to the wire grass for a a for a little visit and he should be hopefully he'll be back next week\nOutlet it's starting to get fat I I was a genius show a lot of people when the stock market with\nHurricane at ... cetera et cetera yes uh I was gonna say that I think there's a conspiracy in Alabama right now in the end you not be the one that can answer they assert our address the U.S okay they share a lead people on there are cognizant spot for her stuff they shouldn't be uh\nI'm just wondering is that immigrants trying to set a set for our criminal light light around to look like under you know are striking now or something I mean they're just they're\nJust talking thirty five dollar the and letting them out for years to appears and and the worst crimes they're not being on it and it's just it's been several Kelly because I go people Scott and they're not they're just letting letting them sign their\nHigh person got what they can create more jobs\nNow Charles I'm just going to go ahead and tell you that in my opinion and I don't know the specific cases but this is all part and parcel to a two prong air for one is we've got very liberal federal judges who have decided that you know\nToo many people in a prison in some sort of violation of there right now we can make them slaves and we can work um ... that's in the constitution but having too many in there is some sort of violations of the state is all paying\nDave's and we can work um ... that's in the constitution but having too many in there is some sort of violations of the state is all panicked about\nOvercrowding in prisons then you've got this new virtues signaling\nThis going on even the president's part of it I don't know how far he is willing to go with their own sentencing reform prison reform whatever prison reform\nIn many many cases means\nDon't send the bad guy to prison I'm ... I'm Sorry that's just what it means Charles so now we have all these issues rolling together and even some local municipalities and counties are saying look we don't have a place to put them so we're just going to let them back in the town the sad part is\nI Am more worried about your safety your family's safety your properties safety than I Am about that person's comfort or discomfort and the easiest way to stay out of jail is don't commit the crime\nWell Scott ... are you familiar with what's happening today about the the three murders in a gun or all of the grandmother the grandson in the night and and the guy got out on parole and nobody had watched him or done anything about him in ... in ... in in a case of murdering these people and\nA ... ... ... that's an actually he's a person if I had this individual and that's not calling these people are going to get a cafe or something is done early to prove it\nWell let me tell you one last night before I let you go Charles I had somebody in law enforcement that I greatly respect and I was asking them about this\nThis urban legend and you've heard it before we have people in prison because they got caught with you know when one marijuana cigarette and send in prison and and this person said look I'm not saying that's never happened\nBut in the day and age that we live right now\nA huge number of these people that are that the left is advocating for that says well they got put in prison for a non violent so and so he said look we know they robbed a store we know who they shot the ... we you know and you don't know 'cause we're innocent until proven guilty\nBut they got this long list of the stuff but the but the charge that was absolutely no way around it he had a pocket full of drugs that's the one that we can make stick and that's the one that sent him to prison he's a bad guy\nBut but you got these people that they're going to well you know it was not about a fifth\nChances are that person has a long history of other things they think he did but this one was the one you can be found guilty of easily and it bothers me that we've decided we're going to let a bunch of these people out\nBecause it's going to make us feel good will if I could make these people stay in the legislate towards neighborhood instead of my neighborhood I'm good with it but that's not how it works Charles\nWell I I just felt like it the checks and balances all seemed like they're leading us for some reason\nThey're falling apart because we're losing our minds in common sense is not common thanks very\nNice lot so you got to keep on rolling I got other stuff to talk to you about what he was you don't want to keep talking just wide open on a friday let's do it Greg welcome to the program\nMan I'm doing fantastic I Hope you are pretty good\nWas watching TV last night but yeah I Know that my lawn is getting their interviews just a ton I I Believe nine o'clock what shows the question\nI was watching TV last night but yeah I Know that my Loni is getting their interviewed just a ton I I Believe nine o'clock what shows the question\nAs I see ... says I'd be saying I Believe it's nine o'clock by asking her about a ... a fire and I hope that you are when she got on a plane that was a sign that went on the commercials advertisement about it\nAnd that that's what's important that that's one of the reasons that folks have gotten where they don't really pay attention to the news\nThe fact that the coke getting on the plane makes new the fact that this huge she wears make news the fact that when I started topping in Maloney a trial the first thing that my computer search engine wants to talk about was that uh she wore clothes in Africa that resembled\nUm something the Nazi sympathizer one war in the first Indiana Jones movie\nThat that's not new to me it's it's crazy so you're going to watch the interview or not\nI don't watch a record or something other and so I can see it and see what see what it's about but I think it's just something that can aggravate Trump about\nYou got it as exactly right if they can if they can drive away you begin to have money are mad at the president or remind her she should be mad at the president or whatever they're going to do it I mean these are the same people that you know give their son a hard time British anybody\nI real quick yeah\nY'all is all three shows your show and the show that comes on you and the one after it all three of them going on fire at the same time\nA\nSin no I'll have to I'll let you know as soon as I can\nWrite that

information we can when we can [noise] it's all I can say oh what is what is it more guns they all got to say about that we'll be right back [noise]\n[noise] uh shall we start to our friday morning fall finally here this afternoon mostly sunny skies or the high temperature near Seventy two degrees chili again for tonight with alone you're fifty two beautiful on Saturday mostly sunny skies and high temperature in the middle seventies\nWe remain mostly dry on Sunday little warmer under partly sunny skies a high temperature near Seventy nine degrees I'm ... I'm Thirteen we're all just staging cross the line with your forecasts almost Crawford Broadcasting station\nThis quarter of the Scott based on the show was brought to you by elder Nelson services everything you need when it comes to HVAC your air conditioner is not working right you're heaters not working right looked him up and have the Alabama dot com or give them a call at five to six three six six two to\nFive if you tell them you heard about him always got to show you get a special holiday service called only\nDollars a the Alabama dot com my number\n[noise]\n[noise]\nI'm always\n[laughter]\nI mean you can always come\nBack to the program everybody here has breaking news that could change the future of the republic [noise] teachers suspended okay Stephen Miller Yahoo Stephen Miller you Stephen Miller is Donald Trump what Donald Trump supervisors the younger guys been blamed would be and um he's a senior policy adviser\nAnd his teacher apparently who is now Seventy years old was his third grade teacher at the Malibu Unified School district Nikki Fisk\nSo she goes out and tails she's Seventy two years old she tells the Hollywood Reporter that she had Stephen Miller as a student in third grade big Dave\nFive cars and they have to certify union hundreds when things happen\nJust for his top notch they carry over Seventy five stars and they have Honda certified unit then undergo a hundred and twenty five when banks and you'll have great horned visitor call Honda jak two of\n'em three five zero one zero zero\nOf program every body one other quick things that you want to know for the weekend Rand\nPaul was on Fox and friends I never saw this anywhere we talked about this over and over when the\n\nCongressmen and senators were shot at the baseball field did you know that the man who almost killed represents represented the skull the wounded for others\nWas actually shouting this is for health care\nHow how did how did that not get out\n\nHe says I was there at the ball field was the ... almost died from a very very angry about a man who was inside it really about rhetoric on the left in this hasn't been reported enough when he came up on the ball field with these semi automatic weapon barring probably close to two hundred shots shooting by people almost killing the he was yelling this is for healthcare\nDidn't they decided they didn't know why he did it\nAnd that's why we wonder why people think the government will say or do or hide anything Danny welcome to the program\nAnd Scott I'm OK you could comment good ideas talking about the Sabbath earlier yes um\nThe the thing that convinced me I I'm a Christian I've been observing the seven states habits for Fifteen Years now\nOkay that'd be Saturday right so I understand ... ... okay\nAnd what convinced me is that the command that says the seventh day is this Saturday at the lord so if a if you\nIf you believe in keeping at St commandments thing clearly the one that says remember the one that we've forgotten when it starts out with the war remember says what David Savage is and how you should keep it it's it's simple it's one of the tent\nI what if we messed up gallon or somewhere maybe it's really on Thursday we\nBut we know Easter is the first day a week every year\nAnd it may be rated ... but don't we just say Easter is East I'm I'm just being it's I'm just be an ornery now\nYeah I I don't know I've had people say that before but Sunday is always the first day it's always on Easter right Easter Sunday so the day before it's always a seventh day it's right Saturday\nTo say and I guess I mean I guess the Jewish people probably were fairly good except for some of those years with all their pagan leaders and stuff it it remembering which day was actively the original seven day\nLow do we probably have with that yes this Saturday is football day is hard to keep it wholly\nYeah you're a man on the Sunday by the side of it [laughter] so that I don't go ...\nWe got an advantage though we have um a CBO we can record everything in the ... you got it yeah yeah it's er watch layer a couple of other things um it'd be one that really gets

F. to president Donald Trump they use that word for the exact same reason I'm On national TV I'm a call this out and the black community it's going to give me a heads up ... about it yeah\nSee but the difference I see in this or is\nIt was that word was specifically used they knew where they were going in and to her response that phrase that he said he\nThought about that before he went on that I can tell I Do not think that I think that when Kanye West drop the\nProfanity I think that just it just kind of came out I don't think that he intended to it just happened here to saint ...\nSee if I Can't say what can you with let's think ... and I can't say with this young man was thinking when he said that\nThat could have just came out because that's the way he flow because you listen to them like I said we've got very rapidly so but they but they use the word Weiss again ... twice right okay so he asked me did the first time he knew he did he did it again so again you're given him a passing a given\nYou know I'm I'm not I'm not I'm what I'm saying is when the environment and when you're critiquing\nOr in Iran and you're giving whatever political advice you're going you're breaking things down heat targeted\nThat word specifically to undermine Kanye West in the intelligence of con you\nWell know are not that I don't believe but I think he used to um a rouse the audience ... because that's what a lot of black folks were thinking\nIntelligence of con you well know\nNow that I don't believe but I think he used to um a rouse the audience ... because that's what a lot of black folks were thinking I don't think you use the undermine 'cause nobody cared about ... ... it was right nana black mood is\nNobody I mean they've been on here who uses that word in this\nDay and age courses in front of the president Bryan again you you can pay no I'm not getting ... but you're saying this guy this article that he thought about it and he wanted to get out there and use it cut out where\nIt 'cause it's an insult Joe it is a complete in your mind in any assault\nAnd what kind of get where there was an insult to the office of president same thing\nThey want us yeah but one what specific thing you can tell Joe by the way the economy was going it's slipped he shouldn't have said it agree no no profanity but this was thought about\nHe finished vaguely used that word he used a lot of word you know but he specifically use that word which is different than you know the gangster terminology of it ... but he specifically used that wrong\nWord if you listen to the whole interview oh I Do it right and he use a lot of the ... were um to describe can you ... that was not the only word that will make up of media because we can talk about it and people get sensational out about it but he used a lot of other words the size of the house in we're okay\nTo describe Kanye West okay so here's the thing we got the I'm saying\nWhen you're talking on national TV you talking on national radio and you saying these words about people\nWe have a responsibility ... like I just almost slipped instead of the word of ... it almost came on a ... that that wasn't the word that was ... right right but I'm just saying at the end of the data when we're saying and doing these different things when we sent in these platforms\nWe have to be careful of what we say and best because I don't like it was what he said ...\nDon't give me All right Don Lemon or anybody else the right to call him that on national TV Now I saw him in person and that's the way I truly feel about you and I got a problem with going hey let's go ahead a rock would you believe that when I got to say right up and and\nAlso it saying well you're not stepping in line with the rest of us is the ... know that that that whole the whole coffee can criticism on CNN of saying you know Kanye West shouldn't be out there\nPeriod Ron I'm going to say this is like me saying best to devote okay she should not be the uh education person for the United states of America\nShe's not qualified is not she's white is not a she's a woman he's not qualified to be in that position\nBen Carson to be the head of hood ... very smart guy and he is not qualified to do that job\nOkay ... West is not qualified to talk about prison reform that's all I'm saying that's all a lot of people to say if you're not qualified on how the qualifications what are you talking about you sound like an idiot when you come in talking about the ... the vote talk about education\nSome of the stuff she says she's not qualified to see if no background and she's making lows leaves me change things in education so she's not making laws and she's just she make aren't she's thinking policies education at the department of education nice gym all he is not qualified\nShe is making stupid things without an accounting background information good for you brown yeah because the department of education needs to be dissolved\nBrian just because you have a certain feeling you have a position to fulfill ... you don't want when you vote for people you both for what qualified people right yeah OK you vote for qualified people\nI Want somebody who is going to be articulate on the issues that hand and be able to discuss them absolutely\nOkay but I'm not I didn't but nobody voted gone yeah well I mean this whole thing\nThe issues that hand and be able to discuss them absolutely okay there but I'm not\nI didn't but nobody voted gone yeah well I mean this whole thing is like it's almost as if we're like say okay well on us\nBut he's been speaking on a policy for this country that can have a repercussion his own down the road if they are listening to this guy right qualify he's\nNot qualified to articulate the individual aspects of prison reform I agree but if he's passionate about it and he's got the president's ear and the president is going to move forward and bring in a group of people to\nDiscuss this I have no problem with somebody hey we Robert ... and you step\nAway over the fence cars and bring in this person do this year\nYou we have not seen any of that stuff you just put out there we're talking about what we are we talking about what we have the right but yeah I was like wait a minute but less houses sit at the same with President Donald Trump yeah ... ... ... said at the table when it hit about a think tank we had no but nobody else we're talking about um jump around and cutting it with like you always\nHave been run was Jim Brown will do in their ... primary I write\nWhat'd you always there are many facts matter ... this is what we've seen ... all this other stuff you bring it up is not factual there is no think tank there is no other people there is nothing\nRight now we don't know bears were not an applicant brilliant that you're waiting to Joe and what am I Am I ... definitely now we're not that we're not we're not seeing this of course we're not saying we don't want all the high line up at the bottom [noise]\nLook at the hypocrisy that you're saying right oh okay okay I don't want to hear what you're saying we don't know no we don't we don't know what's going on behind all and so we can't really discuss it I'm ... I'm saying that if you want to bring up a specific thing that he's\nPassionate about any in the president or whoever is willing to listen to go okay well let me look more into that you can start a conversational way out and you're saying you it\nLet me see this happen Kanye West's runs for senator just like you he wins your position he's not qualified Brian how are you going to feel well it's the people who are like what is that how you go field well he's not qualify you more qualified\nFor the job the when he ran because he's ... where he said that he'd be the job he's making positive are you going to agree with that guy Brian ... and it was the only reason why I ran against Roy Moore because Roy Moore's unqualified\nThat's my point that's my point\nI Want I Want I Want somebody in there and but again it regardless of whether or not you're qualified if you're passionate about something and you want it to be raise awareness were that particular issue you should be able to\nSee them when they go out as saying that you think ... was his passion about prison reform I Believe he is tipped when we come back from break ... please tell me go to the computer goes to get tell me what you did in the last five years oh prison reform show me his ... his music whatever please show me something\nExact them and I and I was I made a point about that with prison reform especially within the state are you there is a law that if the private prisons do not meet their per capita\nThan they can sued the state\nIn order to recoup the funds of law of the bags that they haven't filled right and that's wrong on the ... and when we're talking about criminal justice reform we want to be bringing up those issues but it's not just the the um\nThe jail reform in making sure that we get recovery and making sure that we get rehabilitation it's all talking about the the the foundation that is providing the issues and it's not a singular seeing it seemed multi tiered issue and they need to be addressed all at once or else it's just not going to get six\nI totally agree you know it goes all the court system what color code they have all probably all they got to do and color code and every time they do they fight murdered ... dollars a month [noise] I Do for a fact because I go in the jails\nThey don't have any any military action\nAnd all that will let us go in and mentor and try to help they well they all have a choice you know you get out last year a lease on your site\nThat gets everything in your apartment you lose your car out how to fight the fight or wherever you get out you\nGet what you want to say you want to do\nIf you get out you know I\nGuess what your self righteous I Want to end it got to tell you right\nAway and exactly what a shirt on and you don't have left what else lucky enough to have the money that they get whatever the fish will\nYou underwrite the point that I first hey\nI Know you have Mike and we appreciate all the work you do with the July commencement camping all the stuff that you do you know in your home town and man you know I Can't say how much are truly appreciate you being my friend at all you do\nI Love your brother love another version my loving my own arm or\nYou know you and I can go back for one of these issues but you know there's a deeper thing that we do need to get into before we get out of here prison reform a series\nOh it's completely Syria and this is\nWhy I'm so upset with ... ...\nBecause I feel like you know he came in and hijack that because that's what his wife done you know he came and went and talked to the president because he was going to be with you any any water down the process and we already been battling in the black community about prison reform\nThat passes got lambasted mhm okay for going to talk to president Donald Trump above a prison reform\nNothing has happened that we know of at this point or art that has come up with policies or anything from the White House okay whatever group or whatever there has been in no action says then own prison reform in the public eye it\nCan I tell you something you're there is not going to be anything that can come from the White House that will fix it\nAnd here's the thing and I'm going to kind of give you a little\nDifferent perspective on the ... going in an hijacking it there and why it could be a good thing because you have senators like Rand Paul and Kamala Harris Cory Booker Elizabeth Warren um uh the late\nJohn McCain and Lindsey Graham they have all talked at ... about down prison reform and nothing gets done and they are qualified people who have been within the legislative process but they've also been lawyers and\nThey know what's wrong but nobody wants to give them a time of day and here comes this clown and ... Khan gay west acted like a clown like he always does ... ... what are we talking about right now we're talking about prison reform\nYou may not like how it's being talked about but we're talking about it so maybe that being in the limelight for just a little bit ... that we can get a serious conversation instead of the conversation ...\n... what the pastors that went up there and got land blasted you know they they criticize these black pastors for going up and talking to President Trump why should day that's what they were talking about and\nIt could be a good thing but then again it could be as you're saying that he's just hijacking and just wants to you know here himself speak which I you know more\nInclined to go with he just wants to hear him so to speak\nAnd ... and I'm an act we as a pet but maybe it has some effect maybe possibly but here's the thing that I Would say for anybody that gets a chance to sit in front of the president of United States of America and talk about an issue\nYou need\nThat that gets a chance to sit in front of the president of United States of America and talk about an issue\nYou need to make sure that you have the right person 'cause sometimes just because you live or you may need to bring somebody with ... that qualified to talk on it\nIt's great to be in the spotlight is great to get the news going about you but when you say you're passionate Brian\nI'm not the best guy who knows how to type a time\nWhen I was there trying to tell us how new is bad I mean what do you asked me that that does and I step that the women in a time that you see that you know something better than me what do I do use ... about the way because there's always somebody who knows you know something better than me I mean I knew everything I'm a hard work but I don't know everything them when we have issues like this\nJust because you're a celebrity does not make you to write messenger and I live or to deliver that message to the president or the ... in an on a national stage\nFor international energy as you've got you've got celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio that'll get up on the un and start talking about climate change and a lot of facts that he's but now there are incorrect facts but because he's a celebrity and people want to look it's an eye it's it's\nI dollar tree in a sense and because we have this form of celebrity worship and that's\nThat's my issue with the whole economy worsening it's more of the celebrity worship that we have in trying to make people credible that don't need to be credible and why I roll my eyes that the whole situation and why I just kind of brushed it off because I see it more as a dollar tree and that kind of you know like\nTaylor Swift coming out saying that she was gonna you know people should vote for the Democratic candidates in Tennessee and people are cheering and then people are viewing herb depending on your political ideology but you're elevating somebody who isn't as you said it's qualified to make those decisions but one\nThing about this with a completely different than everybody doesn't came out\nShe said this is who I'm voting for ... she said go get rid of ... to ... go get educated and vote for the person that best serves you and your family values ... very smart she was not now with some people go back and follow her because she voted for the person that will be just because of that yes\nAnd that and that's wrong to vote for somebody because your favorite celebrity is voting for them\nBut if Donald Trump to that's what Trump does that's what it's all politics when I'm In Little Rock Obama held back when they end up you know and this is what all they do\nThey don't know some of these when you go out and endorsed these people they don't really know them they for the same party yeah so they want their party to win and what the president's supposed ... everybody does what does that so what tell us with the U.S they were very smart\nIt got people register as she told you educate yourself now have you made the choice to follow her that's totally on you ... you you you go with her judgment in that to me that's what's wrong with our society or as it is wrong with outside of a celebrity worship of is always going to be there the same that I Would be but when we have a microphone\nLike you and I do and we are able to talk on these issues\nWe have to make sure that we keep the foundation in place yeah we cannot lose our sales because I'd give Donald Trump will pass no I'm not ... on his microphone I've never given him a bath and done something right almost a year so you do that right but when I disagree with the president I'm going to say that\nAnd you should and and that's our right as Americans\nBut I get lambasted to now because\nYou shouldn't be with the president know I should be able to do like I think is right now I may not be right in my position\nBut if the president is don't them to go nobody gets a job you never say anything good by the president that's the law now I've said many great things about the president but there's other things I don't like about the president I've been on record that I didn't vote for the guy okay because I didn't like what he said before the election night when I did it\nBut there are some things I don't like about the president I've been on record saying I didn't vote for the guy okay because I didn't like what he said before the election you know he went out that it kind of his great I'm doing fine I Love everything president don't don't do for the government with Jobs' great job Mr President keep doing what you're doing\nDo I like how you treat people know now people are like how he got in calls called up my commute to all the time they'll call in the community you know I don't like that\nNow people may say what is true well it's a lot of stuff to another community is to know how many times I said that white people got probably not going to affect the community but we always get called up because we are attached to the Democratic party adult and\nNot something that Lyndon Baines Johnson was you know made his life goal in order to get the black community attached at the hits a democratic\nPrimary but when I Am a foot but this is what I tell you anybody and the president of the United states sir\nI Am a man who chooses who I vote for it because I see what you can do for my company for for my for my for my family when I look at this as a man ... okay I don't need you sir you other president of the United states of America for everybody in this country not just for

we made it and let me tell you a short weeks long we can never come soon enough the week is not over but the work week almost is\nIt's friday ladies and gentlemen we know from multiple Fridays that's one friday it's friday ladies and gentlemen and we are entering into the weekend and it couldn't get any better than that you want to know why\nBecause the weekends and amazing time where we have college football\nPro football if he's still choose to watch like I Do and just a little bit of the Sabbath going on that that is really good I heard a a nice teaching last Sunday on the importance\nOf the Sabbath and it really made me think you know 'cause a lot of times on the show we talk about you know how you live in your life and how you're working and if you want this goal you got to be tunnel vision right but we also talked about this work life balance and\nThe Sabbath definitely goes into a work life balance because if you are not taking that day of arrests\nThis work life balance and the Sabbath definitely goes into a work life balance because if you are not taking that day of arrest\nYou will just be absolutely run down trodden I mean think about it with any type of mechanical anything if it is not given a break at some point\nWould be run down isn't engine's not given a break every now and again we'll it overheat I mean there's just so many things that you have to go into and that time is like when you're in an engine where you are where you check the oil where you where you replace fluids redo all that kind of stuff it's the same thing with your life when you take the Sabbath\nYou take time to really sit and think about\nUm the week ahead what's a week in the past held and how you can make the week ahead better and focus on God for twenty four hours\nAnd as much time as we spend working and slave in a way to assist them I think we spend twenty four hours focusing on God I don't really think that that that big of an ask especially since it is your eternal salvation but not to get too deep on you this morning we're going to have more of a light show today because we talked a lot about\nThe Kavanaugh situation we talked a lot about Supreme Court law we've had to delve into some deep deep and really muddy topics\nWhere there's a lotta legally and a lot of difficult stuff so today we're making a concerted effort to just stay away from the deep legally topics and\nMe and Dylan got some fun stuff for you this morning not like that fund that they tell you to do at camp where you know it's like uh what what are they called organized fun or it's like arts and crafts and you know there's always that one kid that's excited for it but that kids weird nobody really likes the arts and crafts time\nLike let's be honest I don't care how old you are you remember camp you remember forced upon\nYou remember that weird kid that was like oh yeah I Love arts and crafts turns out he was just eating glue behind the table that's why he like darts in class crafts but we'll have some fun stuff to get into today specifically Kanye West goes to the White House we'll talk about how that went or the right\nLoves it the less lost their minds\nAnd Kanye well he was just ... so we'll we'll talk about that 'cause you know it will be in the news cycle for the next twenty four forty eight Seventy two hours so we'll we'll cover it a bit he went for the same reasons that came crashing and went which the left praise but now since he's going for a different reason because he's ... he's wearing a ... hat\nApparently he's just not the same and I'm Wondering do they know that they're married to the left no they're married\nI think going one fact past what is\nEvident on the surface is really hard for the left and therefore uh they're not too sure about that but I'll let them know that they're married a little later in the show\nSo without further ado though I got to introduce the man behind the play on the man that's bringing some of the fun topics to help us get out of this quagmire that Supreme Court laws of weight doing how you doing this morning\nLine snow in June\nIt's interesting commentary on the era that we live in now called bro country does it all potentially sound the exact same\nMaybe will it ever be on the level of the only King George I'll ever\nServed George Strait definitely not eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three King George never had to wear skin tight jeans to get a point across yeah I'm Talking to you Brian I still like some of your music eight six six bucks huh one Ninety nine thirty three I Hope so\nAcross yeah I'm Talking to you Brian and I still like some of your music eight six six [laughter] one Ninety nine thirty three I Hope somewhere down the road I get into entertainment in that line comes up by ... I Hope they pull that audio while I'm entered a interviewing Luke Bryan that would be hilarious eight six six by the time one\nNinety nine thirty three let's go to David on line one David how're you doing this morning\nHey how's it going very good how about yourself\nYeah well I like the content of this morning show you know I wanted and for years and years who would be able to replace George no hurry but now I think we've found are man you are the future coast to coast man you got it made do you go from work at an early morning overnight and then you'll be home\nAll this time but what I was gonna say it was you and you know\nThat's no prior those are big shoes to fail man you know I didn't think he would make it when you replace start bell but hey you know he's still here I'm pretty wise yeah what I'd like to talk about is um\nI guess about I had a falling out with a light it\nWent live on a small town called ... and had a small had a falling out with a lady at a local Methodist Church there me and my wife had worked as a social youth pastors yeah under the regular youth pastor mhm and uh so he left to go back home to a Florence Muscle Shoals area\nAnd nobody was going to take over the youth group for me and my wife you know we say we'll do it\nAnd for some reason other than this one lady that\nAlways seems to be the cause of controversy ... uh she was just very innately opposed to us doing it you know and we said look you know we're not looking for any money well you know we'll see them out of our own part you know she absolutely she control the board that controls the church so\nWe left so I guess that was maybe seven or eight years ago and I really started studying astrology I said you know I've always heard of this thing astrology you know me and my son yeah but I didn't know anything about a star and believe it or not here to seven years later really gotten into it I read various books on it\nI studied my a personal chart every day and then uh there's like two or three sources of a terrible car radio or what do you call them or they don't call I'm terrible card readers I you know whereas I read your tear cards for the month and they\nKind of way over my head David I'm not somebody can answer that yes well that's okay but\nUh yeah uh yeah but they read your your they raised the terror cars and they tell you what each one means and how can pertain to you as you're signed but anyway I'm\nA south started really getting into this and I've been documented over the years and I have found that on an average I found it to be eighty five percent correct\nAnd you know very specific\nYeah and ah you know because I had a lot of doubts when I went into it but they got all goes about how the planets are lined when you're born it goes about how the all the planets why right now I'm painting or Venus can be saying underneath the ...\nWhich say Saudi wearing the aries manage to October twenty four and it tells you what all that means to me as a sign you know and everything that's cool though but I found that ... years of being eighty five percent accurate and I mean that's why I thought maybe twenty percent of the most mhm but I was really shocked at it's eighty five percent accurate\nYou know on an average so interest you know that's my little tail\nInteresting appreciate David thank you\nIt was really shocked or five percent accurate you're on an average show interest you know that's my little tail interesting I appreciate David thank you but thanks very\nAll right you have a great day right talking about a little bit about astrology you know I've never really understood is like I don't get the correlation like\nI was there are people like David to believe in it vehemently like not seemingly that's the wrong word that's an angry words that believe in it religiously right obviously it's not their God that they believe in it a lot let's just use the word religiously to mean a lot so\nI never really understood what the concept behind it is because it just seems like in dealing correct me if I'm wrong it seems like something having to do with the moon and the planet alignment is going to affect my body in some way and listen I don't think what's happening on Pluto\nIs going to effect if I get a raise tomorrow you know what I'm saying I just I don't see it I don't see the correlation but there are some people that live by that man check that horoscope every day\nI mean if somebody came up to me and said I don't even know my birthday is December twenty second if anyone can tell me what I Am that'd be perfect\nBut somebody came up and said something I don't even know the science that shows you how good I'm going to do on the test but they said something like urine aqua man isn't that one of them are ... are Aquarius or not ... as a superhero I'm a knock one man but they come up and they said you're an Aquarius and I said\nWhat then they said you're an Aquarius oh it was like what does that mean and they're like you're going to win twenty dollars today\nI was like I don't I don't understand how that works you are a Capricorn a Capricorn yeah no it's pronounced candy corn I like candy corn I don't know what a Capricorn is but I like candy corn as well like I just don't understand a strategy to you at ... at all\nI understand it well enough to know that every single one of the horse gets put out there for every sign are done in such a vague way to where you can interpret it and it's going to apply to the Dodgers that day\nThat's what I thought I thought that horoscopes were along the lines of an unknown gonna catch some flak for saying this but like Joel all singing the evangelists on\nLike you go out and you say something that's really vague that you could take any amount of success and it could be a attributed to that you could say yeah yeah yeah Joel seen really had it right like yeah yeah yeah the sign really had it right you know what I'm saying\nThere's also a lady that wrote a book I Want to say it was in the early Nineteen hundreds that was about some signs that really kicked all of it all sons lines old that's another name for a all of these other uh astrology sign\nSo do people believe that it dictates your life like a guide sit or that it's something that just predicts that rather\nThan people think that dictates that I don't see how that would go with the religion like I don't see how those could intertwined if it dictate your life then that saying that God is in dictating your life and therefore it's kinda flaky waters there\nIf you believe in previous nation you can I can see an argument being made where they do intertwined yeah\nDon't know we're getting too deep this morning let's go back to talking about kicking cats in moving traffic just kidding just kidding but there was something funny that I saw the other day but uh but I thought you'd like in so peta is going around trying to get you to stop eating meat ladies and gentlemen they're trying to get you stop eating steak and they have a bowl\nUh but I thought you'd like him so peta is going around trying to get you to stop eating meat ladies and gentlemen they're trying to get you stop eating steak\nAnd they have a bold new tactic they go out and I believe it's pita\nI don't know the organization wasn't attributed here but it looks like a pita right it's either a pita or the girl down the street that doesn't showers really hairy and tells you she's begun when the conversation start\nSo she she came up and uh she put something on a pack of a burgers and steaks right and the burgers and steaks they say\nMy name is Chloe I wanted to live your quote personal choice killed me don't buy it and it's a picture of Chloe the cow\nOn that and Chloe the cows all smiley in anything\nAnd so did you have made the mistake of putting out a tweet that that would you still eat it but even if they had this message that said\nMy name was Chloe I wanted to live your personal choice killed me don't\nBuy it yes I Would and I we just call that meal Chloe\nI was gonna say I put something like I'll have the glow especially a lot a lot of people were saying some really weird things that that is just such a weird tactic in my mind you put a name on my food I'm going to call him that name while I eat it now that's weird 'cause then you start getting attached to it\nWell abs absolutely there's there have been which isn't all that kind of stuff for thousands of years matter of fact ah though back and read about saw the first king of Israel he got in trouble because when he was when the spirit has left him and he was getting ready to be replaced\nHe actually went in and acquired of a witch or to have his fortune told\nAnd there are familiar spirits enter he's talked about this before um if you have the word\nJeanie Jeanie comes from Jen Jen was an Arabic term\nThat's the only way are you a gene is appearing some gym\nYeah but it's it's a word for spirit and it would be a spirit that would come and tell you information matter of fact Mohammad when he started Islam a gym came to him and started giving them information and that's where and those gyms are evil spirits\nInteresting so I Know that yeah you got to mess with terror cards we gee boards horoscopes all that stuff you asking for trouble\n... do you know what's your sign is so I can at least give you your horoscope before you go\nI I Am from the Chinese year of the dragon and the irony of that is that dragons are considered in secular world and taking the world's to be very wise\nOkay I'm not good at horoscope you're going to break that down for me what is the Chinese you're the dragon is that a horoscope\nWell it's it's the Chinese horoscope like the rest of us do the rest of the great 'cause everybody do months and you have vertigo and Leo and all that which I fall into the vertigo thing\nOr that's what I'm looking for them or if you had to make this difficult on me\n[laughter] All right Murphy\nReady for this October twelve twenty Eighteen ooh this is weird\nSome stimulating discussions not insightful but stimulating some stimulating discussions could take

stimulating discussion [laughter]\nThere's a lot of paperwork might need your attention today Taurus you might throw a lot of your focus in energy into getting it all done stimulating conversations

the end of the day what\nYou would take a walk at the end of say since you're apt to encounter so much new information that you'll want to clear your head in order to absorb it all so you need to go
