I might have been too emotional at times I Know that my tone was sharp and I said a few things I should not have said I Hope everyone can understand that I was there was a son a husband and a dad\nI testified with five\nPeople for most in my mind my mom my dad and my wife and most of all my daughter's going forward you can count on me to be the same kind of judge in person I've been to the entire twenty eight year legal career hardworking even killed open mind\nGoing forward you can count on me to be the same kind of judge in person I've been to the entire twenty eight year legal career hardworking even killed open minded independent and dedicated to the constitution and the public good\nAs a judge I've always treated colleagues and lit against with the utmost respect I've been known for my courtesy on and off the bench I have not changed a terrific Columbine Cavanaugh I think it's it it was both well timed and important to do this\nOr let's go to Steve\nIn North\nCarolina it's a ... wait and see if we go to Robin Massachusetts first online five ... welcome\nHi Laura I'm first off can I say that at the end of my day\nWhen I sit down to watch your show that is the capstone on my day I really love watching you and and she knew an action and it's an honor to speak to you right now so what I wanted to say is that you made a point on your angle the other night and I quite honestly don't think it's gotten enough attention\nAnd that's the idea that you said if I recall that Trump is teaching the Republicans how to fight and I absolutely think that that was a brilliant insight I mean it I think we're seeing the results of that all over the place right now\nI think Rob that came to me as I was watching Lindsey Graham during the confirmation battle when he he saw that Kavanaugh I think was getting a little too he was besieged and the questions and Kevin I was I think he was getting real hot okay\nAnd I think Lindsey Graham decided you know something to heck with this I'm I'm going to take the floor and I'm going to reset this debate about the cabin are confirmation he did that I think it was after the president's press conference\nWhen the president came out an hour and a half and he was just fantastic and his support of Kavanaugh\nAnd with whether it's what the reporters how we dealt with reporters he was having a good time but he said yeah I'm not doing this anymore I'm not I'm not playing defense anymore\nAnd the Republicans have got to stop playing defense Trump won by being on the off and he's not in perpetual apology mode because he said he sent a sharp tweet about someone he kept moving forward he didn't look back\nHe's not going to dwell over mistakes we all need to do that any look forward to keep moving the ball down the field that's what Trump has taught us as a Republican and guess what a lot of Republicans are now seeing it he's transforming the political party and it was in a moment too soon\nI really appreciate your comments Robin we have a great team on the anger mango we're going to take a break Kellyanne Conway up next\n\nThis is Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new Jenny so sunspot correct her she says she loves it it should go to product every day she has sunspots an age spots I can see a definite difference in her skin since using it watcher sunspots age spots and even read inflamed patches vanished right before your eyes\nFor moms for Kavanaugh makes at that point exactly this could be your husband your brother your son\nYour cousin your co worker and people are concerned about that as well what about this new report that Leland income Kaiser\nWho Christine Blasey Ford said was at the party in question could corroborate her claims she said she felt pressure\nTo change her sworn statement by a former FBI agent she felt pressured because she said I Can't ... can't repeat it but he can't collaborated I don't know Brett Kavanaugh I was never had a party with Brett Kavanaugh as described by Ford and then those who are protesting this is about truth and justice in fact finding\nA pressuring her to change your story which is a fancy word is saying asking her to lie\nWell it's also a crime yes I'll travel\nA lot of that can be looked at after this who ... who leaked for his identity will kind of emails were going back and forth why Dianne Feinstein recommended these a democratic activist\nLawyers to Ford why they never told her she can testify in private and keep her ... her face in her name out of the press as much as she could she could just do it in California they go to them that something is Senator Lindsey Graham told me right away he said she can do it by phone we can send somebody out there but no no no they needed a clean slate and the cameras\nOn for them and I guess there next client base so it it's just been awful but America has been watching and\nOut there but no no no they needed a clean slate and the cameras\nOn for them and I guess there next client base so it it's just an awful but America has been watching and I don't the after he's confirmed and hopefully he will be I won't get ahead of the way certain senators are grappling with their vote decided to vote Lara but\nUm if judge Kavanaugh is confirmed as a justice of the United States Supreme court this will not end there they think it won't end because it's still be shouting it and then they've never met for things these men have never done to them personally and individually\nBut other folks won't forget how people behaved how they were her raining folks drive drumming them out of restaurants publishing their their kids' names and their personal home addresses\nThat that's not that's not the first amendment that's just crazy that's completely crazy you know do you\nThink that in part I mean are are you argue this last week uh when the president came out of the press conference which I think it was one of his best press conferences last week was incredible I mean you could have gone for three hours\nOr that he taught\nA really needed lesson much needed lesson to Republicans on how to fight\nFor what you believe in a fight for a principal fight for a person instead of being back on your heels cowering in an elevator that that the reason Trump got elected as because he wasn't gonna take that any more he wasn't going to just keep getting pummeled and beyond perpetual a perpetual apology tour for either him sell for America and\nHe he's not they called him ... I think the bullies are the people who are swarming individuals in public or the Senate or restaurants and and screaming at them within a centimeter of their skin\nBut I think Trump taught the Republicans a lot throughout this whole thing\nIn a large shock me just last night after I was on your TV show and thanks for having me or that the way everybody describes Donald Trump President Trump is exactly that they're behaving and when I don't see from him he's\nFuming he's throwing things at the TV he's angry he's a bully it's exactly who they've become he's not\nThat way how they're welcome yeah these unbelievable job numbers and and bringing peace to across the world and bring it make us prosper it at home if he's sitting there fuming all day they they own the acrimony they own the va to predict vicious wave via way they've gone after people um according to one gender according to one's politics and\nYou're so right he doesn't retreat and backed down when he believes in a principal\nOr a principal in this case PAL Brett Kavanaugh and they didn't know each other before this they didn't know each other well at all but the president selling judge Kavanaugh somebody who sat\nSo is sitting on the DC circuit second highest court in the land over three hundred ... judicial opinions that none of these Democrats even try to pick apart I respect them far more Lars they said you know we have a problem with the five following opinions that he wrote and these particular passages we think he went outside the contours of the constitution the law there's\nNo such are no doubt on about that they're talking about a passage\nFrom a yearbook you can sit in a post it note versus three hundred judicial opinions the answers to twelve hundred written questions over one million documents you need a Mack truck the hall around all this stuff he's produced and you need a post it to talk about a passage in your book\nSo this just strikes a lot of Americans even apolitical Americans Laura as illogical and beyond commonsense I respect them or if they said we're angry lost the election two years ago and that President Trump is reshaping the federal judiciary was constitutional less than all this nonsense\nWe're going to later on in the show Kelly and have a discussion about\nWhat these currents feminists are doing to poison the relationship between men and women and specifically the uh this idea that if you're if you're an accuser\nPoison the relationship between men and women and specifically the ah this idea that if you're if you're an accuser\nYou must be heard and you must be believed in if you're not believe then you're anti woman or you're anti victim and justice Thomas's talked about this a lot you know the ... we all have to stop\nIdentifying ourselves as victims of this or victims of that because that's the that's not going to help you advance as a person as being a victim\nIt doesn't and that every every man as a perpetrator every man has to shoulder the burden of the me too movement every man is a rape is every man is a sexual harassed or by virtue of their gender and that everyone is a victim\nUm even those who many who are that had been victims of\nSexual misconduct or worse don't necessarily consider themselves victims overall and that's being lost in the den here as well I mean if you if you asked if you do one of those are asking everybody who's out there with the masking tape on their mouths and the signs of holding up why are they there what this what is this about\nIt you're going to get answers that I really had nothing to do with his confirmation and really nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh that the Democrats used at Ford because they they breed shirt anonymity they revealed her identity to their while they sat on this for six weeks\nAnd then they set her up with attorneys who never even ... even the of telling her what her rights were what she could do and they're using Kavanaugh and\nHis shoulders should not be\nShould not be shouldering the entire me to live in by the way large ding ding ding happy anniversary when you were interested in me to move it but you know who started it not Brett Kavanaugh Harvey Weinstein ... today it was Harvey Weinstein major democratic donor you're not going to find him in a picture that Brett Kavanaugh you're gonna find it in pictures with Hillary Clinton\nAnd a lot a lot of a powerful now powerful female actresses in Hollywood who look to the other way long after they were just starting out long after they were very powerful and very wealthy but\nLet's remember how who got this all started let's remember he's facing criminal charges he's facing criminal charges and doesn't you know the women describing kind of not sending thirty six years ... years ago and song corroborated\nThis was a a moment yesterday on MSNBC a network that I literally don't even watch it anymore because it's so it's not even interesting so predictable\nBut this was Mika Brzezinski are reacting to ah your comment that Dr Ford look she was not treated badly she was treated like a ... a ...\nWhy can't you be the egg\nTail in the ... egg and tell your story because he say women should be heard you talk to both sides of your mouth you say that women should be heard their stories are believable are credible and understanding and compelling well let's hear yours\nThat's very convenient to drop that but I Want to know your story I Want to know what happened you should have justice ... shouldn't hold on I'm not I don't know your value okay you can't just throw that out as a political dagger to protect this reprehensible predator of a president\nYour reaction to the\nWho I have their reaction to that much I think that many people generally has made my point for me that people are judged women are judged by of what their grief or their harm or their recourse\nOr their quote victimhood based on their politics and I think many people are making the point for me but I don't dignify many things out there are because they're they're wholly irrelevant and I will tell you a lot of blowback yesterday a lot of pushback and a lot of low back um\nThere are because they're they're wholly irrelevant and I will tell you a lot of blowback yesterday a lot of pushback and a lot of low back\nOn and I'll I'll have my say about that at some other time but at the moment I think it's completely irrelevant given how how high the stakes are Laura or to get justice Kavanaugh confirmed and as an associate justice United States Supreme Court but it won't be bullied I won't be bullied either\nAnd I I won't be bullied um and I I'll have my say I'm not going to say much else right now that I find it to be on basically are relevant and when I talked about the fabric drag which by the way it was trending on social media I Love I Love informing generations that\nOf a new term that may not know it uh but when I was

you\nThat if you try to crash or party this is the kind of thing we're going to do to you and I think the only way to combat that is to fight it aggressively and make sure the people who pulled that are out to be held to account if you if we just getting a crouch\nLet them keep doing it to us there won't be any us left because no good people will want to get into politics\nAnd I I really mean us it's not just someone from coming from someone who supported the president in the campaign but coming from a a lawyer and a longtime conservative like myself I really believe Trump taught the Republicans how to fight I mean it's not going to simple formulation but\nFor a long time Republicans were just taking it and they were afraid they were all just like they were all like\nIn an elevator on any longer I've never seen Mitch McConnell fight harder than he fought for this nomination\nThere well I think he's showing Trump is showing that this is what people have wanted all along and look at this sometimes to the president I think goes way overboard and makes me cringe but if I go into my head if I have to pick\nI Want somebody who's going to fight than somebody who's not and if that means there's going to be excess from time to time then you know then there's going to be accessed from time to time\nBut I think he's showing that there's a hunger on our side to not just

a compelling way after the election to say that you know this was on the table for people to consider and you have a mandate now to stop it because people voted against it so I think this not only has to be fought but it has to be heat up\nA as an election issue and frankly it helps the Republicans to take it up because\nI I've seen you say this ... you know on television and heard you on the radio said a million times\nOrdinary people commonsense people do not like the stuff I mean they see these these Olin ski I direct action tactics and they say you know there's some parts of this\nAgenda

Anthony Lewis what are you seeing\nAll week I can just to absolutely agree with what everyone else is that wave knocked over four hundred thousand doors in Indiana\nAnd overwhelmingly we have support here for judge Kavanaugh I think what you said about people finally just getting sick to death we see a lot of people saying we were going to vote Democrat but we're changing our vote we can't believe these tactics\nI think that um the uh the adage thing innocent before proven\nUm you know that you have to prove you're innocent says what has sparked people to be just outraged and America we believe in the bill of rights in the constitution and that means that you are innocent until you're proven guilty or not the opposite way\nAnd that's what's really sparked people to be angry and feeling as though this man is an utterly destroyed without any proof and it's changed their mind\nYou know you you see a lot of that and and I think um the\n... again I think the American people at their core our fear beyond ideology beyond anything they're fair minded people\nAnd had these allegations panned out had a witness or corroborating evidence been produced they might have taken a very different view of this but the unrelenting salt on this guy\nIn the face of no evidence at all I think that his outrage and let me tell you learned this the other day and we are in complete agreement I think\nWe may not be seeing the you're the woman this midterm election this could be the year of the man or the backlash demand where men come flooding the the voting booth because they think my gosh this is going to be meet tomorrow we're going to be right back copy very quickly just want to ask you this\nThe polls are tightening up between ... and a cinema\nIn I'm In Arizona you were there a forty five ... forty seven cinema could this\nTo the polls for ...\nWell I I Hope so and it it's all of that turnout is those who are concerned about having a part of an ... you got to get out there and the turnout ... I think with Sally can land and we all have to pull together\nOr we will leave with their latest please stay with us we're going to take a quick break them we'll get to all your calls eight five five forty ... the real luring from show continues Raymond ... sitting in for the great lady course incremental tonight ten pm eastern on the Fox news show they\n\n\nWeigh three hundred and twenty nine pounds I was a heart attack when that happened I got four hundred it makes me not so hungry started noticing more energy or noticed my belly we're starting to shrink started she weighed come off some pounds I went for three thirty to forty five four fifty six year old guy to lose that much worse it's rather I feel I feel like I was ...\nI myself and the mother of two children\nMy daughter is Fifteen and I wonder if it means that you're saying you're worried about your daughter will not be able to what I worry that my daughter is getting a message from Congress said her experiences that her safety is not important\nBut is it about abortion say a word your daughter or not going to get an I'm also worried that my daughter has not had the right to control her okay okay I just I just want to know what we're talking about thank God I'm worried about\nYour reaction to that Jody Smith the of the Susan B. Anthony Lewis the Indiana State director\nWell first and foremost I'm the mother of five children and three daughters and I certainly would be a lot more I'm also the mother of friends\nAnd I would be very concerned about ah my daughter or son I'm telling the truth and making certain that they have the the right to express themselves we hold certainly no ill feelings towards um\nAnd making certain that they have the the right to express themselves we hold certainly no ill feelings towards um towards a Christian ... but for it but at the same time we've got to know that the truth matters and an Indiana votes have consequences\nYou know we have a very tight Senate race here as well\nAnd when people choose to initially say they're going to vote for somebody because they are qualified are not qualified and then\nEvery five minutes the parameters changes to what we're utilizing to determine our vote people remember that and one of the biggest things in Indiana that we're saying is\nMothers are concerned about their children that are going to be the next generation leaders ever being willing to run for anything I've talked to so many\nMillennials boys and girls are young men and young women that are saying I never want to put my family or myself in that position\nYou know how in the world is judge Kavanaugh holding up underneath all of this especially for his own family so it's really it's a fascinating to me that these women are making it about race when everybody involved in this particular incident as white\nEducated and and upper income so it's a doesn't make much sense to me that that's\nIt's become about color it's become about\nUm women it really is as much about a judge Kavanaugh having the right to um have his innocence presumed to be full and be proven guilty so that's\nAbout ... Indiana I think that's where a lot of voters and Americans come down there they they feel\n... they didn't have a real strong feeling about bread coming on the same way the president's ... up until we can go to knew he was but watching this play out watching the dramatic testimony seeing the accusations and the lack of evidence I think they come down to what you just mentioned\nIt seems a presumption of guilt and something else politics politics is overwhelming all of this this is ideological blood sport\nAnd a man's reputation whose family be damned we're going to take this nomination don't becomes the marching orders no matter what adult calls\nAnd I think the American people now are about to have a referendum on that idea that you can take down the political opponents at any cost with no evidence\nAnd shame destroy use reputation for all time in public and even force of a of a woman who's going through some sort of distrust into the open to be used as your political weapon that I think you use\nThe Americans look at that and go man this concerns me\nJunior I Want to ask you um you you have the big governor's race a hotly contested one in Georgia between sushi Abramson and Brian Kemp he's up the Republican brand company two points\nDo you believe the milk conservatives are going to rally there in that governors\nYes I did and I think this Kavanaugh hearings going to really play into that because it's making when I\nWas really upset that people are playing that the women against man card and I'm Stacey Abrams is a woman\nBut Brian can't is at a conservative man who stands for our conservative principles personal responsibility limited government and lower taxes all the things that we\nAre that's our party is all about so I really do think and I have seen just in the last week or so across this date people are more motivated than ever now to get out get out\nOutset I really do think and I had thing just in the last week or so across this date\nPeople are more motivated than ever now to get out\nGet out and that and not only that but volunteer that I was at camp campaigning either gay people were coming in to get yard signs and the topic of the conversation\nWas exactly what we're talking about the Kavanaugh hearings and how we said this politics being played out and they'll they they are really playing dirty the left is playing dirty and people don't want to say this they really are discouraged\nYeah no I I you know as I look out and watches it it does have all the markings of the last presidential election where we saw a lot of drama for the cameras celebrities coming out now we've had walkouts in protests and signs and confrontations with senators and these dramatic moments\nAt the same time in coffee shops in factories in the school on to pick up the kids if you listen closely you're hearing something very different this same dynamic I think is what propelled Trump into office and it was that kind of well he called the silent majority\nI'm my sense it's it's just working Americans\nAnd Americans would not by nature political activists they don't get out in March the working there working they privately have their views about politics that they spread over the dinner table or to their families occasionally to their friends but it's not something you go to war over\nAnd ... today in Washington I have to tell you\nI've seen friendship shattered people simply do don't talk to each other\nAnd it's all about politics it's because they they disagree politically and it's become an ugly violent thing where once was dialogue to try to convince the other person to your point of view today it's slash smashing destroy\nAnd I don't think Americans particularly women really want that now their core group I think who do and we've seen them in the streets\nBut moms wives working women ... I I don't think it's where they live I'm going to give a quick round Robin we're going to go through every body again a starting with military Potter of from the Virginia Republican Party in West Virginia are your thoughts on where we might be headed here in these midterms\n[laughter] I think that uh due to the situation with this nomination of a\nA very very qualified a judge the Supreme Court I think that the Republicans are energized to get out and vote\nFor Republicans conservative Republicans that will support President Trump's agenda and I think the Democrats were also get out and vote the right way to for cable because West Virginia's counties there's fifty five of them\nAt all fifty five went for Trump and the election\nSo that meant and twenty six states that means that we had had Democrat votes as well and I believe that the Democrats also are a work or to get out and vote for Republicans this time\nSo I think that the air thanks looking good and we love our country and we want to protect our country so and I'm going to spend every last minute I can uh if it's my last breath\nTrying to stand up for what's right for our country\nOkay well I don't want you to do that for military we now we need you in December so hang it have email last breath I'm so busy [laughter] well you keep going great to talk to your junior high our last word do you um you're you're the you're in Georgia or the Republican Party in Georgia\nOr given this enthusiasm we're seeing given the cabin I'll Fight in the in the way it's being processed by voters what impact will it up on the midterms\nI ... I think it is ... ... more and I also think that people that were kind of ...\nSo it's by voters what impact will end up in the ...\nI ... I think it is energizing the veterans more and I also think that people that were kind of neutral and on the fence that were energized about mid term because a lot of times people don't get excited about the terms I think we're going to see ... where you've heard a lot about the blue wave I Believe the red way is going to come and people are\nSick and tired of the in the late ... around and they are going to stand up for their freedom so we love our country we care about our country and those people are going to come out of the woodwork and I think it's going to be a ... not just going to be a way it's going to be a ... and people are going to a shock shock and awe as what I predict\n... a Judy Smith I'm I'm going to end with you you know Republicans were really bad at telling their story I always critique them to this they they can't tell a story to save their lives\nIn this instance the Democrats gave them a dramatic story that ended up breaking their way how will this play the drama the intimacy and the projection I think many voters are are are engaged in as they project themselves on the cabinet and his family and what they've been through\nWhile I agree with what the other gal said in Indiana we love our country we were first on the board for Trump\nRemember that Mike Pence's is locked in Indiana and we are here to say that we support U.S Supreme court justices supports the constitution of the United states living breathing document\nAnd for that reason because we are so strong we also will support a senator\nThat will actually be the incumbent because he is an outsider because his conservative and because he will stand for the values that Hoosiers believe and\nSo we believe that we also are going to see a red wave a red sooner in our state of voters that come out that never have before just as we saw during the Trump race where people voted for the very first time in their lives\nOh nice to have some kind\n[noise] well\nI think they don't ... again [noise]\n[noise]\nCat or limiting the\nLooking than I told him to surrender and I've learned\nTo make a lifetime [noise]\n[noise] I'm wandering\nAround the light on W.

I might have been too emotional at times I Know that my tone was sharp and I said a few things I should not have said I Hope everyone can understand that I was there was a son a husband and a dad\nI testified with five people for most in my mind my mom my dad and my wife and most of all my daughter's\nGoing forward you can count on me to be the same kind of judge in person I've been to the entire twenty eight year legal career hardworking even killed open minded independent and dedicated to the constitution and the public good\nAs a judge I've always treated colleagues and lit against with the utmost respect I've been known for my courtesy on and off the bench I have not changed uh it was a terrific column by Kavanaugh I think it's\nIt it was both well timed and important to do this\nOr let's go to Steve\nIn North Carolina it's a ... wait and see if we go to Robin Massachusetts first online five ... welcome\nHi Laura I'm first off can I say that at the end of my day\nWhen I sit down to watch your show that is the capstone of my day I really love watching you and and she knew an action and it's an honor to speak to you right now so what I wanted to say is that you made a point on your angle the other night and I quite honestly don't think it's gotten enough attention\nAnd that's the idea that you said if I recall that Trump is teaching the Republicans how to fight and I have ... we think that that was a brilliant insight I mean it I think a chore seeing the results of that all over the place right now\nI think Rob that came to me as I was watching Lindsey Graham\nDuring the confirmation battle when he he saw that Kavanaugh I think was getting a little too he was besieged and the questions and Kevin I was I think he was getting real hot okay\nAnd I think Lindsey Graham decided you know something to heck with this I'm I'm going to take the floor and I'm going to reset this debate about the cabin are confirmation he did that I think it was after the president's press conference\nWhen the president came out an hour and a half and he was just fantastic and his support of Kavanaugh\nAnd with whether what's what the reporters how we dealt with reporters\nHe was having a good time but he said yeah I'm not doing this anymore I'm not I'm not playing defense anymore and the Republicans have got to stop playing defense Trump won by being on the off\nA good time but he said you have to do this anymore I'm not I'm not playing defense anymore and the Republicans have got to stop playing defense Trump won by being on the off and he's not in perpetual apology mode because he said he sent a sharp tweet about someone he kept moving forward he didn't look back\nHe's not going to dwell over mistakes we all need to do that and he looked forward keep moving the ball down the field that's what Trump has taught us as Republicans and guess what a lot of Republicans are now seeing it he's transforming this political party and it was in a moment too soon\nI really appreciate your comments Robin we have a great team on the anger mango we're going to take a break Kellyanne Conway up next\n\nThis is Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new Jenny cell sunspot correct her she says she loves it it should go to product every day she has sunspots an age spots of can see a definite difference in her skin since using it watcher sunspots age spots and even read inflame patches of vanished right before your eyes\nFor moms for Kavanaugh makes at that point exactly this could be your husband your brother your son\nYour cousin your co worker and people are concerned about that as well what about this new report that Leland income Kaiser\nWho Christine Blasey Ford said was at the party and question to corroborate her claims she said she felt pressure\nTo change her sworn statement by a former FBI agent she felt pressured because she said I Can't corroborate I Can't repeat it but I Can't corroborated I don't know Brett Kavanaugh I was never had a party with Brett Kavanaugh as described by Ford and then those who are protesting this is about truth and justice in fact finding\nA pressuring her to change your story which is a fancy word is saying asking her to lie\nWell it's also a crime yes I'll Try and\nDo a lot of that can be looked at after this who ... who leaked Ford's identity will kind of emails were going back and forth why Dianne Feinstein recommended these a democratic activist\nLawyers to Ford why they never told her she can testify in private and keep her ... her face in her name out of the press as much as she could she could just do it in California they go to them that's something that Senator Lindsey Graham told me right away he said she can do it by phone we can send somebody out there but no no no they needed a clean slate and the cameras\nOn for them and I guess there next client base so it it's just an awful but America has been watching and I don't the after he's confirmed and hopefully he will be I won't get ahead of the way certain senators are grappling with their vote decided to vote Lara but\nUm if judge Kavanaugh is confirmed as a justice of the United States Supreme court this will not end there they think it won't end because this will be shouting at men they've never met for things these men have never done to them personally and individually\nBut other folks won't forget how people behaved how they were harassing and folks drive drumming them out of restaurants publishing their their kids' names in their personal home addresses\nThat that's not that's not the first amendment that's just crazy that's crazy you know do you\nThink that in part I mean are are you argue this last week uh when the president came out of the press conference which I think was one of his best press conferences last week of incredible I mean you could have gone for three hours\nOr that he taught\nUp a really needed lesson much needed lesson to Republicans on how to fight for what you believe in a fight\nFor a principal fight for a person instead of being back on your heels cowering in an elevator that the the reason Trump got elected as because he wasn't gonna take that any more he wasn't going to just keep getting pummeled and beyond perpetual a perpetual apology tour for either him solve for America and\nHe he's not they called him ... I think the bullies are the people who are swarming individuals in public or the Senate or restaurants and and screaming at them within a centimeter of their skin but I think Trump's taught the Republicans a lot throughout this whole thing\nIn a large struck me just last night after I was on your TV show and thanks for having me uh that the way everybody describes Donald Trump President Trump is exactly that they're behaving and when I don't see from him he's\nFuming he's throwing things at the TV he's angry he's a bully it's exactly who they've become he's not\nWay how they're welcome yeah these unbelievable job numbers and and bringing peace across the world and bring it make us prosper it at home if he's sitting there fuming all day they\nAnd they're welcome yeah these unbelievable job numbers and and bringing peace across the world and bring it make us prosper it at home if he's sitting there fuming all day they they own the acrimony they own the va to produce vicious wave via way they've gone after people um according to one gender according to one's politics\nAnd you're so right he doesn't retreat and back down when he believes in a principal\nOr a principal in this case PAL Brett Kavanaugh and they didn't know each other before this they didn't know each other well at all but the President Saleh judge Kavanaugh somebody who sat\nSo is sitting on the DC circuit second highest court in the land over three hundred dishes judicial opinions that none of these Democrats even try to pick apart I respect them far more Lars they said you know we have a problem with the five following opinions that he wrote and these particular passages we think he went outside the contours of the constitutional law\nThere is no such are no doubt on about ... they're talking about a passage\nFrom a yearbook you can sit in a post it note versus three hundred judicial opinions the answers to twelve hundred written questions over one million documents you need a Mack truck the hall around all this stuff he's produced and you need a post it to talk about a passage in your book\nSo this just drive a lot of Americans even apolitical Americans ... as a logical and beyond commonsense I respect them or if they said we're angry lost the election two years ago and that President Trump is reshaping the federal judiciary was constitutional less than all this nonsense\nWe're going to later on in the show Kelly and have a discussion about\nWhat these currents feminists are doing to poison the relationship between men and women and specifically the ah this idea that if you're if you're an accuser\nYou must be heard and you must be believed and if you're not believe then you're anti warmer or you're anti victim and justice Thomas's talked about this a lot you know the ... we all have to stop\nIdentifying ourselves as victims of this or victims of that because that's the that's not going to help you advance as a person as being at a victim\nIt doesn't and that every every man as a perpetrator every man has to shoulder the burden of the me too movement every man is a rape is every man is a sexual harassed or by virtue of their gender and then everyone is a victim\nOn even those who many who are that have been victims of\nSexual misconduct or worse don't necessarily consider themselves victims overall and that's being lost in the den here as well I mean if you if you asked if you do one of those are asking everybody who's out there with the masking tape on their mouths and the signs are holding up why are they there what this what is this about\nIt you're going to get answers that I really had nothing to do with his confirmation and really nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh that the Democrats used at Ford because they they breed shirt anonymity they revealed her identity to the world they sat on this for six weeks\nAnd then they set her up with attorneys who never even ... even the of telling her what her rights were what she could do and they're using Kavanaugh and his shoulders should not be\nShould not be shouldering the entire me to live and by the way large ding ding ding happy anniversary one year anniversary the me too movement but you know who started it not Brett Kavanaugh Harvey Weinstein you know ... year ago today it was Harvey Weinstein major democratic donor you're not going to find him and a picture of Brett Kavanaugh you're going to find it in pictures with Hillary Clinton\nAnd a lotta a lot of a powerful now powerful female actresses in Hollywood who look to the other way long after they were just starting out long after they were very powerful and very wealthy but let's remember how who got this all started let's remember he's facing criminal charges he's facing criminal charges and\nMean the women describing kind of it's not something thirty six years ... years ago and still on corroborated this was a a moment\nCriminal charges he's facing criminal charges and doesn't mean the women describe and kind of not sending thirty six years ... years ago and song corroborated\nThis was a a moment yesterday on MSNBC a network that I literally don't even watch it anymore because it's so it's not even interesting so predictable\nBut this was Mika Brzezinski are reacting to ah your comment that Dr Ford look she was not treated badly she was treated like a ... or ...\nWhy can't you be the egg\nTail in the fabric egg and tell your story because he say women should be heard you talk to both sides of your mouth you say that women should be heard their stories are believable are credible and understanding a compelling well let's hear yours\nThat's very convenient to drop that but I Want to know your story I Want to know what happened you should have justice Rome shouldn't hold on I'm not done all I Know you're ... you know okay you can't just throw that out as a political dagger to protect this reprehensible predator of a president\nYour reaction to the\nWho I have the reaction to that ... I think that many people generally has made my point for me that people are judged women are judged by of what their grief or their harm or their recourse\nOr their quote victimhood based on their politics and I think many people are making the point for me but I don't dignify many things out there\nAre because they're they're wholly irrelevant and I will tell you a lot of blowback yesterday a lot of pushback and a lot of low back\nOn and I'll I'll have my say about that at some other time but at the moment I think it's completely irrelevant given how how high the stakes are Laura or to get justice Kavanaugh confirmed in as an associate justice United States Supreme Court but it won't be bullied and won't be bullied either\nAnd I I won't be believed 'em and I I'll have my say I'm not going to say much else right now that that I find it to be on basically are relevant and when I talked about the fabric drag which by the way is trending on social media I Love I Love informing generations that\nOf a new term that may not know it uh but when I was talking about that I was talking about the process\nIf you look at the entire cut that's me talking about how\nRight well I'm All right where it was a comedy I write of course I Am she was\nTalking to I was talking to NBC reporters two of them are shouting at me and I looked at the one the male reporter\nUh Pete Alexander and I said do you have ... do you know where she you know how she got there and you know she got home do you have you found anybody and he's you know swallowing hard and then asking similar question and Christian Walker was shouting questions and I said she's been treated like a average egg meaning the process\nShe you you could do it privately in California it's her attorneys who didn't allow her that courtesy and the decency you can do it I'm not on camera you can do it\nSuffer concussion each year that includes boys and girls every age\nEvery type and level of sport\nIsn't always clear that have players had a concussion so parents athletes and coaches need to learn about concussion signs and symptoms the American Academy of neurology recommends athletes thought to have a concussion be immediately removed from place\nAnd not returning to assess buy health care professional trained in concussion this isn't just about sports [noise] it's about your brain when in doubt sit it out [noise] learn more at A.

doesn't\nI'm told a line of the new empowered progressive Democrats basically they are telling you that if you try to crash your party this is the kind of thing we're going to do\nThe new empowered progressive Democrats basically they are telling you that if you try to crash or party this is the kind of thing we're going to do to you and I think the only way to combat that is to fight it

people will want to get into politics\nAnd I I really mean this is not just someone from coming from someone who supported the president and the campaign but coming from a a lawyer and a longtime conservative like myself\nI really believe Trump is not the Republicans how to fight I mean it's not going to simple formulation but\nFor a long time Republicans were just taking it and they were afraid they were all just like they were also like in an elevator\nOn any longer I've never seen Mitch McConnell fight harder than he fought for this nomination\nThere well I think he's showing Trump is showing that this is what people have one at all along and look at this sometimes the ... the president I think goes way overboard and makes me cringe but if I got into my head if I have to pick\nI Want somebody who's going to fight than somebody who's not and if that means there's going to be access from time to time then you know then there's going to be accessed from time to time\nBut I think he's showing that there's a hunger on our side to not just stand in a defensive crouch and keep taking this stuff with which we've been doing for years\nWell I think it's important that we have McConnell out their Lindsey Graham John Cornyn\nOr even been fast talking about the mob mentality that we can't become a ... a country by mob rule where people are afraid to go to restaurants\nYep [noise] yeah and I and I think Laura that if you don't raise the stuff\nAnd turn it into an issue particularly when we're on the cusp of an election you don't have a compelling way after the election to say that you know this was on the table for people to consider and you have a mandate now to stop it because people voted against it\nSo I think this not only has to be fought but it has to be ... up\nA as an election issue and frankly it helps the Republicans the tea it up because\nI I've seen you say this what are you know on television and heard you on the radio said a million times\nOrdinary people commonsense people do not like the stuff I mean they see these these uh Lenski I direct action tactics and they say you know there are some parts of this\nAgenda that I may
