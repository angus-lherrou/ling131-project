Andre as high sitting in for for brown as we head and\n[noise] well well well welcome into the board faction Andre as high fit in for\nFord brown as we head into a weekend this Friday and as\nI um [noise] take over for the next two hours recipe head to head out and do his job on the other end of this building with W DJ see\n'em so as we head into the next two hours just you and me uh I'm looking up at Fox News and I I Can't believe what I'm seeing a this mass as you know there's a migrant there is a group of migrant\nWatermelon and Hondurans in El Salvador ends and all of that\nWho has all grouped together in in Central America and are heading towards the Mexico border at the bottom of Mexico wow that is crazy it is um there there are thousands were watching them they're in it looks like some sort of\nRoadway but they've put up temporary metal\nFences um bread and there did you see they were calling at them shaking them bending them climbing up them yes uh easily could have turned them down if everybody went after it there's no doubt about it I don't know how\nAre the authorities are going to stop this if these people get violent and it's it's it's actually pretty scary right now the this caravan of\nCentral Americans has reached the Mexico Guatemala border now at the bottom of Central America at the bottom of Mexico the whole Mexican border\nA doubt it goes kind of narrows down at the bottom\nAnd along that those that southern most border or it shares a border with Guatemala and I believe they'll Salvador I don't have a map in front of me but uh several Central American\nCountries they've chosen to go through Guatemala at the checkpoints there and it is chaos and I see them now moving it looks like I see the word image ... and Spanish which means immigration it looks like a little um\nCheckpoint little a kiosk and they're all marching around it so apparently they are moving into Mexico as we speak I don't know what's gonna happen here because as you know President Trump has called on the Mexican president\nTo put a stop to them even entering Mexico\nSo that they don't get anywhere near the U.S border and the reason why is because Trump knows that if they make it on to us land according to our own\nRidiculous immigration laws they can't be turned away and they'll claim asylum and then they get a\nThey get a slap on the wrist or they get a court date and they're told to come back to that court date in the meantime they're letting loose into the United states where they begin to filter through\nTo all the points where they know they can um access whatever they need to survive be it fake IDs be it welfare checks be at jobs on on on the black market because they're not legal\nWhatever it is that they do when they get in here in the United states so it's actually a very scary thing is what we're watching right now or is about four thousand people trying to stage an invasion\nAnd it's an invasion that appears\nHarmless in a sense in that they don't have weapons they're carrying bags and even some of them have on a bunch of red hats and I don't know that they're ... but there it's very American looking um they have on backpacks\nEggs and even some of them have on a bunch of red hats and I don't know that they're ... but there it's very American looking um they have on backpacks there's kids mostly men though I noticed there are some women and children as I watch this and it and they're just walking slowly so you know ...\nWhat are you going to do you can't mow them over\nBut at the same time they're not turning around and going back to Guatemala so this is going to be an interesting show down to say the least uh how you turned back a wave of four thousand people on a road without getting forceful\nAnd run the risk of appearing\nHarsh and violent I don't know it's a good thing it's up to Mexico right now\nA Trump has said that he will send\nThe military to the Texas Mexico U.S Mexico border if need be\nOr have Joe on the line we've been talking about does these caravans in Central America that have reached the Guatemala and Mexico border and our it appears to be pushing their way through slowly but surely just because there are four thousand of them and there's only so many\nOfficers there and unless they're willing to bring in tanks and brigades and blocks that you know trucks to block it and everything I'm\nIt looks like they're making it through so which means they're going to go through Mexico I don't know what's the how this is going to play out this is going to be interesting and we also talked about the fact that even Trump alluded to what caused this whole thing to ramp up\nAt this point in time and he suggested that there's other elements at work behind\nThe scenes [noise] George Soros um other people working to organize this get to people in a large enough mob that it's very hard to disrupt\nAnd this is clearly nothing but\nA tactic along the lines of what liberal to a I have yet to see Republican I'm I'm not saying Republicans are as pure the wind driven snow in angels with halo but you don't see Republicans out there organizing mobs\nAnd causing this but you do we know for a fact\nThat there are elements out their George Soros even Morocco Obama behind the scenes with his community organizing group I don't know the name of it but they they organized people at the least to cause these protests in Washington and abroad um\nAnd at at worst they pay him we know Soros is paying and let's see what Joe as to say about this whole thing Joe are you there\n[noise] hey glad to have you on a\nPer shut your show always appreciate your your views and stuff all that so like listen to the um [noise] yeah that no is it I've got to say exactly what you said I mean this obviously started with during the Obama administration and when George Soros was involved in that [noise]\nUm and I think it's no different I personally think\nThey're the reason you made the comment that it seems to be the majority of men and and that doesn't surprise me I think they're going to push this thing\nBy force um that's my opinion it seems to indicate that that's starting to happen anyway the fact that they're getting through our at least some of them are my guess is probably going to buy up some of the\nPeople that are quote unquote a while for the ride a but\nUh you know there there's ... I really can't see this thing going ah being stopped without force\nYeah you know Joe as you're talking to me this whole thing is kind of crystallizing in my mind that this is two weeks out from the mid term elections this is all\nPlanned by the time they get through Mexico because they're on\nFoot they're walking it takes time by the time they get from the southern border of Mexico to the U.S Mexico border it is right around the time that people are voting and what they're looking for I have no doubt in my mind is they want they want violent conflict on the media on the news\nEvery night leading up to the time that people vote and they want to make it look like the military is out to destroy men and women\nMedia on the news every night leading up to the time that people vote and they want to make it look like the military is out to destroy men and women who are seeking shelter from violence in poverty and it it just coming before me as I can hear\nYeah no absolutely not only that\nHow many what percentage based on the figures you gave us earlier are ISIS who are definitely going to be forceful ah you know because they have the cover of\nA innocent a non I'm Carrying non weapon carrying a people right uh so uh yeah they're going to be they're going to be the\nPeople back during the election sue war of the black mask ah although there won't be wearing a black mask and were you know\n... you know do things beating people up shooting a young girl I remember with a tear gas yeah and shot a guy a so so that that's my opinion what's what what they're going for a and it just\nI I mean I it's sick and to me\nIt I I'm angry really sick and you know because it's not something that I can individually do something about and\nAnd and you've got to be diplomatic about the way you do it but the way the Democrats\nAre tri ... I've always felt they were a lot she still and even in some cases kill right to get there like a bunch of widen babies who are so we're losers I mean look look it from the Trump or in in the in the beginning when the\nUh rallies were going on they were they're starting fights that I just spoke of\nAnd and it goes on and on with Kavanaugh from there to have it all it all points in between of their uh antenna for and a black lives matter all those things are pushing violence\nThere pushing 'em ... real rebellion and and even revolution in the wrong censor the word right a upon upon our society and our free nation than just a just angers me to know yeah\nIt absolutely is a very frustrating to watch Joe because you're right they act as\nLike the they had the same level of outrage and I'm a retaliatory rage that a pimple or a drug dealer get when you when you impose on their turf I mean there's no did that and so there's like how dare you\nDiscuss in twenty sixteen we're not going away quietly and we're going to cause a ... a everyday leading up to this election um it you're right it is it has come down to mobs versus job it is that the most truest slogan\nOut there for this upcoming midterm elections that could ever possibly put out their back in twenty sixteen it was\nDrain the swamp it that kind of emerged organically through Trump and all of his rallies and it was it was a rallying cry I think for Republicans and independents and now it's mobs versus jobs we're seeing it there is a mob in Mexico\nAnd they're headed our way thanks for the call Joe I appreciate it let's go to Dorothy Hi Dorothy welcome to the Ford faction\nYeah this is so you know where it sport uh I mean I hear it keeps growing like you know people are just living in an adding themselves I constantly ISIS people like you brought up you know about I Know what that's going to talk about a lot [noise]\nIt's growing like you know people are just really in an adding themselves I possibly ISIS people like you brought up you know that right oh well that's not going to tell us about a lot you know you hear about it our sons and uh you know a quiet little station somewhere you\nInto a lecture or what you are doing or a ... it's\nI I don't know I hear that's going to get military down there\nOr you know we we can do what we have to do to keep people out we should be able to use all means possible I don't care chair gas ... Robert all it's a little out of step foot over here if people are making us sectors are strange ... an ounce bottles that disease\nRight that we all ... yeah yeah polio virus killing ... yeah that's\nYou know when when we have to go to our travel we have to get shot you know like a you got some you know island country ah overseas uh Europe\nDon't you have to have jobs to keep yourself well from whatever their diseases or they don't want to get your you have to make sure he has their shots right but it will all we're you know it just yeah come on you know and like I say\nYou know they're they're they're just said whoa whoa there's everybody wants to come here\nThere's a lot of factors on I'm dangerous factors involved in this whole mob scene it's moving towards our border you you brought up the health issue yes there's a lot of things going on that have been reintroduced into the United states we we don't hear a whole lot about from the CDC other than um you know that story you mentioned about the polio like\nA virus or illness or the CDC said it's affecting a hundreds of kids in twenty two seats but they would not release the names of the state\nAnd I find that interesting why is that why normally you release the names of the state so people can be warned it I could put it in the news cast it in if something's\nHappening in Alabama like Sam ... or whatever else on the scale of foreign you know it's probably California for short and all these other border states and its you know ones that have have welcomed\nUm illegal immigrants it would be interesting to find that connection if we ever got to listen to the states thanks for the cold or the appreciate it but um\nYeah we're about to head to the bottom of the hour so in the meantime yeah we've got this mob moving its way through Mexico they seem to be a good gaining ground or at least making it through the checkpoints\nAs Dorothy and the caller before I think Joe said ISIS can easily infiltrate in fact they don't even have to join the crowd they don't even have to be part of the moving mob\nThey'd just as long as they wait until the mob gets to the border of the U.S and the ... in Mexico\nOr whatever happens there is not going to be pretty\nWhen the military has to push them back it's not going to be pretty and as with any criminal you always use a distraction to your benefit so well whatever's happening at and the cow in Texas is going on at the checkpoint there that I can bet you they're going to be you know fifty miles away and another border crossing\n... we know that the press is more than willing to try and craft the image try to craft that weaponized headline that we know they're really good at\nThey love to weaponize a headline and make it look like horrible things are happening in Trump's behind it all and it's nothing makes them happier than to try and do this\nDays and weeks ahead of the November election so I guess for the next couple of hours that I Am here we're going to talk about different stories but the the bottom line is going to come to the same message at the bottom line is don't fall for it you're being played and make sure you go and vote\nAnd get your friends and your family than everybody else who's\nAware of the facts and willing to act on them to go vote as well but do not fall for this phony emotional propaganda that is being pushed out there it is nothing\nLess than what happened in Alabama when we were we had the ruined more special election and outside forces came in and and tried to disrupt it there and cause all sorts of grief and we now have Doug Jones in the Senate who by the way didn't vote for Kavanaugh and regardless of the facts or\nActually wouldn't even know meet with Kevin all so easy to just\nWasn't even going to consider it\nWe we have a guy now representing Alabama who won't even give consideration to what the president is proposing even though Alabama voted President Trump into the White House so I Would think as a representative that's the least\nThat you can do and still be\nEven though Alabama voted President Trump into the White House so I Would think as a representative that's the least that you can do and still be able to say you're doing your job\nAnd if you can't do that then you're not doing your job and the countdown continues on that old story\nIf you want to be part of the ... the show than um feel free to call in nine four one one zero one one\nEight six six five five one nine nine three three is the toll free number and you can share your thoughts on all of this um by the way the whole cabinet I one of the things that was very clear about the whole cabinet situation was that they were hoping hoping it was a it was a Hail Mary I Know\nBut they were hoping the Democrats in the Senate\nDianne Feinstein and all the other people that were playing into that Chuck Schumer for sure we're all hoping that this Kevin uh issue would be delayed more into the upcoming elections and if they could play it um they would and if they could stretch it out they would\nIf they could actually derail it that was the ultimate goal believe me they wanted that to be derailed because they knew it would have a huge huge morale affect on Republicans if Trump\nCouldn't get his Supreme Court nominee through so this you know that\nThey that was the whole kitten caboodle that they wanted that would that would have been the the ultimate dream and they know you know if they failed but hey they'll take whatever scraps they can so if they can at least scratch out a delay and make cabin all look\nTaint him teaches image taint the appearance taint taint his record then they'll do that\nAnd if they can't uh derail him and cause him to withdraw because of the vicious attacks they've made on him his his wife has children and all the people associated with them\nThen they'll just settle for a putting it out there that he's a rapist or at least implying and putting it out there that the me too movement has just been set back\nYou know in a women now have have had the delta blow it'll settle for anything they can\nFor them to be in control and and help you help being the the questionable word help you interpret it the correct way the way they want you to see it\nAnd I'm\nThat didn't work and I believe that what's happening now I'm Down in Guatemala and Mexico is another round of that exact same things slightly different form you know same song different verse let's cause chaos\nLet's see if we can get this to tide out just before people are going to vote let's see if we can get a big enough mob that a a riot ensues at the U.S Mexico border\nOh wouldn't we even love it if the U.S border patrol uses tear gas or water cannons cars will will be there with our cameras to make sure that we catch a little two year old getting blasted with water even if we have to do the blessing ourselves hey well whatever it takes\nWe're going to make sure we've got that that photo op to make everybody mad and to make everybody convinced that ... this is the true colors of Trump are coming out now he's out for the kids\nHe's out for war he's out for violence never mind don't ever fall for this never mind what has taken place in the weeks leading up to this election okay I'm just here to remind you this is my service to you for the next few ... a little while\nAnd this is my service you I'm just going to remind you that um several\nService to you for the next few ... a little while and this is my service to you I'm just going to remind you that um several ... congressional\nSenators congressmen and candidates had been threatened some of these and then attacked I think it was in North Dakota I don't have that story in front of me or I Do know that as of today in New York they've arrested a man who threatened to assault and killed\nTwo senators they would not released the names of those senators I'm Glad that's fine they don't have to do that\nI be interesting to find out the name of the guy\nAnd where what his story is and where he's been for the past couple of months at have you been in Washington DC clawing up the doors of the Supreme Court I wouldn't surprise me if that's the case\nSo we there's been a of a lot of violence we've got moms in DC clawing at the Supreme Court doors we've got in ... in Portland, Oregon causing all sorts of\nHaving their most recently we've got threats we've got a congressional members Maxine Waters are pushing for this idea that you got to not let them eat in peace we've got people getting disrupted during their dining experience\nUh that's the that's the minimum\nAnd and now you know we've we have a you know Rand Paul's wife sleeping with a a gun by your bed because of all the stuff that's happened to her husband now remember Rand Paul had his ribs broken by neighbor but he was also shot at on a baseball field and and don't let me\nLet you forget this that just didn't that happen just a little while ago Steve ... was almost killed and two of Alabama's ... congressional members mo Brooks and Gary Palmer were on that field as well\nSo again I'm coming back to the slogan\nUm that we're going to be chanting all the way to the polls it's mobs versus jobs and there's a vast vast difference we're going to take a break love for you to join the show\nOr you can call and be a part of it

here in the seat again on Monday and then for it will take over\nSo we've been talking about the\nDifferent breaking stories coming into the mob down at the Mexico Guatemala border and I just looking at Fox News again and they're talking about indictments against the Russian national who's charged with interfering in upcoming\nMidterm elections Catherine heritage was on talking about it she mentioned that this person that she didn't she mentioned the firm called Concord had a budget of forty five million\nI'm I I'm not I have not read the article I'm just reading the\nWhat do you call that when they put the words up the Sisi the closed captioning I'm I was just reading that to to catch up on it here's the thing I I'm a ... it's great that they caught these Russians it really is but the key thing that Katherine Harris was sharing that is that they were tasked with causing division\nAnd basically sowing discord and\nSo why is it Russia is going to be targeted but George Soros isn't that the I don't get that I'm Glad they're going after the Russian but George Soros should be following on his coat tails and did you know the guy goes around and says discord he's organizations all the time\nTo tell me how we're focusing on a Russian national\nAnd not others not to mention this which is worse putting setting up a server and the U.S in a sowing discord on social media are causing people to not like each other causes\nUs and ... are sowing discord on social media are causing people to not like each other\nCausing division among how we see other people okay I understand that's bad but which is worse sewing that kind of discord or actually engaging in voter fraud work people we legitimize mentally walk into a poll with a driver's license even that is not\nIndicative of their actual citizenship\nThey walk in with ID and they cast a ballot and they take the ballot and they put their vote in and they put it in and it gets counted tell me which is worse\nI'll take the discord I mean I\nI don't want my vote stolen\nNow I understand that this court is detrimental and it needs to be fought as well\nBut I Do not want my vote stolen\nAnd that's what's happening we've got four thousand people down at the bottom of a Mexico southern border that are headed towards the ... the U.S border we already know this has been done untold times it's just this time it's getting coverage by the media but we don't know how many millions of already cross the border has filtered into central sanctuary cities\nAnd have gained\nSome type of ID or access at minimum to to voter due to the polls and are able to continue the invasion by basically negating and canceling out my vote here in Alabama as a U.S citizen\nSo this whole situation that mo Brooks is brought up and the attorney general Steve Marshall has brought up by launching a lawsuit for the Census Bureau that's ... that's the first at minimum the first start and challenging this so I'm\nYou know we can you got to redistribute the\nCongressional districts according to who are us citizens and you got to be able to ask that you've got to be able to weed out those that aren't I'm Sorry it sounds harsh but these people can't have a say in our government in our governance when they are legally here\nAnd they don't understand it they're here to to to work off the system and gained the goods but do they

system that needs to be evaluated and corrected in all of that\nThat is a long term goal\nIt here's the thing I guess I Want to point out from that totally by the way I'm Glad you called [noise] um\nI understand that that is the long term goal that doesn't move quickly you can't have it on that quickly it's just not the way it is anything with a involving the system takes time it takes leadership that takes selecting the right people through the system\nDoes it in a case of a a mob running down to Montgomery and\nStorming the authors of the a commissioner of prisons and ... yanking him from his desk and replacing him that we do not live in that kind of a country we live in a country where the system is built\nTo replace bad leaders\nLiz in that kind of a country we live in a country where the system is built to replace bad leaders and we have to go through the system otherwise we we just\nDenigrate ourselves into a mob rule into a government of chaos into a tyranny into\nA non democratic government where the people don't fix it from the bottom up and so that's\nYou know I I understand you get ... again I felt like tell tall he was pulling an emotional car there this is happening these are people that are on the take their ... their got their quotas and they're throwing people in jail that don't deserve I understand that I Do it's okay I don't like it\nBut again it it seems to be an emotional pleas for something to be done okay but you got to go through the system look if I if someone comes to me in lists all the things that are wrong with my body you know\nYou got high blood pressure you got diabetes a unique is out of whack I got a choice I can let it go I can go find the best doctor to address those issues or a specialist or\nI can go down you know I can go get in a panic and go down to you know the local ah which docked there hippie you know organic\nWhat do you call those people [laughter] that that has crystals and all sorts of and you know herbs in their house and see if they can help me\nUm I I don't recommend that but if if I get all emotional that has to be dealt with right away I might be more likely to go that route\nAnd it would be a shame because it wouldn't take care of things ... you know I'm not talking all holistic medicine is wrong but I'm just saying um you get you got to pick your the right vehicle to accomplish their goals and you can't throw everything out 'cause then we just have chaos Roger\nCan you you want to weigh in on this whole thing\nThat I have a couple or ... or you mentioned emigration and you also mentioned the ... ... ... ... low spiritually or LA or your ...\nThat's right and also it's like a ... I think there's a lot of oh\nI Know California California is becoming the entry point for this invasion simply by way of being able to vote in the system\nIllegitimate ... they're not legitimate citizens but they're able to hijack the system and vote this is very concerning to me it really is voter fraud like I said before I'm more concerned about voter fraud being I'm becoming pervasive in the state of California\nAnd overwhelming the system just by the fact that they pull all of our congressional representation by number by their population not by legitimate citizens it's it is that it's very upsetting\nAll this focus on one side of this a lot of ... ... or or felt close to it for good\nHi I'm a I'm a I'm a big money but the lady that uh it was like up in the Senate yeah like a hundred and\nFifty thousand dollar air strikes on\nThe lady that it was like up in the Senate yeah like a hundred and fifty thousand dollar strikes on your shoulders but yeah\nI yes I did see that things Roger\nBrokers to get fired for Fifteen dollars\nYeah I Know well the reason being Roger it's really simple look ah we as humans we we can only\nMuster up fake emotions for so long right\nUm other incentives have to be brought in so they want these protesters they want them to stick with it they want him to claw at the Supreme Court doors on the data Kavanaugh's there they they wanted to stay in DC for weeks on end and cause commotion you got to pay him you got to pay him to eat you got to pay him to sleep\nAnd then you've got to pay them give them an incentive for for hanging on that long because clearly they don't have jobs they got to get back to\nUm so you had other incentives for being there and\nI think these people are are so self interested themselves that they wouldn't last long if it weren't for that fact you know I think they get bored and and then the get distracted find a squirrel and I walk off um\nI'll ask you one question before you go yeah for a couple of votes or of a show trial if I'm a crush of it or if I stood up for the ... or ...\nI think it would be great I think it would be refreshing I think Washington DC is overdue for an actual grass roots protest and I think it would be fantastic if Alabama and all the other Americans out there in other states took part in it what\nIs it about getting a facial shoulders\nA there'd be too many of us and they probably would have an idea we'd all be packing so that might slow them down thanks Roger [laughter] they for the call I appreciate it yeah I think Washington DC needs I think if an actual true blue grass roots effort happen without any payment between George Soros and his\nOrganizations that actually happened I think the media would be overwhelmed with the amount and the and the conduct it would be vastly different than what's happening\nWhat has happened in Washington DC and what's happening down at the Mexico Guatemala border [noise]\nUm and all around you know other places where this is happening Roger mentioned again that California\nAllows driver's license for non citizens and then by virtue of having a driver's license you can go to a polling place and vote and then if you have someone within the precincts and you know governed by the um\n[noise] uh the secretary state who runs the election that they're not requiring a strict adherence to verification and um ID and and ah who gets absentee ballots and all of that\nOr if they're not even committed to purging the rules to eliminate dead voters and people that have moved away and I'm ... and you know all of that than the ... that said is ripe\nFor an invasion of by way of voter fraud immigrants illegal immigrants I should say as\nGetting getting their license at a sanctuary city and and and basically stealing our vote I Know that we tend to think oh that's California there are all nuts over there and they're you know hundreds of miles away\nIt's a shame I Wish that state would fall off the face you know that big earthquake dropped into the hours that we ... wouldn't miss him let them see I I understand\nThat state would fall off the face you know a lot that big earthquake dropped into the hours that we ... wouldn't miss them\nLet them see I I understand that it's in some ways it um\nIt seems far away and so it's it's a little mental but what are you going to do but ... California\nAs we speak it the more people they let in illegally means they're stealing our vote over here in Alabama those of us who have legally registered we are citizens we've got the id we go out to vote they've basically from a distance stolen ...\nAnd that's why no Brooks and uh the marshals launched this lawsuit I Hope that it gets through in enough time to do some some real I'm\nHaving an effect on the twenty twenty but it's going to be interesting to see what happens here November what has happened in the in the past two years\nThat could possibly um steal the election just through voter fraud in in California law I don't know it's it's very disconcerting 'cause there's already stories coming in a like Roger mentioned about the idea being issued to to non citizens\nUm there was one I just saw this morning I don't know that I have to find talking about ah someone ah admitting to voter fraud I Believe it was in California I have to look at it\nAnd they're very much activating people to cause now they may not be doing as much of the violence that George Soros is encouraging\nI don't know we'll see\nWe'll see what what are you know comes to the surface overtime with people digging around and investigating 'cause this is going to be one of the first ... elections word Brock Obama having been gone for two years from the office would have gained any type of influence our power within his organization to\nYou know to make a change in the terms we know he wants to for sure so I mentioned Brock Obama George Soros\nGeorge Soros is weighing in on the Alabama it's on yellow hammer news dot com\nHe's put two hundred thousand dollars into the state he did it by way of Tuscaloosa political action committee\n[noise] um they have various names it's kind of a group of packs a they're called cash axiom gee packed to eat the pack leadership pack pride packed to tea town packed too and there's probably more\nThese groups have already contributed thirty percent to ... his campaign for governor\nSo these packs are very much Democrat leaning and now we know that George Soros finds a kindred spirit in these packs otherwise why would he put his money there\nHe feels they're going to do exactly what he would like them to do in this campaign and he has thrown in two hundred thousand dollars\nA certainly nothing to sneeze at it's probably not as big as contribution but we also don't know how many contributions he's already given to the state these packs because it's only flag because of its amount if he sends a thousand dollars here and there over the course of the last six months that is not going to\nBe as noticeable this was brought to our attention because of the amount\nAnd then it's required by law for him for it to be disclosed the source and everything\nSo we've already got George Soros weighing into Alabama my gosh this guy is like a spider\nHis fingers reach everywhere he sees any type of weakness he sniffs out like a shark blood in the water and then they try to go in there now I think he's wasting the money because I don't think that it's going to win\nBut nevertheless ... Alabama's gotten on the radar of George Soros and I'm\nPretty positive he probably was involved in the whole Roy Moore thing as well or at least egging it along\nUm so just be aware of that again here we come November ... um midterms\nAre don't be duped into thinking that all is as it seems on the surface there are people behind the scenes working for a different outcome than what's best for America let's go to Kim see what she has to say\nEither [noise] [noise] hey how are you doing today doing great I have a couple of questions for you\nWhat's best for America let's go to Kim see what she has to say\nEither [noise] hey how are you doing today doing great\nOh I have a couple of questions for you well ... I have a statement for you um [noise] I understand you're famous for George SARS I totally get that but he's actually not doing anything any different\nThan what the Koch brothers do for the right\nSo I think it's disingenuous to just completely go after George tours for everything when the Koch brothers are doing the exact same thing on the right and then the question that I have for you is this caravan of\nPeople who are seeking asylum from Honduras Guatemala because they they are so gang infested countries these people running for their lives the way they want a better life for themselves that's while they're trying to come to America do you have any proof that George Soros and the left or behind this ... this caravan coming\nA no no proof at this point uh Trump's referred to it at the rally in Montana that it it looks like there's there's some shady business like how did this all come together here's the thing\nWhen do four thousand people all just randomly from from all over the country just just suddenly congregate together and say hey let's make a run for the U.S Mexico border\nNo it doesn't happen if people are seeking a better life and they do it individually because they stand a better chance of first of all getting across the border\nBy themselves if they're really going to do it that way I don't recommend it but if you if you've come to the point where you've got to get out of the country and you've got to get to the U.S\nAnd seek asylum I I don't buy that argument to begin with but if you're going to do it you got to do your best chances of doing it is all alone without causing I'm getting eyes on your endeavor now why they don't seek asylum in Mexico that brings up a whole nother issue why did they go to the U.S and not Mexico\nMexico will be a whole lot easier there it's right there [noise] um so you know there's no proof\nRight now but it's very very suspect it follows the main line of all these protesters in Washington DC that came together and we know for a fact that they're getting paid it's been traced so it's just odd we don't have the means to know exactly what happened\nDown in Guatemala when it first emerged we're just seeing the the the actual symptoms\nIn full display but we don't know what the sources\nAre all came to the to be and to your point before that when you were talking about the Koch brothers yes they're contributing legally\nWithin the law and George Soros I is free to do that as well but George Soros has a tactic that I don't see in the Koch brothers and that is to go hand in hand\nWith the baser elements the antifa the protesters those who are willing to be violent those who are willing to be paid to\nCause problems in and burn things and break things and\nI'm obstruct people in the hallways and ... you know corner them in elevators\nKoch brothers are sending money to other um groups but that's not the outcome was coming out of that is political action non violent that's the difference I Would point out with the George Soros Kim thanks for the call appreciate it let's go to David are you there David\nWhat's going on on\nMay well come to the Ford faction\n\nThat last caller talking about and all those martyr here and people trying to come over here better laws but why should we\nWork with all the problems I mean they're fleeing Guatemala and they're coming up here and I mean Donald Trump\nProblems I mean they're fleeing Guatemala and they're coming up here and I mean do troubles right you just said at the wrong way when he started at night yeah some of them are real people suffer right above my burgers you know there was a kid in San Antonio that\nWas supposed to be deported why murder and still Eighteen year old kid in ... and that's the kind of stuff that we're getting on the other countries\nThat don't care about our way of life and it felt some that are minutemen go down there with their yards a bullet it stop these folks from coming in our country without our government's not going to do it right\nThe whole of just you know look at each other on the news for Americans just stand up and do what they need to do to stop this\nThey have it for the call I appreciate it I Do I hear I hear your frustration and I'm hopefully Trump has seen the tactic play out already and how they use it and how they um play the crowds in and play the press will actually the press is more than willing to be played\n'em and hopefully he's seen is already in the head of it and that's why he's calling on Mexico to step in before any violence ever erupt and before we had come down to\nThe U.S border patrol in the military having to take action in a way that will be very unseemly on camera I can assure you I'm In I don't think it'll get to the point of bullets\nBut um it it certainly hope not um but ah hopefully Trump sees where this is going and headed off the path we got to take a break we only had two more minutes after that three hours just flew by I'm Andrea

by working hard and hoping that\nYour own leaders leave you alone\nBut create an environment that allows people to prosper op talked about mini mini jobs even back when I was in office that the job of the government is to create a good solid greenhouse or a good solid garden spot\nWe're not the government's not supposed to go out there and play with the food for you governor is not supposed to go out there and decide that you know this person the or the cabbage industry grows and the and the corn 'cause I'm not a big huge corn person and the corn industry is not their job just go out\nAnd make sure that the past and the beast or kept out\nAnd then let the people do their thing\nThat's the job for the most part with that said the president is ... let me just tell you how aggravated I Am over two new stores [noise] more than he is the caravan of people fleeing\nYou know aggravated I Am over two new stories\nOne is the caravan of people fleeing poverty and violence from Honduras supposedly the numbers are up to four thousand people\nWe spoke about it yesterday I just watched the clips on the cable news networks I'm telling you pay attention\nBecause when they show the mass\nThe crowd in mass the caravan in math and I got big Dave to verify for me who was making sure that we keep it in the ditches as usual\n\nOr they're not many many more men young men in the crowd\nThan women and children I did not see no one woman\nAnd been pictures if they were so much to do with just a minute ago and they're showing who's a bunch of Hillary exit fee for young guys military I got fighting age gap that's what we said when they were refugees in Europe right right because there was no women coming with him and\nAnd there are some there are some women and children and I'm just going ahead and telling you warning you ahead of time as they get closer to the U.S border\nMexico was apparently saying they're going to turn them all around and send them back home we'll see if that happens\n\nBut as they get closer to the border it will be picture\nAfter photo after photo of moms\nOr females I don't know if it's the mom or not and like I said yesterday in the day before the cutest little kids you have ever seen\nJust go ahead and prepare yourself but the fact that this caravan is moving towards the United states and that I have to hear pundits on TV say was not like it's a big deal\nThere is a new report out and I asked this question for years when we dealt with the legal immigration how could the illegal immigration numbers stay at about\nTen to eleven million people how could that number remain the same\nYear after year after year after year after year and I\nAnd I said at the time that we dealt with it that that number was probably low there's a new estimate out I Can't remember I think it is a Harvard maybe a Harvard study so you might you know the number may be low\nThey're saying now that we possibly have twenty million illegal aliens in the country big dive twenty million so\nI was right about the fact that they've been holding the numbers down and and I know it's just journalist I don't know they go in whatever the pure Pew Research center says it just stays it's just the static number it was ten million last year so it was ten million this year and and they don't want the number to be bigger\nBecause if the numbers bigger people began to get a little bit out of shape so we're a country of what three hundred and fifty million people\nIn twenty million at least already legal aliens\nAnd we talk about how many millions of people can't find good paying jobs and how many millions of people are own government welfare programs twenty million sure I guess in the scheme of\nTwenty million another three or four thousand doesn't seem like a big deal\nI'm twenty million sure I guess in the scheme of twenty million another three or four thousand doesn't seem like a big deal that three or four thousand lands in your town it's a huge deal that three or four thousand lands in New York they might not given up\nBut that three or four thousand lands in I don't think of some towns in smaller towns\n\nThree four thousand lions in on the auto that is a huge deal\nThree or four thousand lands and Fulton Dale Gardendale huge deal heart so anywhere but we're there go spread across the country sure maybe they are maybe they're not well if you spread it doesn't matter ... people still have to pay for this\nIt is being online and rational thought even for a liberal a liberal who believe we should take care of people from cradle to grave\n\nIt cannot be very bright if they want the size of the group that has to be\nTaken care of drew grow larger and larger\n\nWe can't we can't pay for what we supposedly have agreed to pay for now that's why we have huge budget deficits\n[laughter] oh I Need a new wardrobe daddy\n[laughter] yeah that's basically what it boils down to it but because but back to your town your point is one of your senses of what I gather on the road and across the nation now there's a lot of\nLatino or Hispanic drivers out there ... in a lot of these jobs are not for this immigration bill where I understand that\nYou know one of them are like what they're not by people I'm third generation American or I might be the first generation outlet that life behind I came here legally sport came here legally originally get my green card off but I'm here as a citizen now I did what I had to do a you know\nSo they do they see the threat they realize how would you go to help\nYeah let's run from Texas or or ... or all and even those people I think that are here illegally really don't want any more to me and\nBecause it takes away from me that are getting what benefits they get now even though they're illegal right right so this but either way it's not I don't I think I think the news media is just playing to solve that try to get more people answer you know get them on the government to it to\nDraw in more votes than Democratic Party I I Know\nThis I think Trump's doing the right thing by putting the military down there are some part of it which I'm\nA retired but I'm Glad I did but you know I'd be glad to go down their throat or it draw my little government by for active duty paycheck yeah absolutely you know but\nYou know I I I think he's doing the right thing if we can't get the poor bill ... he's the commander in chief west one of the things he's matter to the military\nAnd he was tasked with say he's a doll being out of state stopping invasions\nYes stock in protecting the borders of the United states is correct that point where hey by going today we ... what what we went to ... via down there all what was the name of the general purge was purging\nBlackjack purging when we're going to get on to be yeah\nYeah and you know we invaded Mexico got under a you know go get in a way it is that a first time we we just started a sovereign nations poor to protect girl\nYou got that right you will you be anyone do about that I'm Glad you knew that story William yeah you know are you where you're from Blaine county [laughter] that's what got them from the original [noise] okay that must not most over oh can I William buddy about gas by\nHow many people do Black Jack purging invaded may go with him or a movie and you might be I don't know what movie would that be oh a movie that was a liberal that was that was kept in\nJags oh ...\nOkay okay uh getting my you know when you rely on movies and stuff for your for ah the knowledge yeah\nGetting my you know when you rely on movies and stuff for your for ah the knowledge yes he'll he'll history as hard\nFlak math Brian welcome to the program\nI just got thanks for letting me get on the is absolutely ... what would have to appreciate the fact that sometimes you kinda ring the warning on different items and social exile Yes sir\nWell one of those things and I'm curious about has been telling the people about the uh state wide amendments\nNo we're going to do that next week and no no one's really called and asked there's little there is a little concern on the pro life one which may be number\nTwo I came back could be wrong\nSo there's some confusion on that I Know that Planned Parenthood is sent some money down here to try to defeat that vote but will probably do some of the state wide amendment stuff next week when more people were ... and ... and election\nOkay well I just want to make sure that you're going to cover it because of you know evil ladies in white or apathy\nIt ... no you're right and we have to realize that there are things we can do and we have to be active and we have to be out there making\nOur opinions known or our our goals known\nAnd we're really bad to just thing somebody else who's going to take care of it\nAnd the mob\nThey are active and they are fired up and they seem to understand politics better than we do\nWill you you understand that we're also getting a lot of money and say because of amendment number one also right\nNow which was one one day I'm In God we trust the ten commandments\nOh yeah yeah\nBut I didn't know there was a lot of money being spent opposes added that where's that\nComing just as it is coming in the you know basically on the groups that have been fighting all the uh a freedom from religion and things of that nature Yes sir so you're going to use the thing is you're going to have people that are going to be coming out\nSo we don't need to get changed again I'm so we don't need to have to see on this uh on this election\nYou got it we're going to we're going to get to those ... thank you for reminding me you had a great day now Yes sir thank you thank you for listening\nMosquito robot who is mixed up in order\nThe Mayo lady how are you there did you I'm doing very very well thank you for listening to the program\nI got a little convoluted gash in here just barely out on that OK I'm hearing about all the illegal aliens coming over here and a lot of them being given the right to vote you\nKnow what I mean that does that won't happen for a while but that's what the Democrats were like\nWell here's a solution they keep talking about redoing the voting laws and like you know and\nWe like to have everybody have an id ... I was born here in Alabama I had to wait till I was Eighteen years old to get to that that is correct when they become citizens they should have to wait Eighteen years to become able to that [laughter]\nI kinda liked that strategy\nAnd on top of that they ought to be able to have to wait till they citizen sixteen years to be able to own a car and drive [laughter]\nYou're getting better that's\nWhy I feel bad I mean that they thought they need to be part of this country and be here for over a decade before they become part of it and pay taxes during that time\nWell you know you kind of make this it's a pretty good argument they just have to follow the same path way to voting that you and I did correct that makes perfect sense the problem is\nIt's a pretty good argument they just have to follow the same path way to voting that you and I did\nCorrect that makes perfect sense the problem is if they ever get enough votes in the U.S Senate or the Congress to say that illegal aliens can vote and that's what they mean when they say pathway to citizenship okay ... what they mean when they when they do that\nThey will have so many boats that we won't be able to put any breaks zone it there will necessarily be a waiting period that\nWhy it's so important vote next month\nLet's vote unless stop it from happening I still say twenty million new the new number\nIs low a at a twenty million people\nWill change the future of the country forever and I am not for giving up the Republican I'm not for giving up the republic to socialism back to my wedding\nWhen you to be careful out there first quarterly down today I Would do a better job of keeping up with the corners yesterday I thought it was half time and it was the end of the third call [noise]\nGod you didn't have any good gay right in there I didn't even realize it was that that will be back [noise]\n\nMostly clear skies and cooled over and I lost fifty five during the day on friday a good supply sunshine for a while though some clouds will increase in the afternoon\nThe warmer high Seventy seven mostly potty friday night a chance of showers late at night last sixty one some showers likely on Saturday especially during the morning in mid day the high temperature sixty eight so we'll be quite a bit cooler I'm WB champ Thirteen she made her all just jury Tracey with your forecast on this Crawford Broadcasting station\nThis quarter the Scott based on the show was ... by LA open services everything you need when it comes to HVAC your air conditioner is not working right you're heaters not working right looked him up with a C.

United states I might not ever hear from that woman again\n[laughter] I Know that stuff I don't know all the details I've also been told that some of the things that have made the rounds on the Internet um may not be exactly right but America has one of the most lax immigration policies thanks Bryan appreciate your but yeah the most lax\nImmigration policies in the world and that's just one of those things that Americans don't seem to understand about\nThe world doesn't work the way so many Americans think it works ... people don't just wander into other countries in most places unless you happen to be the United states and frankly\nA European country you don't just wandering\nIn in in demand things in stay in places and work and get taken care of and your children are taken care of

sustain yourself economically\nCannot be destined to be a burden on society you have to have an economic and social benefit to Mexico you got to be a good character and have no criminal record et cetera et cetera et cetera\nThat's why we're not as smart as we think we are Tony welcome to the program [noise]\n\nHey listen to your show today about the illegal immigrants yes I I'm for making our laws is stripped off but we can't just focused on the border as we also got a thing about those that come here legally with a green card or whatever and then\nOnce that is up they just instead of trying to go out for citizens they say\nThey are they overstay their visas yes I I agree\nAnd you know one thing I said was the reason why I'm so against you know so hard on this is you know been in the military I served alongside people from Aaron part of the\nGuy and I talked to a few of them and I asked my legal and they still fight for their citizens ... so we've got people fighting and our military\nTrying to fight for their citizenship at the same time but they said why it's so hard\nIs that all the illegals in this country you know and I think these people are willing to fight in our military they should be in front of the line I mean these people are given up their ally sometimes for a country that they're not even a citizen [noise]\nOh I I'm really you know there are making the laws of the strictest possible making our borders to the north and south it's harder to cross off\nI I'm really you know making the strictest possible making our orders to the north and south it's hard to cross as possible as you know I Know you can relax to know you know I'm an an from Canada you\nKnow you're you're absolutely right and it is easy to forget about the people who overstay their visas and that is a big percentage\nOf the folks who were in the country illegally um and it it does seem like we focus only on the southern border but that is a a big problem as well and and I don't understand why the federal government can't handle both brilliant\nYou know not enough money in it for them not profitable [laughter] ... exactly the buddy you appreciate you\nGo to Jim Jim welcome to the program thank you for listening\nOr do you ask a little while ago why the a so called journalist was so important why what is not a big big deal about cars Yogi ... is a Muslim and he's anti west so anybody who's a Marxist\nOr Muslim is a big deal and promoted by mainstream CNN and black\n... know that that is is you didn't get that from this program did you\n[laughter] know\nWell that that's the point I mean I read an article a couple of days ago talking about cars show ... one of the things cause Yogi was clearly for was the toppling of the Saudi monarchy and replacing it with a much more radical Islamic\nUm leaders leaders\nMet like black took up we're like took over it's similar to what took over in Egypt after a you know so called Arab Spring\nThat's right that's exactly right\nWhat that's what you advocating for and that's why CNN last because you can't find work so if you're a Marxist or you're a Muslim your loved by the left\nThat's right you got it right Jim I'm Glad you called remind us of is absolutely my understanding of the situation is\nAnd and maybe that is one and they and they want to put the president in this box\nIt would not bother me if the president said I go to the guy was trying to overthrow the government and you don't do that in Saudi Arabia reporters asking him what are you considering to be the the what you do to Saudi Arabia we find out that they\nMurdered him\nWhat if they claim hey look we executed a traitor\nYeah yeah earlier you were speaking of the number of illegal\nIn the country now yes there is a new study\nOut now there are worn a hundred and fifty four million and the current great not forty and they\nHave not seen that study um where where's that coming from 'cause the ... the without him referencing is it up to date\nI Believe I Want to say was Harvard I could be missed quoting that saying they are now twenty million illegal aliens in the country because they were still claiming that ten or eleven million which is about a decade old\nRight or I read this it was it was an Internet thing of course\nYes sir but you\nKnow there's got to be more than forty made in the\nWider crossing the border it's an open border anybody there to kind of a like a micro\nWell that's how I got to the the referencing the report because I have said for years that there's got to be more than ten because you can't let hundreds and hundreds of thousands come across the border every year\nStay at ten or eleven million\nI'm looking at an article now where the president is being fact checked a couple of years ago by politifact which I Would not put a tremendous amount of greed and seeing where he was saying I don't think it's eleven million I think it's closer to thirty million and they're saying oh no you're totally roll\nWell he was as close as they were and here they had their referencing Pew like I said they were back on the eleven twelve million range which again is\nAt least eight or nine years old face NO NAME a priest\nA few like I said they were back on the eleven twelve million range which again is at least eight or nine years old face NO NAME I appreciate you but thanks for listening about what\nAre the ... the the numbers are are probably hire\nPresident might be more right than some of the others let's get back to something that's a little bit Alabama oriented this was the article over at PJ Media that I like to touch on every so often\nYou listen to the show for a while or you followed me at all when I was in the state legislature I was one of the few guys\nWho actively opposed Alabama signing onto Common Core standards\nOne of my greatest regrets was leaving the legislature without being able to kill all the common Cold War when I still had a good bit of cloud as soon as I made it public that I Would not be returning that hurt me greatly and that's one of my disappointments\nIs not killing off Common Core\nPersonally I Believe if Alabama had remained with the standards and the way it was doing education at the time when we were\nActually improving education if the rest of the country decided to run their little carts off into the ditch we might actually be ranked one of the highest in education in the country if we had continued owned the path\nWe couldn't do that we had to get on board with everybody else we had to do what the U.S Chamber of commerce said we had to do what the Obama administration said we could not be left out in the cold everybody else was going to do this new in great thing that was not proven anywhere in the world\nHad not been used anywhere in the world was not more rigorous standards was not all the dribble that we were told and people like myself are out there\nAnd most Alabamians agreed with a few of us who were trying to stop this disaster\nThis is an article by Paul a ball yard from two days ago published at PJ Media the creators\nOf the ACT test you know the tests that your kids have to take and it's actually been kind of changed around through the years but it's your college admissions test and some of these things we're supposed to be fixed\nWhere you wouldn't be able to tell how bad the results were they were supposed to all be aligned and hooked up and and some of us said hey wait a minute\nIf you change the the test on the outcomes didn't\nYou're going to kind of say oh there's no problems here that is what that was the concern I still think that occurred\nBut even with that the creators of the ... see the test announced on Wednesday the scores for the class of two thousand Eighteen or the worst reported in decades math\nScores remember my ass remember hey what is Common Core math why why it's my kids using dots and dashes and all this stuff why could not help my kids with math why are we not doing long division what what are we doing as a parent can even help my child remember all that\nScores in fact are in freefall among ACT tested us high school graduates following falling to

I got to give them they want to do my and live my life that's why I say it doesn't matter I don't think I can do is encourage people to go vote and I go vote after that man is what what else\nCan you do and don't be afraid to go to the wrong point and I think a lot of there's a lot of fear that's being stoked out there about going\nAh you know voter purging or that you've moved in to where you may have gone to the previously if you didn't get the card sold and send it back to whoever you're secretary of state is\nThat you can still go to the same polling place and you can get a provisional ballot and you just have to later on prove that that's where you are and your vote will be counted\nLet me ask you there who are who is talking about the young people you know devote my this is where it really is when it comes to these local elections in your professional opinion about what are we doing wrong be\n[noise]\nUm I think that the identity of what a candidate is has changed all use this analogy um\nI fell in love with basketball in Ninety One you know my stepfather from the west side of Chicago and then my Uncle Billy introduced me to back it was a commission of parks in Harlem for years I was when all the NBA players like Katie Anderson's ... anybody that came from New York and uh but here's the point I make\nIn my opinion Michael ...\nThere's like Katie Anderson's ... anybody that came from New York and uh but here's the point I make it in my opinion\nMichael Jordan revolutionize what it meant to be a basketball player he was a rock star um sneaker contract see one multiple championships in my opinion\nUm you talked about the social media aspect with Obama Obama change what it meant to be a candidate ... black white green yellow whatever ... you have to social media you have to drive traffic in that way\nUm when I look at Donald Trump\nHe is a media mogul uh\nThat's a New Yorker light duty that knows how to spin controversy or you know it didn't sell it is it's Diddy P. Diddy a coup buddy love today what is it to me that's the comparison to Trump and just the different things that he has going on and so I Believe that someone like Mitt Romney was ahead of his time\nIn the sense of people were mad about the forty seven percent comment and he was very wrong for what he said he got caught on tape saying it um but\nIt was true yeah how was he wrong for what he said I mean it it's it's accurate and I would say that there's about forty five percent mental the one way forty five percent of the wonderland you're not really by and looked\nAt me and I say that my grandmother taught me that you may be better off than someone you mean that you you may never be you're may be better off to somebody but you're never better than anybody in the comment that he made to some people sounded like he is up here and they're down there there's certain things is kitchen table talk that maybe you shouldn't say\nAnd he got caught on video staying at a at a function\nSo maybe the runaway said he was he was saying he was naming data\nThat maybe that should have been left out of his speech because you never knew who was recording\nRight\nDo you see where I'm coming from a no no I I mean you know I get to be here and I'm I'm I mean I don't\nI have a problem because I saw more statistical what he was saying I didn't see it as you know on better than you and here's forty seven percent of the country that you know doesn't sit in the league has climbed\nDefinitely made you that's what I mean you've already bumped in brown because it's perception right from your perception of what you've experienced and the perception of what I've experienced and so we can get the Sunday to instill a totally different about it\nBut that doesn't make him a bad person either so back his experiences his experience my experience has my experience for me I was one of four black kids graduate from a prep school I went to a prestigious prep school I had to close which every day of my life and so for me\nI've been in different experiences where I've had to adjust to people in and learn different things and see different things and all from my point of view as they had to offer there's for me it was a tone\nYou know if there was a tone that was head but that was my experience based off of what I heard when it was said he didn't see anything wrong with it because he felt that you know Romney was was was offering empirical data and that was it but\nYou know I grew up where you know my father and his ... and my father's family was blue more blue collar my mother and her family was were well to do and white collar and I always had mixed between both worlds and so something my mom is said to my dad my dad my I felt that it was wrong or was that buddy and\nMy father might have said some to my mother and she didn't like it it it's all based off of experience and how you and how you interpret that and so when I heard it around me that\nI did I I I since it was a tone I understood what he said but sometimes you got to self edit yourself 'cause you just don't know how people are going to take what you said if it's a well should they want it to be\nRight but but but the initial question that you asked me was ...\nBut sometimes you got to self edit yourself 'cause you just don't know how people are going to take what you said it fit it so what should they want it to be right but but but the initial question that you asked me was ... I Believe it was about identity\nI think the same way that Obama came across as this rockstar um whether you agree with his policies or not I think that the Republicans are are going to have I think Trump is their best candidate in that aspect [noise] but I still stiff what I said I Believe roundly what's that rock star I just think that he was maybe ahead of time\nIn that instance I think that that forty seven percent comment changed the way certain people view I also think on me being an east coaster and people voting you remember when Romney ran against Obama the north east was hit by treacherous stole\nForm a hurricane that a lot of people weren't voting during the election day\n... and ... that changed some well so the answer your question I think that the the role of the ... of the politician I'm as has has got the chance I I I interviewed people from all walks of life and you know I I often talk to the athletes as much as I talked to politicians as much as I talk to to rappers\nAnd Tom I spoke to a to a to a rapper recently I said you know I'm\nCertain people in the church community have been turned off by the pastor or the person who you know the man and a woman of God and given the word and because of various reasons things have gone on in the church people think that they're not ethical and I said when you look at hip hop\nArtists do you look at them as the modern day preacher and they told me yes because they're speaking they're good news is ... there were there speaking the truth and people want to hear what's real\nI think it and and in in pop culture and even just in politics people are tired of being lied to you know I think that\nThe gentleman who called on the phone um he didn't like Obama policy I respect the fact that he was respectful of President Obama and he said he didn't trash him and I think that um we have to find a way to find the juxtaposition of respected demand whoever the man is an office while also\nThe person who's in office has to tell some troops and has to be ethical and I think that's a hard a\nBar [laughter] man you know you said a mouthful if you've got to me right now got Brennan robbing the one on Scooby in Studio with us and we're discussing politics and you know the good bad and ugly and I think we can all you know um agree on this right here that\nWe all want our country to succeed we all want president Donald Trump to succeed\nI think that I I don't think that's ... I don't think that you can say we all want Donald Trump to succeed because I Do believe that there's a vast majority of people out there\nWho do not want to see him succeed just as there were a vast majority of people out there who did they did not want to see where those six but here's the thing I Would say to those people you idiots okay our agree on\nThat because if you're saying that you don't want the president has exceeded because how he comes across how you two weeks of what he said you're\nBasically saying you want failure for yourself because unless you live\nToo far I think the delivery of what he says and tone on Twitter takes off those people but I think ...\nThat is a huge problem that's what I always try to say you know middle ground about\nThe candidates or the people in office I don't get to how them I don't get too low and then I just call it for what I see I don't look at the party that they belong to if you're in an office and you are doing that job I'm looking at the job that you're doing I may not like the old policy more like a puzzle and look at president Donald Trump\nI have to say when he did the six minute interview I found a new ... found respect for president Donald Trump\nMeaning that the guy's going to say was on his mind he's going to say what he feel and you could see he don't think a lot of things through and a lot of things he said he don't really mean he's just saying them and might get 'em in was new for no\nIs that refreshing to a point to see somebody actually telling his truth is still a tell him what he thinks the right thing should be said is refreshing to a point but ask to be said ...\nYou do have to know what to filter president Donald Trump and this is a great example\nWhen we found that ... she was missing president Donald Trump before you got any facts start talking to the public went out on Twitter strongly and say what that if something has happened to him Saudi Arabia gonna be still films just punch me as I said before he knew anything\nYeah this because all the all the initial against rumors\nThat that particular time were pointing in a direction that the Saudi Government and the Saudi crown prince had something hands on to do with the disappearance at the time but uh\nSo I guess rumors that that particular time were pointing in a direction that the Saudi Government and the Saudi crown prince had something hands on to do with the disappearance at the time but uh and it was speculated that he had been murdered right\nAnd so once he found out and what was going on now you see Donald Trump building don't jump during my conducting Milwaukee he backtracking ... because now he's saying well I understand is that he he tweeted\nJust like you did a alone with or was it under the Russian President of about ... he said well he said he didn't do it well he now he's and he didn't know\nBut it doesn't matter if you knew or not you said if this had happened that we're going to be still filling the ... but then you say but we do have this arms deal so it looks bad and that's the end of the day like I said I said it's on my team was almost eighty on his radio show today\nEvery president has had to backtrack when it comes to Saudi Arabia\n... every president they cannot stand up to Saudi Arabia to a point because why would they have us with our parents around our ankles to a point to ... and so no matter what President Donald Trump say or do they are not going to be able to do what they're saying and I'm not mad at president Donald Trump for that because he cannot do and that's\nProbably what the whole fight\nAnd the west wing that yeah ... a secretary Bolton and I'm\nLike Terry Kelly that you did that the ... that's the ... the reason why we have unfortunately I don't I don't want\nTo be doing business with Saudi Arabia we have no choice and unfortunately in the position that we've been in for the last almost hundred years you know we have no choice at this point in time when president\nDonald Trump tweeted out this statement a few hours later what did the Saudi Arabia's come on and say you want to do to yeah OK they called his bluff nobody want to talk about that but that's the truth\nWill because we're we're engaged using our proxy what that right well that with Russia in ...\nBut that comes from inexperience right and speaking off the cuff and sandwich you feel that you want to go do without knowing the consequences and the ... because it just like the Saudi friends there\nBut it's also something that he campaigned on like he wants to pull us out of the middle east unfortunately we have so few allies in the middle east and you're right you know he he off the cuff you know this is what I promised in the campaign I wanted and still just promise because he wants to do what rock Obama never could do was still in his promises\nAnd he spoke before he had all the\n... and this is what I Am I'm telling people\nPointed out ... when he's right\nPointed out when he's wrong yeah I understand he's not American so I understand that you know we shouldn't do anything but that is not what President Donald Trump's it just like the wall may get Bill but president Donald Trump did not say we was going to build the wall who he said it was going to be a little while to pay for Mexico's can okay but that's not the case now people say oh we just don't get the wall bill\nI get that but let's make she'll be like you always say ... right and so we cannot\nOverlook President Obama when he says aren't they I was the first one I Want to for a woman and microphone you say we keep our doctors yeah you and we did I got a problem with you sir for the the red line the red line and you and I was allowed his radio saying that I called it out because he has a say\nA broke lockers right twice or they don't care what part are you from if you're right you're right but what President Donald Trump deal with this was an experience now he spoke before he knew it he got to backtrack and you ... people walking away like okay now because you know well\nRussia started getting involved they said they were they were ready to start\nArms deals to Saudi Arabia after President Trump\nRussia started getting involved\nThey said they were they were ready to start doing arms deals to Saudi Arabia after President Trump had a sin experience I don't assume you know if that says you know ... Russia has been trying to make them build\nAround April ... you know the players you know what could possibly happen that Mr that's an experience but you know I I I'm One of those that he's not listen to his people know why are these your British or his people told him before he went out there\nIf this is what the situation is these are the possibility that can actually be happening you don't know you you don't get to a situation with the Washington Post and this get national news without being advised by people\nOdd to me there's a bigger story and all the it's a bigger story but the thing that I'm poor now as the bust their finger to come to you\nThe bigger thing that I'm pointing out is when the president speaks ... off the cuff stuff is fine sometimes I guess because people like I don't like it but sometimes when especially when you're dealing with this stuff here yeah it can become nuclear well see I Want\nThe repercussions against Saudi Arabia you know they're they're they're the ones to remember one humanitarian\nIt it is but I guess what plump pale went over there\nAnd sat next to the friends that had that got killed ... basis and it looked great the opposite that look horrible but Steve ... been pulled from a financial conference right but but you but brown what I'm saying it's for everybody to see color for what it ...\nHad to go he had to go that day had ... yes he had to have that sort of wild yeah that was but you know but what I'm\nSaying is when it happened on the other side people call it for Rome and I understood at that point in time we'll ... it had to be done when the Saudi Arabia deals and those are some people call up okay I kept saying back then\nHe had to do those they are right in April when people were all in all means that no that was up for the Democrats this way no no no I'm telling everybody I must say that again\nWhen it comes to Saudi Arabia among those deals we have to do the print came out Saudi Arabian government came on a few hours later the of the president Donald Trump still um and they came out of ... and stuck his jazz out you know what then and then a day\nLater the the story about them spinning it yeah ... oh well he ... he died in its site but don't send Eighteen people interview a conflict room handed it back to die because\nNow you're trying to spend it so it can be easier for president don't you want to make it that just about the U.S but the but the thing I Want everybody to look at is when president Donald Trump's duck is just out of state what he said America strong ... what are the press what what did they say ... you don't wanna do that now\nYou don't want to do that and the president joins John ... back to that nope because why\nAnd I'm not saying he's wrong he and his ever right and if president I don't care if you're a Democrat or Republican Senate ... did the right thing 'cause you know the position that we are and and I mean you don't even know how deep does go now yeah and I and that and now you\nSpeak a truth right there we don't know how complex of a relationship that we have with Saudi Arabia because it is been for\nGenerations but you know deep enough that Democrats and Republican president and don't want to bother that yeah\nI get up to the stone lines Steve here in the lock it in Studio ... how are you know\nDon't go on a list to lock it knows what the law calls we went from a start and what was it not seeing Ninety One Ninety ... we want it to the desert stole ... right\nIn and we went to oh\nOne lady ... we went to the there's a stall ... right to teenagers that we went to Saudi Arabia just to have a fall and I'll just do a little I\n...\nI was there in those little ...

catered towards adolescent girls fair Dylan accurate actor so they ran a story that said that essentially this\nIn bogus cater towards adolescent girls fair Dylan\nAccurate actor so they ran a story that said a centrally this is a paraphrase America's done with capitalism it's time to move to socialism and I know a lot of the times when people hear the phrase socialism\nRight it's become a buzz word it's almost like when the left says that on a homophobic racist big et et cetera that's a conservative buzz word a socialist so when conservatives say socialist every time it's at a conservative goes\nYou know the horrors the evil socialist oh it's going to hell\nBut I really started sitting down and I was thinking OK in theory this socialism thing would mean that if we're just going off of the basic economic theory without applying it to reality the theory would make it a more even doubt society right it'd be forced\nIt'd be a force even a quality of outcome by government standards but basically what it calls for is the redistribution\nOf resources so I thought okay what is so because we we tend to view words and phrases as inherently evil and you know I Would never advocate for anything that George Carlin used to say 'cause you know he's a very crass individual I'm sure a couple of you know\nWho George Carlin was ... I Believe I'm remembering the correct comedian\nBut he had this bit where he talked about you know the ten word you weren't supposed to say and his whole point behind it was their only bad if you allow yourself to get so worked up and think they're bad\nNow granted the words he's a were some of the worst words in English language at least by American Standards so again I'm not advocating for that\nBut nevertheless I think he had a point so I think it's always interesting with these things that as soon as they are said that we think they're bad like modern day time socialism said any conservative will go oh no no no no no I think it's important to think about why is that the gut reaction\nSo I Want to discuss the differences between socialism and capitalism and why after thinking about that for hours yesterday\nBecause instead of doing work and being productive I was sick so I was propped up in bed watching documentaries about the Roman empire yeah shows you how much fun I have ah in my spare time I enjoyed it I watched six episodes six hours worth of documentaries yesterday\nBut nevertheless we'll discuss the difference between socialism and capitalism in the show coming up and we got a couple of other things to talk to but\nA drone down long enough given you an intro to the show this morning we got to go over as always to the man with the plan each and every single morning keeping me kick in making sure I haven't just absolutely passed out in the bed and just\nGone on to the socialist clouds above Dylan how\nYou doing I'm doing All right by the way I have is not socialist it was just a joke please Dylan that one on one W.

I assume you're relating this mat with them like\nThat yeah I Would say that's a correct or were you learn more and more why we're here what you are places where what is your destiny what does your purpose\nCan I ask you something and we were actually I'm not trying to do take you off topic an impact on hold you over during this break if he'd be willing to talk about it but on your own risk ...\n... and my own risk that's fine but my era very educated man when it comes to biblical pounds and I really respect that and the other day my friend and I were having an actual deep conversation and it was oh it was about this you know why does God allow for things to happen you know you have to search really deep and attacks in the one thing\nThat me and my friend just could not reason through other than the cliche praise God has a plan but really no validation for it that I could find was why the un and this is again a really loaded questions if you don't know the answer that's fine but why\nI read in the answer why would not allow the Holocaust happened the murdering his\nWay let's put it this way let's go back to Egypt when a ... Israel was a put under the foot of the Egyptians why did the first born of the Egyptians have to die why with all this debt why did all this calamity boils all these tech there was\nTen closest put upon Egypt why why why would they have to suffer so much was it ... that was a stiff neck and ah why did God put it in his heart and mind purposefully\nTo go against what he wanted for Moses and Israel because yeah the fallow pharaoh could have had any time let them go but God actually placed on him\nYou know you're pushing on ... and his mind not to let them go now later on power would seek Jesus and where where um you want to wear the prisoners were and then you know ... ... talk to him many ... read but I'm getting up here I just wanted to explain that\nEverything is not meant for this particular time mhm\nHe's talked to him many ... read but I'm getting up here I just wanted to explain that\nEverything is not meant for this particular time ... the the the the Egyptians had to go through what they they had a God everything mhm God wanted the Egyptians to learn\nThat there was a God a real true living God and the only way that he could do that was to\nMake them stop believing in their gods and the only way you could stop believing in God that you believed in all your life is to have that got not give you anything not be able to get ... to give you any relief from what the true and living God\nIs is doing ... and allowing the angel or death saying to come through at the end was one of the the the most important I Believe because then he shows that\nNot only is in charge of everything that's good but he's in charge of even the locust army that comes upon us yeah it's his army it's God's ... if you read and Joel chapter two acts chapter ...\nTo ... I Believe it is also a one or a anyway you'll read up the focused on you'll read of that time when of Jacobs trouble that's when Satan is here and there was an army the locust army God is in control that army you know they can do anything they wanted to anybody that doesn't believe in God\nThe only problem is they can't touch a hair on anyone's head that has the CEO of God and therefore head or has the knowledge of God's word in their mind\nAnd then those that that's why it's always perplexed me in the scenario of the Holocaust because those are the Jewish people are typically regarded as God's people and they were the people that were selectively singled out and so that's why I didn't ... I I it's hard for me to understand that\nWell there's been a long confusion of who people are I mean most people think that we're ... we're not gentile gentile as those who have the dumber the rock\nOr we don't have the dome of the rock we don't believe is that ... we're Christians ... we're we're we're God's people\nAnd you know you you can argue we've been grafted in but what if you're not even grafted it and what if you're an ashtray or for him what if you're one of the ... that was scattered upon this earth to one end to the other and\nBeing ... you know I'm an adjunct means but don't forget bull you take the American people those a white male Christians are a little bit forget bull or food or God is ... and\nAnd ... and it goes way it goes deeper than that what we don't have the time to talk about that 'cause I'm really wanted to address that guy did to my heart because I have to talk about that for some reason and bell bottoms I wouldn't mind talking about bell bottom but yeah you wouldn't believe this by my wife sky pre made\nOut here and she told me that there were the newspapers putting in veterans and and the newspaper picture so she wanted a picture so for the last two weeks up and tell her no no no no no and I finally told her where some of my pictures were ... and one of the euro books and she's she's showing me pictures and I'm wearing news like flannel bell Blue Bell bottoms\nWho stairs of the uh accomplish in Italy in Rome or somewhere yeah in one of the college stadiums right mhm and understand\nThe peanuts and there was a capture no nothing to do around here but he had actually that's pretty funny when you're off a ship and you're doing nothing but standing around and you know the early ... anyway I was wearing Blue Bell bottom", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "21"}
