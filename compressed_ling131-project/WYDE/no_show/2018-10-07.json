it begins\nWith a drastically different emotions for me than just one hour ago Jessica oh well it really and I\nI I didn't have this written down this is just because I'm just telling you how I feel organic organic here's what I mean we had collies and I can't remember which specifically said this is just the kind of person who calls it as they see it I think it might have been Jim saying that and\nRemember which specifically said those of just the kind of person who calls it as they see it I think it might have been Jim saying that and I want to do the same but\nOftentimes the best I can do is just tell you how I'm feeling what my gut tells me I don't know if my guts right or wrong they were even knows but in the moment what am I feeling\nSome on the show yesterday I was telling you that I felt that there was going to be one or two Republicans who are maybe going to surprise us with a no we had some swing votes out there but I just thought\nSomeone was going to have their Ted Cruz moment you remember at the convention two years ago when everybody is offering praise for Trump as he accepts the nomination from the Republican Party\nTed Cruz takes the stage you wanted to be different and he said vote your conscience you didn't say vote for Trump he said vote your conscience got booed off the stage John McCain had indicated he was going to vote for the repeal of Obamacare until he didn't he gave the famous thumbs down killing the repeal effort\nOf Obamacare we spend a lot of time on this yesterday those were my thoughts of yesterday of the victory lap and I was hearing by Republicans I felt was premature\nLet's go back to just one hour ago our show began ... an hour ago and I was telling me how to geek up it felt like a game day felt like the super bowl I wasn't even really caring about the historic nature of it as much as that was just excited by all of the energy right we talked about that for twenty minutes\n\nThen comes the word that an hour from now Susan Collins will announce which way she's going to vote\n\nIt's hard to make predictions because either go your way or they don't write I don't know and you can laugh an hour from now if I get it wrong I'm telling you right now and one of five in the afternoon I think an hour from now she tells us She's going to vote no\nI think there's very well could all come crashing down in an hour and whatever goofy energy I was feeling an hour ago and now for real nervous is not for the sake of the show and I'm not saying for the sake of a segment and our from a ... an hour ago were laughing about just little\nGravy keep the craziness going my gut tells me an hour from now it could\nAll fall apart senator Collins has lunch with a leader Mitch McConnell I don't know that you'd having lunch with him to say I'm voting yes right I think she might be saying you can't count on me\nWell and I thought it was kind of strange that she came out and said she was going to make a statement today\nI mean I had of the vote and what's the purpose of that I don't understand if you vote yes to go ahead and move forward to have the vote then why hold a press conference and say which way you're going to vote sure because it would seem if she's going to come out and say because I battled with this myself that would seem that she was going to come out today and say I'm voting no well why did you vote yes to\nGo ahead and have the vote tomorrow yeah I mean that doesn't make any sense but then again if you're going to come out and say she's voting yes what's the point of telling us that right\nAnd I think you can have a yes vote to let's get to the vote is kind of wrap this up what's your final answer who wants to be a millionaire style of\nVoting yes to move to the final vote to me I don't necessarily think is yes I Will vote for this person I think it's just let's get through it already have enough information right I made my decision\nAn hour from now you can call and say your big dummy we knew it was fine and the victory lap can continue a head of the vote tomorrow\nBut sitting here right now my only emotion is I don't think there's going to happen\nWell there's wanted to change the thought I've had it's either a she's going to go hat and lay out her her reasons why she's voting no when she wants to go ahead and cleared the deck and make sure she saved state or it could be the exact opposite it could be that she's nervous about her yes vote and she wants to make sure everybody knows why she's voting yes\nThe back and make sure she same state or it could be the exact opposite it could be that she's nervous about her yes vote and she wants to make sure everybody knows why she's voting yes okay so she can walk away with the clerical yeah\nAnd that may be I did see a headline or maybe it was a an opinion piece about the FBI didn't clear Kavanaugh as much as it allowed for Republicans to have clear conscience is when they vote for him for confirmation\nHappy

completely bust my chops because I could hear it in their voice it was coming\nI had made a point about cabin on politics he's like\nOh isn't it [laughter] it's never good I\nDon't know something I don't want to hear from you because I Know something about you like oh my gosh what'd you going to say I know that you took a photo with cardboard Hillary Clinton fabulous for years you know and then we had a good laugh about it I think she's high then I'll never forget\nSo it's just a reminder that these are important times and these are situations that matter they do they do they do but then there's also the realization we're in a country with roughly three hundred Seventy five million people that we vote we\nGet involved we let our voices be heard but in some respects we're also just got to go in with the flow and I don't mean that to be dismissive but you just life is what life is\nYou heard but in some respects we're also just kinda go in with the flow and I don't mean to be dismissive but you just life is what life is we try to be good citizens and good parents and good spouses and good friends and hardworking employees and the rest is just kind of details\nYeah right yeah I Know what you mean and it's one of those things too and I know that we have we have a voice as voters and blah blah blah\nBut in this current situation we don't really have any power to control the outcome of graduation all we can do is sit back and watch and see what happens in it is it's kind of nerve wracking in a way I agree because it's one of those times and and the more you do this especially in this industry and radio\nThe more you kind of get a knack for being able to predict and maybe not with a hundred percent accuracy but you know you you kind of feel things out like I think I Know how this is going to pan out I have no idea [laughter] she literally have no clue and it\nFeels kind of good to say that 'cause I listen to to other people who do this job or a watch things on TV or read people on line like wow these people are so I was thinking smart\nAnd embarrass wrong if the rest of the time you know not all of us are and I think I realize that not just real politics but with sports you know we're all paid to have an opinion and express our opinion and you think of the most passionate people in the most opinionated people I Can't remember when they were right or when they were wrong I Would try sometimes ... you know like\nWhen it comes to sports they'll give the Goldstone lock on the day I promised tomorrow afternoon this is going to happen\nAnd then Monday rolls around I Can't remember what they've it right and who knows I enjoy listening I enjoyed talking to them and that was good enough like Murphy we always enjoy hearing from him go right ahead\nRussell piece scorpion in the wall of why the\nThat I like it\nYes yes ah listen a Christian Blasey Ford is a liar she has borne false witness against Brett Kavanaugh as she might be deleterious about being assaulted but is when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh says she has lived by implicated in him now and it's like how do you\nHave now let me that made me here's I mean let me ask you this is how how in the world could you know that\nWould would you go to Congress and to tell the whole entire world somebody assaulted me\nWell Haitian here is that ... that Brett Kavanaugh salted\nHe said he said it was him or a hundred percent yes I did or not ...\nShe provided hero evidence\nShe none of her witnesses what corroborate her story and then my living all it takes is too\nBut there's a difference between being unable to corroborate and being an refuting right I mean let's say like her friend Leland uh she's she did tell the FBI when they spoke with her this week that she felt pressure from one of Dr Ford's\nUm allies to change your story or to revisit her story but you know you make a claim I'm unable to corroborate is simply means I Can't vouch for it I that doesn't that's not the same\nAs me saying it definitively didn't happen I don't know whether Dr Ford is telling the truth or not so I certainly we talked about this on the show last friday in fact I don't want to bear fault false witness\nHer I don't know I Do agree with you that she didn't produce enough evidence or maybe even any evidence but I'm not ready to call her a liar\nWell if it walks like a dodging wax like at the list [laughter]\nCollins and Murkowski both of those ladies are owned by Planned Parenthood\nAnd\nI you know for Murkowski not voting for him she's all along with the with Planned Parenthood Collins yeah maybe she's getting something out of a deal she just got a sweetheart something coming in the next whatever\nWith the with Planned Parenthood college yeah maybe she's getting something out of a deal she's got us we are something coming in the next whatever bill um but she has to get out in front of that and state faced with Planned Parenthood\nBecause she's in there they're in her pocket so she's going to put our dog and pony show to make it look like she's she's doing this against her will like her arms being twisted\nIn order for her to maintain her status and keep getting our tax dollars as campaign contributions from Planned Parenthood\nWhatever her statement is thirty minutes from now can we all agree we don't want to uh Cory Booker moment he'd she doesn't need to go over forty minutes I'll give her for just make your point up or down yes or no and we can all move on and figure out what happens next\nBut ah yeah I don't need an hour long press conference with her telling us whether she's going to vote yes or no tomorrow\nWhy I don't think she's chair and are close yelling I'm Spartacus\n[laughter] I don't think that's going to ask you what if\nShe got out there today alright more while we're almost thirty minutes away from this now and she goes to this whole long thing about how she feels and all that when she goes so I'll let you know tomorrow\n[laughter] that's like a cliffhanger I going to polarize the grass then I said after the ... [laughter] gosh can you imagine\nAs good a buddy always good to speak with you I Do appreciate it two oh five nine four one one on one one toll free one eight six six by by one Ninety nine thirty three\nSenate voting today fifty one forty nine to advance the cabin on nomination Jeff Flake Susan Collins voting yes to move forward the final vote\nOn Kavanaugh tomorrow as the Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of voting yes eight and know from a Republican senator of Alaska Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins of Maine I Believe it's Maine right or will be offering her\nHer plans on her vote for tomorrow I'm nervous I think next hour we're going to find out that she's voting no when Jessica I Do like\nThe um kind of the different scenarios you laid out there maybe she doesn't know or maybe this is her way of saying I'm voting yes\nBut ... me too I'm Still with you or I don't appreciate how Dr Ford has been treated I don't like that she's been ridiculed or whatever this is not a complete and total endorsement of Brett Kavanaugh himself but they have enough information to vote yes so maybe this is her trying to save face however she chooses to vote\nIt would make sense if she did that I mean because that's kind of what they do they're all about protecting themselves and their image\nYeah meantime a President Trump continues to tweet I Can't wait to get his reaction\nLater today to see what he has to say he did call the protesters earlier today paid actors not to buy into it he says they're paid by George Soros and others protesters gathering in front of Mitch McConnell's office having a cabin are keg or with beers\nAnd solo cups you got all people up in arms in all manner of ways we got Andrea ties coming in we've got to talk about the economy I tease that we would and then failed to do so will use them in the headlines to show you how\nTo do that you're you're saying let's continue on I don't know what she thought could be achieved by continuing debate well by the allegations could come for I guess ... but he the here's what she said after it did the woman's all over the place like she's just a\nDeer in headlights going you know between the the dotted line like just both sides because she said afterwards to reporters basically indicating\nI did vote no for on this cloture vote but that doesn't mean now I Will vote no against him\nWell yeah I Know the end the call and said the same thing about her yes vote so it's a weird thing and it's almost it feels like to me and maybe I'm just fantasizing you've got these two women\nAnd it's like they're trading off votes like I'll vote no for cloture you vote yes then when it comes to the real vote you vote no and also yeah all switch ... will do a switch through and that'll just show how conflict here we are and how we had to wrestle this through and we weren't quite sure I don't know I had\nHeard is that the agreement was they're going to go in the same direction of let's agree yes or no that we vote the same way so there's not one person standing out as a sore thumb right but rather the group of people flake out together or stood strong\nRight so I I'm not quite sure what the reasoning all is in that but he just stress it struck me as interesting because Murkowski and Collins tend to work together there you know Bob de twins and um and Murkowski said no calling said yes let's vote it's through let's get it to a final vote and then um and then work house he's\nI'm not a hundred years in Congress or not\nAnd we're ... said no Collins said yes let's vote it's through let's get it to a final vote and then I'm In the Murkowski is like yeah\nI'm not a hundred and ... not so I don't know what these girls are plotting honestly it's kinda crazy\nThis conversation today conversation yesterday and even last friday isn't always breaking down what happened but really trying to\nPredict what might happen I've been talking on the show today than my emotions are kind of all over the place at as the show began at twelve hours pretty excited just the whole spectacle of at all\nThen at one o'clock when the news came of here's the time two o'clock hour it'd be three eastern but two o'clock for us when Susan Collins makes known her plans on how she'll vote I suddenly got nervous have you Andre ... have your emotions kind of gone up and down here and there are you pretty much locked in however you feel about things\nIt's really much it's just a a wait and see hold my breath I'm In hold my breath mode and I'm just holding my breath not letting the emotions come one way or the other right now I they're they're not going to vote until four o'clock tomorrow because they have to wait thirty hours\nAnd I calculated that they completed their vote right before ... and came on so he comes in at ten\nSo it you twenty four hours of ten AM and then you add six and it's going to be around for pm that\nThe vote and anything can happen right I mean I some there was one point where when calling said she would vote\nYou know vote for cloture but that didn't guarantee that you would vote yes for the final confirmation it sounded to me like she was just simply buying time like\nI'm going to vote yes here but don't assume anything because I Need to get back to my office [laughter] clearly without getting accosted by a myriad of screaming women blocking me in the elevator and you know making me feel bad to think\nThat they would get interest in terms of the protesters and the pressure from the public and people literally screaming in your face I Know that this has historical and that maybe we they haven't seen that level of protest you know first hand\nBut but at a certain point it as as many years of some of these senators have been in place you think the economy used to the public pressure and be able to navigate through that without at you know knock on the back and forth I mean it it kind of surprises me that they're not a little bit more accustomed to that\nYou would think that they would be Jessica but at the same time thinking about how often they skate through on doing things with their little shallow surface explanations right and nobody calls in to the carpet on it for example who's a costing Doug Jones right now\nBecause Doug Jones gave the most shallow answer about why he voted no on her that and um it it's in raging when you think about it when the the a majority of people here in the ... in Alabama want Kavanaugh\nAnd want him to vote for Kavanaugh and he's a senator representing us and he's voted no\nSo ... you know nobody chasing him down roughly what what did he say you know to give a direct quote but just his his reasoning or did he oh well see I happened to have a piece our let her go to their yeah let me just whip it out\nThere it is yeah I ... a piece story Jones is saying you know what this is what makes me nauseous really he says there's been unprecedented ugliness this is true okay on both sides\nAnd I just I'm Sorry I I fled disagree I'd like to know the ugliness started with dirty Diane and her little\nLetter whipped out from wherever she was stashing it and and the ... the the ugly and it started with dirty died in and it went on with Spartacus and ... and you know um what's his name was it was the\nNickname for um the Rosen guy who claims he's getting\nAnd you know um what's his name was it was the nickname for um ... the Rosen guy who claims he's Vietnam I Can't\nOh I Know you're talking about hunger dang dang [laughter]\nFrom Vietnam right okay All right anyways it just kept going and going and rolling through on the Democratic side I beg to differ senator Jones who was ugly on the Republican side yeah who was ugly I Know\nIt is strange that Democrats in this situation seemed to be able to say whatever they want and any pushback is seen as being mean yeah you know what I mean that you can say all manner of things about Brett Kavanaugh the man and then when he gets heated\nI Can't believe it's Denver meant look out why can't you just sit there are a lot of ... and just smile about it and wondering what\nKind of man would sit there and and the face of having his family ripped apart you know I mean think about the uh the conflict and and the pressure that must cause inside his home I mean just as from his wife and his kids and how devastating these accusations have to be I'm sure they know they're not true but still it's it's going to have an effect on your family and then you put him in that situation\nAnd you put them in before the the very people that have orchestrated all this and you expect him to to be a completely perfect human being that's ridiculous and yes and then the act\nAct with this sanctimonious a judgmental spirit like ooh I don't know that temperament Ollie might flare up in the middle of a courtroom he\nMight throw his eyes well you know what\nThey were saying to their own MSNBC there were just like you know I just don't I don't know you know this was like a job interview and and he just did not perform well and I thought how many times during the job interview somebody asked you if you're a gang rape is literally never happened to me right\nOh I Know right now and the thing is if anybody on any given day released video or some sort of undercover coverage of current day senators and what they do\nWhen they're off camera and they're not any does come on are you kidding me I mean ... ... yes believe me it it would come around real quick and they\nThey would be caught for the hypocrites that they are\nA hundred times we don't want an ambush you but when we come back we're going to embrace you\nIs it about that Halloween [laughter] listening yes I years are and I forgot to bring that up and what did you call her\nDirty Diane or [laughter] you know it is between dirty day in and you know Dr fraud\nA mean Christine for oh yeah yeah see I'm here's what I'm thinking ... easy enough to get a blonde wig in a in a suit and then just have one of those really super big big cans and wrap it was a cover that says one beer\nLike if a brand name one beer All right and a goofy glasses and some frequent flyer miles tucked in and sticking out of your pocket and oh that'd be fun what do you send them the truth I'm wires hotel you my my lie detector wires hooked up to me I'm so afraid just because he's telling the truth I Know I\nKnow I Know but I just think here's a thing as a female and and I mean again I'm kind of go on the line here but I Would just send the thing that if you were in a situation where you had been you know attempted rape or a year and that type of situation\nThat you would go to the authorities I mean I Would you know and and since she didn't take that for there's like statute of limitations in place here so she she still had that open door to go to the police and say hey I'd like to you know yelled investigate that if if you were truly wanting someone to have to answer for what they did you\nI Would think that that would be the greatest stuff you could take was to go to your local authorities and and do it there and not put it out\nI could even appreciate the fact that she thought he shouldn't hold that place in the Supreme Court I could appreciate\nYour local authorities and and do it there and not put it out I could even appreciate the fact that she thought he shouldn't hold that place in the Supreme Court I can appreciate that if if that had really happened\nBut don't you think you should seek justice in the form of going through the proper route and then they even said well you know you need to file charges and she just didn't and that makes me think that she didn't fall charges 'cause you can get in trouble for falling a false police report\n[noise] yes and that was the same thing that came up between you and me Russell remember that why is a person who has a doctorate\nNot going through the proper channels the normal channels the logical channels for how you deal with something if you feel that it's worthy of attention by law enforcement or need to even be brought to the Senate you still want to ... you know ... with law enforcement there is actually a crime\nAnd it's much like the Roy Moore thing it's like Roy Moore didn't all of a sudden burst onto the scene he he was in the public eye for a long time and it was right when he was running for office that all of a sudden we find out as much as they found\nYour book appears in all of these allegations come out that ... and all the time he's been in the news and in the headlines never once said these allegations been brought forth but now all of a sudden\nNever met her like a total abstinence from the garden got rather die from alcohol as I didn't really get yeah yeah I guess that makes

God\nSpeaks to the news that\n\nOn superstation\nLook in the program every body sick I have got to be some radio on this day of October\nIt is friday hope you're having a fantastic guy out there I had a little bit of a brain and the\nSecond quarter of the program I was trying to remember US Senator Joni Ernst and I said in the hall which was a terrible terrible insult to miss earn but I think she deserves a lot of credit\nCards um\nEspecially Cindy hatch let's see but I really like Joni Ernst and here's one US Senator Joni Ernst is pretty conservative\nJoni Ernst is a woman Joni Ernst does a good job in Joni Ernst good\nApparently we're on her shoulder or on her sleeve if she happens to have a sleeve\nThat day that she's a woman\nWe knew this Collins and Senator Murkowski are women do we not\nSo that Susan Collins and Senator Murkowski are women do we not why do we automatically know that they are women because they play the card\nThey they act like you you've got to know that I'm a woman don't last and the press knows that they can push\nTheir gender button or whatever\nThey can get them go when they get a lot of fire under them with the stand with women stuff\n\nJoni Ernst just says this is how it is I'm a senator I'm making decisions powwow I'm not saying she's never said anything about women in politics et cetera\nBut looking at it from Alabama watching the national news\nJoni Ernst does her job apparently the press doesn't think they can twist in bend Joni Ernst\nBecause she's a woman Joni Ernst apparently is a strong woman who says I'm going to be a U.S senator and I'm going to do a good job I Believe Joni urged\nActually portrays in my opinion equality\nShe actually shows us what that should be like she's an attractive lady should that should\nNot necessarily matter but everybody knows she's a woman but you don't have her with a big sign that says I make my decisions from the viewpoint of a woman\nI Will make sure that a woman's voice is heard here every day she's a senator she was elected to be a senator\nI don't know if I Am\nCommunicating this idea right but if you compare her with Murkowski in Collins where everything is\nOh I don't know I'm I'm a little I'm not sure oh oh oh I just might be a little afraid of I don't know have a made up my mind yet I don't know what I feel like\nI was I Wish there was video if you do in the hands\nAre laughing as well\nIt's just that but I'm the only person who season is so Joni Ernst is not a household\nName because she does she does that act that way\nAnd then I have to hear this law and stuff I have to say oh these people marching and\nWomen are going to have their revenge and women will be heard\n\nI just don't believe southern women maybe as red state women\nAre asking for all this special treatment\nI think red state women take care of their families do their jobs are are straight up up front and get the job done no nonsense yes I'm a woman but I'm not going to play at every which way possible\nBut these female politicians in Washington DC way too many of them want to have their cake and eat it too\nFemale politicians in Washington DC way too many of\nThem want to have their cake and eat it too\nI'm a super powerful\nWoman fighting for this that and the other and then it's oh but you need to treat me a little differently\n\nProbably doesn't matter anything to anybody but Joni Ernst and some of the other Republican women who aren't always on the news because they're doing their job\nDeserves some credit but it was just senator or is it just kinda got me\nGo when this morning and beliefs you need to have a little too does 'cause she's out they're voting for Kavanaugh and nobody is over there saying well what about you Joni what about you what about your going to throw women under the bus no\n\nToo bad ms Murkowski ms Collins can't realize\nThat is they're signaling of weakness that has made them a target of all these protesters you can throw just like in there you want to\nI Want to tell you a little bit more about this or so missing McClain who is a former FBI a government employee tight\nEnds up with her attorney being a person named David Law firm ... who was number one two three owned the third tier of leadership\n\nIn the national security division ends up her attorney\n\nSays in his former deejay in as the position last men would have held knowledge of the size of the title warrants surveillance program initiated on Carter Page\nScott you are not telling me that these people all know each other and we're in positions to know about this stuff that's what this article was saying\n\nYou can look at all their background will probably put this up on the website somewhere\nMs Mitchell asked Boise for the second is the letter that you wrote to Senator Feinstein dated you out of the thirtieth of this year Mitchell said did you read the letter yourself forward I did Mitchell and our census data July thirtieth did you ride it on that date\nI Believe so it sounds right I was in a bus\nI was in rubber robust Delaware at the time I could look into my calendar and try to figure that out it seemed was it written I Wonder about that day yes yes I traveled I think the twenty sixth of July to her robust Delaware so that makes sense because I wrote it from there\nWell those like you say I don't even have I Can't even mind sound like a frog is Kermit the frog all my voices are covered the frog and just leave me alone [laughter] let me let me go through this one last part if I never\nThis is why I like doing this show for you I busted the same if I didn't do this show my poor poor wife would have to hear it anyway so I get to come here and tell you miss McClain\nWho is miss lazy Ford's buddy who lives in ... where there is robust speech and people are saying oh is this McLean her beach friend or maybe she has some beach friends like she said\nMiss McLean has a lawyer his name is David last month David a lot of men was

going to show up and show either for because they were outraged of how\nOver six that women\nOn either side is going to show up and show out either for because they were outraged of how they think that the full with a liar\nOr the other side what Democrats think that she was telling the truth ... do you think at the end of the day that this is going to ... motivate women to get out and vote Brian uh I\nI Do um I think that is just on precedent looking at the two thousand Seventeen Alabama special election and the allegations cannot\nRoy Moore those allegations invigorated or the female vote on the Democratic side and also had a um a almost a resistance that I'm On a lot of Republicans that did not want to cast a vote for Roy Moore on the flip side though I Do\nI mean there's just a lot of rumblings on us through you know just looking at conservatives news outlets and you're talking to my friends who lean conservatively\nOr they're outraged completely and totally outraged\nBy this whole process they feel that he has been railroaded mom that he has been done wrong where unseen just the opposite on the other side where a lot of my liberal friends you know they're just as outrage that he's getting off another another\nSexual saucers getting off a or a privileged white man is getting off and so you're getting on a boat and I think that is invigorating both basis I yeah I don't I don't foresee a blue\nWave of right now there's a lot of people that are saying that the Republican Party might pick up six Senate seats and that the houses now ...\nWhat we're going to see you know I it's hard to tell when you're talking about local elections national elections ... you're talking about local elections um I still think the American people don't realize how important\nThey are looking elections are in a different ... around the country um but what I'm looking at right now Robert I assume you were to come to a six weeks off I've won three three\nI think there's going to be um definitely conversations I think the media is going to pick up on this and special MSNBC and CNN I think they're going to be running stories now not just about during the Trump but what does this mean to women I mean they're going to put on a horse strings of America\nAnd I think every Democrat is going to run on the horse of Americans say you see what the process was done you see this is a shame\nYou see that they didn't go um um they didn't go to investigate all the other people that I'm Dr phil wanted them to investigate the only guy had a list of people they were trying to control it so the narrative is already being put out it was already being put out\nLet me put out even more now\nAnd you're going to have the uh the Republicans coming out and they're going to say you know justice was done you know at the end of the Democrats paint a picture mhm for America\nWith no facts and so again for me in the middle of this watching as an American citizen\nForget both parties okay for me forget for the boys what worries me and I've been saying that for the last couple of weeks as I've been covering a story from TV or radio what worries me is when this truly does happen and the woman is by herself mhm and she decides to come out\nHow do we believe them because I think with the twenty four hour media what I look and see is\nDepending on who it is they're going to spend a store or wherever way they can not said his role in us and is right but when it really really really happens okay when it happens to a female or a man and they're by themselves and they decided to it triggers one year\nOkay when it happens to a female or a man and they're by themselves and they decided to it triggers one year later ten years later did this they decided to tell their story\nWe going to connect this to he's a CEO mhm oh he's a politician oh he'd give it to go through a position and it really happened that's my worry\nBut you shouldn't just tribally jumped\nInto this boat of believe all women just to believe all women because somebody's coming forward with the story not all stories are accurate not all accusations are accurate I have been a part of a situation where I was trying to do the right thing ... and uh me and my best friend\nOr a girl that worked for me in a missed a couple of days\nGot a phone call from her friends saying that she was raped\nMhm she comes back to work her parents worked\nOf about a block and a half away from you know we're we're our business was mhm and me and my friend but we we talked about it and we wanted to ensure\nBut our our bodies question okay and I'm a ... to Yuma for him\nDo you think a person I'm a ... magnitude where she lived her life ... being her what ... what is going to be a with a family and teeth is going to subject her family to do for whatever\nOkay she goes to show she's already Murphy for the left okay the fact that she failed as a disappointment\nBut you know\nWhether they think she told the truth or not he still made a Supreme effort and it took one for the team as far as they're concerned\nRun out democratic moment yeah\nNow and I'm an I'm Sorry but there ain't no conservatives out there in Palo Alto where she's teaching psychology OK okay\nThere's precious few and universities in Alabama anymore okay All right I mean you know it's just I'm Sorry but somebody pointed out that they control the schools and and unfortunately for the most part they do\nAll you know what they won't allow is any kind of a thought diversity of\nYou better be in lockstep with the way they think or you're in trouble all the money from that goes on me accounts mhm\nOkay now next savings are best coaching football oh two ways about it right right okay where's the ... months you get\nPaid by the University of Alabama right\nBut then there's ... money there's yellow wood money there's ... towards the camera endorsement okay okay so the book deals the Gulf funding money\nThis is called on flights and yellow with money if they're passing out the people you know with bags of money passing out cash for protesters to get elected us to be or get arrested at the beginning of this thing ...\nI got to think that she's taking care of\nLimit on his luck we would never know this but I Would like to see who donated to go I Want to be\nThat we can find out on ... used to go to the site and we're going to do what I Want to research because\nYou would the ordinary American people go to a million dollar everybody's story short of organizations donated to her right that's a different story you got interview individually that a wealthy they're part of a you know the Democratic party or you know some kind of a I'm a pack that ...\nI Can't remember the lady's name that got on the elevator with a Jeff Flake uh-huh but you saw the interviewer she just fought admitted that she was with the Soros organization\nWhat we know sourcing people to disrupt on politics all the time you know death that's ... now but\nHe's the longer he using the platform okay that's the platform of using the cameras do his thing I'm ... I'm I Want to connect doctor for the money the book deal knowing this he was going to do the plane I can say is a possibility I'm not saying that it's not but when we live in these will affect my partners in the coffin we always talk about this\nKnowing that she was going to do the plane I can say is a possibility I'm not saying that it's not but when we live in these will affect my partner cynical often we always talk about this is what the record see ... no one is still in Iraq and right now\nEverybody's hypothetically how are you going to respect on aid I mean I'd like to\nRead on Monica McLean so far how much is what how much have y'all read on Monica McLean\nI have no other who'd anything I don't know who Monica McLean is\nOh my goodness okay so you're going to not want it to McLean is pretty sense okay she is the person that Dr Ford was probably with when the letter was crafted\nShe is the person uh when we talk about a Cleveland Kaiser was pressured any change in her testimony right she wants to pressure on that she has a ... she's excess vi okay off\nOr he told me late who are caught on how to beat the they say they thought they had to be the uh the fact that they're\nThe ones that wasn't a whole other member ... protests right he went for the FBI got to go okay well she is linked to\nThe ... I think I ... I don't know how to say the name right I Apologize I've read it several times ... for ... for somebody that knows how to pronounce it shifts connected to a Paul lost money mhm\nThese are the people that were in charge mhm not their investigators they were in charge of the Clinton email trials and found that there was nothing wrong there mhm\nI I mean you know telling us there's a lot of the state just Sutton washed at this point in time you know it's it's not just the same ilk it's kind of the same people that we got the uh email ...\nI mean but but ... what we're saying right now and and I and I hate to push back on because I you know I Love you man but they were saying basically the same thing that when president Donald Trump was running for president\nAnd all these people came out the woodwork conspiracy theory right I mean everybody everybody that came out that came and ran with President Donald Trump they had a record they did is they did they do connected as they were connected to that\nI mean again we can say these things and you can find people linked to certain things but like I said for me I Do believe I Do I'm happy that just kind of got confirmed heard me say that many time\nOkay I'll tell you what to do this for me joke okay go by a six ... six cork board okay alright get you a bunch of them pans ...\nAnd when you start reading these articles take pictures of these people and write their name on the picture mhm stick them on the court for the\nFirst run its strengths between them\nRight but at the clock I'm with you you can do that but I can do that with President Donald Trump and his connections to with the Russians and all of this stuff all the people who connected will they be is still with the Russians I can do that President Obama I can do to President Bush\nClinton I could do that with everybody what'd you ask me and I knew I couldn't do that with everybody\nDonald Trump's on business deals wherever Donald Trump figure Donald Trump will make money\nBut he but here's the thing clock we're making excuses you know what I'm saying\nShe can say that does she see can say that doesn't happen I think it said that these people came in afterwards Mm okay because the deep state wanted to come and they saw the platform they they came in after this and they wanted to go to work with her and they and she didn't know nothing about them before they had a I mean there's so many different ways we can go with that still connecting the dots\nIs not really connected to the doctor because like I say everybody on the national said like the president don't jump and food and everybody you can connect Dr something connected to run your representative I did right there if something happened right now I'm doing is here and and it's something we ...\nThey could make me do you mean something bad as they should or they're going to take me to class\nI did right there if something happened right now I'm doing is here in ... and some of the ... they couldn't make me to you know something by as they should or they made a clock and it was out of the gossip about midnight they connect me to clock to\nManage [laughter] we we don't ... scrupulous character in the yard and plug I got you\nKnow really off you know the compromise shovels has been first and foremost in the news and all that they all they did I Know when it's not first and foremost in the news I Will be very surprised if you do not see a lot of stuff come forward on people's names I just mentioned\nI I Want to see it in ... like I say I would go on the on my radio show and I will apologize that I was wrong because now\nI think you know I'll go off on a rabbit holes when I see somebody's name or something in an article right so I I just like I'm I'm probably forty eight dollars hadn't before\nI got to love you man and a half ago\nYou know I hear what everybody's saying Brian then yeah I mean I'm listening but again\nThis is coming from your play book yeah right but what you always ... me about ... ... right now it's in black and white and there's nothing you know black and white everybody is saying but at the end of the day is not in black and white and I'm surprised how are you I'm really you more about it because 'cause I don't I don't\nWant him to leave her because there's nothing in black and white ... you go into speculation\nOh it's fun to speculate but brought up but I'm saying like here I and I'm just throwing hypotheticals out there I'm not saying I'm One hundred percent behind all this what I'm saying what is you know let's look at the situation and how the situation has on full yet it's not in black and white but it does make it go huh All right that makes me scratching my head a little bit\nBut brown me and you have about a minute times on this show yeah right and ... it will be our reporters who don't pay for it was in paper it can't be with you it was written down and he can't be refuted from these certain organizations where we're at the highest thing in the land when it comes to the government yeah All right we got the media covering this you know right\nAnd they left or right has not come up with anything that anybody saying though right now in what now the media in anything that she was like the the lie that did not happen there's nothing out there in the media on either side from the left or the right there saying for a fact that she lived there for a fact that this was did not ...\nI'm ... I'm Sorry I I've I've seen some Fox\nNews reports that have gone detailed into what she said and has broken or department of also spoken\nThey'll park ... proved that she's lying that something did not happen ... ... yeah no I no\nBody nobody but her in God and who ever did do something to her can refute that\nThat's what I'm saying now ... was it just Kevin Oh like I said we would never know I don't think so I don't think so but then something happened to this one because there are people you heard on this show on my TV show people to vote in\nBelow lady you don't find it often where women are going to come out against each other on something like this but this is the bottom of the country I'm In for women to me I think that especially because of the the\nTiming of it all knew it looks like a political hit job based upon when the information came out how the information came out and then on the back story and everything that we have gone through um\nWith the process in there I think that's why a lot of people are looking 'cause I think everybody was kind of been dissipating kind of waiting for that October surprise for this process and then when it hit everybody you know you have all the\nDemocrats are high but then all the Republicans right and ... [laughter]\nRight but you know into different no trains of thought well you know a radio talk show anchor news I could see rather than doing this and I want to actually your opinion of you you know fear where we've seen in last week's seeing how you know this has divided the country among women\nWhy women and black women I thought I Would never see something like this on a subject like this\nUm is about even in politics or what is your observation as a a woman in this time in his time two thousand Eighteen what are you feeling right now about this\nThe way a lot of people are responding to these uh it kind of makes a valid points for both\nThe way a lot of people are responding to these uh\nIt kinda makes a valid points for both sides of the argument on one hand you have people that can come forward and say like this is why so many people are reluctant to come forward when they are victims of some type of sexual assault because you have so many people coming forward you know saying they she is telling the truth\nThen I'm On the other end of the argument like a a college sad you know there are a lot of inconsistencies in the story\nSo it gives people a reason to say you know she's not telling the truth you know when we go here and find out that the reason they she gave for you know whatever she was actually different so you know I guess it was kind of like you know when you were younger you know she's always tell you it's hard to believe you if\nYou lie like and he lied about these new ally about something else and continue to cover it up over and over again ... so just what the what in the ... that we're in now I'm just what the hell me too movement and everything is really hard and you know find an argument in stand firmly on it\nLet me ask you a question and we'll get to the phones makes six six five one non uh three three supervisors do you believe that before\n\nThat's something hard to answer as in wrestling with myself\nUm\nI Want to believe someone watching someone of sexual assault mhm and the reason I say that is because that is such a heavy allegation and it can cause so many issues for um the uh the ... but\nJust like the caller before it isn't a lot of things they seen then ... saying they weren't true so new and ... do you believe it or\nNot I don't\n... about five one man after we do is get up to the phone line Dave you're lucky to love to bake\nA ... a great oh David going pretty good\nI I'm quite frankly there's there's an undercurrent\nOf of a situation in the Senate and the Congress actually a\nGoogle all the wealth is of a journalist so you to all he does an interview with George well these are a government analyst he's got a lot of information about what's going on since two thousand two thousand and won\nThe Senate a committee only a military Cindy and I'm also the Foreign Relations committee the fall there's lot there's there's about\n... percent of the Senate is all the ... or is the most of those programs and they it was a toss up because all of that it wouldn't go in all of a sudden that they wouldn't vote him in the really\nYeah oh man and of course I voted for Trump I'm I'm a concert and conservative names conserved constitution was written right off and I don't believe it's a a living document and all that garbage as a way it's written\n... all but I'm a\nIt's well worth losers hour and forty five minutes of of\nThat commentary on YouTube program Jon ... George ... know John B a wells program and I'm spiraling down the rabbit hole was is the title of it is so what happens is set for it does and it's very ...\nElves program and I'm spiraling down the rabbit hole is is the title of it is so what happens is set\nFor it you got you and it's very interesting uh and uh it it\nIt makes a lot of dodge of what's going on but they spent or did not vote for him it was a toss up because it's a it's a it when they voted manager so sealed the deal that the um uh they didn't do you know it was going to anger the Republican so fast\nThat was going to come out in droves or in the November election in that first but I think they're going to come out in droves anyway we'll sing yeah we'll see\nWe'll see eye to eye bless America this is the end of the south or not it's not that I\nThink they um yeah it's the God of the Bible says I Love you may have been preserved or how will All right so um you know I always\nLove when people bring up a birther and a separate center on the conversation that just\nI mean people here's the thing I Love all our listeners I knew we agree with you know my point of view or my asking the questions um but when we look at the whole situation like I say I'm a radio talk show host ... my job is to\nSee what I see posed a question to give my opinion I gave his most affected that I Know and then I'm going to act logical question I Am an independent conservative I'm old civil Republican but at the end of the day\nI still things have to make sense to me right now with this situation that we're talking about\nAnd I hear all the rumblings but what's most surprising\nAnd I have to say this I did not think radio talk show hosts news anchors to Rogers would say the answers he said before we went to the caller well that's the problem Joe ... a lot\nA lot of this process has been talked about with her taking the lie detector test you\nAnd she was in her sworn testimony she said it took all day she was only asked two questions she was asked is everything that you have written in this to be true and she said yes and pass the lie detector test that was one of the questions\nMakes we tell the full story she was asked to question but before you get to those two questions they have to prep for you to make sure she was not ... she had to be she ... she\nWas there is no way she did not go through the the typical process\nSo when the lead to them because they have to figure out what what did you learn and they don't they did not give her baseline I'm about questions in order to do we have much to me that if that doesn't hold up there the okay but that's\nWhy a lot of people were passing it on so then she gets into the uh the hearing and the uh the sex crimes prosecutor asked her is everything in your letter accurate ... and she went in and she adjusted her letter\nMhm she's changed your story ... to me\nThat lose a lot of credibility into what she's saying I agree and and and I think that's where a lot of people can come out in like ... you know it it 'cause I Want to believe her 'cause I don't want to not believe somebody who comes\nMore going to have evidence but only like ... right right and then it got back to ... in so many other women have made a\nBra once you allow one time right one time about something so through the bus somebody's life job you know what I'm saying man who whatever people would not believe you know and that's why I say it made me question\nHer her ...\nBut ever people would not believe you know and that's why I say it made me question her her being a doctor her being well educated having money why in the timing let me get up to the phone lines are eight six six five\nFive one nine nine three three Bobby lucked into love to bake\n...

a good morning we have the Facebook Live stream going yet again\nYou can check it out you can go you can find me on Facebook just type in Baylor I'm the first name that pops up we got something really important to talk about the day that I'm really excited that came as a result\nOf a conversation that I had yesterday right it was a conversation that I wasn't expecting\nThat I didn't know what happened um and then it ended up happening and eat it\nFor ... and then I had yesterday right it was a conversation that I wasn't expecting\nI didn't know what happened um and then it ended up happening and it it really changed the way I looked at things and it was based off the conversation that we had yesterday right we have this conversation yesterday\nAbout going going for your goals specifically going for the success that you want in this life and in doing so also you know finding that balance finding what you what you need to do what you want to do but you you\nHave to find that balance and in finding that balance you have to not care what people think about you because the whole part of finding that balance is again not caring what people think\nSo in having this conversation which dreamed it live on Facebook we did it on the radio and\nI got a very moving response and a conversation ensued right and I got permission to read this on air I won't give the person's name I'll just say the name is Glen and we talked main Glenn talk for a little while and so Glenn sent me this\nMessage yesterday he said\nI listen to your broadcast earlier I'm fifty five I work at a job I hated for twenty five years I took early retirement to take care of my parents I feel like I spent my whole life in service to others and I keep thinking when is it going to be my turn\nI Know in the end I Will have no regrets being the responsible child and taking care of my parents I just wish I'd follow\nI'd followed my dreams and hadn't been held back when friends talk about their exciting trips I see photos of their homes and I think I could have had that\nIn that's discouraging and so Glenn basically brought up this idea of ... you know the deeper message behind that I think is how do we define success because Glenn basically saying\nI've been serving my parents and I've been serving others my entire life my parents my kids and I still don't feel\nLike I'm successful because I see other people posting these photos right and they post these photos of trips and cars and houses\nAnd we see these people and they're doing really well and what the world is defined as successful and they're making a lot of money and therefore they can afford to go on these lavish trips to buy these four storey houses to buy all of these\nThings all these things that money can buy and so we talked about success a lot on the show and we talked about success a lot on social media I mean if you follow me on social media at all you know that that's something I talk about quite a bit and it really got me thinking\nHow do we define success what specifically the biblical way to define success because before I tell you how I think the Bible defined success I Want to tell you how I Would define success and this is through a biblical worldview right\nI think that Glenn who sent me that message is more successful than most of the people\nRight than most of the people that post about the cars and houses and the trips I think that Glenn is more successful\nWe weren't to provide a wonderful experience for all the time through our doors if you'd like to start

I really want to talk about I Will always bringing in right now and I will try to live stream that\nAnd that really touched me yesterday like me and Glenn ended up having probably\nA thirty minute conversation about that right a thirty minute conversation and I was telling him don't be discouraged you spent all your life in service can you be more Christ like than spending all your license service\nThat that that's what Jesus did right he came and he served others and he served others without complaint and without worrying about himself he came and it's been a short time on earth are saying I'm going to do this\nThis is the man that is the savior of the universe\nPerson the more powerful than any king or any dictator anybody ever will be\nAnd what did he do he came in he washed the feet of those around them right\nHe preached the people that nobody thought should be preached to\nHe went against is fair to say cool idea that religion was up on a pedestal and that religious people are better than other people in state and talked to the gym piles who the Jews were not supposed to preach to they weren't supposed to receive the word of God he preached that entitles\nHe preached the lepers\nHe went into the places where nobody would go he talked to the people that nobody would talk to I Can't remember the specific story I Can't remember the these specific name but I remember the story of Jesus going across I Believe it was an ocean right and the other side of the ocean\nAnd police somebody I Know I got biblical scholar Henry on line ones who are correct me if I'm wrong but and that's no joke injuries very intelligent when it comes to the Bible but Jesus went across the water right and there was this man\nWho had been who had a demon inside of them don't remember what specifically what specific store this is I'll find it during the next break and Henry doesn't know but there was this man that was\nBelieved to be a demon inside and nobody talked to and everybody said that guy's crazy we we're not going in there we're not doing that he lived amongst the tombs right our modern day version would be he lived in a ...\nAnd nobody talked to and everybody said that guy's crazy we we're not going in there we're not doing that he lived amongst the tombs right our modern day version would be he lived in a graveyard\nExcept she didn't live in a graveyard he lived in the way tombs used to be set up er tombs used to be in this cave like structure right you've seen them you've seen pictures of them even if you haven't gone to a place where they had structure like this you've seen the idea that you used to walk into this thing and it was just covered place and they're just bodies on top of bodies on top of bodies\nThat were in these little things it's it's a similar concept of what we have in big cities where the there's these big buildings and they simply pull out a drawer and once you're dead you get plopped in the drawer enclosed like that\nJust as a side note I never want that to happen I don't want to be in a drawer my whole life\nThat I don't want to but that's a sign of Jesus went and he talked to\nThe guy living down there every once and it was crazy that nobody wanted to talk to\nCan you imagine that\n... and look at the lessons that taught us look at what we do we go and we talked to the people who are the most hurting the most broke or the most afflicted and our society\nWe have a whole groups of Christianity that are dedicated to going to prison and talking to violent felons not just people that you know the stole or ah or had drugs or something like that ... talking to people who committed murders of three or four people\nMurder five people six people some people you have people that dedicate their whole lives to going into the jail it's following that teaching where he went into a place where this guy was afflicted by demons and she walked in he looked at the guy and he essentially said this is obviously a paraphrase he's a demon get out\nDeem and leave him\nAnd if I remember correctly the demon went into a group of pigs that were nearby and then the pigs ran jumped off the cliff\n\nJesus ... is wanting to drive that thing out of you\nWrite\nJesus cause you to help drive that thing out of others\nThat makes you want to do with things that aren't productive for you right he wants to come and he wants to teach he wants you to teach and\nI think successes defined by following his teaching and then going out and sharing those teachings in changing the community and that way and driving the demons out that way it doesn't have to be a literal demon can be a metaphorical name and\nWhat are the demons you're facing\nWhat are the demons your parents are facing what are the damage your kids are facing what are the demons your brother is facing what are the demons that anybody in your family is facing\nAnd how do you drive them out right\nIsn't that what successes have you known that somebody's been struggling with something and you just said look I got a lot going on I'm just going to stay over here I'm going to work on this worldly success you can't take the money with you\nCan't take the stuff with you can't take the Lamborghini whether you'd be really cool if you could jumping that Lamborghini and drive all the way to heaven but guess what you can't\n\nIt'd be really cool if you could take that private plane and fly it all the way to heaven but guess what you can't and guess what it also doesn't does that that plane that car that house you can't sell them and then turn that money in to get to heaven quicker to get to have it on a more expedited route to get to heaven maybe when you don't deserve\nIt the only way you get to heaven is they're following Jesus Christ\nHave and maybe when you don't deserve it the only way you get to heaven is they're following Jesus Christ\nAnd when you follow Jesus Christ and when you believe in what the Bible says you followed these works right true faith produces actions a tree that is alive bears fruit\nTree that his alive unhealthy doesn't bear nothing right the tree that is alive unhealthy bears for and that fruit is not only the fruit of the spirit but it's the first success because when you're following Christ and you're following what he says to do\n\nYour being successful by the very definition that David gave Solomon again in first came to three do with the lawyer God commands and follow the teachings obey everything written in the law of Moses then you will be a success no matter what you do or where you go\nNo matter if you're the top of the mountain\nOr in the cave where the bodies are where the guy that's crazy are considered crazy by this world the person that's deem inflicted\n\nNo matter where you go or what you'll do it will be successful he followed up I think that's a really really powerful message we're going to get to your calls when we\nCome back eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three and I said all the time and I don't think people really think that I mean it because of a president that's been set by other people\nThe lake and came up to him and and I told the legion to leave him there was a legion of a varmint of a\n... what we call them are uh some new your spirits are they are falling angels mhm and there were seven thousand of those\nAnd in him alone ... he called himself a legion of legion averages about the reason why and says seven thousand is because there's only one group other than saying that is\nSatan is by name will perish burn from within his guilt twenty eight ... you can read and how he his demise goes but now in the fall in angels there's several thousand\nAnd they immediately once crush the hit now our seven thousand men fall into the streets of Jerusalem mhm\nThat's seven thousand that will come where say in and they roll the of course they don't mix with the uh\nWith with the clay you hire and in the ... the do not mix so you know uh they're never going to be friendly to each other they have no liking for as they hate us you know dangerous all they want to do is have sex with women and thank goodness there won't be any children born up because they won't be here long enough ...\nYou know a lot of people than she was seven years which was short and the short and I want to get to the fact of pleasing God I'm going to be I don't want to get off on I'll let others that are going to have stuff is not going to tell you too much and but once you learn a lot more you can get into stuff like that yeah but what are you every day you should bless God and he will bless you\nThat is one thing you want to do right never never acquire ill gotten gain or else you're not going to go through that needle gate that need okay is that gate that they had it was a smaller door\nInside of the two main doors and the camel had to crawl through on his knees and everything on that camera had to be taken off of him so\nHe uh he had to be unloaded so you've got to unload\nAll of your gun games before you get in the habit well why\nIs your works mhm you're right just acts you want your works works\nAre the only thing is we take with us and you are judged we are judged by al works were not judge by our faith\nWe're judged by our works and those works make up our clothes are crispy white linens and I plan on having a little bit more than some are boxers [laughter] hopefully I'll be doing it right\nBut you know on the last\nLady I I Am very as I Am curious I Do have a question uh what do you think about the idea a then people say or my faith not my site by um my faith not by works they do now\nThat is something that I've heard that's been precinct Christianity the Austin amongst the variety of sects of Christianity um and I was wondering why there seems to be a difference in what they're saying and what you're saying don't misunderstand ...\nNext time asking where it is Matthew I'm I think it's twenty five ...\nGoing to make me look it up I don't have [laughter] lifting but ah yeah Christ is the one is to it\nUm I think it's twenty\nFive ... you kind of made me look it up I don't have [laughter] I think\nThat ... yeah Christ is the one in ... it's a revelation also okay the only the the people who make it\nOr or or don't have to go through the second death of the spirit mhm that second death is the one what we're talking about the lake of fire yeah a diverse death is those some of us\nAre it's basically like a Christ judgment ... you're judged on one side of the paradise or the other you're in the woods a rich man or you're on there with the poor man that's in the arms of a Abraham\n... but on the other side you know he's the poor man's just burning up over there because you ever get that way when you know you're messed up just burn up all over yourself\nAnd then he runs a drink of that everlasting water and you can't get that so everybody from Hitler to everybody's over on that wrong side of the Gulf ... a loop sixteen\nYou could read about that that devising a loopy in a medical doctor and he ... he puts uses the word the chasm that's an ear you cannot cross\nA only of course Christ did when he went back all the way back to those prisoners ... and that's who I spoke with and some of 'em were were were released at that point you went all the way back to the eight or ... and Peter\nThat are ... that he went back in so many of them were then breed but on the laws I Want to I don't want to be brought in and out of time yeah the laws are important most of the food was a very important people\nDon't ... don't listen to these are people that are going to teaching nothing but the traditions of men which make boy the word of God we have the commandments or the law ... then we have statutes statute statutes and then we have ordinances all blood ordinances were nailed to the cross with Christ\nOr everything from circumcision to animals sacrifice anything that draws blood\nNo longer exists Christ has taken back tries said I'd change that one of the war we have the law\nNot one kid all I wanted to John John we have the law\nAnd statutes of course they can be changed and they aren't some British takes care of some of those things on it for a night to throw tears when we have grades and\nYou must forgive but not be forgiven yourself so much the laws on rape the laws on murder all those laws\nExist you don't want to steal even that when most people can figure out and uh don't say that God don't exist don't take his name and bang then is emptiness or nothing that's so you don't want to say a God\nIs nothing or doesn't exist most people think it's a good old GD and uh that's how you can get in trouble with that one again\nIt's just ignorance it's bad understanding and not getting the full translation yeah so when it comes to the law read the law on\nThe how we eat and basically ... I could surmise the whole thing I Do not eat scavengers a pig as a scavenger\nA vulture as a scavenger Iraq as a scavenger anything that's a scavenger a captive sorry folks I Love 'em to strap a bomb I Gotcha I still am sometimes [laughter] but God Knows arming them but it's not a sin too so\nBut it is a senator your body to your health and it will cause you to live a little bit longer or have a\nA crappy help that's our bodies were not changed after he gave those laws that our bodies in the same as they would have been now the condition of the earth is different we have a heavier atmosphere of the earth is a a lot different than it was when ... lived to nine hundred and\nYou're atmosphere of the earth is a a lot different than it was when there's a lot of lived to nine hundred and sixty years old\nSo you know and he ate as God told them the\nAnd that's why one of the reasons why do you live that long plus we have the ability to live that long so remember the laws they never change ... Christ said it and change one ... that that's a that's a turtle is a a mark\nOn the Hebrew where it changes the pronunciation of a from a are\nTo from car to\nCalf mhm you know can be a cap three main [laughter] you know I mean it it has a line over that yeah that will kill any way that you know the laws not change many people are really messing up a lot of good Christians who are going to win the first\nTwice problems are going to run like germs thinking are going to do all these great things but they don't really know he's the anti Christ and he is kind of\nThomas everybody's going to fly him away no such thing\nIf you're going to put on the body armor and you're going to get in the field at work then you'd better stay in the field at work until the real crisis get here and if you're going to put on the body of water you got to be ready to fight right with saying and you have that she'll the truth and you'll be in the um the the\n... of the head armor of truth in the shadows of of\nUh oh gosh I'm forgetting that but that when it gets rid of his firing Dutch drained kids poison or any of our enemies poison mhm we could drink poison and we can handle them as they are the papers they are ... so that's another false and it's a it's a a idiom\nIt's a he brands and these people get a good teacher\nI I met one day I might teach about my my wife wants to be just for herself\n[laughter] we always appreciate your calling in and helping us out in ...\nYeah well just you know you don't have to believe me but studying yourself you know that the law statutes and ordinance every blood ordinance\nFrom putting a a ... and all through your nose or your ear ... ah took ... remain of slavery in the house and be part of the family that's not a no means say that's part of the family and then uh circumcision is up the heart of the flesh any more All right I'm Out here on your entity that uh\nSomebody was probably a saying you got to get out of your ...\nNot shut up shut up shut up\nNever Henry that would never have a pretty good though rather well you'd have a good day man you have a great day always lottery she\nHad eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three again that's eight six six by by one Ninety nine thirty three live from ... studios Alabama license one eleven twenty the wakeup call don't go anywhere\nYou are listening to the wake up call\nRaised in Alabama educated at John Carroll Sanford university you a B and Birmingham School of law you've seen my face on thousands of billboards but did you know that over twenty five thousand of your neighbors have trust to me when they needed help the most", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "07"}
