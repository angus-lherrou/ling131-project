died so far we've got chairman Terry life in on the line now the chairman of the Alabama Republican Party\nOr if you'd like to call in and throw a question to the gym and a number of non for one one zero one one a gym and thanks for staying with us\nLook let's look at a couple of specific Rice's perhaps um and of course the you know the the big one in the room is the governor's race a governor ... the uh\nPrices perhaps um and of course the you know the big one in the room is the governor's race a governor Roy they use the uh food most popular governor in America which is which is just fantastic\nShe spoke last night at a yellow hammer awards event\nHere in Birmingham ah she was inspirational a ... she spoke very very well unlike other politicians including won't Maddox she doesn't trouble with the huge entourages just governor will I be standing at a title are trying to everybody in talking voted with everybody becomes pause\nHow are you feeling going into the uh uh ... for governor\n[noise] well if if our folks will show up if they are motivated and that's something I'm always concerned about is complacency road or we're gonna have a good night on November the six but that still that big yeah um you know one of the challenges in it and having such a red state and I think Alabama's been rank the fifth\nMost conservative state that Gallup poll I I'm going to call that without because I feel like we're the first\n[laughter] I Would think so [laughter] I think it just seems like that and you know nowadays if you feel something that must be true thoughts feel like we're number one\nPart of the sudden but very accurate or in the last few years\nWell no but but but let's just say we're we're top five I think that's fair to say ... one of our challenges is is is trying to uh get people motivated and not sit back and go you've got it all like I'm I'm a big sports fan especially college for um\nSports and whatnot that without champions\nThat we all love champions everyone watches but champions don't rest they don't go oh I've I've got the cost of all our one that I one of the blue ribbon or you know I was first in the track being or whatever on my team was what they do is they go back and they say how can I Do that or\nHow can I Do it faster how can a fix my mistakes what did I met\nAnd that's that's like a champion and so I work with a group of champions across Alabama and they're called patriot they're good how are ya not American citizens that say I love my state I left my county I care I just came out and the founding fathers gifted us with the greatest gift\nIn in ... in in mankind and our history on planet earth with with the democracy with democracy with the bill of rights to the constitution\nWas American ... that's one of us are\nI mean it's one reason the group the caravan as we call them is you know we're trying to get in it you don't see any of us trying to get out the ever tried it in writing and so we have a great team of people\nAnd I'm really just citizens patriot ... says it's your neighbor it sure your your relatives ditch your church folks at your school friends and and we we just think that conservative policies that and so but on the flipside of that that's the good days the flip side for us\nIs not to be complacent and say oh we've got it all oh they don't need my the I don't think it's got its more worried to back in\n... yes and in fact is if any thing right now with the noise that we hear from the resist don't across our state in pockets now it is it pockets of Alabama but it is they're across our nation that we need to um\nPut put our nation put our state first and and not our complacency that is always my number one fear\nA lesser grounded I agree with you wholeheartedly you know or ... or ... or seen the ... governor why these opponent a wolf as he works from ...\nAgree with you wholeheartedly you know I've I've seen the ... governor why these opponent a Walt ... a couple of charm tried a couple of opportunities to sleep you\nKnow you you you know just better than or whatever and seen him a couple of times he seems the mayor of Tuscaloosa seems to be much more liberal than he lets on now is that we just uh seeing something or shouldn't see or is that would that be an accurate description\nNo I think that's an accurate\nDescription not because I Want it today or you want it to the people want it today I think it is way to get\n'em when he says out loud I'm so glad George from this group that money to packs of guide me money I'm so glad that happen and when he says I'm pro life that one of them that too\nWhich simply stunts Alabama's alive state there is no legislation on them to tell you there's no laws that are trying to please\nEveryone don't let Planned Parenthood has been a million dollars in Alabama television a digital radio\nAreas like that that's\nThat's like nature right there on the corner that as I said when he\nRight when he when he looked at you and tell them to you guys but I'm pro life but he turned right around and he gets he gets in with Planned Parenthood and and them fighting us\nThose wart works main things and that is totally contradicts\nContradiction to what he sang us look at us in a statement so I think what people will have to do is use your gut instinct on there what about this is not making sense when I see him standing up at a press conference\nWith I'm senator hang Sanders who's right or rented a purple Buss really vote or die stickers on it and\nI see him standing next to Doug Jones who we now clearly see\nIs is less progress that we see the money Chuck Schumer helped him get elected he's a truck shoot what do we think I mean I I just tell everyone you know what Alabamians are smaller and is there going to see through this a absolute a show they're putting on\nYour government know trim and we have a cold or Michael is on the line Michael you have a question for Jim and light them\nGerman ... and this is Michael hope you're doing well Claude you joined the show you should I question as an Auburn fan do you think it's a coincidence that the Republican Party adopted the Alabama or finish its mascot\n\nOkay now they there was a ... I I Would rather have asked me about\nLike you know Russian collusion ourselves as Michael are you going to get in trouble here but let me just say yes I Am an ...\nGulf War and all our role hard\nYeah yes go ahead we'll get satellite but I'll go ... you know the color red is of the party red is sort of are adopted the Republican Party and I wear Nelson on it all the time and so it it I get a lot of teasing for over a firm sees me from Alabama friend\nFeel it in ... what is not the government is doing these things that people it's the people when you implement a you get you vote that's\nThat's the first step right the officials on the first step of voters or the first step the voters or the board of directors they determine which way our ship is kinda got and when I go to the voting booth and do that in it and put in conservative Republicans not liberal Democrat\nThis is what we get this is a simple I don't know that it could be a better cause and effect\nYeah this is what happens they can do this is what happens is is this thing over here well this is what's going to happen and I guess voters just has to make that decision do they like what's happening or you're better off his Ronald Reagan said you're better off now than you were a year to four years ago I think the answer is pretty much yeah yeah\nYeah I should have paid more attention in college I Would have gone that whole cause and effect or a thing [laughter] now see them in a one could do much longer term we\nGeorge Soros this Boston today or a couple of days ago he pouring money into when we Planned Parenthood to wall medics and other Democrats and pines\nYou know I read in my view so correct but he's put nearly three hundred thousand dollars into the medics combine surely\nA you know ... that money is going to be spent on you know getting out the vote in those more liberal areas sort of around Birmingham man broke a ... you know where we might not normally vote but you know he's going to spend this\nOr you know there's two hundred thousand George Soros a gold coins uh uh trying to get people to do\nOh but you know he's going to spend this uh you know just two hundred thousand George Soros a gold coins uh are trying to get people to do to vote\nHow much you do think that we have on Rice's down the ticket like I'm Talking about in Jefferson County in some of the other counties or you know how much your big blue\nA state wide get out the vote campaign to these like ... with George Soros is money have on those rights as\nWell I you know first of all I think I heard that Mr ... put six hundred thousand dollars hole in the packs now\nI don't know I haven't looked to be done on a date that um where at all when I'm you know he's that's just play money for him so and that's kind of like mind blowing but\nThe fact that the battery is I I don't know how they're going to spend their money and I don't know what they're going to do but I'd really like to think and I really believe in my heart and just watching what's going on in our state how how wonderful things are for folks that they're that Alabamians will show up\nAnd maybe regardless of something they saw on TV or something or start running across did it all you know they'll look around and go gosh things are things are going really well in our state\nUm the national news is seems to be a very loud because they're on a chair gets Donald Trump and they're not going to adopt one seven so um I don't know how they're going to spend the money but I'd like to think in the day the server to policy when people walk in the day that that that's where they're not plant themselves\nRegardless of where they live in regards to how they send them\nOut and we hope you're right now just one last thing to ... we touched on this the when you first joined us you know the cooling now the great pretender would senator Doug Jones no influence bleak for\nKnow majority of Alabamians certainly folks listening to die or the when I saw how who and just trial or was that his treatment of no justice or Kevin uh uh you know an incumbent I did not vote against the judge who was I hardly hardly qualified jurors your\nSenator Jones went against the will of people in Alabama how can you justify back Buddhist and what what what is the endgame here as he becoming a shoe for Chuck Schumer so we can get a job on CNN or MSNBC and to use\nIt seems like it's in game is to come back to Alabama senator he liked it yes thing I mean I I don't know what kind of housing leads to the hasn't they say that I Would have found anything more than six months at a time look here's what he did he went on a and you anybody can Google it are you to that he he didn't\nThink he went on national TV on CNN and my job and a lot of other people that too and he said uh well um when asked by national news reporter also don't you think I mean we understand that the Georgia of Alabamians want you to vote yes on a half an hour\nAnd you're going to vote you you're going about that and he said well that might be so but it's not the end all today off\nNow listen to the work that might be so the majority of that might people might want me to but I'm not\nAnd went further out later on several days later he was saying that my staff look ... thanks we came to the ocean so he and his staff right so he's governing free stuff\nYeah it's not even thinking Alabamians are going hey hey overhear us up on you know center shelving or why he's always had it right on the topic\nAnd ah I think that John could uh learn a few things from the states and I'm Richard Shelby\nYou know center Shelby why he's always had it right on the topic\nAh I think that John could learn a few things from the state and I'm Richard Shelby on when it comes to things like this for sure but I I just um look what you got ... at night and I'm going to work across the aisle he would you call it along with\nInteresting and the album still off a goner circumstances we found herself and Annette right but yeah that that's not what he's doing\nHe's a real a real sick this\nYear he's a true believer I you know my uh my day job I have a a governor ... ... ... the Bush thing we started to potential clients who potential candidates are and we even have it as a ... going to put her account these candidates matter\nAnd uh you know we saw this play out you know we put Doug Jones had mislead\nA but even once they be candidates matter and you're going to be sort of get report you saw a little bit I guess but uh now before we let you go which we have to do because we are because I'm getting the law from a big dive\nUh uh what's your predictions for the house and Senate and can the Republican Party hold the house\nWhen I see CNN last few days I'm Talking about well wait a minute\nMaybe the Democrats want won't take the house over well wait a minute maybe our numbers are wrong to me that signals the getting a little soft in their messaging and so I I think we pick up in a Senate seat in the United States Senate\nAnd I I have not bought and so that we're losing how we're seeing record turnouts around the nation and early voting and\nAnd the Republicans are crushing it in early voting that I I think this is a narrative the national news that they think they say over and over and ask you that maybe we'll country you know what they were wrong it twenty sixteen\nMother telling what's wrong and everything they threw out of this wrong and so I I I think we are we going to lose some we are a lot of us have been redrawn\nThat's one thing

the radiation the uh the a tactic sure the uh\nUh what was that middle one is called the red devil\nAnd uh she had those three horrible kind of on edge you know chemotherapies but the bottom line is is I was even\nDon't want her hair started falling out she knew she couldn't get me on me to cut that air so what did you do if she calls my youngest son who's already bald headed and she came out shaved but ... but I saw a real shock girl I'm more into something that uh she would go anywhere to speak to anybody\nBut ... but I saw a real shock girl I'm more into something that uh she would go

fundraiser for you a be a radiation or a radiation or on the ecology\nAccelerate research where there is in doubt professor professorship named after her ... and this is a ... a girl that that when I

said I couldn't do it either I Would kind of freaked me out anyway they would share of Mike Hi all in the studio right now called the number is non for one one zero one one non for one one zero one one if you'd like to watch the share of the question a sheriff\nI got so\nJefferson County isn't just Jefferson County as we understand it dried it's no that's wrong orders of Jefferson County you go or like it's what nearly twelve thousand square twelve hundred square mile\nAbout that a thirty eight cities and towns are I think uh twenty eight a different a ... a law enforcement agencies are so it's a it's not just like a single city in single jurisdiction and it's the one that as you know Greg the criminals don't\nGive a darn about the boundaries city limits and they use that against us but uh but it's a very diverse area a great place to live as you know I Know you've fallen in love with their since you just love it he's yes yeah absolutely ... so that's going to be what a million people or thereabouts\nYou know the metro areas but it's about six hundred and forty four thousand in in Jefferson County okay uh I Would say about four hundred thousand or a registered voters usually about\nTwo hundred thousand will vote in elections okay so yeah it's a it's Britain they do\nWell I can I ask ... Oh yes\nYou can send them to know about it [laughter] to serve I oh I was ... I was so glad to see that you're helping some of the smaller towns out well by giving the communications I ... a friend of mine\nIs the chief of police in a Lipscomb yes and a good guy would yeah oh yeah very nice guy have called him for advice on a few things yes super nice guy and he's that way with everybody not just me\nBut I Will make it out there and then he will yeah and the the funny thing is is that you all had some surplus or something tell us about\nThat well we uh [noise] as you have to upgrade radio systems we've had a great radio system in Jefferson County\nIs kind of like the use of fiber optics or digital and we were forced to uh to the county commission or it was just best for us to a\nTo change out if we ever wanted to get into encryption and things like that ... we had to be able ... not that we are but uh we had to change our our radio radio system radios heart you know the actual ...\nIs that part of the being compatible with all the I just\nExactly right that's the only ... and ah we had some of our older units that we just had and really we didn't have a use for them and they're going to be a good Robin for another ten or eleven years and uh but of course we changed all of our\nAnd really we didn't have a use for them and they're going to be good probably for another ten or eleven years and uh but of course we changed all of our is outside of the art but the bottom line is you had a smaller jurisdictions\nThat had to make decisions about whether or not this county the city government was going to renew and rebuild their own individual systems or they were going to they're going to be a part of the Jefferson County system\nAnd ah this allows them to be part of the Jefferson County system\nThis allows them to talk with each other talk with these ... there's there was a deal that are gonna be call that an any emergency you know whether it be a tornado right or I or ... or a timely Los ... we saw on TV today they're going to be what I Will switch over and talk to our ...\nWe got out of the closet but I ... I wanted to have some by you know hope all these\nCitizens agree with this if you give somebody something it's almost like well it's not worth anything\nI Want them to buy into so we're doing half the programming yeah they're doing it brought that it's good and that's awesome so we're just going to get a break and we'll be right back with you a pile Colin non for one one zero one one [noise]\nWith ... and when we created that Ninety nine but ah now we've shown the national trend I guess would bark when where I looked at and I know did you say that Parkland is that uh in in Florida was the ... he did not know where to go in or stay or go in well you know what\nThat changed the national ... is an expectation that once we're there we give you body armor we give you the right well weapons would give you the right avenue should we expect you to go in and disrupt the shooter\nAnd so what I and also the national conversation was we want somebody in every school\nAnd and the national conversation talked about\nRetired military retired a debt these are our police officers or to volunteer I wiped out the volunteer because that that's just not going to happen right what what I did do is I went I partnered with the Jefferson County commission a partner with uh the school board and I parted with adjusted personnel board\nFor funding in permission because they were American system\nAnd I've got enough by and that now we have a deputy in every county school there was no more soft targets with elementary schools that's covered now what does that mean for the ... district\nWhere do you call them all or to go swimming getting ready for the next caller\nBut what that means is is that we can set a good example for some other school districts like a Hoover is doing\nAnd like Fairfield by the way he has signed a contract with us to a parochial school district they won't one of our as rose I think that's a giant step forward I think that's the right way to do business is so Katy appreciate the question because uh says some point in time\nIf you expect you to have the leadership and division\nAnd to develop the partnership with other agencies\nTo get the job done and that's what my dad he's done and that's I think that's the case of ... will go back to the Mac and just a second we got a couple of by the coal is supposed to Larry you're on line one Larry you've got a question things going thanks where\nHe is or share if this is Larry I live in a Hoover I'm a big supporter of years and I think you're doing a great job in\nA have a son out of here Larry and Hoover [laughter] well I Hope it never pulled me I'll tell him you know he's dead\nBut uh yeah I've been reading about the Mac and ah and I'm Still I just think it's amazing what is it gets so stove piped here in Jefferson County and people only\nCare about their city or their area but you found a way to really uh bring everybody along what was the secret of that how are you able to bring some of these folks because of the crime reduction that you have experienced in in ...\nIn the last year and a half has been a unbelievable and I think ... national recognition I over that and and and uh and and so it's just\nI Want to to does for what you're doing and and but I'm curious to know how did you finally get everybody on board to to do something that uh uh you know it's so so so innovative is is this well\nThat's a that's a great question I you know being in it a I've been here since I was elected in Ninety eight and a a made a lot of relationships and a lot of partnership like with my buddy chief Nick nurses out in ah Hoover and\nUh made a lot of relationships and a lot of partnership fly with my buddy chief Nick nurses out in Hoover\nAnd uh to cook over chief over mountain broke or Tim Raul sin home would it's just it is is is relationship driven but a lot of times projects like the metric crime sooner\nOutstrips the ability for the local jurisdiction to fund\nDoes that make sense\nYou know what happens he died booted lair okay what happens [laughter] ads are asked for Larry David yes [laughter] and\nThe sheriff has a unique opportunity to step in and and I don't mean any disrespect by this\nBut just be a big brother to understand what the needs are of the other communities and have a desire\nThis part of your DNA to won't Hoover to succeed that won't mounted brute to succeed to need for the city of Birmingham to succeed so the vision\nIs easy to come up with and when they trust you I'm Talking about the different cities than they will buy into it and I would like to do list this vision\nWe didn't charge 'em a dime for we ... we wanted them to bring a detective and there are there are reports in highly that's just like ... are kept him woods over in ... you want him to do good out their absolute goes the better\nThey do there the last you have to come into that community and do stuff and how about this you've got other places that you need to be how about if twenty seven\nOh the police departments are all bored with me at the back you tell me where the criminals are going great [laughter] and they're going to the one that don't exactly right oh we got one more call before the less the camel line for hey Kim thanks for calling or you have a question for the sheriff\nYes I'd like to say something to to Mike hell if I can I mean I'm a Democrat and I'm a liberal but ah about ten years ago I had a debilitating mental illness and I had gotten violent and chased share Stefanie came out to my house\nAnd the amount of care and the amount of compassion that they showed me it ... it was astounding they made sure I got to a hospital in jail they realized what I needed um and I\nJust got to tell you we just because of his alone that's the way the ... for you every time you know the gentleman they did not learn this compassion without the help of you and I firmly believe that that shows what kind of leadership that she has and I just wanted to say thank you for your um\nYour welcome and look I'm I think I'd be able to take a step further\nIs I inherited basically a white male dominated a sheriff's office and it's just been my absolute privilege to turn the sheriff's office in to warn that reflects a community it's not about being a Democrat and it's not about being Republican surely that's maybe that's the case on November six\nBut the service component of the sheriff's office is not about that\nAnd it's about good training and it's about serving your fellow man and a man and woman but uh it's just an honors or my guys love dude it's a great jurisdiction\nAnd uh I just appreciate your kind of comments I trust all of my I got close to seven ... seven hundred and blow away six ... six hundred or enforcement\nBut I trust them all I won't any of them become in my neighborhood and deal with me\nOh we're seven hundred and blow away six armor six hundred on ... but I trust them all I Want any of them become in my neighborhood and deal with me at my very worked on trust him I Know they're trying I Know the compassionate another part of the community you thank you so very much\nSheriff Kim writes a good point and you do to us as we go on to break the ... all the elected positions in a city or in a county or state the\nOne that should go to the best person for the job is sheriff is too important\nFor it to be caught up in political mumbo jumbos if you're the best guy and you're Republican I'm to vote for him but also if you're the best guy and you're going to take my family and

advertise on Scott basins job because he was questioning some political correct thing and that's taboo he's supposed to just shut up\nAnd Americans are just supposed to do what they're told don't question these things this is the new\nMorality\nSo I think all those advertiser for that and it's it's an important thing that is going on on this program and other programs where you and I can\nActually asked the question law enforcement law enforcement source is confirming that one person has been arrested in connection with the packages that were set or we now calling them packages\nI'm Still here just just letting you know I'm Still here you're here nobody came to get married because of the suspicion address and I'm Glad I'm Glad that you're still here I noticed that

it [laughter] so why do we wait a minute hammer well watchers go what happened to I don't know if somebody get it I think I left it at home and you probably did it as a matter is just get here when you can boil it we don't need watch with only was just\nSo happens we decided now that the packages calls yesterday they were\n\nWeren't they bombs yesterday or yes they they were and they were ... devices the day before that right there just packages now is that is that serious I'm asking you our company that I could just\nI'm ... and their packages because if they are moms\nLooking things that will not explode when they're not bombs\nWill just be very similar to if I took a um\nA pop tart\nAnd out on it until it was shaped like a gun and mailed it to you\nThat I really ...\nYou know little ... the both of the money to where he was at the house and we were involved or [noise] and he started go play bang bang bang\nI that's why that's the way it is it's a boy they're going to do so so

welcome to the program\nHey Scott how are you doing Hi Stan I'm doing well how are you doing I'm doing well we're going to talk to you about the spam bomber yes is that what we're going to yeah well ... not really made it just made up a little parts it looked like me so\nI'm not buying on the thank you can't we have a different thing a different name\nWhere there's little park bombs was not really bombs um I wanted to ask you know the demand that they're supposed to have arrested if heat from northern Florida a which tends to be conservative Republican territory\nI I Can't I Can't tell it said that the implantation Florida is where they're covering the van with a ...\nI don't know where plantation Florida is but I'm telling you this than I don't doubt me when you see the van yeah this is the stickers on the van if they weren't put on the week before last\nAh I'll give you twenty bucks or ... this this is what I Will want you to consider okay but the man is supposed to be from Florida okay\nBut he but he cannot spell Florida and he is ... ... when he comes to building a bomb but he is perfect and finding twelve people's addresses and having them delivered to the correct address\nA ... that tells me that it's not a a good old boys from the south that tells me that someone inside the government inside the structure of what we are called the deep state\nThat they're pulling the salt they may not be house bladder but you you can't tell me that a man that cannot build a bomb that goes off but he can find route addresses to have to protect\nDid have ... and I'm having a hard time saying finding is kind of like big big news two days then people started saying hey wait a minute or these even these even really bombs not that it would scare anybody to have something sent to them that looks like a bomb then we start having reports that say well they\nThey may not be bombs and do some of the stuff that's inside of them is not even explosive where are some reports I don't know\nAnd and I'm looking out here at all the usual news outlets\nInside of them is not even explosive where are some reports I don't know\nAnd and I'm looking out here at all the usual news outlets and where where are the comments about whether or not these things are real were literally Here's New York now it is back to packages suspicious packages so were they bombs or were they not\n[noise] well they weren't bombs and all of them all and uh I I just like somebody on the inside Scott\nAnd and someone not not only has access to the postal service without having packages streamed but has someone that can hand deliver these packages but you can't tell me some guy down in Florida that that's just to stretch\nA you know how can you begin your can deliver packages and mail to applaud on the same day that this is absolutely nuts it's an inside job they will sympathy lines drawn it's just all this is an activist and there'll be something next week\nYou think of the usually if they've got another ...\nOh yeah we got another October surprise coming\nGuy I was hoping just this one was the October surprise by staying appreciate you got to take care now there's a lot of people out there asking a lot of questions and then I'm not seeing a number of answers about what exactly has going home\nUm\n[noise] we've got the president being attacked because he tweeted out something about here it is Republicans\nRepublicans are doing so well in early voting at the polls and now this bomb stuff happens in the momentum greatly slows news is not talking politics very

waiting\nPaul welcome to the program thank you for listening and I appreciate you get in touch with this while you're on break and I appreciate you working cause millions of people in government subsidies depend on you\n[laughter] like I have two questions I'd like to ask you yes and one is of a friend in New Hampshire who calls make very articulate and she gets different news I guess yes she is really told me that a fellow named Cory Booker\nSupposedly her what she said assaulted a boy in the bathroom and tried to get to a moral activity with them and she said that a fellow so Cory Booker in a speech um but she\nMarried him and I let you lift up doing and then the federal up to the restroom quite look of England or the force\nAnd then the other thing is you don't mind set advertisements I don't know either one of them but two fellows running for office so as long as ... on the other fellow as last one was Parker and divine named finance is saying that [noise] are are\nAre aligned Lola Lola and he's like in satellite lower and lower his tail guilty of that ... that lower and lower it for almost all those women Luo a lot when they accused him and he plays for both of those and I I Will you stole\nA willpower thanks bye appreciate you listening All right the first thing let's go ahead start with the Alabama stuff\n[noise] um I think we went through the whole thing\nOf the Roy Moore in my opinion innocence and all the whole and everything that we're in the accusers stories\nThe the last one that was the most difficult was the the youngest lady and more still has suits and stuff against her and they're they're suing back and forth I Believe more was innocent the the race that you're talking about between Vance and Parker Vance is a Democrat his a\nDad was the judge I think you actually uh was killed by mail ... maybe not in the eighties yeah it'd be nice for eighty nine and so his goal is\nHe's going to lose to Parker unless he can get some of the same folks\nWho allowed Doug Jones to become a U.S senator\nTo weigh in and allow him to get on the the state Supreme Court and that it's just a Hail Mary attempt\nBecause Parker is friends than has been allies with Roy Moore and they see the world very similarly um I see the world very similarly as well so this that's just the typical campaign thing don't don't vote for Scott\nBecause he knows Roy Moore and they agree on most things\nThat does that kind of yeah that's kind of ...\nNow the Cory Booker allegations we have not talked about them very much because they are\nAnonymous claims or a gay\nMan has said that Cory Booker he was at an event with Cory Booker Ito Cory Booker how great he thought Cory Booker was\nCory Booker ended up coming in the restroom at the facility at the same time and according to this man's allegations Cory Booker tried to get him to do some stuff to Cory Booker\nAnd the bathroom we'll just leave it\n... tried to get him to do some stuff to Cory Booker\nAnd the bathroom we'll just leave it at that the reason I don't haven't spoken about it or have a hammer down on it is because they are anonymous that I don't I don't have enough\nInformation to say that is true now one thing that the anonymous person says is that he does have corroborating evidence as far as having been there having told people about it a et cetera\nSo those things are out there I Know it's surprising for some people to hear but I Try not to\n\nI Try not to go down certain kinds of rabbit trails I don't have a pretty decent information big David boats are trying to do that and if we're going to say people are innocent until proven guilty all I Would\nAnd until I get a little more information\nI just don't bring don't bring it up now would I be surprised no I wouldn't I Would I find it poetic justice for Cory Booker\nYes do I think he would even that his base would even be against him no he already admitted in some of his writings that he you know it was with a young lady and the young lady was saying no on some of the things he was trying to do\nBut he but he made it to his target anyway just groping\nAnd then he turns right around and does this whole Spartacus stuff actually saving the world I mean he's a method that he\nThings that were on welcomed by a lady but nobody cares his base doesn't care it's another great example of only we're supposed to care we have to throw people under the bus\nThe first possible allegation it could hurt the agenda for us to elect such a person and then we then we figure out that oh it's probably not true\nDare I remind you that on the whole Roy Moore thing really morbid officeholder in ... county forever we talked to multiple people on this program this very program he lived in ... county for years\nAnd said never heard any of this stuff never heard ahead of any of this stuff\nSo I mean who do we blame somebody from the Washington Post or people who actually live there and would have hurt

seem true we were we were going about Seventy miles an hour granted his power steering without so we were being a little bit cautious and I didn't time is on the way back we drove all the way out there and maybe we took a weird on ramp or something but I just know that we got there and it's a chewy town next to Texas and I was like wow this took a while I'm ...\nThe way out there and maybe we took a weird on ramp or something but I just know that we got there and said shui town next exit and I was like wow this took a while I'm shocked that you drive this every single day what's how many are coming through a is a busy time it was like it was around lunch hour\nSo it wasn't like a rush hour type thing but there are people emerging on and getting off one exit later kind of you know like lunch hour ground\nWhere we are coming from Birmingham Sanford\nOkay so you know I went to the junction twenty fifty nine and then to your town exit\nThe words you're saying we're very confusing to me so I'm just going to say yes and we're going to go with yes\nYou got on the interstate yes sixty five new or yes and you got on the other interstate yes\nThey need to Utah to cool okay\nYou ought to some weird 'cause I like Fifteen minutes maybe twenty from Stanford I don't know\nMaybe we're just so drivers his power steering was also going out he could not make any turns he was great it straight line so the interstate with were great but or\nAnywhere off the interstate was a real struggle and it was like a newer car right so it didn't have the steering wheel or it could go all the way around and you could just essentially without power steering you could still make the turn at some point the steering wheel just said no we're not going any further\nAnd at that point it's like Mm what do I do because I'm going straight but I Need to go hard left and so we eventually got there safely he didn't hit that many things now I'm getting he admits he'd had anything that we reported the police no I'm saying he didn't hit anything\nAnd we made it to the garage and we were very safe you\nGot there are safe and sound but I don't know I was just thinking about that because I was thinking wow you make that drive every single morning\nCan't be fun maybe we went to a different accent I don't know all I Know is\nIt was in this area called middle town or something like that as well as the midfield midfield yeah see I was close middle town midfield and is that right near us down\nThat is the area a few economists right off the interstate\nAlways\nBaffles me [noise] because Timothy draws not that old [noise]\nLike he certainly does not outdated crack and cocaine which is what he's referencing a new song like those are definitely those have been around as long as he has so I missed back when what when you were a forethought and your parents have like what the what do you miss your Tim I'm just a little confused\nI Can't be the only one of the things that I mean I like the song it's touched don't get me wrong but less somebody wrote in Eighteen twelve like I'm just a little confused as to what it means [noise]\nI mean has anyone else seen the show narco was that was before tumor growth time eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three\nSo he goes back when I was so okay I got it slang terms yeah a coke was a coke nope cocaine outdated you cracks what you were doing when you were cracking jokes crack outdated you back\nWhen the screw was a screw Tim your regents wind was all that blue you know and if you've been you're down would that it meant you had the flu\nWhat in the world are we going back in the eighties hip hop now Tim I'm Down with that openness could do like what\nAm I about to come up with an oversized basketball Jersey and pants down to my knees and drop in order to\nBe single that will shape the world forever huh except it didn't listen that's beside the point\nWas that yesterday we started a university today I'm becoming an R B singer were just coming up with something new every single day of the week ladies and gentlemen welcome back into the wake up call rang out this morning so yesterday\nWere uh I went to a college Republicans many right I go to some of those occasionally they uh I'm occasionally political I don't know if you picked up on that or not but they had representative Gary Palmer\nCome speak which is really cool and uh for those of you who don't know Gary Palmer is serving Alabama's sixth congressional district Gary bomber works in Washington and his privy to some of the most a valuable information\nAnd our nation right now he's privy to all of these classified hearings that are being had over the FBI and struck in Russian collusion he's on the oversight committee and so we were talking about all of that\nYou had over the FBI and struck and Russian collusion he's on the oversight committee and so we were talking about all of that and uh\nIt's really crazy so I go to Sanford university and you'd think a small Baptist school\nIn the middle of Birmingham, Alabama would have a greater conservative movement and I don't know I didn't even know we had a a conservative group on campus um until\nYes last semester\nLast so last semester and I've been there for four years now I found out that we had a conservative group on campus and so of course I joined um and it's shockingly small and I don't know whether or not it is just lack of advertising or lack of people wanting to be political but we had\nA sitting US Senator come in and speak yesterday and I can't you know maybe ten people showed up\nTen people showed up which really makes me think\nOur people let's just say it's not the fact that it hasn't been advertise well let's just say maybe that's not the case let's just say this is just people not caring at one point have we reached in our country when a representative in Washington that talks to the top people\nRight he talks to he was there during the Peter Struck\nQuestioning he question Peter Struck alongside Trey Gowdy he was there what have we where we gotten to as a nation\nThat people won't at least come sit and talk and respect those people I mean I did\nI'm not saying I agree with everything Gary Palmer did I don't I'm not saying I disagree with that or any anything Gary Palmer that he's a very interesting a politician I like where he stands a lot of issues but\nI Would be in there if Kamala Harris came to speak it Sanford university\nI don't agree with anything Kamala Harris says relatively maybe ... point one percent of what Kamala Harris says do I agree with\nBut here's the thing she ... sitting United States senator that holds the power of a sitting United States senator and so I think you should go listen to those people's ideas especially if they're going to open the room up to a Q A and you get to ask let me tell you with\nGary Palmer sitting in front of us\nAnd nobody else around like there were just ten people in the room and it's college Republican so half of these kids are shy and are just really political and don't know what to say and a lot of people are afraid to speak up I basically got to have a one on one question and answer with Gary Palmer\nAnd it's all just because I decided to go listen to a twenty minute speech seriously somebody I'll spend twenty minutes on the toilet you know what I'm saying you can spend twenty minutes listening to us beach\nAnd that wasn't directed at the listeners that was directed more at college students but it just baffles me\nI'm curious if that's what it light was like in previous generations you know like Tim McGraw is referencing I miss back when well I I have this theory that back in the day politicians were respected and more people showed up to those events and more people were involved in the political process so\nI miss back when people were involved in the political process\nNot as catchy but I'd like to submit that lyric Tim McGraw but I'm curious if that ever was a thing still and do you think it's always been this ah I I Believe the word is apathy right this political just I'm not really caring\nIs it the right word here we're going to figure it out\nApathy is a lack of hearing yeah yeah\nI'm not really caring is it the right word here we're going to figure out\nApathy is a lack of hearing yeah\nYeah so is it political apathy of our generation\nThere's change or as political apathy benefiting from generation to generation to generation\nHonestly from every report that I've seen it's less of a thing among our generation than it was a previous generation\nReally so engagement you believe is actually gone up\nFrom the EU reports that I've seen yes\nThat's a very interesting idea because if this is up this is pitiful like\nHalf of the people are on my campus I guarantee if you go up and you ask what are the three branches of government\nNo answer absolutely no answer it's it's very shocking and it's not something I I I don't\nEverybody tends to put these things on the education system right they tend to say oh the education system isn't teaching government therefore we have a problem and the education system needs to teach government I don't think that's the case in all honestly I think it's people really and truly not caring\nLook because I hate it when I see somebody that goes into a class right they don't listen to the whole time they don't give the teacher any respect and yet they complain when they fail the test\nIt's like at some point there's a there's personal responsibility the teacher can't take a hammer and hammered into your brain right they can only give you the information is your job whether or not you're going to take that information and\nI think that's what a lot of people\n... that's the case with a lot of people I mean people are given this information I mean people like Gary Palmer come to speak to college students\n\nLiterally outside of their schedule that he didn't have he doesn't have to do this we're not going to be the voting force that gets him over the edge you know to get him back in office he doesn't have to do this but he chooses to do it because he believes in the process so much\nAnd people just\nThey don't care and some of them that show up they don't listen and then there was something else that was incredible last night\nWe were sitting there and so afterwards he does ask for a picture right it doesn't ask for payment for speaking like he would if any other organization and ask him to speak he doesn't ask for anything only asked for his picture so a lot of people go down there but there's some people\nThat just don't want to go down for the picture and I get it some people don't like having their picture taken but that's just rude about it too like it's the only form of a mini asked for and he's like a can I get a picture with you know and they're like no\nI'm like okay alright are like what does that hurt\nI don't care if you're a die hard Democrat right I don't care of your as left as they come what does it hurt getting a picture with Gary Palmer\nIt really doesn't if if you think it hurts to get a picture with a senator that disagrees with you a little bit on some policy stuff or a congressman and the gaze of Gary Palmer that disagrees with you a little bit on some stuff I Would\nPush you to evaluate your thinking All right we're going to go on these phones eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three we're going to happen to Dexter on line one fixed or how you doing\nIn there you're doing this for better now deserved extra how about yourself\nOh man I vote up like a show dog on a loan and\nI knew it was kind of a man I was going to\nA sort of weird I Know I Know you're talking about are the people didn't show up a little town all vying for your call or whatever\nThey didn't show up a little town of buying all or whatever\nYeah well he uh he came as ... as beat the college Republicans and nobody showed up really only ten people did on Sanford stamp as\nWell but a lot of that is a whole\nLot of younger people of all I Love your twenty five point three\nIt's just nowadays a lot of people do they were say well you got to go to college you got to get a degree or there's a lot of people out here that are manager of the grocery store managers up different kind of trucking companies that have a degree that in physical education you know\nAnd that might really good money very but you could get a job badly because you had a degree it didn't matter what it was saying you know are they allowed the allergy or something like that mhm but back like you were talking about ... ...\nThe great didn't matter what it was an ... you know are they allowed the allergy or something like that mhm but back like you were talking about ... back in the ice sheets stuff that's when technology really\nCallous started taking all yeah and all that technology will get out there in about ... show you know what you can do very true\nBut you know a lot of people on and the politics 'cause they're not thinking about future ... my dad used to always get might put it in the bank save it you know save and save it if I had a quarter for every dollar ... plant in by I wouldn't have to worry about doing it I\nKnow yeah I I'm a I feel about one hundred percent\nAnd he was talking about Gary Palmer your mom or a British smart man it's good man you know there will be about country mhm uh\nI've I've met him before and talked to him in it and I mean he's staying straight forward it could be oh yeah I think it's really good representative and like ... or somebody that you could pay attention to\nA one hundred percent he's definitely one of the good ones and that's what struck me is that you know sometimes politicians you can listen to him speak and you can tell you know they're putting on that mask they're putting on that political mask and they're going to tell you exactly what you wanted a year and he didn't he told you exactly what he thought um and what he thought\nIs what aligns with a lot of the people who is constituents um ideology and I really appreciated that that a politician was willing to be so forward and not just pandering to people\nI I mean first and I thank you the truth you know like like one in\n... yeah very true as well in in you know yeah very true but\nWe need more a rec centers like that and if they don't get out and vote your ... the guy in that way my\nThat Harry Potter and that's what he said he said look we have a team mentality right now you got to get out and vote we can't have this voter apathy where it's like oh you know we were doing good right now it's just going to stay that way he's like because if we lose the house and we lose the Senate it probably doesn't stay that way because we're just going to be stagnant\nUh for the next two years maybe until the next elections come around\nYou know Trump doesn't do everything I mean Jesus Christ what what like jaded ... him grow mhm you know ... I don't not compare him to it\nBut you know you're not going to find somebody to please everybody down crashed I first and complain about every day I mean that's ... yeah yeah\nThat's our edge to it and if with these people don't get out and vote as young people like you and stand up you know and that's what next time they go low like oh say way what happened\nYeah and that's what will eventually happen especially voter apathy stays the way it is right now it will just be a slap in the face to those people are like my generation who are just you know kinda apathetic to it to go you know I I don't have any reason to get out and vote I'm not going to get out and vote once they realize the things that will happen to them\nThat's when they'll get a slap in the face when a lot of people I don't think realizes these are the people that are making decisions for you right these aren't just decisions that are affecting a far off land that will never touch you these people are deciding what happens every single day in your daily life and how government intervenes in it\nYou know like you said you you were talking earlier you were going up huge town you said you went through middle child mhm well that may feel there I'm just going to pay you need to get out and explore your neighborhood a little more\nAnd through middle town mhm midfielder\nI'm just go hey you need to get out and blow your neighborhood a little more more than one way to get on the interstate or GPS\nYou know oh yeah ... ... and you need to find that ... suit shortcuts good when the interstates do love dance you always had a back up there well I can go through here and I don't have to stay in this lab or an hour and half full ...\nYou know oh yeah which I Know I fill the time or two on sixty five here in Alabama\nI used to the highway from here to Texas in every interstate from Twain here in Birmingham I mean ... ... am to John Hunter Texas I've been off and I know how to get it right you know\nThat's awesome that's been tested\nYou know when you get out and travel\nShe learned more not complaining or I'm not first in but that's what hit me you should you didn't know how are you where are you ... you were in Middletown and that was huge ... yeah you know you need to take the neighborhood and go around and find a new place every day if you get a chance\nYeah that sounds actually we've been down here they are doing today\nIf you made a good mechanic going down to ... go down there to mold brothers they're the best and honest is you can buy\nSounds fantastic I appreciate your groups are\nSaying that when you got more time in my\n[laughter] thank you dig always appreciate it always appreciate the wisdom let's go to Mike in line to Mike how you doing the bone in rather good morning\nOh well oh God I'm\nMy senior year in a nearby that government major missions gift limit was tired Airforce mhm any was hard I mean there's more people than my own pay anything\nThen found has by us especially if you had any before before his class how did you dress out that in the ...
