they don't seem to understand that but they certainly understand\nHow to what to say and how to get in here illegally but my my feeling is that they have no respect for our our\n... and how many cases Chris there are a lot of their relatives are already here illegally\nAnd they've been here for years\nSo the relatives call 'em up and say just get get here and you'll be able to stay they're not going to deport you get here\nMight as well ... second cousin twice removed ... uncle aunt or adult children could get it come on I mean they're they're not going to send you home if you don't violate the law once\nYou're here and even then you might be able to stay so I mean people don't know what's happening here and they're taking advantage of it I mean that doesn't surprise me at\nAll if people knew when they got to the border guess what you're not going to come in and just because you bring a child doesn't mean you're going to be protected\nYou will be sent back immediately we need immediate border turned backs even to non contiguous countries that has to happen\nEight five five forty Laura ... do you agree with me I Am so\nTired of this let's go to Susie in Nevada online five

those who is paying for the ...\nPeople coming from a Guatemalan on girls if it costs five to seven thousand to get through Mexico somebody's paying for them and their downtrodden people so\nYeah I don't know who's paying for some in some cases and you've heard stories of this people traffic themselves\nThey they actually traffic themselves they pay a debt to the human traffickers with our own bodies\nSome of them as the border agents told us on the angle last uh was the last February and march some of them just abandon their own kids in the desert\nThey just leave their kids there\nOr they leave their kids\nAre where the border\nSome of them just abandon their own kids in the desert they just leave their kids there or they leave their kids\nOr where it with a border patrol agent and run that's happened to\nMost now they'll know they can just stay with their kids so as long as they have a child or a miner or someone who's related in some way\nThey'll be able to stay and then they're released and then they don't have to come back for hearing this is a way to destroy the country it's a way and it's\nHave a country three hundred and ten million people one in five births in the United states today according to that story that we saw last week is to an immigrant twenty percent and we have twenty million\nAt least illegal immigrants in the country are and when you know the ... people who are here the uh other people who are we're allowed to stay from El Salvador and hurricanes and mudslides\nThe temporary protected status that that the president sought to undo\nThey've been here for decades and many of them have children so we have our stupid birthright citizenship which we also have to get rid of huge problem\nBut I've been a broken record on this I Know I'm On my board with my own comments about this because I've sent him so many times let's go to Scott in Arizona Scott go ahead\nLaura what I'm Talking about is the border of order farmer in\nTucson who have cameras that was posted on the Drudge Report of just thousands of people crossing the border as well as cartel fully\nFully armed up camouflage bottom you know black bottles and they don't get caught it was just like and they see this but no one does anything about it this poor farmer finally put 'em all these terrorists they look I'm tired of this you know this is where the deal is I Want to do something [noise]\nOur Congress is letting our people down that we know the Democrats are just going to welcome in more of it but why should Republicans be standing by allowing this to happen you have the house in the Senate\nNow [noise] do something about it so you lose the house you get nothing you gotta have nothing but it's going to have a a wholesale invasion of the United states going to keep going\nMore and more and more and then you have all these we the reports on MSNBC they don't do the Wi Fi reports on the victims of violent crime by legal immigrants they don't do those stories but they do the we'd be stories south of the border of all these people are sitting on the concrete with their kids playing with you know a paper doll\nAnd you the people are supposed to have your heartstrings completely uh polled by the emotional manipulation of the American media\nThey're emotionally manipulating\n\nI Can't stand that kind of reporting it's the easiest kind of reporting to do and it's the most dishonest\nLet's go to Paul in Virginia very quickly Paul\n... build the wall is going to go down as Trump's you keep your doctor\nIs done nothing on his border here he has failed miserably I don't care about Korea or trade deals or anything he lets this continue on this country is not we're never going to get anybody elected you're going to have the Elizabeth Warren\nAnd the brokers and everybody'd be elected in this country to his killing his country by not sloppy and I have to put the military on the other side of the border and stop that\nWell I think a lot of people agree with you and you see these you see this\nI have to put the military on the other side of the border and stop that\nWell I think a lot of people agree with you and you see these you see this massive invasion imagine if the people who claimed to be reporters were actually reporting on this like really reporting on it not just talking to the the the Seventeen year old who has two or three kids is a\nPoor person I get that they're desperate people I Do understand [noise]\nWe we feel for the people who are being manipulated and hurt into making this track but we are Americans first we must must protect our border otherwise adios America [noise]\nIf you suffer from E. D. and you've seen your doctor about the little blue pill you know can be expensive and seeing the doctor and waiting at the pharmacy can be a hassle\nYeah it's a key race Stacey Abrams has received a lot of outside money a lot of outside attention she's become a darling of the left and you just heard right there she is truly a progressive candidates saying we welcome undocumented\nOf voters people who are legally allowed to vote in this country to come out and my race I mean that's just not something that we should be\nUm accepting as citizens and she's also saying I'm going to raise your taxes abolish ice all the things that the left as putting forward and it's a frightening prospect for the people of Georgia Brian Kemp would be a much better choice and he does have a slim lead and I'm hoping he will pull it out\nWell I think again this is about the future of America a we have Elizabeth Warren of course the great progressive savior and the Democratic party are coming out today with this DNA test a where she claims that she does have [laughter]\nAncestry a of a Native American sort a initially\nReports were that she could be one thirty seconds Native American but now there's a\nThere's a there's now a Boston Globe\nQuestion about whether it's really like one one thousand given the math of how far removed her\nNative American ancestry could be yeah here goes the report includes the possibility that she's just one one thousand twenty fourth Native American they just put that correction on the Boston Globe store\nYeah I mean I'll tell you one thing she is a hundred percent not qualified to be our president where she would take our country it's frightening\nAnd it's interesting to see that she's running for Senate in Massachusetts this signals to the people of Massachusetts as clearly as possible she's running for president so she's saying here give me another term as senator but I'm going to go run for president and walk away from the Senate seat as quickly as possible so\nUm I Would love for the president to go up against Elizabeth I can't think of a better contrast that'll bring it on\nThe bus like ... by this token if you if you say you you know your part Austrian and and goes back ten generations you get to claim nobility status and\nThe Austin Austria Hungarian empire I mean is this is this really what we're going to do now to get special privileges in colleges and universities I think this is what drives people crazy\nAnd it's offensive to Native Americans I mean it just is so ... and she doesn't apologize to them for you know capitalizing on their true heritage for her her benefit and and that's really the bottom line of that says that he's pushed that forward for benefit for her career\nFor her education and what she's one one thousand\nTo ... [laughter] I'm Sorry this is funny now Donald Trump was asked about this or on a on the south lawn of the White House before he took off for Florida let's listen to\nAnd\n\nA ... no no no he went on to say he hope she's running for president he hope she's running for president he went on and on about that that was the least interesting part of the uh the White House lawn but nevertheless he was he was like well I Hope she does Ron because this will be an easy way out for me\nAnd on about that that was the least interesting part of the uh the White House lawn but nevertheless he was he was like well I Hope she does Ron because this will be an easy way out for me\nYeah I Hope she ends up being the nominee I mean what Democrats are putting forward now the progressive left Democrats\nWill change our country and and we did a video actually recently talking about what socialism actually means and the cost of it\nBecause Democrats keeps saying free health care free this free everything and they're not saying this world quadruple your taxes it will destroy our country go look at Venezuela get educated on this if you like the country that we live in today with a with economic opportunity with prosperity with wages coming up\nA Democrats are not that people you want to vote for\n'em and I have to ask you about what the house looks like I Know it's hard to predict every races is different but\nDid anyone predict at this point that the Republicans would be frankly making a comeback it looks like in this midterm election cycle\nWith the Kavanaugh a win for Donald Trump and he turns around and I think he fights for for Kavanaugh unlike anyone else and now the people are like\nThe ... he's the best clothes or we have this could actually help in the house races\nIt could it it is helping we're seeing that in our data obviously they are in the U.S put a huge ground game and place we've trained twenty five thousand field organizers that's five times more than we did\nWhen twenty sixteen to turn out our vote to educate voters to talk about the results are there's a lot of house races in the balance there's about thirty so the house is going to be neck and neck I think until election day I think that every counts\nTo determine the majority and then the Senate is breaking our way uh in North Dakota and Missouri\nI was in Indiana this weekend with my run I mean the energy and the Senate sides great we could definitely pick up seats which is unprecedented in her mid term of a first term president so I feel good about where we are Kavanaugh\nHas definitely energized our base and I'm seeing that in our mail I'm seeing it in our fundraising all across the board it has put a good choice in front of our voters do we really want with the Democrats are offering obstruct resist the smear campaign\nThe the search and destroy it all costs or do we really want a party that's putting forward results that are helping average American families\nAre run

legislation at the border stopping new application of asylum at border entry points instead of doing it in your home country of ... what what are you asking the Republican Party to do to stop this this madness I mean we don't have a wall\nAnd now we have more people just flooding into the country\nThe president has let on us and you've you've heard signals from the Senate and the house it they're going to look at funding for the wall\nDuring a the race or during the time between this election in January they should I mean I think about what these kids are going through these poor children are being dragged across Mexico to our border they're being put in very dangerous situations oftentimes when they come in to the United states there last\nWe have a human trafficking problem this is something that Democrats should be working with the president to solve they don't um and it's going to\nWe have a human trafficking crop on this is something that Democrats should be working with the president to solve they don't um and it's got to take Republican leadership to step up and solve this immigration problem we have a serious problem at our borders and we have to resolve it\nYou know we have to resolve it and of course everyone's heart breaks for the children who are as you said put in danger by taking this long track\nA but the American children the American people

what we're going to see again at our southern border just in time for the election uh your reaction to the um desire for lawlessness on the part of the left\nYou know but no doubt about it or it's great to be on with you a real about this for a long time now the political violence being advocated for by the left and now it's being carried out by this group of thugs and that's what ... is there not the embodiment of\nFascism I'm I'm Sorry they're not the yeah they are they argue buddy middle fascism\nIn America in defense of the a foot line officers of the Portland the they're under orders but I've railed against the upper echelon of these police agencies\nSoftness with which they're handling\nAt the end when it shows up they show up prepared for battle they're not counter demonstrators they're not counter protesters they aren't in search of SEA Group an anarchist group and a police state to be more sort of early on\nTo keep the peace\nDefend like to keep their officers safe and it's not really going on once the crap hits the fan so to speak or then it's too late so\nI think a different strategy of more of a sort of strategy by the Portland pd and all throughout the United states is necessary because we are at the states now and I I've been seeing this for two or three months using the term political violence of people in the lift up and they laughed and said it was hyperbole no it's not no it's on\nAnd this I'm a patriot prayer group that was holding their rally and they had one a couple of months ago and it and to flip did the same damn thing they showed up\nThis is I'm a patriot prayer group that was holding their rally and they had one a couple of months ago and it and to flip did the same damn thing they showed up prepared for battle they start fights they like conflict\nAnd like I said a the police are there to keep the peace not let this stuff happened not been but don't break those or fail strategies\nAnd until they make it clear\nWith a answer for that their antics are not going to be allowed to go on under the guise of protest because this is not protests I'll tell you what what irks me as well as when a commentators I'm not talking about you but there are commentators are on the right who continued to refer to what\nAnts a foot and some of this other political violence is when they're shutting down uh an intimidating people in a restaurant they keep calling at protests it's not protest it\nIs insurgency answer for calls for the\nKilling of police officers they call for the down fall of the United states lawfully Institute of government\nWell and I know anyone who calls that legitimate protests doesn't know what they're talking about it it's it's intimidation uh it's it's a type of\nOf political extortion too when they do it to the senators and and the elevators I keep saying sheriff Clarke why is this even allowed in the halls of the U.S Senate why should why should people be able to to get within a centimeter from someone else's face and scream at them\nIn the in the halls of the uh the capital that should be allowed\nRight and but see these groups they realize that not much is going to be done about it and I write you know senators and another congressmen congresswoman to keep their decorum but then some of this is happening to a private citizens for instance said Trump rallies for instance just this rally held by the\nPatriot prayer group or in Portland, Oregon and I've been saying for a long time to\nThat we have to have more effective counter measures and people say well what does it look like and I can tell people what I Would do and I don't advocate for what anybody else to do but I tell them you're going to think about this now you have to have a plan because they view turning the other cheek\nTaking the high road walking away they view that as a sign of weakness and like you said lord you hit the nail right on the hit this is designed to\nIntimidate and incite fear in people to get them to alter their their votes for public policy that's why I'm calling this\nPolitical violence it's gone on for too long it's gone on\nToo far and and the more that you let this go on the worst is good I mean we should have learned this from the sixties which is the\nThe anarchist movement that I studied to know what they're up to to know what their antics are and also know that what they learned out of the sixties law enforcement meaning of what they learned was that those soft masters just lead to more people getting hurt\nMore people getting killed more property damage and they we I Would like to think that we learn that that doesn't work but we are committing the same mistakes or in law enforce\nI agree and I think we're seeing the same results and we'll get into this and just a moment sheriff Clarke at the border with this new caravan caravans approaching the border or so we'll get to that in mind but I Want to play something for you this is from Donna Brazil on ABC's This week and and it was on a panel with Chris Christie and others\nResistance isn't that about ... [laughter] about people who do not want they help their cooking away about women who want to be listening to when they feel that it's time to talk about their prom a sexual assault there isn't that about mob\nThat you're running to maybe this will be about but when we listen to what the Democrats were coming on TV or talking about is about impeaching Brett Kavanaugh talking about a meeting Donald Trump I and the reason is taking the feel I agree with Rick Silva mob\nI eerie action to that last statement on it\nDonald Trump I and the reason is taking the feel I agree with Rick Silva mob\nI eerie action to that\nLast statement gun in Brazil you know but on Brazil\nOr not too long and we had a great conversation and she told me the true she said the stuff happening on the left is wrong she knows it's wrong but see they don't have the courage to call it out when I hear people like her and I hear others not denounce this violence it is a mob and she ought to just admit it but like I said she doesn't have the courage\nShe saw the backlash when she came out with her book that really took the or the DNC and the Democratic party to test and she saw the filter blowback realized she better scurry back on the ... plantation and that's what she did it at the end of her\nHer a book tour but I think that's what she's up to again she needs to exhibit leadership people in the Senate\nYou're not going to get it from Maxine Waters with others in the Senate\nMeans exhibit leadership we call this crap all for what it is to tell these people to knock it off but what they do Laura's you know or their tacit approval is comes from the silence and if they do see anything like they try to make that well it's not a mob it's really about health care no it's not she's trying to to frame of narrative\nAnd um everybody knows what she's up too but they do it with a wink and a nod when when they try to uh when they're forced I should say to say that ... and some of these other goons this I'm a feminist movement when they're pulling their crap\nYou know they do with a wink and a nod when they go well yeah maybe a little bit but you know their their silence give tacit approval to this political violence\nOr and share of Clark before we let you go ah the\nDemocrat Stacey Abrams and other she's running for governor in Georgia saying that they represent both documented and undocumented um people in this country and left a whole bunch of other groups they claim to represent a and now we have this is mad a\nCrash about to happen again on the southwest border with more caravans of people showing up because you know we basically are just now releasing people who are coming over with the children\nBy just as dangerous to continue they meaning the left they continue to push the envelope on their stuff she doesn't represent undocumented anybody or citizenship is you know means something in this country they're diluting the meaning of citizenship and want citizenship means is that all the rights and privileges\nAre in the constitution or belong to the United states citizens not non citizens so they're actually taking the citizens of Georgia what she's doing the the residents of the state of Georgia and she's making them second class citizens\nAnd again on this Congress must work with the president both on the wall and of course allowing for immediate turned back at the border sheriff Clarke otherwise we're just going to keep this this keep happening and it's going to be an entire a migration of\nPeople from Central America into this country I completely illegal not wanted by this country not why by the people but just because they can and they know if they cross the border there no one's in there and no one's going to make 'em leave\nWell they're gonna have to be turned back but I think there's going to be a moment of truth that really is\nA terms of this administration I support the president's policies on immigration or illegal immigration and you know it is you're you're right it's the Congress who has not\nMoved on that same on the geo pecan Congress I think they squandered an opportunity here who knows what's going to happen in November but they squandered an opportunity to straighten out this an elite this broken\nOr immigration system to finally seal the border that's the first thing that has to be done everything else that that people are proposing follows sealing the border because if you don't steal the border we just saw last week we're still a guy committed some\nIt has to be done everything else that that people are proposing follows stealing the border because if you don't steal the border\nWe just saw last week where some guy committed some heinous act against the United states citizen of beating has been deported six times lore six we've heard stories of people who've been caught that have been deported\nSorority times that's not a made up number but the ... the borders so poor or easily or they can easily get back in Seoul no it's a matter of um you\nKnow the eleventh hour and and I don't know if we're going to maintain the house I I I Hope when I say we the Jill ... I Hope they can but if they don't all this stuff is off the table but Democrats are not going to allow that wall to be built they're not going to fix this immigration system they're going to give citizenship\nOr to some measure to illegal aliens amnesty I'm Talking about and you know of course we have a president that will put a block on that in the Senate will but at the same time we shouldn't be fighting the battle right now we squandered a GOP Senate and house squandered two years for heaven sakes with a very\nA strong\nPresident ... arms of stealing the border and immigration a broken immigration system they squandered it so this is what we're left with\nOver the last\n[noise] maybe\nA little ...\nThanks very now [noise]\nFamily I\nMean\nYou can try to shelter in the army\nOr lean to make a lifetime from\nI'm from around the\nW. windy enough I'm Coleman W.
