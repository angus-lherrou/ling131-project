hear the stories we're following at this hour to keep you in the now we begin tonight with hurricane Michael this storm continues to gain strength as it bears down on Florida's Gulf Coast residents of at least eight Florida counties have been asked to evacuate by tonight\nAs a category three storm is expected to make landfall tomorrow\nBeaches here are bearing crews have already started stacking up beach here getting ready to store it\nThere's also a double red flag warning\nWhich means no one is allowed in the water and that's probably a good thing because you might be able to see but I mean the water is starting to get rough ad that storm moves closer now people spent yesterday basically boarding up their businesses and homes in Franklin County which is about Ninety miles east of here\nIn Tallahassee people stocked\nUp on supplies like water and they also filled sandbags and eight areas late locations that were set up across the area gas stations have lines of cars are also waiting to fill up some places even ran out of fuel\nFlorida governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency in thirty five counties and as President Trump for assistance over in neighboring Alabama governor Kay Ivey also declared a state of emergency and from the air you can see\nThat President Trump persistence over neighboring Alabama governor Kay Ivey also declared a state of emergency and from the air you can see the long line of cars and ... cutting out of Panama City beach yesterday schools also across the Gulf Coast Syria or closed\nAnd many of them will remain closed across the week that this particular area we're expecting anywhere from six to nine feet of storm surge but just to give you an idea of the reach of Michael\n... they can get two to four feet of storm surge and that's about two hundred miles away from where we are right now\nAlmost the bronco reporting tonight Hillary lane is in Panama City Florida where residents are bracing for the worse\nThan we spoke to a lot of people in this area this is a mandatory evacuation area that we're standing and that are staying put and for them it's all about getting the supplies that they need we went to multiple supermarkets last night and water and places like Walmart superstar were completely sold out along with red and peanut butter and then if the ... the necessities\nAnd then some sort of didn't have generators didn't have flashlights so for the people who are deciding to stay here\nUntil about having a supplies they need to ride this out and then for people that are leaving we saw them putting sandbags along their homes to make sure extra water does not come into their home they want to protect as much as possible and then another thing people are doing it's filling out their gas tanks yesterday at the local gas tanks around here\nSixty to Seventy to eighty cars deep people filling up before the storm comes to making sure they're prepared whether they're saying here or heading out before the storm comes in\nAnd do you get the sense Hillary that people are are listening to governor Rick Scott in evacuating\nI think every hurricane you have people on both sides of the people here ... ... even in the mandatory evacuation areas people that are here right now\nThat they're staying they say they've written out other hurricanes before there are different reasons you know we spoke to a woman here she says she has two elderly parents in wheelchairs it would be just too much to take them out to take their medicine take all their breathing supplies and travel with Mao and another woman\nSaid look at my car it's completely beat up how am I supposed to drive somewhere and then pay for the gas weight in those long lines to fill up so some people are saying but they do have reason that of course like every storm you have the people who say I just wanted to see Mother Nature an action I just wanted to see this happen\nAnd then of course people are heeding those warnings again we're in this mandatory evacuation area we just spoke to a family there from Kentucky they were here in Florida for the kids fall break there were so excited to have a nice calm relaxing vacation they got here yesterday and on this morning told the kids that they have to go they said if it was just the adults they would stay but they're\nNervous with young children so I think it really depends on the person but officials especially in these mandatory evacuation areas want people to know that this is a dangerous storm and they want them to leave immediately\nWhile I'm so surprised by the people who say I want to see Mother Nature like go watch National Geographic this is a serious storm I I just don't understand why anybody would say that at this point Hillary\nExactly but they say they've done it before and it's gone well for them and they they're risking their lives and they say for them it's worth it and even though it is a mandatory evacuation police can't force you to move out they can't physically take you to they say they're saying and that's what they've decided\nHillary lane reporting from Panama City Florida tonight names are being floated as potential successors the

probably just supposed to go she said you know maybe at the end of the year the end of a two year period but at the end of the year I wanted to take a little time off a little\nIs very important so now there is no personal reasons I think that it's just a very important for government officials to understand\nI haven't given everything I got the last eight years and I do they fit somehow discipline to rotate\nOther people who can put that same energy and power answer when\nPresident Trump says he will pick a new and that you're over the next two or three weeks ambassador Haley also says that she has no plans to run for office\nFor all in here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty I can promise you what I'll be doing is paying for this one

I mean once you couldn't stay quiet\nBecause you wait a second she's talking about Trump's behavior right and she's starting about Trump's policies we don't have to like say oh this is Jeff he's interpretation versus ones interpretation when you hear from say things\nLike call a black woman or a dog or when he says there's a whole lot of people do it all I think there's a lot a lot of history and a lot of stereotypes that's invested in these comments would resonate with people and so\nGuess what is he playing to the base is she right Jesse come on and she's telling the truth or Hillary crooked Hillary I'm going to\nGet it was so stupid I mean I'm not going to make fun of her because I I Would you didn't really feel bad for no one in our life can tell her to stop the should be between Hillary in her Frank\nBut what I'm struck by is ... like she sincerely believe Trump got elected because America is terrible racist voted for him there are a lot of racist and the actual truth as she got elected because she and people like her did a really bad job running the country was a message to her and people like her\n... what you have done the decisions you have made have been deeply unwise and hurt America and she can't recognize or learn from it none of them can that's the frustrating\nPart you know she's very politically blind and she doesn't accept any responsibility for that last at all and every time she pops up and says something I Believe this reinvigorate the Trump is\nWe haven't anytime she talks we ended up doing a segment about it because until the Democrats have\nA new leader um until they go through their painful primary that don't go through a little bit of an odd years well then as Greg says it should be a very easy win for president [laughter] or if it's a ... um\nI also think that this is her leading up to a movement that she is going to continue to push and that is to abolish the electoral college ... and you just say things like we know that this is not the majority of America we know this and they're all he's only talking to those people those people who live there and this fight\nAbout the electoral college that it's coming in our lifetime and the next ten to Fifteen Years is one is going to be the most\nFascinating and I I don't know I I'm I'm really interested in it and you ...\nThe next ten to Fifteen Years is what is going to be the most\nFascinating and I'm really interested and you pick up along the way they're going to try to\nDo it as like the losing see him in the world series they lose and they want to get rid of the designated hitter knew those rules\nLooked at her attack a racist Texas anti gay and I think she might be projecting\nHillary racist was he refused to travel on the same playing with Michelle Obama that's probably racist or sexist smear all of the of our husbands alleged victims that was worse than any man do I would say that was\nA anti gay I think Trump was for gay marriage bill well before she decided to be for gay marriage\nIslamophobia wealth in she blaming God's got a movie which conflated all Muslims with terrorist activity 'cause they were just regular Muslims who just happened to get upset so you think about Hillary as racist or sexist strict Islamic law but could you anti gay she's a deplorable person\nNow this next story I'm bringing up because I had Oreos last night the mini Oreos and Oreo is coming out with something even more unique for those of you who enjoy the cookie cookie that you can Duncan milk or [noise] you know if you take it apart and eat the inside out like some people do I don't know [noise]\nUm so it's constantly changing and recently Oreo has come out with the birthday cake to celebrate Mickey mouse's Ninety is\nA strawberry shortcake or Oreo is even making Halloween candy this year but now for you cookie lovers Oreo is coming out with a huge Oreo cookie basically double stuff and it's like two big cookies on top of each other\nIt's perfect for my sugar free diet that I have yet to stick to [laughter] big Dave likes likes the big double Oreos yes so I just thought I'd share that\nI'm not sure when they're going to come out um but in case you just can't get a cookie big enough to satisfy your taste buds there you have\nIt now I never see really anything bad what is going on a large we've never seen you eat sweets you don't bring in chips you I'm not talking about working out what we do eat anything bad\nAll right well we'll see I did see an ad I'm the first that I saw with a governor candy I like it was a picture of her behind the desk when she was very young um it was kind of a kid at that time and I didn't like it that way when\nShe she's not when she she wouldn't be a good old boy in which she should be a female to but I'm sure a teacher for probably goes back to school a little bit yeah uh you know um which which I was raised from and have always\nUh you know going back to you you always go back to your roots and everybody went to go home\nMhm at one point All right well thank you my friend yes ma'am machine high pine shah\nHang on to say goodbye and throw\nA I have to clarify something that I said that was wrong\nAll I Know and she said that was wrong about the song\nAlso ... I don't know why I don't know either but I I I knew what was wrong but it wasn't even worth bringing it up oh it is when I was given out my nose but I Know you know your music\nI don't know why I said that though that just drives me crazy I I don't know where my brain when does\nIt for now how do you say his name Williams for no Williamson alliums yeah that's OK and thinking oh go ahead and monitor [laughter]\nYeah brutal war didn't sound right to me to the old crow medicine sure they're interesting song I heard this morning about rain stopped in the uh stop in the store I'm going to look for that what it was\nCalled the deplorable staying the Fox news just won't let that go a Hillary misspoke and uh but uh but you know it's a\nReward hard on her GED on Hillary well outside of Charlotte joke recalls or or just a big day patients tonight or voted for Hillary a you know Hillary's difficult woman but she uh yeah yeah\nI called ... or ... oh yeah I mean she read it you know and have pine Charlotte\nShe uh yeah yeah\nA call ... ... yeah I mean shoot me\nAnd you know in a tape behind Charlotte's interesting about Hillary is it's like she's had a couple of lives because I remember when she was running when\nBill well not she was running but when Bill Clinton was running way back\nMember she she came off too strong and I remember back then she just didn't resonate with a lot of women and then it seemed like when she you know her husband ... and people started feeling sorry for it and she was born in New York then she had favoritism again and then\nKind of ... yeah well you know all all that\nMay be true but there's a lot more going on than just a America is one big sitcom in Hillary does have some substance you were to well she gave a fantastic speech in the Vietnam War era she's friends with Taylor Branch you wrote the\nTrilogy on the civil rights era the Pulitzer Prize winning novelist she campaigned for George McGovern who was the ... the big Lance uh was on the right side of history buff farther preached it was just ... to George McGovern in Nineteen eighty three that's another story but here's the bottom line was the horrible thing\nIf if your station and Rick Berg us too has a fantastic time you know he talks about\n\nHow things because I'm do them once in awhile to him every time you don't start bringing up other people that are on other stations\nBut I don't even know where he was gonna say\nI Know but he's bringing up people on other stations and nobody is to not to do that\nAll right well behind Shariah apologize you seem to be making some interesting points that I Would like to hear so please call back finished your statement and a ... will leave the other people out of it All right then count welcome to the show\nUp they don't hang up on me [laughter] [laughter]\nIt's all good don't bring up all the people from other radio stations around here\nAre are there any way to get paid ... last year ... says he really didn't know nobody now\nIt may be it may be financial but you know every some people have a conscience and you know I use systems are different depending on how we were raised and big day that talks about that a lot\nYou might like someone but I like the values you know and I just think that she still wants to have a vibrant campaign to the gym for ... for politics she wants to put some distance I Do believe that the Republicans are going to take a bath\nOn the Congress not the Senate and she wants to make sure she's away from that a little bit so that when she makes or move\nYou know she doesn't have a bunch of ah\nBarbed wire hanging around her neck you know\nUsing any plans to run for ... what's your right\nShe's got some\nOh yes definitely really and she would be a good candidate to run she used to be a governor in South Carolina she had a makes you get a job for him so he has a respect you know everybody doesn't want to be part of a surface\nAnd even though you're trying to do what's right and you said that I Believe in this person but she says all the political and write things\nI think about it if you was totally happy why would you give up a job like that and I'm quite sure that job pays well I don't think that job\nIf you are totally happy why would you give up a job like that and I'm quite sure that job pays well I don't think that job pays no fifty thousand a\nYear but not as much I mean lash her and her husband combined they're making six figures then it's like ... six figures\nWell then the normal people like we are how 'bout that yeah you know\nBut but the bottom line is\nI just think she wanted to cut loose from the nineties you know the economy will argue for days before Trump you think he did it not foreign you think the previous administration did it but the bottom line is he was given a dinnertime and me and he gets\nCredit for continuing but Obama did a lot the rights that ship because what he was given what's a mess so with all of that said and all this money that's going on and what to do forget now wants to Democrats win\nIf they went in the Congress the president in trouble because they can request\nHis tax returns and he must give them they can look into all these things that what's his name Noonan was hiding from you know at hiding stuff\nThat's so much wrong with that guy out there in California\nA similar to Newton or whatever his name wherever yeah so there's going to be a lot of things X. polls that it's considered\nCrooked or less on it then it's your idea that we wouldn't have gotten away with it you know ...\nYou're going to keep investigating the taxes that he always bothered him five hundred million dollars somewhere around there the only paid fifty million why does he get a path when you were I Would be put in jail big day would be put under it'd be under there with me so so it's not about like you know disliking\nWe want people who are going to be honorable consistent and truth\nAnd I think she wanted to just sort of so\nDon't know she seems like a big supporter of the president though\nThey always do that openly you know how you do it you save face none of her closest employees knew about think about that she kept with totally close to the vet\nMm interesting\nDo everything is so great why would you do it I'll see the nutty guy\nNow she she just will then she's an actress ... now have\nYou know she she just has a value system\nYeah but she even said today you know I'm going to be out supporting this guy\nHas what it's supposed to say you don't want to look trees are more like should turn go knock you play the game I mean I Would support big day re ramp off\n[laughter] All right thank alright thank you get to a couple of ... thank you Josh\nHey how are you\nI'm good how are you doing tonight\nI'm Out standing I'm On my way helped matter yeah that's a good feeling in it\nIs absolutely a gut feeling so two things are are are you in a very stepping down and I can't remember her name is escaping you\nKnow ...\n... in Nikki Haley a I commend her a call I think they said earlier uh she said that she did her time and\nShe still is a ... step in that they have because she didn't want to hang out there all have to stay there forever I commend her all that you know she's got a family to run she did her part now she's got to go home if they were part is\nAll the power to stay there forever I commend girl that you know she's got a family to run she did her part now she's got to go home and do our part as a wall of up I mean\nYeah and I would think to all the traveling maybe see
