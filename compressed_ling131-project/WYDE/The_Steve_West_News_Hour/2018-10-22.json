All right to oh five nine four one one zero one one is the number two free eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three and pulled you about uh the apartment collapse and Clemson what happened in the NFL\nOr what's move over real quick to Trump pulling out of the nuclear deal with\nNow we don't have any confirmation on this but this is just what Trump's telling us and he or at least the administration says they intend to pull out of that nuclear deal arms treaty which was in ...\nHe or at least the administration says they intend to pull out of that nuclear deal arms treaty which was aimed with Russia during the Cold War and they came back and they said listen\nMoscow is expanding their base of nuclear weapons and that completely violate the treaty so we're going to throw it out if you don't want to make a new one will be more than happy to\nBut if we're going to have this deal in place and your just not going to pay attention to it and continue to do what you want to do why are we have to hold up our end of the deal\nThat are happening rabies and bad with Russia right this is this story and will not be widely report how it's going to have that was going to be the next question\nBut ah he was talking I guess it was late Saturday Night or he was talking to the press and he says he's looking for a new deal with both Russia and China to put a halt to this nuclear armament he says China was not a part of the original deal\nA but he wants China there'll be a part of it he\nAlso said ah\nWe're going to terminate the agreement and we're going to pull out he said Russia has violated the agreement they haven't been violating it for many years and we're not gonna let that we're not going to let them violate a nuclear agreement and go out and do weapons\nAnd we're not allowed to um\nSo he ... it was funny because he was headed off the tax is not thinking about the Texas rally will later on the show that will be tonight that's going to be one to watch I'm telling you\nHe was handed off the tax is just probably an hour or so ago when he stopped to talk to reporters and one reporter says are you going to contact Russia before you terminate disagreement he's as I Do have to do after Dr Russia\nA terminated the agreement which he doesn't need to says he doesn't eat they they they violated where you tear it up\nOn the ... civil rather than they are not abiding by what are they agreed to\nIt he said um let me find his other quote because he said something along the lines\nWere going to terminate their agreement and we're going to pull out he says that the U.S would pour more money into developing weapons if that's what the situation requires\nAnd strong arm in your way across the globe and saying I Russia here's what we're going to vote are screwed up this deal so we're going to rip it up we'll come back with another one and if you want to play ball will let you sign on to this one if not we'll just start dumping money into our weapons\nTo make sure you don't get one up on us and that's the kind of president this country needs is when it needed at the right time and do that as a sixteen it couldn't happen and a better time in with a better guy [noise]\nTough to get you a headway on the global stage not apology tours [noise]\nNot handing over billions of dollars to terrorist [noise]\nI have alerted border patrol and military\nThat this is a national emergency must change laws he said every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming in\nOr attempting to come into our country illegally think of and blamed the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws remember the mid term so unfair to those who come in legally\nGuatemala Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping the stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally\nTo the U.S we will now begin cutting off or substantially reducing the massive foreign aid routinely given to them now going back to the second tweet where he said it's unfair to those who come in legally it's also unfair to those who currently\nA an ... for their whole lives have lived in the U.S and there are some communities that are disproportionately affected by by a legal immigration one of those being the black community or outside of that poor communities\nInner cities people that are are living in places where\nThe jobs aren't as available and that's because of the the job market in that area or lack of uh transportation\nAnd it's available and that's because of\nThe the job market in that area or lack of uh transportation or whatever you know 'cause if if you're limited and having a car or whatever it's harder for you to get a job you've got to get a job you can\nEither want to or take us to take a bus or ride the co workers or whatever bicycle once you start\nBringing in illegal immigrants especially a big caravan has got eighty percent working age young males\nAre they start taking those jobs why because they will take less\nMoney to do the work than the average American will or even the intake\nSo you let these people pour in so for the people living in sanctuary cities for the people living in black communities there having jobs taken away from them all because Democrats say this is the right thing to do\nSo again shows the racism of the Democratic party because they have no problem with this issue with illegal immigrants coming in and taking the jobs\nFrom freedom loving Americans that want to do nothing but work provide for their family and pursue happiness\nThat's exactly\nWhat this is this is affecting\nThose among us those communities among us that are most vulnerable\nAllowing these people went to take those jobs and put Americans last it's not about compassion it's not about opening our arms and welcoming the people of the world in\nIts about are you going to put your family first or somebody else's family first\nAnd it's not selfish to say I'm going to put my family for\nWell we've talked about this before to think about the whole airplane example they tell you to put the mask on yourself before you put it on your children and there's a reason why and it's the same reason why we talked about this you know\nIf your family is struggling or whatever you don't take in a bunch of foster kids if you can't even support the once you have you have to make sure that you can take care of your family first before you bring in more people that you will have to be responsible for and take care of\nIf it's going to tax our economy and tax or health care system intact our public school systems\nThat I think we have a problem that we need to be serious about that and have a conversation\nWe all be on the same page if I were to say what do you think about the horror lady whose houses the lab rotated and she's got\nShe's living among Seventy five cats and she's trying to take in more I think we'd all collectively say she's crazy right she can't even take care of herself why she's still bringing in animals\nEspecially the last let's say those poor animals are just looking for home Letterman [laughter] right out no matter how much it affects her life are overrun things or causes the the preexisting cats to go through or even more trauma or headache a lotta men\nRight no compassion that this compassion for these migrants\nIt's all a sham of course and they know it's a sham by promoting this with political actors to to push this Caribbean towards the U.S to clash with the border\nRight around the election it's all politically motivated with with no remorse\nFor the people that are dying in this caravan for the children that are dying that the people that are being beaten and tortured by human traffickers that that they've had to pay to help them make this journey two thousand miles\nAnd tortured by human traffickers that that they've had to pay to help them make this journey two thousand miles who who in their right mind\nIs saying any human being\nShould be allowed to walk two thousand miles\nEspecially up to ten thousand human beings men women and children should walk two thousand miles that's the right thing to do according to the Democrats that's the right thing to do because they want to come to the U.S\nWhy the Democrats heading to Mexico and trying to pick these people up and their own cars\nThey've said nothing about the fact that these people are making this journey just the journey itself and how dangerous that journey is the Democrats aren't saying anything about that\nWell why don't they just got to the border and take some of these people into their own homes I mean some of the people that make these claims are actually very wealthy and talk about people in the last a lot of those people are in Hollywood and they make mega bucks so I mean if you fail so you know I ... towards these people don't want to do something about it personally\nOutside of the innocent people in this caravan that I think we're being politically used also used by drug\nTransfer human traffickers MS Thirteen gang members who were all in the mix of this caravan it's important to note ... and we brought this up on the show before we were seeing a surge of\nOf Bangladeshis Bangladesh nationals coming across the southern border in taxes we were getting these reports from border patrol and and they're like you know this is kind of bizarre because these are not people from Mexico or Guatemala or Honduras or El Salvador\nYou know people from Bangladesh all the way on the other side of the world's okay\nWhat's the deal now we're finding out and and I found this out through a Spanish language reporter and I don't even remember what a what\nOutlet he was with but he was embedded inside of the caravan and he was talking about how shocking it was to see so many Bangladesh nationals in that caravan and to see a people of\nMiddle Eastern Middle Eastern countries in that caravan and this is coming\nFrom a this is coming from\nCountries that that are connected to the U.S okay not countries that are across the pond or anything\nHow is this happening how are you getting we're not dealing with three countries we're not dealing with just four countries we're dealing with people all over the world that are in this caravan and nobody said anything about it except for those poor women and children\nLet's just open arms they want something nasty to happen because again the compassion thing is a GM they want something nasty to happen on the border\nThey want to clash\nWith these people on the ... they want it to look like the Gaza Strip is what they want\nThey just want the optics of that situation what\nWe see between the Israelis and the Palestinians on the Gaza Strip on a daily basis that's what the Democrats want to see\nOn our southern border because of Donald Trump is pushed he he'll sit in the military to the border and we'll just closed off if we ain't got all all we're just going to make a human wall yeah until we can get this under control but you can't just allow seven to ten thousand people just walk into this country\nCan we talk about the fact that we've mentioned this in previous discussions that and I don't mean to send any kind of way that we don't know what kind of diseases that bring into this country right I mean at that we have an immunization like you can't even go to a public school here without\nAnd I don't mean to send any kind of way that we don't know what kinds of diseases that are bringing to this country right I mean at the we haven't immunizations unless you can't even go to a public school here without a blue car without proving that you've been in the unites unless you have a religious exemption or something of that sort\nSo I mean you're telling me that it's a wise decision to just unfiltered let these people and I mean for a host of different reasons for that one too we have no idea what they're bringing into this country\nRight in the problem is is the feds are saying hey we're already dealing with an unprecedented amount of\nMigrant families and mainly unaccompanied minors at the border they're pushing on is they're doing what they can to get in here we're putting them in immigration facilities\nThe Democrats know that the political actors whoever they may be that are involved with getting this caravan started and and getting it up through Mexico into the U.S know that they know that border patrol is overwhelmed\nSo they just want to hit him with one big rush one big flood of illegal immigrants right before them in terms of right before the midterms unfortunately\nIt's not going to help the Democrats case because most of us have the view of\nOur family comes first we ourselves ...
