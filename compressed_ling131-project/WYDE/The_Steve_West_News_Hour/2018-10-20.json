I got to give them they want to do my work and live my life that's why I say it doesn't matter I don't think I can do is encourage people to go vote and I go vote after that man is what what else can\nYou do and don't be afraid to go to the wrong point I think a lot of there's a lot of fear that's being stoked out there about going\nAh you know can voter purging or that you've moved in to where you may have gone to the previously if you didn't get the card sold and send it back to wherever your secretary of state is\nThat you can still go to the same polling place and you can get a provisional ballot mhm and you just have to later on prove that that's where you are and your vote will be counted\nLet me ask you there who are we talking about the young people getting out the vote Michael this is where it really is when it comes to these local election in your professional opinion about what are we doing wrong be\n[noise] um I think that the identity of what a candidate is has changed ... apple used this analogy um I fell in love with basketball in Ninety One you know my stepfather from the west side of Chicago and then my Uncle Billy introduced\nApple use this analogy um I fell in love with basketball in Ninety One you know my stepfather from the west side of Chicago and then my Uncle Billy introduced me to back\nIt was a commission of parks in Harlem for years I was when all of MBA players like Katie Anderson's stuff are Marbury anybody that\nCame from New York and uh but here's the point I make it in my opinion\nMichael Jordan revolutionize what it meant to ask a ball player he was a rock star um sneaker contract see one multiple championships in my opinion\nUm you talked about the social media aspect with Obama Obama change what it meant to be a candidate ... black white green yellow whatever ... you have to social media you have to drive traffic in that way\nUm when I look at Donald Trump\nHe is a media mogul uh\nThat's a New Yorker light duty that knows how to spin controversy or you know it didn't sell it is it's Diddy P. Diddy a cool buddy love today what is it\nTo me that's the comparison to Trump and just the different things that he has going on and so I Believe that someone like Mitt Romney was ahead of his time in the sense of\nPeople were mad about the forty seven percent comment and he was very wrong for what he said he got caught on tape saying it um but\nIt was true yeah how was he wrong for what he said I mean it's it's accurate and I would say that there's about forty five percent mental the one way forty five percent of the ... and you're not only by and let\nMe when I say that my grandmother taught me that she may be better off than someone you mean that you you may never be you're may be better off to somebody but you're never better than anybody\nIn the comments he made to some people sounded like he was up here and they're down there there's certain things is kitchen table talk that maybe you shouldn't say and he got caught on video saying it at a at a function\nSo maybe wrong or what he said he was he was saying he was naming data that\nMaybe that should have been left out of his speech because you never knew who was recording\nRight\nDo you see where I'm coming from or no no I I mean you know I get to be going on um I mean I don't\nI didn't have a problem because I saw more statistical what he was saying I didn't see it as you know on better than you and here's forty seven percent of the country that you know doesn't sit this lead this clown\nDefinitely made you that's what I mean you've already bumped ... brown because it's perception right from your perception of what you've experienced and the perception of what I've experienced and so we can get the Sunday to instill a totally different about it\nBut that doesn't make him a bad person either so back his experiences\nHis experience my experience is my experience for me I was one of four black kids to graduate from a prep school I went to a prestigious prep school I had to close which every day of my life and so for me\nI've been in different experiences where I've had to adjust to people in and learn different things and see different things and all from my point of view as they had to offer there's for\nMe it was a tone you know if there was a tone that was head but that was my experience based off of what I heard when it was said he didn't see anything wrong with it because he felt that you know Romney was was was offering empirical data and that was it but\nYou know I grew up where you know my father and his ... and my father's family was blue more blue collar my mother and her family was were well to do and white collar and I always had mixed between both worlds and so something my mom is said to my dad my dad my I felt that it was wrong or was that buddy\nAnd my father might have said some to my mother and she didn't like it it it's all based off of experience and how you and how you interpret that and so when I heard what Romney said\nAnd my father might have said something to my mother and she didn't like it it it's all based off of experience and how you and how you interpret that so when I heard it around the set\nI did I I I since it was a tone I understand what he said but sometimes you got to self edit yourself because you just don't know how people are going to take what you said if it's a well she didn't want it to be right but but but the initial question that you asked me was just I Believe it was about identity\nI think the same way that Obama came across as this rock star um whether you agree with his policies or not I think that the Republicans are are going to have I think Trump is their best candidate in that aspect but I still still what I said I Believe wrongly what's that rock star I just think that he was maybe ahead of time\nIn that instance I think that that forty seven percent comment changed the way certain people view I also think on me being an east coaster and people voting you remember when Romney ran against Obama the north east was hit by treacherous story\nOn a ... a hurricane that a lot of people weren't voting during the election day\n... and ... that changed some well so the answer your question I think that the the role of the ... of the politician I'm as has has got the chance I I I interviewed people from all walks of life and you know I I often talk to the athletes as much as I talk to politicians as much as I talked to\nTo rappers and um I spoke to a to a to a rapper recently I said you know I'm\nCertain people in the church community have been turned off by the pastor on the person who you know the man and a woman of God and given the word and because of various reasons things have gone on in the church people think they're not ethical and I said when you look at hip hop\nArtists do you look at them as the modern day preacher and they told me yes because they're speaking they're good news is we can their word they're speaking the truth and people want to hear what's real\nI think it and and in in pop culture and even just in politics people are tired of being lied to you know I think that the gentleman who called on the phone um he didn't like Obama policy I respect the fact that he was respectful of President Obama and he said he didn't trashing him and I think that\nUm we have to find a way to find the juxtaposition of respected demand whoever the man is an office while also the person who's in office has to tell some troops and has to be ethical and I think that's a hard a\nBall [laughter] man you know you said a mouthful if you've got to me right now got Brenna robbing the one on Scooby in Studio with us and we'll discuss in politics and you know the good bad and ugly and I think we can all you know um agree on this right here that\nWe all want our country to succeed we all want president Donald Trump to succeed\nI think that I I don't think that's ... I don't think that you can say we all want Donald Trump to succeed because I Do believe that there's a vast majority of people out there who do not want to see him succeed just as there were a vast majority of people out there who did they did not want to see\nWhere the line with us but here's the thing I Would say to those people you idiots okay our agree on that because if you're saying that you don't want the president has exceeded because how he comes across how you two weeks of what he said\nBasically saying you want failure for yourself because unless you unless\nYou go ahead please late to Trump I think the delivery of what he says and tone on Twitter takes off those people but I think ... I think your caller has a point about you know people and wanting one person to see succeed and another one I I made the point about President Obama making the president\nThe rhetoric is out there and they're fighting back on the rhetoric that are where they are they're and they're stupid justice low they are causing a problem and they ... at you at that level should never say anything like that to your constituents you are so wrong and honestly they should not be an office\nHonestly they should be if they could be peace I think they should Maxine Waters Cory Booker the world all of them Eric Holder the crap that there are ... to the people for them to go vote ... shows me how weak you are because if you're a strong enough\nIn at the end of the day people will vote for you\nI don't need to get into my with President Donald Trump ... without him being a PC I don't need to go and they call a mob and they doing this and they don't need to do that just happened to Elizabeth Warren's yeah that's what he is president Donald Trump wants to do let him do that if your message is strong enough and what the Democrats are showing\nThat they don't have a strong message that they don't have a strong message or a messenger so at the end of the day they're fighting back on the same thing you you're trying to find the bull in in in in the pool if it were you don't know how to fight yeah they are they they they\nCannot be Donald Trump it's you're not the same thing was said you know when rock Obama was in office there was an ...\nWhen you don't know how to fight yeah they are they they\nThey cannot be Donald Trump and she has not been in the same thing was said you know when rock Obama was an office there wasn't a Republican\nOr a conservative candidate or somebody that was a good messenger for the conservative side because rock Obama was a rock star at that point in time I was the first president\nAh in modern times that had a form of celebrity status which I think it's an unfortunate thing because I Do not think that the president of the United states of America needs to have that celebrity ism about but ... ... ... what do we have right now right and been in his uh you know ... be said you know\nObama was the one that work is rated originally and you now you have Trump who you know Trump is a celebrity in God help this country if we continue down a path\nOf celebrities Bert are having ... and because we we get in to an eye dollar tree type of celebrity worship in we can't separate\nTheir celebrity from the actual person and that's a problem\nThat is a huge problem that's what I always try to stay you know middle ground about\nThe candidates or the people in office I don't get to how them I don't get too low and then I just call it for what I see I don't look at the party that they belong to if you're in an office and you are doing a job I'm looking at the job that you're doing I may not like the old policy more made like a puzzle and I look at president Donald Trump\nI have to say when he did a sixty minute interview I found a new ... found respect for president Donald Trump\nMeaning that the guy's going to say was on his mind he is going to say what he feel and you could see he don't think a lot of things through and a lot of things he said he don't really mean he's just saying them and might get them you must use for it no\nIs that refreshing to a point to see somebody actually telling his true instill it tell him what he thinks the right thing should be said is refreshing to a point but ask ... bc ...\nYou do have to know what to filter president Donald Trump and this is a great example\nWhen we found that ... she was missing president Donald Trump before you got any facts start talking to the public went out on Twitter strongly and say what that if something has happened to him Saudi Arabia gonna be still ... punishment is what I said before he knew anything yeah\nThis because all the all the initial against rumors that that particular time were pointing in a direction that the Saudi Government and the Saudi crown prince had something hands on to do with the disappearance at the time right uh and it was speculated that he had been murdered right\nAnd so once he found out and what was going on now you see Donald Trump building don't jump during my conducting Milwaukee he backtracking ... because now he's saying well I understand is that the tweet it\nJust like he did a alone was or was it under the Russian President about blood ... he said well he said he didn't do it well he now he said he didn't know\nBut it doesn't matter if you knew or not you said if this had happened that we're going to be still filling the ... but then you say but we do have this arms deal\nSo it looks bad and that's the end of the day like I said I said is on my teams are almost eighty on his radio show today\nEvery president has had to backtrack when it comes to Saudi Arabia ... every president\nCannot stand up to Saudi Arabia to a point because why would they have us without will pass around our ankles to a point to ... and so no matter what President Donald Trump say or do they are not going to be able to do what they are saying and I'm not mad at president Donald Trump for that because he cannot no that's\nSo no matter what President Donald Trump say or do they are not going to be able to do what they're saying and I'm not mad at president Donald Trump for that because he cannot no and that's probably what the whole fight\nAnd or the west wing that yeah we're together do screen or a secretary bolt and and um\nAnd like Kelly that that that's the that's the ... the reason why we have unfortunately I don't I don't want\nTo be doing business with Saudi Arabia we have no choice and unfortunately in the position that we've been in for the last almost hundred years you know we have no choice at this point in time when\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted out this statement a few hours later what did the Saudi Arabia's come on and say you want to do to yeah OK they called his bluff nobody want to talk about that but that's the truth\nWill because we're we're engaged using our proxy but that right well that it's Russia in ...\nBut that comes from inexperience right and speaking off the cuff and sandwich you feel that you want to go do without knowing the consequences and the ... because it just like the Saudi friends there\nBut it's also something that he campaigned on like he wants to pull us out of the middle east unfortunately we have so few allies in the middle east and you're right you know he he off the cuff you know this is what I promised in the campaign I Want to do this promise because he wants to do what rock Obama never could do was fulfilled his\nPromises and he spoke before he had all the\n... and this is what I Am I'm telling people\nPointed out ... when he's right\nPointed out when he's wrong yeah I understand he's not American sort of understand that you know we shouldn't do anything but that is not what President Donald Trump say just like the wall may get built oppose that Donald Trump did not say we was going to build the wall\nWho he said it was going to be a little while to pay for Mexico's okay but that's not the case now people say oh we just don't get the wall bill okay I get that but let's make sure we'd like you always say ... right and so we cannot\nOverlook President Obama when he said certain things I was the first one I Want to for ... microphone you say we keep our doctors yeah you and we did I got a problem with you sir for the the red line the red line and you and I was allowed Israel saying that I called it out because he has a say\nA broke loggers right twice a day I don't care what part are you from if you're right you're right but what President Donald Trump deal with this was an experience now he spoke before he knew it he got to backtrack and you ... people walking away like okay now because it Noel\nRussia started getting involved they said they were they were ready to start doing arms deals to Saudi Arabia after President Trump had a sin experience I don't assume you know if that says you know ... Russia has been trying to make\nThem build around April ... it you know the players you know what could possibly happen that Mr that's an experience but you know I I I'm One of those that he not listen to his people know off the British or his people told him before he went out there\nIf this is what the situation is these are the possibility that can actually be happening you don't know you you don't get to a situation with the Washington Post and does get national news without being advised by people\nI to me there's a bigger story and all the it's a bigger story but the thing that I'm pointing out and see what's going to come to you\nThe bigger thing that I'm pointing out is when the president speaks ... off the cuff stuff is fine sometimes I guess because people like I don't like it but sometimes when it especially when you're dealing with this stuff here yeah it can become nuclear\nSee I Want the repercussions against Saudi Arabia you know they're they're they're the little remember one humanitarian it it is but I guess what\nBecome nuclear well see I Want the repercussions against Saudi Arabia you know there there there was a ... number one humanitarian\nIt it is but I guess what\nBump pale went over there and sat next to the friends that had that got killed ... which is and it looks great but after that look horrible but Steven Mnuchin has been pulled from a financial countries right but but you but brown what I'm saying is for everybody to see color for what it ... had to go he\nHas to do that now had yes he had to have that sort of walk yeah that was but you know but what I'm\nSaying is when it happened on the other side people called for Rome\nAnd I understood at that point in time will come up with him about it had to be done when the Saudi Arabia deals and all those people call up okay I kept saying back then he had to do those ... people were in people with el enemies that no that was up in the Democrats as wise you know no no I'm telling everybody I must say it again\nWhen it comes to Saudi Arabia ... those deals we have to do the print came out Saudi Arabia government came on a few hours later after president don't jump stiff 'em and they came out of ... and stuck it out\nYou know what happened and then a day later the story about them spinning it yeah meaning this oh well he ... he died in a fight\nBut don't send Eighteen people interview I constantly am hands on I ... I Know he's trying to spend\nIt so it can be easier for residents don't you want to make it that just about the U.S but the but the thing I Want everybody to look at is when president Donald Trump stuck his just understand what he said America strong ... what did it for instance what what did they say ... you don't want to do that yeah", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Steve West News Hour", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "20"}
