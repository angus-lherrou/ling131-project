I Will call everyone to the conference room including corporate people and I will do the biggest in dance and then I'll walk out now you quit my job now now\nI'm like come on there's at least that chance they could win whatever you say on the air you're going to have\nTo follow through with it [laughter] I'd be careful if they win that game I I don't care I'll do it I don't I really don't even hear it it would I Would cry tears wow tears of Tennessee beat Alabama real salty there yeah wow that's that's big it'd be that big of a deal now\nIs this who's the home game for Tennessee okay well\nWell Tennessee man haven't really been been good at you know at home necessarily\nWhat a way that well we beat Auburn adult ... forgot about that and if we're going by the numbers they do a better way than ...\nUh but you know and is what it is it's not it's probably not gonna happen but in the same time you think about\nThe emotional a roller coaster that would be if they did this will be the first\nTime my child named after the famous Peyton Manning quarterback at Tennessee would have seen us when this game\nBy all he knows is the stories I've told him about how big that rivalry was but he's never seen it means never seen it happen that guy\nWell I mean for your sake and your son I mean I kind of hope that y'all get that W but at the same time I hope you don't you're right you know because I got a saint ... well\nWe don't we don't have our hopes up we but we do have our hopes\nUp for the next three years or so or or or in the next two or three years that it will be more competitive we just don't\nI mean do you think savings are going to take it back to the house\nWell I think well hopefully [laughter] but uh I don't know I mean it's just a matter of we gotta\nAnd bring in the\nYounger generation the new Democrats the problem is I feel like the Democrats downfall has been the fact that they continue to move left further and further left\nSo then the problem becomes well the new people coming in there for the left and the people are now so it's like you're not just moving lab you're jumping left\nAnd then you're starting from a position that doesn't line up with American values doesn't line up with your average voters or opinions policy wise economic wise whatever [noise]\nIt's it's a lose lose situation for the Democrats if they don't pull this off I was watching a a ... CEO Cortez\nAlexandria was that the video here watching in the office saying well yeah she was on Jimmy Kimble last night and ah\n[laughter] and then as you watched her to talk with with Jimmy Kimmel and durable interview or whatever there were so many times where she was\nLike a you know like like yeah yeah like yeah shelling sound like\nWhen we were little interview or whatever there were so many times when she was like\nA you know why why yeah yeah like yeah\nShe does sound like a Fifteen year old in high school yes very much so and so there was a video put together where it just took those clips of her\nBeing like yeah like like this and like that and like or don't have Matt\nRyan don't end up in all mash up it was a\nIt was crazy because once you listen to this I just want you to know that what you're hearing is not much different from the an edited version\nJust the way to compact it make it shorter but it sounds almost identical to when she was dogging Jimmy Kimmel and the first place like\nIt'll be a time incumbent a guy who just assumed that he was going to win and you came out of nowhere and working as a bartender and decided that it would be a good idea to\nRun for office it's really one of the most remarkable stories I've ever you stop and think about this from time to time ago yeah believe this has happened a year ago\nPeople just live their life back in the day we read\nIn the party yeah they they do their own home town really and you know I don't know\n'cause we're from the Bronx it's like exotic you\nMotion what does it mean when somebody says yeah no yeah I don't know yeah yeah no wait wait was it seems a little salty I don't know\nThat ... behind me that's like singing singled out actually is [noise] you know and they're telling me you know and you know they they said\nAnd [noise] I kinda\nUp with me so good you remember the one uh an an you do words like the stuttering kid have heard that may try to explain to my mom why I came home waiter I ever\nYou don't remember that no actually I don't know that was so good and there's a lot of people are old I Want to play that for you because that's this is who she sounds like right here\nHave eleven dreams and you're you're you're you can give you ... you once you you can sell your your your way you might get very much you can do anything\nTo do they do know\nThat ... memories [laughter] you know I remember those days that that your kids\nWell I mean you get that face he likes spit it out um yeah\nWell this is the you know they do or re makes everything like right so they did a remix to this one and a\nThere's an ad and it's pretty good ... area\n[noise] dreams [noise]\nYou're you don't get any rain [noise] you know [noise] you know\nAnyway that's called the ... the what strap re max I'm gonna check that out later anyway back to Alexandria Cortez [noise]\n'cause it is yeah in the mid well you know I think he kind of typing into my phone put it in your cell phone calendar you know she sounds just like they could yeah she's a side but also it means that we need to also\nOh you know she sounds just like they could yeah she does have to also had [noise]\nA low allow man even just the tone of voice he's got that yeah yeah yeah totally so it's that jazz yeah sure sir sir yeah but\nBy the way is the easy it is from ... yes I ... I went ... talking about the the democratic candidate right next thing you know when you do play no my favorite video on than playing the ... you\nDidn't play and remains a also Joe buying he was on CBS this morning this morning and\nHe uh he they were talking about voter fraud and a voter fraud is a big issue was done about it on the show we talked about how very real it is and how Democrats deny it the thing they not only deny it's a thing but they flip it around and say people are being denied the ability to vote\nAre there are things that happen where it's a it's a mixed up and somebody get their and their names not on the\nList or you know this that or the other happens and they're not able to vote yeah we've all heard of so many that that's gone through that or whatever right up because guess what governments running this thing but\nThis whole voter voter fraud doesn't exist or voter fraud doesn't exist in a large scale is an absolute why\nAnd Joe Biden's on CBS this morning and he's pushing that stuff and talking about how crazy it is that anybody would think that ... that voter fraud is real and that and voter ID laws or any sort of voted in laws\nAre racist because they're suppressing African American people keeping them from voting was going to the\nEarly they were told to get\nDo you believe that voters crashing\nAbsolutely look\nI have the exact numbers but somewhere in the order of Seventy seven in the last couple of years piece of legislation ... state legislatures to restrict the right to vote\nTo reduce the up we should we should have automatic registration\nWe should allow everybody to vote\nAnd you know all this stuff about oh I Can't let felons you can't let it you know people who are in this country illegally like they have to have an id well no they don't have to have an idea\nWhere they have to demonstrate that they lived there and who they are they don't have to have a particular id\nThey don't have to have a government issued id they don't have to have that's not true and the truth of the matter is that all the talk about voter fraud did the president find anything\nIn this big hole thing reason he won the popular vote\nCome on and then what what was the only time I didn't want to see more now yeah both of them but my generic point is there is no no evidence of all the studies time\nOf widespread voter fraud that being a central problem in American electoral process just not true\nAnd supportive more than fifty three thousand voter registration applications are on hold\nDetroit is Seventy percent of those are African American surprise surprise said do you believe that an effort underway absolutely already positively without question it continues it's one of the reasons why this museum the ... the people in this museum that are here now and being honored and started their fight\nIs still going on\nIs still exist and it's wrong and look that voter id if my name is Joseph ... by junior if I show up and I don't have a license that says Joseph are Biden or doesn't have junior on it then I Can't vote\nI show up and I don't have a license that says jokes are Biden or doesn't have junior on it than I Can't vote\nWhen everybody knows who the hell heck I Am in my ... and ... and and the challenger knows who I Am\nThis is designed to suppress the vote\nNot allow the right\nTo you know those those are asking people to show ID at the polling place is designed to see black people from voting sure\nSo racist policy because I mean not to say black people don't have the ability to get a free government issued id or anything I mean isn't that race and send it\nSo you know and I know this is off the beaten path but just going to the broader theme of of us not recognizing racism for what it is now twisted we've become and I was telling you this earlier I started watching the show called New Amsterdam it's a it's a new medical drama type of thing and and me and my son or watching yesterday 'cause he's sick at home with nothing else to do\nAnd it was actually really good I'd recommend it but anyhow one of the uh like a cardio drastic surgeon and he's he's black and apparently Hammond this white girl had been hooking up or whatever and so she's like well I don't understand why you don't want to see her to date me and he said I don't want to seriously dates you 'cause you're not black\nI had a vision in my mind are having black children and you can't produce that for me and a lot holy goodness can you imagine if the roles were reversed and that show had a white person saying that to a black person right and the cries of racism that would quickly common that show would probably be shut", "show_name": "The Steve West News Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "18"}
