with me All right ah welcome to your Tuesday edition of the line a plenty of of stuff out there to get to it's it's one of those weeks Halloween ths tomorrow the midterms are weak\nAway and I know it's important for us to talk about um mid term stuff\nBut there's really only so much to say about it I I mean you know we were going to talk about what's going to be on the ballot in Alabama tomorrow with Jeff in the three thirty our now lucky for you guys that are listening right now between the hours of six and seven on the replay\nYou will be able to hear that conversation tomorrow evening after we go off air live and then they do that first our replaced we have two chances to hear that if you want some clarification on what's what as far as your ballots concerned next Tuesday a week from today so we'll try and make sure you guys are\nCompletely in foreign we've had people\nAsk us to to go through the entire ballot or you know that they find out what happened in violation that what I Do but I don't think I'm going to do that okay you know right\nThat's what war people down on the Democrats\nThat's why people started backing away from the Democrats because of that old tired strategy when these things happen for some reason the Democrats go back to that same playbook and doing that a week in two weeks before the mid term elections\nIs kind of a bizarre move if you ask me you know granted their overall theme is attacked from in every way you can but seems like they should do it more subtly\nAnd concentrate on what they're going to do if the people of their respective St state or their district vote for them and vote them in the office what they're going to do for them opposed to just\nI'm On a puzzle everything Trump does\nSeem like you need to come up with a different strategy that's for the Democrats for the media\nThey do the same thing and it causes the same effect that causes people to back way and they're like man\nThis is all these people care about did they not care about other things like jobs are my child's future or my four oh one K. or any and all they care about us talking about Trump and horrible of a person he is and how he's this and that and the other\nIt turns people off so when you hear Don Lemon spend his show talking about with Chris Cuomo talking about how the biggest terror threat in this country are white men that doesn't\nThat doesn't get middle America excited about going out and voting next Tuesday it may get them excited about voting but it doesn't get them excited to vote about a vote for Democrats listen to a little bit of what happened last night on CNN when they did the whole transition between Cuomo prime time and Don Lemon show\n... not just the bomber there was another hate filled criminal just last week in Kentucky and other white man history of violence custody for shooting and killing two African Americans or grocery store ...\nBut when he tried to do was born into a predominantly black church fail and then he picked a secondary target is being investigated for hate crimes Don Lemon is here right now we barely have time to cover it because we were distracted by another extremists that was doing bad things and and ... yeah\nAnd then now another one and you have all of them in a row and you know we talked we messages about this little bit this weekend I keep trying to force people not to demonize any one group or anyone ethnicity\nBut we keep thinking that the biggest terrorist threat of something else some ... some people who were marching tours of order like a feminist and when the last time they did this a couple of hundred people came and they you know\nMost to get into the country most of tired you know got stuck it out before they even made it to the border um\nSo we have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terrorist threats in this country is white\nSo we have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threats in this country is white men most of them radicalized ... up to the right\nAnd we have to start doing something about him there is no travel ban on them\nThere is no ban on you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy van so what do we do about that\nAnd\nAt first of all let me just say this\nMores style or just a name and Vicki Jones and may have been lost in all of this to people who were killed him was that you talked about they have been lost about this and I know that people feel that the story is not gotten enough coverage and we will honor them tonight about programs going Chris are good no no no\nI'm going to be anyway they go on and on and and Don Lemon even seemingly to propose a white guy ban quote unquote in this country\nEven though the Muslim ban that he's brought up this time last night ten in several other times in the past there was never a Muslim ban there was a ban on travel from particular countries that were infested with terrorism\nBut there never was a Muslim ban it's just it's funny to me that if you listen to that he leads up to this whole the biggest share threaten America are white guys white\nMen\nThe whole time leading up to that he talks about how we don't need to classify a certain group of like one or one group of people that as being a threat to the country we don't need to classify Muslims as a threat to the country then it goes but white men are the biggest\nThreats are gone yeah not even realizing has had an ... I just I just wonder what would have happened if somebody were to have said that about the black man\nWe'll see how that sounds black men are the biggest threat to this country\nHas that same it well it sounds pretty rice and it does and I'm just that the frame of mind that if you can take something and then start the opposite race and to that sentence and it sounds racist it's probably racist\nAnd I'm sure it's probably racist or if we're looking to dream each other equally and look at our our fellow man ... without the the the lens of of race\nThen you should be able to use that theory in any situation and find out if it's racist or not if you can use one\nBut not the other chances are both of those are very racist not just one it's never just one side is racist if we're actually concerned about racism the left isn't concerned about races the left is racist\nThe left puts on a happy face and says we're here to fight against the races all the while they're wolves in sheep's clothing\nTheir racist disguised as crusaders against those they claim are racist you've got racist fight non racist the problem is is that people instigating it are the racist pretending to be non racist I Know that sounds confusing and that is uh that's that's exactly\nWhat we've got going on not just those in the media but those um ah those democratic politicians and and Democrat Party leaders are the the biggest culprits in that whole thing\nOr another thing is in in their tying to the shooting in Kentucky\nThat we did talk about on the show and also the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh or they're referring to that in most important one thing that bothered me is is something we brought up on the show\nSo the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh or they're referring to that in most important one thing that bothered me is is something we brought up on the show yesterday the the I saw several media outlets claiming that there were numerous Jewish leaders in\nPittsburgh saying that they do not want Donald Trump to visit\nTo to pay his respects to to stand in solidarity with Pittsburgh and the Jewish community there they did not want him there and the media painted this is ten or eleven Jewish leaders in the community and come out and said that that ... to paint\nThe picture that it's all the Jewish people in Pittsburgh do not want the president there because this is his fault [noise] what bothered me about that 'cause I was not surprised to see NBC and and CNN and whoever else a repeat that false could repeat that lie but then I see John Roberts\nOn Fox News who you know he's he's one of the guys the White House correspondent gray haired dude he's in the White House press briefings and all that\nI've watched him on three different occasions repeat\nThat Jewish leaders have rejected Donald Trump's intention of\nOf visiting Pittsburgh I watched him do it three different times now just if you didn't hear a song about this yesterday the Jewish leaders they're talking about are actually just members of a group of a group called bend the arc\nWhich are Soros funded\nLeft wing political activists and not Jewish leaders it's a Soros funded a political action group political activist group\nThat is only Jewish by name and they're certainly not Jewish leaders for the Jewish community in Pittsburgh\nI someone and bringing up at the White House press briefing I saw him bring it up on Shepard Smith show yesterday and I watched him say it again for the third time\nOn ... bay or show yesterday evening three times meter the host Shepard Smith rep Bayer corrected him on that front\n... they knew that was fake news\nBut they just let him go and John Roberts went on his merry way\nAnd continued to repeat the line and maybe\nMaybe they feel like they're they're getting close with their partners at CNN or MSNBC or the people that that ah perpetrate these lies\nBecause of things like when something tragic happens why in I don't know if you can consider a tragic but but the uh the the the pipe bombs that were intercepted there was most certainly\nOr the potential to be a tragic situation they come in and they stand arm in arm of CNN and they do the same thing when Donald Trump calls CNN out for me and fake news they say no we're not going to put up with that kind of talk [noise]\nThat's what those at Fox News do so maybe they feel like they can just take\nTheir word on this whole Jewish leaders of Pittsburgh thing [noise] but I thought\nAmerica this is not even a close call we talked about Lou Dobbs spreading conspiracy theories about the bombs being fake I mean and the same thing with back bunches of Congress ... certain back ventures in Congress you're giving money to somebody\nThis is actually spreading the big lie right now talking about the others lying about smallpox lying about leprosy no no no Mika I Wish they were only complicit\nOr this is far worse than that Jeffrey Goldberg\nIt's so nice to to be able to to watch people and Joe Scarborough who is just so informed yeah that he knows Fifteen thousand migrants or heard\nOf Fifteen thousand migrants that have been walking hundreds and thousands of miles oh have a clean bill of health\nSure yeah and they have no criminal history and they're not going to be any of that into the country I mean it's amazing because I don't think that they even have the papers to pray for coming in with a blue form you know what I'm saying there is no vaccination record so out for him to be able to even say that I think it's a there was some wisdom and actually discussing the possibility of what could happen with the you know it\nEx nation record so out for him to be able to even say that\nThink it's a there was some was something that actually discussing the possibility of what could happen with the you know at the flux of people coming into the country I think it would be stupid to not question as\nWell and once you look at the details and as to what has happened as this caravan moves through Mexico Mexican authorities are coming out and they're like hey ah\n... we're having Honduran men with weapons guns\nShooting at us on their way through they arrested two guys and recovered some hand guns from some of these migrants in the Caribbean that were firing weapons that them ...\nThey were firing bullet that these guys they're throwing Molotov cocktails I watch now keep in mind there's a second migrant\nCaravan coming through the Boston through the Guatemalan border Mexico and Guatemala\nAnd they were throwing rocks and bottles and whatever else they could get their hands on at these authorities and busting down the gates okay of violent group of people they want to be next in line and they want to create the second caravan that's coming up behind the first one\nAnd there's some dangerous people in these groups but yet\nPeople like Joe Scarborough says we're white nationalist for even questioning that it was funny because Fox News and I know him hammer and Fox News but there's a couple of good people on that channel\n... was out in a inside the Caribbean and and they were interviewing people and they came across this one guy and kind of asked him you know hey are you willing to go to the U.S and break the law and he's like oh sees in your he ... a\nMine he's got a translator was I just want you to listen\nTo how that and I am going to play the whole clip not just the interview part just because the winters things set up but just listen to this segment from Fox News I think this was over the weekend it's Griffith Jenkins the same guy that was sneaking up on the adult across our letter that he's getting some good interviews and the caravan lately but listen to this right here\nFor the marching they were in San Pedro Kevin ... tech\nBut you can see here they're still waiting for a press conference from the leaders to sit in front terrorist group if you look here you can see them all in this square there very tired they've been going since October thirteenth there's a lotta coughing here they've got blisters on their feet it's been tough with a\nLotta coughing going on there but no need to worry there'll be don't screen them don't scream today that they're not accepting Mexico's offer for temporary a silent temporary job simply there to listen very healthcare they're offering them asylum in Mexico healthcare they're offering\nThem temporary jobs in temporary healthcare okay\nAnd they're turning down because they're going to keep on track and do America even though they know the military will be meeting them at the border\nAre definitely not heating President Trump's warnings to not show up at the border they all say they're coming here say in fact degree maybe too big but yet they're still going to go forward and they're going to show up on the border one person who is probably not going to have luck once he gets there is Jose we spoke to earlier who had prior convictions ...\nIsn't that what are called every migrant in this caravan was hosing right even than women and children are all Jose listen [noise]\nAre you willing to break the law\nTo get back to the United states you'll get all that as a but it'll do don't he says he wants to apply for part of the felony he committed to the u._s.\nTo get back to the United states you'll get into that ... that are don't she says he wants to apply for a partner for the telling me he committed can you ask him exactly what happened on ... on the ac [noise]\nAgree felony ... the my data attempted murder\n[laughter] yeah yeah\nThe only guys I re oh oh now by other number three\nIs that okay a third degree felony okay ... was it attempted\nMurder hey it's no big deal it's been deported multiple times he's been convicted of attempted\nMurder and yet Joe Scarborough\nSays don't worry about these guys send him like he was ordering something else to McDonald's and you what do you have a good number three you'll get a little felony\n[laughter] you'll get tempted met a number three number three [noise]\nCrazy all this is seriously happening and we're supposed to just turn a blind eye and just let these people walk in\nAnd I\nI I shouldn't say this and I really don't even want to say because most people should have enough commonsense to realize this but we're not saying everybody in the group is a felony convicted\nOf attempted murder but the fact that there is one two three\nFive hundred whatever doesn't matter to the bigger point they we can't just allow big group of people coming in if we know this is in the middle of it\nThis is not that the first\nTime we've seen in an interview like that either we played it on the show where they interviewed people in there like I have been deported ten times that's just the name of the game you just keep going back\nWell let me ask you this too if if somebody said hey there's a bunch of ... there was like Fifteen hundred people at your front door I Need you to let them all in and there was like three that were had been convicted of attempted murder would you be like no that's fine just go ahead and let them in my home you know where my children live that nobody would do that is the same thing\nToo oh five nine four one one zero one one keeping an eye on line shots of Pittsburgh is the president has arrived\nAt the tree of life synagogue where they're going to be visiting and paying their respects to the eleven people that died over the weekend so just to say you know we're giving our eye on that anything goes down we will let you know Don is going to be first Don how're you\nHey good afternoon you know I wanted to make a comment about Mr lemon and his comments about a white man and being the real threat like we're all over the fact that you know after he just says that the bottom of the pipe bomb mailer and this guy that shot a synagogue oh these are white a\nWhite male is not white\nIs half Filipino half seminal last time I checked that was not Caucasian yeah uh you know so\nThat I did not think that the Warren has proven to out to even point zero one percent of a race matters even a little white then he's white\nWell I mean he is skin color or maybe a little on the on the lighter shade but he would not be considered Caucasian all these at uh yeah uh and going back to um [noise]\nRest of that nonsense you know they know what they're saying it and it's all premeditated uh they are basically lying to everyone in the country\nOr they are doing is to gene out their base of on the left and division because they can see that you can see that can see by the polls and they will never\nTheir base on on the left the end of it\nBecause they can see that you can see that can see by the polls and they will never bring this up because the CNN than the NS NBC News of the world will never bring up a poll that shows trending up once for the Republican\nIt won't happen right\nNow if it they'll bring up the polls that show a cup and some of the candidates that are trailing um you know they say well look bad and James is down by your job James down by seven points what they say over what they say is that he used to be down by the\nRight yeah they're going and they they do that I I even watch Fox News do it earlier where they were like oh this has gone from heavily leaning to Republican and it's gone down to just kind of leaning Republican and and they don't even want to show you the numbers on some of them which\nIs you know they don't bring up ... work anymore [laughter] [laughter] right well and that's the one they're lying pork\nAfter sort of talk tens of millions of dollars into Texas well going to go down in flames I Love to see Soros wasting money\nThe the end of the things on ah the the hostility in this country towards people in their political beliefs as really skewed polls that happened in two thousand six team where people decided\nHey I'm not willing to just go out there and tell you who I'm voting for him because I Want to be getting beat up on TV from supporting Republicans I'm not going to put that out there so then they get an accurate reading on what the polls are\nAnd everything they put forty on TV and they're like this ... this poll says that\nIt's it it doesn't it doesn't work as well as it used to not saying it's completely ineffective but if you're going to make your predictions based on a lot of these polls and only the polls you're going to be misleading yourself and then to Don's first point about what Don Lemon sand and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The
