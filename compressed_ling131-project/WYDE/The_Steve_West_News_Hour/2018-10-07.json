that we're going to get to one second but I just want to finish up really quickly uh by sharing that after I fired my attorney the thing that I understood was\nA that my ex and I had the opportunity\nBy dealing with each other sensibly a without all the motion we had the opportunity to salvage our children's a psychic or their psyche there to salvage their ... their mental state of mind divorce hurts\nIt hurts children it hurts families are sold the the the least you can do um or I guess the more you can do to minimize that affect the greater so uh you know my story is is real simple\nI figured out really early by the grace of God that I didn't want want my children to be damaged or any more than they were already going to be so I wasn't going to go through\nA big legal battle and dragging their mother through the dirt and calling her name's and tried to\nDo all of that just so that I could not pay money or so I could say things\nUh children are way more important than that yes it's about kids and I believe it's a man's responsibility and I'm going to hold onto that with all of our callers with everybody's out to I'm going to hold on to the fact that ah that it's the man's responsibility\nUm to do everything that he can because I Believe if a woman knows you're going to honor her and treat her right that she will work with you are so speaking of that we

and it was a terrible I'm In a ... at the very end up so desperate to get out mhm I'm I'm living in the back of my mind I was wondering you know\nI'm I should've been more of a\nComedy club ... and because I wanted nothing okay a is a show the ... ... if I moved to ... and it's a um it's something I could have done that or\nA right to make the marriage work I'm able to something that uh and\nI didn't do the calls you know little divorced or a actually a medicine right so I you know is that all these years warned already in the back of my mind that something I could have done to you on that what you're going\nYeah and and and you know joy but thank you so much for that question I really appreciate that a lovely I I I saw ... your eyebrows went up and you brought up so\nOh absolutely absolutely can't when I was going through my divorce I went through a divorce care class at my church my home church than back in Delaware and I saw\nWomen who had been married ... who had been married and then divorced divorced\nFor at least ten years Fifteen Years Twenty years still struggling with divorce they were not only struggling with the things that a joy mentioned and having guilt\nThey were struggling with shame they were struggling with self identity they were struggling with love new laws they were still struggling with finances\nThe impact of divorce is long lasting\nBut I'm here to tell you that there is a God and he still he\nStill wants you she still loves you and he has a purpose for you if you are divorced if you have been divorced if you're walking through a divorce if you're walking through separation\nGod wants to use you it is then during that class and I realize that my scars were not for me my scars are not about me right\nIt it there's so much healing in sharing the story right so a joy is not alone um and carrying that it is my hope and desire that anyone who was gone through a divorce is in a church and that the church\nUh has classes has workshops and have people there who can talk to them and help them move and ... and moved to a place where God is at their center and and they are releasing all that hurt and sharing\nYour ... and you know what what's really interest\nHelp them move and ... and moved to a place where it got is at their center and and they are releasing all that hurt and sharing\nYour ... and you know what what's really interesting is that for a lot of people out there a win win trauma comes or whether the divorce or death or whatever it is uh that you go through these these five stages of grief right\nAnd in one of the stages of grief is called bargaining and one of those stages you begin to say to ask the what if question well what if I Would have done this what if I Would have and what if what if I Would have been a better why what if I would've been a better husband what if I Would not have and and that what if question you never when\nThere's never an answer it's always a water\nOh absolutely and I also believe that if you are continuing to ask those questions he asked a year you are presenting died from you really using you write something for you to do\nWell and and here's what I Will tell you for for every one that's out there um that's a stage of grief a it's a natural stage to be in\nAnd it's natural to ask those questions as natural to progress through the different stages of grief what's not naturalist to stay there to guide them ... ... and and so to that point I I Do want it to let everyone know that uh we have a number of shows lined up here at at commitments with Ken allegedly\nA we encourage you to to tune in every Sunday\nAt five thirty or we encourage you to uh go to our Facebook page we do have a Facebook page we do have a Twitter\nUh we are our website we we are we're planning on our website being live within the next couple of weeks but I Want to encourage you because we're actually going to have a ... a clinical therapists that are going to be a gift on on our show very soon\nAre each one of us have a different set of scars and different things that we've gone through but\nUh as a as you heard in the beginning of the show you know we we moved down here from New Jersey we opened up a church here it's called the house of life church\nA lot of it and it is how you feel about the accounting firm ... not nature [laughter] Kelly\nGirl All right anyway okay we we moved down here and we opened up a church and and I just want to encourage you or if you want to get more information\nAbout uh uh the divorce program I we do have a divorce program at our church in the divorce rate recovery ministry uh we do have a structure Thirteen week a divorce program that you can go through life and we went through it and she is a key facilitator Ford ended it it helps a lot and let me tell you why else\nOne of the biggest reason that it helps this because\nI'm ... and I get to say this because I Am a pastor\nOne of the reasons that helps as because before you can start ministries to someone spiritually you must meet their needs and naturally when a person is hurting and in pain and they've been through divorce and they\nAnd and they they they're guilty and and and they don't know where to go on what to do they feel guilty well yeah they they feel guilty they don't know where to go on what to do when all of that it and some of them are guilty by the way\nWhen that in that case um\n... you need that natural need met first you need I tell people all the time you can't minister to a person's hungry and tell them about God they they need to be fed first they need food\nAnd so the thing that's so great about the divorce ministry that uh that we we we advocate and ... and we believe in is that it deals with the natural issues that people go through\nYou know how how many to how to that at all so we have that problem in our church we encourage you to uh to to uh seek out our church to come by\nAnd learn more about that program in addition to that we also have a really awesome marriage program at our church because we believe in marriage\nIs a marriage program and it's called saving your marriage before it starts\nStance repeating we believe in marriage right\nAnd and so we have that program uh uh at our church or we believe in these things we believe in in in the entire part of it so there isn't a number of different things that we offer to ah\nTo people who are divorced or people who are married and married people who are going into a marriage were engaged et cetera and you can find all of that stuff at our church the house of life church and we certainly encourage you to to look us up and and uh and you'll hear at the end of our show uh the contact information for that\nBut what can you expect going forward from commitments to with Ken and Leslie a we have a number of different gift that we are lining up that we're going to have in Studio that are going to talk about a variety of different things from how they survive divorce or to how they survive marriage and they saw the red flags and they were able to to combat it\nOr we're going to ... therapists that are going to be a here that are going to talk about ah the the the clinical side uh sometimes you need to go see a therapist\nSometimes [laughter] you know here's here's what I Believe you need to see us\nOf the the the clinical side uh sometimes you need to go see a therapist\nSometimes [laughter] you know here's here's what I Believe\nYou need to see a therapist when you are well uh-huh right and\nSee what their ... well before the sickness it's just like getting a physical you go for your annual physical for your body every year I tell my children all the time you needed a spiritual checkup a mental check up in a physical check on all three right right okay or so before I mean canonized but the beauty of our marriage is that\nYou know we're kinda geeks like we love like classes on communication and I got a couple of class like we're there you know so we're we're kind of corny that way but hey\nIt's ... it makes our beautiful married [laughter]\nSo what do you tune into the corny people [laughter] every Sunday at five thirty on one on one point one of them streaming live WWW dot one oh one\nW why D. E. dot com you can pick it up on your computers you can download the app\nAnd other W why do you want a one point one FM app you can download that in I tunes and or an Android or we're going to have a number of different guess we're going to have ah some some very special people that ... that are going to come in and not just to talk about divorce but ah but but but let me just kinda sum it up for you this way\nUh people say well why divorce\nAnd the reason why divorces because anymore now people are not talking about divorce and it's rampant absolutely it's in the church and churches are not talking about it\nA and people are affected by it it's hard to find anyone anywhere who hasn't been affected in some way\nBy divorce but we don't just stop there because you can't talk about divorce without talking about marriage and the things that lead to divorce\nRecognizing the red flag out of a little wedding the red flags all we want to talk about those kinds of things as well and you can't talk about marriage you can't talk about avoiding those red flags you can't talk about uh doing the work to make your marriage work without talking about dating and and making the right choice and making sure you're equally yoked\nCan that that's a key because I spent a I'm going to say we spent a good part of our marriage trying to clean up our unprepared and has to be married your rights and then you get a ... sessions before we got married it\nWas a ... and now they all the time that people don't invest enough into into marriage on the front end right right I mean people invest all kind of money in their education their job and everything else\nBut they if if if if someone said to sift through them okay you wanna get married right you need to come to three uh three sessions till I don't know where we're good we don't need that many why so many ah they're just a couple is fine you need to invest in your in your relationship and not just before during\nRight and you also need to invest in yourself and you can't tell someone else who you are if you don't understand who you are\nWell so you know what that is ... ... ... talk about self love and self understanding you are you know what's your love language drive and know what that is where are you know I I Know that you're an extrovert\nI Know what it is because um when I was dating Leslie she made me take the take the\nTime that I Love [laughter] and ah the love language you know you don't have to bring me a whole lot of gas and the ... there you go [laughter]\nAre these are the kinds of things that we're going to talk about our commitment to Kennan Leslie or we're going to talk about the five love languages making sure you know your your your love language\nHow someone relate to you ... we want to talk about how to do the work to make a relationship last and by the way we're not just talking about romantic relationship we're going to get into relationships with their children and and and focus on the ... maybe ... or you know in the book that I wrote one of the things that that I talked about was the fact that my children\nTook me and molded me into the kind of father they needed as opposed to me being the dad that I thought I was supposed to be missed\nFact that my children took me and molded me into the kind of bothered they needed as opposed to me being the dad that I thought I was supposed to be Mr Big bad you know military man I Know what to do and you just do it are my children taught me how they needed to be parenting for them and and\nThat's something that we are going to talk about so we're going to talk about that relationship we're going to talk of a relationship with family we'll talk about dating and how 'bout that no other people dating again\nWell she goes you're off the market was just talking about [laughter] make it here nobody of listening to yours sultry voice thinking you're on the market had asked me if you have trouble right now [laughter] it's like you know just\nDating again how do you go about data and you know when you've been hurt when you're coming out of her from divorced one of the things that people really like to do quickly and start dating again and I made some mistakes where what is the old saying what Israel saying the best way to get over a one man is to\nGet under another Mm you know not just people safe [laughter] I'm not sure if I Do I Know I went there I\nKind of data a little bit and then I totally stopped because I'm like you know what I don't care what you think I don't care what you want to do and I never could that's an idea that it gave me time with God's will talk about\nThe ... and we will because that happened with me as well I I wasn't able to find the most awesome beautiful woman in the entire world the perfect woman for\nMe until I stopped close myself and went to God developed a relationship renewed a relationship with him and then after that God gave me my gift and\nTalk about that as well so we have a lot to talk about a lot to do\nUh we're gonna we're we're going to have gas on the show or I Can't wait to talk to you about the new line of commitments a merchandiser we're going to have we're getting we're getting merchandise because he had already starting next week we're ... with every show we're going to give away a merchandise\nWhen when people are when people go to our Facebook page and they log on we're going to do a drawing for phone and we're going to give away T shirts and hats and mugs\nOr we're going to have a seminars that we're going to give away a I'm a tickets to seminars and we have a lot that we are going to do a this is a ministry for us and this is important and people are hurting because of bad choices in relationship Mm they're hurting because they don't know how I was getting commitment broken commitment they're hurting because they don't know how to take\nA limited make lemonade in a relationship or\nI don't know how to reach out for help\nAnd they don't and burial but but at the end of the day it all comes back to that number one commitment it's got to be the commitment that you have with God\nSo you know we're we're excited about what we're going to be doing here we're excited about where we are going stick with us a joined us every Sunday at five thirty\nAnd uh I guarantee you that we're going to say something that is going to do that is going to be very thought provoking something that is going to really a tickle your knowledge\nBut stick with this so uh I Am can with the commitments with Ken and Leslie show I'm Ken and I am less late and we thank you for joining us on our ... I'm Out come back and talk to a ... [noise]\n\n\nNow I'm not saying that I Want you to send your children to the most expensive schools so they receive the most day that's not what I'm saying and all\nYou know is is it would it be the right decision for your child is studying engineering and Auburn would it be the right decision for them to go to MIT I have no clue\nYou know could they even get into MIT could they handle the academic\nOr situations there I have no idea that's not the point I just don't want parents to rule out the possibility of a university because they are just not aware of the actual cost of the university\nAnd you actually cannot no cost to your child into your into a parent until you go through this financial aid process\nUm that is necessary for you to understand what these colleges are an ash actually cost\nNow in the introduction last week I started out by saying that I wanted to talk about how we choose colleges\nAnd this is kind of when I'm leading up to with this understanding of the financial aid um now how to handle most of the time our children choose a college\nIt with his understanding of the financial aid um now how to handle most of the time our children choose the college I mean how do they decide well\nIn my experience has generally several different things it's it's weather friends go a issue they root for a two day tailgating ...\nI see one they are and ball um it might be what's close to home I mean what's far away from home um it's not generally selected because of the academics and the cost involved\nMost children choose a college either because their friends from going or their parents went there or something along those lines and I think that's fine but I just want to\nEncourage you to go about this a little bit different\nWhat most people do is they have a handful of colleges that their child is interested in um they might go visit those colleges and then kind of go from there and then once they decide on whether they want to go then they start the financial aid process I start the admissions process\nAnd so I'm actually kind of suggesting the reverse of that\nAnd the reverse of that would be to allow this financial aid and cost to drive the selection of the schools\nSo you can start out with a handful of schools but you also need to start out with the financial aid process and then eliminate schools based on what financial packages are provided not necessarily choosing the schools\nI'm going to visit them and then starting the financial aid process that's how most parents and students choose their schools they pick a handful of schools um they go visit they decide which ones they like and then they kind of go from there\nSo when I'm suggesting to you is the is the best way to do this is to start out with a handful of schools go through the financial process the financial aid process see what assistance is out there\nI see what the actual cost is going to be in then eliminate the colleges that you're not interested in go visit them then now one of the one in the principles that I mentioned a few minutes ago as ... not all colleges are created equal\nAnd this is going to come out when you do when you choose a college the way that I'm Talking about because if you only choose a handful of colleges and then go visit and then go to the financial aid process you're just going to find out what the financial aid is not going to be able to be shocked\nAnd so when I'm wanting to do is create a competitive situation between these different colleges so that the actual cost is what drives the boat\nAnd and the analogy that I Would use for that uh would be buying a car you know what's one way that you can overpay for a car you can go into a car dealership letting the salesman know that you bought the car\nNow if you want to pay the most for that that's fine but if you want to pay a reduced amount for that and you you need to create a competitive situation I'm for that car dealer you need to go into it or not letting them know that you've already pre chosen the university\nUm that you could walk away very easily and they need the gave me the deal that you need a so let's just take a break there and we'll come back after the pause 'em and will continue from their\nSocial Security benefits are key party planning for retirement many people believe they simply bar and the only decision to make is that what age to begin with five hundred sixty seven waste involved in three thousand different rules about nothing\nThey simply by making the minimum wage law three thousand different nothing\nThat says you're not really their minds to learn more about this argument is\nBetter understand how long you live in New York City when you're in the outlying areas for six or twenty two twenty nine eleven a\nShopping spree limited leaders are registered to online and um my comments off\nAgain revolves\n\n\n\n\n\nAround a little bit different\nYou know the principles that I was trying to get across to use this idea that you need to limit school choices based on the tuition costs is a little misleading\nBut that's the way most parents look at the situation um the actual cost of college to the parent isn't necessarily driven by that is driven by the financial aid process the difference between the two\nSo you will fine because all colleges are not created equal that you have a very different situation between universities you some universe and they provide very little sister should provide other on other universities that ... a lot of us\nSo the cost is going to be the the two\nSo you might find that a more expensive school is costing less than a less expensive school\nSo the one I was trying to make is in the selection of the ... in the college selection process that you go to you with your children limiting school choice does not necessarily reduce a fair share of college costs\nShould you send your children to the more expensive school I have no idea\nI'm not suggesting that I'm not suggesting that you send your children the most expensive schools so that you can obtain that much because I actually have the option is going to be so long\nAnd the most expensive schools so that you can obtain that most date because actually part of the airplane quite often is going to be some lunch might not be loans it might be some grants and various things that don't have to be\nPaid back but quite often it's going to be some loans that do need to be paid back so all I really want is for parents to make that decision with their children independently of these published tuition rates so in my previous example that I talked about\nWith all run into my team you know both very fond engineering skills you know is it the right decision from the child to go to MIT is it the right decision ... I have no idea\nI just don't want the MIT possibility to be eliminated because the tuition costs us twice what all bringing us\nSo what I was talking um before the break about is is just a little bit different little bit of a difference in how we go about choosing a college and what most of the time when people do is uh most of the time the students pick the [noise]\nThe colleges that their friends are going to or who their football uh who won the ... um you know who they rate for who they tailgating for who they kind of raised\nUh watching on TV and so forth\nOr they might they might choose a certain university because of the curriculum\nYou know like a veterinarian I think a lot of people went to Auburn for that and that's fine I just want people to go about it a little bit different\nInstead of choosing a handful of college is going to visit those colleges and waiting down the list I Want people to have it I Want people to ... down the list based on the actual cost of college", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Steve West News Hour", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "07"}
