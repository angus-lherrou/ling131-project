I'm ... and as much as some people out there don't believe that the oh no\nHe cheated oh no she cheated oh no they were emotionally unavailable oh no you can say whatever you want to say but at the end of the day\nMy conviction in my belief is that there are two people that entered into the covenant and there are two people who if you're honest unreal and if you want to move on with your life and get into another relationship you will identify the things that you did the things that you could have done better\nStop focusing on the other person stopped talking all about everything that they did oh well she did this to me and he did this to me that won't help you heal what helps you heal is finding what you could have done differently what you could have done better because here's the deal you can't change another person\nReally no you can't talk [laughter] you know you can only change yourself yeah that's right and and by the way you only change yourself best when you let God\nDo it well yeah I make sure that we have the power to change ourselves all by ourselves you know that has to come in well to do some molding and ... and I don't\nKnow we can change ourselves but the question is how\nRight so you can change your so I'm not sure if I make it worse you can change drill to become harder and harder and change yourself to hate man sheriff self to hate women you can change yourself took to blame other people and be the victim okay but ... or you can let God come in and change your heart\nAnd then you can begin to look at things even differently and it reminds me of another situation that I ran into\nA another person that called the church and uh and was looking to uh to take part in our divorce recovery program\nAnd she said to me it hit me out of nowhere I don't know what happened\nUh it was so unexpected we were going to church all the time you know we we were going you know to X Y Z church I thought everything was going well and I thought things were great and then out of the blue he came to me one day and said I Want a divorce I was devastated because I thought everything was going great\nAnd you know here's the thing there are a lot of people out there\nWho hear those four words\nAnd and it devastated them because they they had no idea what's coming right at ... and here's the thing and I'll just be real ... sometimes we put our heads in the sand sometimes we are not recognizing the warning signs sometimes we don't see the things that that are happening because we just want to see them\nAnd so this particular young lady said to me I never saw it coming I I I never saw it coming in as we began to talk and as I began to to to to talk to her and the council her et cetera\nAll of a sudden little things you know\nThey'll come in as we began to talk and as I began to to to to talk to her and the council her et cetera all of a sudden little things you know are you you know I ... I didn't even think about that oh I didn't even notice that and\nThat's what happens in a lot of cases so I you know I mean so there are a lot of different cases where people have have reached out and as they've reached out again they want to blame everybody else and they want to say I never saw was coming but at the end of the day\nThe signs are there signs of their ... so ... and your particular case Leslie when when people were calling you I'm sure you've had friends call us and they and they you know shared with you oh my God you know this was happening what would have been some of the stories that that you've had well\nYou know it has mostly been the other person's fault you know people call you up and they want to talk and they say you know what I'm getting to the point where I Want a divorce I no longer want to be married and I think for women I'm most women feel as if they are\nIn the ... ... um they they you know complain about he's whether he's not helping with the children he's not helping with the house is a fix anything he doesn't come in and watch TV and go to work and and they feel that there are in their marriages alone I Will tell you\nUm that I Am not an advocate for I Am divorced I Am not an advocate for divorce okay\nI knew that I was not going to be going through a divorce so it was absolute denial I knew that guy was going to work this out I gave this situation to him to work out and we were going to come out with a testimony mhm\nThat didn't happen okay so for me I just it was straight denial and so you know first things first I had to go before gotten prayer um I had to seek his wisdom and his vision but really it was my own vision that I decided that I was going to accept\nSo but let me let me back up for a moment yeah um did you did the two of you go through counseling\n[noise] okay\nIf he wanted to call it that um we went for about a two sessions and I'm somewhat you\nKnow my my ex did not want to continue so so let me say this now\nWhat I have found in my counseling is that a lot of men right ... ... they fall in one or two categories mostly not not all man and repeatedly don't call the station and and Sam men bashing or or whatever but\nThere are a good number of men who followed him one of two categories either a\nThey go just to check the box they go just so they can say when they're standing in court yet wearing counseling didn't work irreconcilable differences that's number one\nOr number two um they they go because I'm or ... so he did they go for that reason or they don't want to go right that that they they say there's no point I don't want to go there is nothing that can become of addicts cetera uh and so they don't go to counseling ...\nBefore he didn't last very long before you go any further let me let me just take a pause\nRight ... right here are we just had a caller called in to the show the caller did not want to come on the air but the caller had a question that or that he wanted me to address and the caller is\nA a want it to know um if if um I knew I could recommend therapist or therapy ... I'll say a couple of different things the first thing that I'm going to say is that I Do therapy uh I Do therapy you know personally I I'm all set myself [laughter]\nSo now that said uh I Do\nTherapy so I Am a I Am a I'm a Christian counselor I also can do what they call secular therapy or so I can do a therapy and I've done a lot of divorce therapy or a with a lot of men single man\nA lot of couples et cetera so um to zero five six three to seven seven nine nine or please feel free to give me a call and more than happy to uh either\nUm talk to you about about my counseling or\nMore importantly um to give you resources for other cancers as well because here's the thing um I Do crushing counseling and I believe in that but I also understand that there are some people who need clinical\nTherapeutics ... that's right and that's not the same as you're going to get when you go to see your pastor or that has its place but I also am a strong believer that when it comes to divorce clinical therapy is oftentimes\nGo to see your pastor or that has its place but I also am a strong believer that when it comes to divorce clinical therapy is often times so very important because there are so many different tools and\nResources that clinical therapists have that Christian counselor to just do not have and next week as a matter of fact we're actually going to have a clinical therapists that's our ... our special gas\nUh L. S. Williams is going to be our special guest next week a clinical therapist is going to be here and you're going to have an opportunity to call in\nA and ask questions et cetera but if you are looking for therapists please give me a call at two zero five or six three to seven seven nine nine a that is the number of that is my number to the church\nAnd I'm more than happy to talk to you and help you determine whether a Christian counselor or a clinical therapists are as good there are several different clinical therapist that I I certainly believe in and I can recommend a and I'll and I'll tell you I see a therapist at first when I see a therapist on an ongoing basis\nOr because I Believe in therapy you like to see a doctor on an ongoing basis right or your body et cetera\nI Believe that you ... when it comes to mental health I Believe that you should have a clip of therapists that you're going to on a regular basis as you're working two or working through things in life shore and even Leslie I we believe very strongly that you don't wait until you're having problems before you see a therapist that try it you see the therapists\nAhead of time it it's um\nIt's like a pre checkup and it's like a preventive care and preventive care it's like going you know so ... you know I don't want to get cavities I don't I don't want to have to have a root canal so let me make sure that every six months I'm going and I am seeing a therapist\nAnd most health insurances offer services for um mental health\nSo I Would encourage you encourage you to chat with your health insurance carrier because a lot of them offer at least five or six free sessions and then they'll offer um you know where you can just use pay as your co pay for it so check with your health insurance carrier as well yeah and\nAgain you know for for the call or that that called in and we absolutely respect the fact that he didn't want to come on the air but uh again please feel free to give me a call you can call me on my direct line at uh area code two zero five six three to\nSeven seven nine nine and I'm more than happy to talk with you and I recommend a counselor\nOr whether it is a counseling that I Do or whether it is a clinical therapist\nAgain I go to a clinical therapist or and I I Know several in this area that are very good and uh we're actually going to have a clinical therapists on next week so we can talk a little bit so so Leslie let me let me pick back up a before we close and and uh and and kind of jump back into where you were\nOr where you were talking about uh your feelings right and what happened with you\nAnd and my denial mhm right so you know I I did go to God and prayer I saw him I I wanted to know 'em ... wants to become a nest from what I did um I knew enough to at least get down and prayer\nAnd [noise] you know and God did not answer my prayers but it's funny because you know it's not funny but I'm Ron it it's ironic thank you can um ... it's ironic that you know here I said today like nine years later\nAnd you know happily married but I I just did not see I did not understand that that time\nI'm I'm Sorry I didn't know Norway ... excuse me I Need to go back for more on one second you said happily yeah like like really really happily you know\nAnd at that time when I'm I'm Sorry I didn't ... excuse me I Need to go back for willing to one second you said happily\nYes like like really really happily you\nKnow [laughter] 'cause I'm thinking there's a word than happily [laughter] they're there I Am a cat [laughter] we will get you know what to say I\nI mean you know that but you know what we'll get to our story for her to hear it again okay honey [laughter] any\nCase um but you know he he didn't answer my prayer and so you know when it came to my ex I was totally in denial I'm going to wait on this\nI'm going to you know let him move through whatever he's going through and I'm going to wait right because there is no way we are going to throw away all that we've accomplished all you know our children is no way we're going to throw away our future and your friends I wouldn't my editor gather\nMy friends well okay the majority of my friends\nWere were there they had some roof\nTear off the top prince you know but then I had left the tire friends well okay I did have a friend [laughter] okay [laughter] really I did have a friend who want it to do some damage [laughter] we're slashing tires were spray painting signs and we're going to do some damage and I'm like\nNo we're not going to do any of that um but it was it was truly denial in the beginning and when you when you hear the when you hear yourself say those words here um\nI I Want a divorce it it's now been this long and I have to move towards that that's the realization I mean it just tore apart it tore me apart I'm having to search for an attorney\nHaving to to you know talk to people about this to to um learn information having to tell everyone that that coming right oh my gosh yes yeah\nYeah how do I made a deliberate and at first of all forget everybody to tell your children yeah\nRight I mean I I got there tears yeah yeah I got that her I was the one that told them initially okay um and that you know it it it it tears you apart it here she is a part in it and I knew this that this does not have to be\nAn ... and ... there's there's often a struggle in all of this and who tells the children first days sometimes there's a rush to try to tell the kids right right and then sometimes there's the the majority and the columnist and says let's tell them together\nAnd again I mean we talked about this last week divorce it with the decency yeah hopefully that's your story if you're going through this and it was unfortunately that was not\nThat was not my story\nUm while I'm that's that's pretty interesting was so listen\nOr we appreciate your joining us this week I'll come back and joined us next Sunday at five thirty central time we have a life that's next week we have a live just next week we're going to talk a little bit about the T shirts and the giveaways that I told you all about ah there are coming\nUp but why don't you join us next week at five thirty commitments we can and Leslie I'll be here and I'll be back and we'll look forward to see you next week five thirty\nThrough twelve thirty one and their senior year in their primary looking in income during that time period that's a change and that's why they're allowing people to file the application on October the first as opposed to waiting until the end of the year\nFor taxes to being done now there's about three areas that I Want to point out before the break\nUm some areas that people make some decisions in that creates a ... a problem for the base year and the first areas that is what happens when we sell assets and the typical scenario that I run into are people that have been saving money for college\nTheir child's entire life they set up a college by when they were young\nThey put it maybe put it in in next fun or mutual fund or something that's grown over the years and it's the child gets into high school and as they get closer\nTo college they begin to sell those assets a which is a very smart move in fact one of the biggest mistakes\nThat parents make with a college savings is not doing that they don't reduce the amount of risk a reduced the volatility associated with their investments for their child for college and then run the risk of a two thousand eight type event where the market\nReduced the volatility associated with their investments for their child for college and then run the risk of\nA two thousand eight type event where the market corrects so as we all get closer as our children get closer to college we need to liquidate these funds make them available or remove the risk and so forth so it's a very smart idea the problem\nIs that when you do that you're going to pay capital gains of even mess in his money over a long period of time you typically going to have pretty large capital gains well then a capital gain is treated as income that income goes into the but if it happens during the base here\nWhich is pretty much when the child is in high school um it's going to go in and decrease urine eligibility for financial aid\nAnd then the second situation that we run into is where someone sells their house very similar situation\nUm there's been a lot of tinkering with the taxes associated with your primary residence over the years and and currently when you sell a house about certain threshold of game you will pay taxes so often quite often I see someone I'm kind of in a downsizing phase kind of getting ready for the\nChildren to go off to college the empty nesters around the corner\nThere thinking they want to get rid of the uh expensive house a with a lot of upkeep and um they don't need the school system any more they want to get rid of the property taxes and so forth it's a it's a very smart move I'm downsizing getting ready for retirement very very smart move\nThe problem is when you sell your home if you have any large gain you are going to absolutely wipe out your eligibility for financial aid and a lot of people looking at these types of situations have been living in a home raise their children gone through their entire life\nThey have a lot of equity in their home a lot of gaining their home and they just need to be careful about doing this I'm not saying that they shouldn't do it I'm just saying that you have to be careful about selling any kind of asset during the base year\nSo it because it will make you an eligible for financial lady decrease the amount of financial aid the chicken receive and then the third area then I Want to cover up very quickly before the break 'em that I get into a line is is when grandparents are involved\nYou know I Love grandparents most of us wouldn't be able to make it without grandparents um they're an awful lot um help as we speak\nOr my ... mother one grandmother it's taken our dog to the vet um while I'm recording the show and I and I desperately need grandparents and a lot of parents who are very much dependent upon grandparents to help financially\nWhich is quite a lot of grandparents want to help out with college the problem is according to the financial aid rules when a grandparent and gifts money to a child is what we call a resource\nIs considered a resource and a resource decreases financial aid\nSo you may remember in previous weeks when we were talking about the um the student wanting to go over um if there was a child in the financial need five thousand dollars going to Auburn and a grandparent gave a channel five thousand dollars they now have no financial need\nSo this is the situation that grandparents can actually backfire\nBy giving resources to the student so you have to be very careful about grandparents being involved how they help the way they help and we'll continue this discussion when we come back from break because\nThey're very careful about grandparents being involved how they help the way they help and we'll continue this discussion when we come back from break because I'm I'm running out of time and I just want you to understand\nThe way that the best way that grandparents can help the grandkids [noise]\nIn Social Security benefits or Tea Party planning for retirement and many people believe they simply bar and the only decision to make is that what age to begin with Bob ... seven ways the ball and three thousand different rules Apollo

[noise]\nLet's continue our discussion\nTo kind of help in a situation that happened you know I could not the Wilson's could not get through life without our friends and [noise]\nUm [noise] financially though a lot of parents are very much dependent upon the grandparents to help\nAnd but there's a certain way they need to do that and not do that\nUm most of the time when we left off in the before the break we were talking about resources because most of the time when when the grandparents gives money to the child\nIs going to be counted as a resource and it's going to hurt their financial aid usually another situation that I see\nA and the grandparent won't give money directly to the university and this is this is generally at the suggestion in their advisors or there's an estate planning reason for that\nI'm a little bit beyond the scope of this um the show but what what they're really talking about what they're trying to do is reduced the size of someone's state\nOr by allowing him because the Doris allows you to give money directly to the university and not be limited uh there's an AOL amount that we are able to give\nA this limited by the IRS and there's an exception to now an exception is if you pay the University of directly so a lot of advisors will tell the grandparents especially those with the largest state\nTo give that money directly to the university the problem with that is when they do that is going to be considered a resource it's going to a dollar for dollar reduce their financial Nate dollar for dollar reduced the raid\nSo how can grandparents' health\nWell in general when I tell parents is that if there is a strong need for financial aid\nYou need to maximize the resources that they are out there\nTell the grandparents to hold onto it um because what most likely will happen is that when they go through the financial aid process they're going to have lunch that means they're going to have some grants but they're also going to have lunch let the grandparents pay off those loans after school\nTo let them go through the process because the financial aid process as an annual process starts when the child is before the child goes off to college but it happens every year every year it looks back two years so until they get to the second semester of their junior year\nKnowledge but it happens every year every year it looks back two years so until they get to the second semester of their junior year they're still going to be falling and you'll renewables for financial aid that is the point in which a parent or grandparent could help out they could pay off the student loans and so forth\nSo not usually it's a I certainly don't want to discourage any grandparents from helping\nBut in a situation where we need to maximize financial aid the best situation generally is to wait wait until the end up college um pay off their student loans and so forth\nUm so let's move on I Want to finish out the section today\nJust talking about continuing a discussion of assets\nIn general are in this is going to lead into some planning ideas that you can use to maximize the aid or for your child\nAnd what's important for you to understand is when with respect to assets what counts for financial aid when what doesn't count for financial aid because\nThere is different treatment of assets and so one of the planning maneuvers is that you move assets between these different things some things count some things don't count\nBecause that allows you to maximize the aid\nUm the time at the assets that you have at the time in which you apply is what the financial ah the what the fast requires so these are planning maneuvers that you would do before you sign the application because it's whatever assets you have the time of application", "show_name": "The Steve West News Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "21"}
