F. to president Donald Trump they use that worked for the exact same reason I'm On national TV I'm a call this out and the black community it's going to give me a heads up about it yeah yeah but the\nDifference I see in this or is it was that word with specifically used they knew as they were going in and to her response that phrase that he ...\nHe thought about that before he went on that I Can't I don't I Do not see that I think that when Kanye West drop the profanity I think that just it just kind of came out I don't think that he intended to it just happened\nHere to saint ... see if\nI Can't say what can you ... ... and I can't say with this young man was thinking when he said that that could have just came out because that's the way he flow because if you listen to them like I said we're ... so but they but they use the word Weiss again\nYou can't get course twice right okay so ... ... did the first time he knew he did he did it again so again you're given him a passing a given\nKnow I'm I'm not I'm not I'm what I'm saying is with\nHe did the first time he knew he did he did it again so again you're given him a passing a given\nYou know I'm I'm not I'm not what I'm saying is when the environment and when you're critiquing or in Iran and you're giving whatever political advice you're going you're breaking things down heat targeted that word specifically to undermine Kanye West in the intelligence of con you\nWell know now that I don't believe but I think he used to um a rouse the audience ... because that's what a lot of black folks were thinking I don't think you use the undermine because nobody cared about ... ... it was right now and the black men didn't know about it I mean they've been going on here who uses that word\nIn this day and age ... in front of the president at Brown again you you can't recall you pay no I'm not getting ... but you're saying there's got to have a tickle in that he thought about it and he wanted to get out there and use the\nCredit because it's an insult Joe it is a complete in your mind in any assault\nAnd what can I was there was an insult to the office of president same thing\nThey want us yeah but one what specific you can tell Joe by the way the economy was going it's slipped he shouldn't have said it agree no no profanity but this was thought about he said it's only vaguely\nUsed that word he used that word now but he's the typically use that word which is different than you know the gangster terminology of it ... but he specifically used that wrong word if\nYou listen to the whole interview oh I Do it right and you use a lot of ... we're um to describe Kenya where that was not the only way that will make up of in media because we can talk about it and people get sensational out about it but he used a lot of other wars and the side of the house in we're okay\nTo describe it west okay so here's the thing we got the I'm saying\nWhen you're talking on national TV you talking on national radio and you saying these words about people we have a responsibility ... like I just almost slipped instead of the word of ... it almost came on I caught my thought that that wasn't the word that was ...\nRight right but I'm just saying at the end of the data when we're saying and doing these different things when we send in these platforms we have to be careful of what we say and best because I don't like it was what he said ...\nDon't give me All right Don limit or anybody else the right to call him that on national TV Now I saw him in person and that's the way I truly feel about you and I got a problem with going hey let's go ahead a rock would you believe that when I got to say right ...\n... it saying well you're not stepping in line with the rest of us is the ... know that that that whole the whole coffee can criticism on CNN of than your Kanye West shouldn't be out there\nPeriod Ron\nI'm going to say this is like me saying best to devote okay she should not be\nUh education person for the United states of America she's not qualified\nIs that she's white you're not 'cause she's a woman he's not qualified to be in that position Ben Carson to be the head of hood Mm very smart guy and he is not qualified to do that job okay\n... West is not qualified to talk about prison reform that's all I'm saying that's all a lot of people to say if you're not qualified on how the qualifications what are you talking about you sound like an idiot when you come and talking about the ... the vote talk about education\nSome of the stuff she says she's not qualified to be as he has no background and she's making lows leaves me change and things in education is a shame that many laws she's just she make aren't thinking policies education or the department of education I used the Mali is not qualified\nShe is making stupid things without an accounting background information good for you brown yeah because the department of education needs to be dissolved\nShe is making stupid things without an accounting background information good for you Brian yeah because\nThe department of education needs to be dissolved\nBrian just because you have a certain feeling you have a position for feel ... you don't want when you vote for people you both for what qualified people right yeah OK you both qualified people\nI Want somebody who is going to be articulate on the issues that hand and be able to discuss them\nAbsolutely okay but I'm not I didn't but nobody voted gone yeah well I mean this whole thing is like it's almost as if we're like\nSay okay well on us but he's been speaking on a policy for this country that can have a repercussion its own down the road if they are listening to this guy right qualify he's\nNot qualified to articulate the individual aspects of prison reform I agree but if he's passionate about it and he's got the president's ear and the president is going to move forward and bring in a group of people to\nDiscuss this I have no problem with somebody running a ... step\nAway over the fence because there and bring in this person do this year\nYou we have not seen any of that stuff you just put out there we're talking about we are we talking about what we have the right but yeah I was like wait a minute blacks houses sit at the table with President Donald Trump yeah ... ... ... ... said at the table with a hidden about a think tank we didn't know but nobody else we're talking about a jump around and Kenya with like you always\nHave been ... was Jim Brown will go in there on ... primary hold on\nWhat you always feel any effects matter ... this is what we've seen ... will get all this other stuff you bring it up is not factual there is no think tank there is no other people there is nothing\nRight now we don't know bears were not an applicant brilliant that you're waiting to Joe and what am I my ... definitely now we're not that we're now we're not seeing this of course we're not saying we don't want to sign a paper burned [noise]\nLook at the hypocrisy that you're saying right oh okay okay I don't want to hear you saying we don't know no we don't we don't know what's going on behind the eight so we can't really discuss it I'm ... I'm saying that if you want to bring up a specific thing\nThat he's passionate about any in the president or whoever is willing to listen to go okay well let me look more into that you can start it conversational way out and you're saying\nYou it let me see this happen Kanye West's runs for senator just like you he wins your position he's not qualified Brian how are you going to feel well it's the people who are about what is that how you go field well he's not qualify you more qualified\nFor the job the but he ran because he's telling you where he said that he did the job he's making politics are you going to agree with that guy Brian ... no ... and it was the only reason why I ran against Roy Moore because Roy Moore is unqualified\nThat's my point that's my point\nI Want I Want somebody in there but again it regardless of whether or not you're qualified if you were passionate about something and you want it to be raised awareness were that particular issue you should be able\nTo see a link up now they're saying that you think ... was his passion about prison reform I Believe he is\nWhen we come back from break bond please tell me go to the computer goes through good tell me what you did in the last five years Oprah's a referral show me his passion his music whatever please show me something\nI Want and why and\nWhat I mean for its own owned the uh on the on on when he was talking about um the ... the anthem didn't as announced national anthem he was sitting down before the um they actually they called they called it on camera then it became an issue\nHere's the thing we call the ... oh but before that before that he wasn't doing anything I'm with you a hundred percent my but here's the thing where I put 'em ... and Kevin you go into the two different levels not that I agree that he ... they were doing it on the plane the more than almost they would call a governor gives right now\nHis money and a lot of his time is going back to what he's saying he's set up a foundation so he's putting his money and his time where his mouth you know it took a while but it may\nAlready did how did you say let's say who who's to say that Kanye with this new passion that is clearly coming from ... when ... you're All right so we want to just wait a couple of years over the other\nI Would say OK yeah until that time you're just going to criticize him like everybody criticize are calling ... calling ... to criticize him until he did when he me because I see now that same thing with ...

I've that I've seen it firsthand\nI Know you know market will present all the work to do with the ... three camping all the stuff that you do you know in your home town and man you know I Can't say how much are truly appreciate you being my friend well how do you do\nI Love your brother love right to know the British in my living my mind when I when I met\nYou know you and I can go back for one of these issues but you know there's a deeper thing that we do need to get into before we get out of here prison form a series of ...\nYou and I can go back and forth on these issues but you know there's a deeper than that we do need to get into before we get out of here prison former series\nOh it's completely Syria and this is\nWhy I'm so upset with ... ...\nBecause I feel like you know he came in and hijack that because that's what his wife done you know he came and went and talked to the president because he was going to be with you any any water down the process and we already been battling in the black community about prison reform\nThat passes got lambasted mhm okay for going to talk to president Donald Trump above a prison reform\nNothing has happened that we know of and this border art that has come up policies or anything from the White House okay whatever group or whatever there has been in no action says then old prison reform in the ... I\nCan I tell you something you're there is not going to be anything that can come from the White House that will fix it and here's the thing and I'm going to kind of give you a little\nDifferent perspective on the ... going in an hijacking it there and why it could be a good thing because you have senators\nLike Rand Paul Kamala Harris Cory Booker Elizabeth Warren um uh the late\nJohn McCain and Lindsey Graham they have all talked at ... about ... prison reform and nothing gets done and they are qualified people who have been within the legislative process but they have also been lawyers and\nThey know what's wrong but nobody wants to give them a time of day ... and here comes this clown ... Khan gay west acted like a clown like he always does and but what are we talking about right now we're talking about prison reform\nYou may not like how it's being talked about but we're talking about it so maybe that being in the limelight for just a little bit ... that we can get a serious conversation\nInstead of the conversation ... ... like the pastors that went up there and got land blasted you know they they criticize these black pastors for going up and talking to President Trump why should day that's what they were talking about and\nIt could be a good thing but then again it could be as you're saying that he's just hijacking and just wants to you know here himself speak which I you know more inclined to go with he just wants to hear him so to speak\nAnd ... and I'm an act we as a tad bit\nMaybe it has some effect maybe possibly but here's the thing that I Would say for anybody that gets a chance to sit in front of the president of United States of America and talk about an issue\nYou need to make sure that you have the right person 'cause sometimes just because you live or you may need to bring somebody with ... that qualify to talk on it\nIt's great to be in the spotlight is great to get the news going about you but when you say you're passionate Brian\nI'm not the best guy who knows how to tie time\nWhen I was there trying to tell us how new is bad I mean what did I Do you asked me that that does and stuff that the women in a time that you see that you know something better than me what do I do you step son I said by the way because there's always somebody who knows you know something better than me I mean I knew everything I'm hard work but I don't know everything them when we have issues like this\nJust because you're a celebrity does not make you to write messenger and I can live or to deliver that message to the president or the ... in an on a national stage\nInternational as you've got you've got celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio and that'll get up on the un and start talking about climate change and a lot of facts but now there are incorrect facts but because he's a celebrity\nIn order to Caprio that'll get up on the un start talking about climate change and a lot of facts but now there are incorrect facts but because he's a celebrity and people want to look it's an eye it's it's I dollar tree in a sense and because we have this form of celebrity worship and that's\nMy issue with the whole economy worsening it's more of the celebrity worship that we have in trying to make people credible that don't need to be credible and why I roll my eyes at the whole situation and why I just kind of brushed it off because I see it more as a dollar tree and that's kind of you know like\nTaylor Swift coming out and saying that she was gonna you know people should vote for the Democratic candidates in Tennessee and people are cheering and then people are viewing herb depending on your political ideology but you're elevating somebody who isn't as you said it's qualified to make those decisions\nBut one thing about this with a completely different than everybody doesn't came out she said this is who I'm voting for ... she said go get rid of ... to ...\nGo get educated and vote for the person that best serves you and your family values are very smart she was not now with some people go back and follow her because she voted for the person that will be just because of that yes\nAnd that and that's wrong to vote for somebody because your favorite celebrity is voting for them\nBut if Donald Trump to that's what Donald Trump does that's what they all politicians\nWell I'm In Little Rock Obama held back when they I mean that's you know and this is\nWhat all they do they don't do something when you go out and endorse these people they don't really know them they for the same party yeah so they want their party to win and what the president's supposed ... everybody does what does that so what tell us with the U.S say was very smart", "show_name": "The Steve West News Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "13"}
