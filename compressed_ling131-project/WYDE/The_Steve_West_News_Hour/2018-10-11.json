the shot and everything\nYeah yeah well don't forget when he was young up this is what health care while he was shooting had Republican conservatives this is for health care\nOr of course the Democrats don't want you to listen to that because he was a Democrat in that case just like every other case that's a ... a ... called the Democrats I'm getting fed up with them tell you the truth ah\nKnow are they going to push so hard and keep pushing but again I don't I don't understand why nobody's has seen it for the last\nThirty forty years I've known since the eighties and uh you know you got to think about what if a if the jobs are not being able to buy those coming in through immigration than what is our immigration ... unless it's just a racist plan to\nTake away the middle class a superiority and the political arena you know you you really need to think about what Edward Kennedy did in Nineteen sixty five when he opened up a border\nAnd she was highly upset in uh in what he did\nWhat do you think he's trying to say hey man garden yeti other's best friend's sister [laughter]\nNo ... mother's best friend\nOkay so that means they don't really know that I\nKnow that said that they were highly upset but what he was he was all over the place I'm going to be honest with you\nI don't have a problem if he wants to be a Republican that we know that\nThere's a government run health care and abortion and uh uh you know they say pro choice that's a nice ... you have a choice of whether to kill a baby or not kill the baby and your liberals say that it's just a blob is it's not a person\nNow I'm not a Bible scholar but I read the Bible every day and I've gotten quite a few verses in the Bible that ... tells me that is not a blob and I'm not going to read all of them because I Know it was a lot of people trying to call in but I won't read just two or three of them it proves that is not a blob and this is right out of the Bible\nAnd the my favorite one is Jeremiah won five it says before I form the end the belly I knew the and before that came as fourth out of the one mile sanctify the\nAnimal read another one here uh Saddam's twenty to ten now are my God from my mother's belly\nAnd I say a forty nine one says they lowered have called me from the one now there are several more but since I Know the time and show it out or not read them and then the other thing is government run health care\nNow I'm old man and one I was little I I had problems with a pneumonia and uh I I had it bad several times I mean I had like a fever of a hundred and five\nAnd a I was at home and of course back then doctors came to your house and but but I was suffering so bad I begged my parents to get the doctor to the house and so are the doctor came to our house and he gave me a great but go shot and and\nI imagine he charged my parents maybe twenty or twenty five dollars and I got over that pneumonia and and at that experience just twenty or twenty five dollars in today if that it happened I Would have probably been in the hospital for a week in a bill probably been ten thousand dollars or more\nThat's true and and today I Am a going to a a dermatologist in this doctor he's a good doctor and he don't like the food with all this government healthcare crap\nAnd so he charges a basic forty dollar fee for an office visit and does what a what on he needs to do to get me a while and there's he doesn't have to hire any extra help to do paperwork and doesn't have to send anything to Washington to get approved and I walk out with a little receipt and that's it\nWow all doctors can be like then huh yeah and I\nI Am reading a book right now I'm I'm not even before the way through it about the big brother in the exam room it tells about all the problems with government run health care and I want to read three or four short\nQuotes from what doctors think about government run health care I'm not going to give the doctor's name because I don't have permission to but this doctors from Kentucky and I quote\nI Am a solo practitioner and unable to keep up with a massive amount of ruse if it is your goal to force me out of Medicare than you are about to be successful\nHere's a doctor from Texas and I quote in Nineteen Ninety nine I achieved my lifelong dream of becoming a physician\nInstead I was forced to become a paper Bush or an answer to the insurance companies and government bureaucracies that but we are bureaucracies that took time and care away from my patients so now my lifelong dream and passion has become a job\nI no longer enjoy going to the office I'm no longer enjoy going to the operating room\nNo longer enjoy going to the operating room\nHere's a doctor from Oklahoma and he's all ready to quit because of it and I quote I finally quit at the beginning of this year at age forty five I was spending fifty percent of my time meeting quality and other incentives rather than caring for patients\nBefore I quit so that that's what some doctors think about government run health care so Mr ... thank you Yes sir\nThanks for calling brother we got three I mean we've gotten lines for trying to tell her by\nI think I'll thank you for giving me the time the runway\nVote Donald Trump because he's done more football action one ears and Obama did in eight remember that mental next election\nOr do you think you hate yeah welcome\nHey I just heard your last day and want to call in and I don't unfortunately get to listen to you every day but\nYou know they listen to you as often as possible and called them from time to time but I I Can't tell you how much how good of a job you've done first of all just from the basics just you have the perfect\nFemale radio voice doesn't see the ... and\n... yes and you

white boy did do it so [laughter] so\nBasically the thirteenth amendment was outlawing slavery but there and I don't remember the exact quote so just spare with me on that but but except and then went on to say except\nI'm In prison because back then and even tried to do it today you had the chain gain and all that which really is slavery but just because you're working off your debt to society\nAnd so it's a loop hole in there and that's why he what time why ... was trying to get across\nThere is a loophole in there uh about uh if you're in jail than flavor is okay and again I I my
