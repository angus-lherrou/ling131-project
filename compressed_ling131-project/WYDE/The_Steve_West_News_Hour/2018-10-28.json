for in a therapist um I like I said finding a therapist is not as easy as one might think you really have to find someone that you connect with I recall can\nGoing to a therapist and I think she told me more of her problems and I told her mind\n[laughter] right and so that didn't last very long right right and so just finding\nSomeone that you connect with and then moving to this area for me having a Christian therapist is important um and that may or may not be important for other people um whether it's I prefer a female\nUm some you know and now maybe for a male or or it doesn't really matter for some folks at all so um I I think that once you find a good therapist um they should be in your rolodex I'm dating myself with that they should be on your cell phone\nContact last right I'm just like your accounts have always loved the goal was a Roman right I Know\nIt's like your accountant just like your doctors they should be in your phone and you should be able to call them up for for session you know whenever you want to go in for a month or two or whatever you think you need in order to get back on track so can\nYou sought out a therapy as well right yeah um tell me a little bit about your experiences if you will\nYeah so uh you know but ... but before I Do that let me just say if you want to join the conversation toll free eight six six five five one\nNine nine three three again we're talking about a therapy\nOr how do you find a good therapists why do you even need a good therapist so ah but for me when I came out of my divorce um uh uh you know when I came into the process if you will or I knew that I needed a therapist\nBecause there was a lot of things going on in my head there was a lot of thoughts running round of my head and I knew a lot of them were not positive\nAre pissed because there was a lot of things going on in my head there was a lot of thoughts running around in my head and I knew a lot of them were not positive\nAnd I knew that a lot of them were not productive I knew a lot of them were not the kinds of thoughts that were good for me to have on a regular basis or the you know there's anger\nThere's guilt there's fear there is resentment there's all these things and the thing that that I Know is that if you don't find an outlet for that it will eat itself from the inside out um [noise] all of those kinds of feelings\nYou can drink them away you can't drug them away you can't sects them away you can't uh TV watched them away you can't party them away and and I tried a lot of those a lot of those things I tried and a lot of people listening they have tried as well\nUm but at the end of the day that is one of the reasons why I Believe clinical therapy makes so much difference because there are tools that therapists have that can help you get down and do the ... that surgical\nI'm a you know that surgery that's necessary to kind of feel the layers back and get down and and and and allow that that wound that has been covered over by the life and covered over by um\nPride and covered over by motions and everything it allows that wound to to leak or you know one of the things about having a a a wound is one of the best things that can happen is when you cut it and and you know cut into it and open it up and allow it to to bleed out and allow it to to uh I don't know the right word but to leak out or whatever you want to call it\nUm it needs to do that because that how it can clans are itself the longer that it stays covered up the longer that it stays under the surface then more damage that it does to the body so for me when I\nFound myself going through a divorce I went looking for therapists because I knew that I needed someone that could help me or to cut open that wound soared so that all of that bacteria all of that negativity all of that\nA pessimism all of that could could you know can conceive mounted leak out or because for me\nI'm In the position in this situation where I was I had a lot of resentment I had a lot of anger I had a lot of disappointment and a and I had a lot of guilt a there was a lot of guilt that was there too and the thing about most men in my opinion most men will take their guilt and they will attach\nSomething else to it so that the guilt become to minimize the guilt of the things that they have done they don't want it to be about them\nOr they want to try to find a reason why it's about her well she didn't cook as much as she should write she knows how much I like mashed potatoes why in the world where where we have an rice all the time you know so it was it was looking for something\nTo blame someone else for to defy the things that you have done if you look at the end of the day there are a lot of people out there who are going through divorce because they messed up\nA lot of men out there because they messed up\nAnd and saying that somebody else was a better listener saying to somebody else I'm cared more about you listen to you more or gave you sex when you wanted it\nAh I all of those things don't justify breaking the cabinet they don't write it sounds good and trust me I said it myself\nI sat and said well God will understand God will know that um you know she didn't do this and she didn't do that but at the end of the day it's not about the other person is about you write what did you do\nAnd what did you not do and that's the important these\nSo Ken it sounds as if you were active in your own hearing right\nWhat did you do and what did you not do and that's the important these\nSo Ken it sounds as if you were active in your own healing right and I think that's one of that and then next infections if you well fat when folks go to when they visit a therapist accepting the therapist to to be to fix our right as a great point right for the therapist not to fix her\nThat the therapist is not the fix or that the airport is the facilitator right the ... the therapist suggest allows you you know to heal yourself through talking through a exercise as there are a number of different things and and tools that have therapists use is\nSo that you can see you and that's really the name of the game and that's why for me so so when I went to when I went to my first therapist I went to a therapist\nRight after uh right after my divorce as the therapists was so good looking\nOh she was so cute I really can't and I'm like okay I can stay here\nBecause that for me was a distraction okay right now and I knew that what I Would do when I was there instead of being focused on healing myself\nInstead of being focused on getting better and I'd be focused on you know oh she's so hot laugh can cheaply sit in front of me in turn this way really well I'm I'm saying to you that what people have to do is they have to understand that when you go through and therefore healing after and you have\nTo remove any and all impediments any and all distractions whatever they are so for me I learned early on that the best kind of therapists for me that allows me to do work on can as a male therapists\nIf you if you really look at the person when they are in shock there ... or ... or dilated if you really look at them they're they're moving a just a a tad ... lower than everybody else and that's because they are in shock there are people\nThat go through a divorce and they come out on the other end and they feel fine right but there in shock\nAnd eventually the shock will wear off it might take a month that might take a year it might take two years but it eventually we're we're off so one of the things that I'm I'm a big proponent of is to go to therapy when you don't think you need it right\nAnd that's important um ... therapy to me is not something you go to three or four times or five times like the insurance allows you to your a bee to go five times and then you know stop or whatever therapy is the therapy or something that is kind of ongoing something you should keep going and even if you think you're fine\nMake sure your children are in therapy right you know even if you're fine you know what a great maybe you saw it coming maybe you prepare yourself maybe you were able to kind of\nOf of ... some of of of what happened but your children are not and they didn't see it coming and they didn't know about it so you know even if you don't want to get in therapy put your children in therapy and by the way when you're when you're when you're telling them that that they're going to therapy\nPositioning is everything don't say I'm I'm sending you to see ahead shrink I'm sending you to see you know a mental health professional because you know you you know you're screwed up mentally it's all in how you position at him\nMhm that's very true can't I think in today's age that\nAre young adult I'm a ... mile I'll speak for myself my young children or young adult male children um they are aware of therapy because I've introduced it to them now\nThey fought me to say now about going and they don't go right what they are aware that foundation that you know at least they are aware and I share with them that I go to therapy them on and so I made it something for them in their lives and like you know when when you when you're to the point where you're dating someone seriously\nAnd even before you get to that point you you want to seek therapy because there is actually from this divorce ... they have an impact at great length right and like you said I Do believe that\nNow they're they're covering up something right open and praying that one day they will get there but they've been introduced well\nAnd and the thing about it is lovely what you have done as you have made it okay\nYou have normalized to therapy so you have made it okay for them to go and that's exactly what you have to do so give them getting back to your question you asked um you know what can you do to get the most out of therapy so there's just a few little pointers that I Want to to to bring out to every one\nOr the first thing I Would say to you in order to get the most out of therapy is is give it time okay\nUm you know and and I heard you say this many times allegedly you know the divorce didn't happen overnight the marriage did not\nOkay um you know and and I heard you say this many times allegedly you know the divorce didn't happen overnight the marriage did not you know hit decline and go down overnight it when I was it was over a period of time and because there was a period of time\nThen you have to give it the same period of time to allow yourself to come out and he'll so when you're going to therapy don't go to therapy thinking it's going to be a magic wand\nRight and and don't look for someone else to become your therapy right so a brand new relationship is not your therapy right mhm mhm your best friends has then or why not just the ... right exactly yeah\nYeah somebody else's bad can be your therapy right um what what needs to happen\nIs you've got to give it time\nWhere you go to therapy and you allow therapy to take its course\nAnd it happens over a period of time and I have not been to a good therapist yet in my life where they're able to do everything they needed to do and five sessions right you know when I when I see a therapist right now you know and and what I see a therapist even right now when I went in to see him my thing to him was\nAre just so you know we're going to be moving way beyond five five sessions why because see I have children\nI have young adult children uh that that kind of an oxymoron\n[laughter] it is [laughter] I have y'all go up there yeah I have young I have\nYoung adults I have pre adults um and anybody who has children know that having children will make you go to therapy [laughter]\nIt will it will because in the day that\nWe're living in right now there's so much going on and I strive to be the best parent than I can possibly be but there was a lot of things that are very frustrating a lot of things that happened that\nI just don't get I don't understand and and I need to to to check can I Need to be in a place where I can make sure that I Am a level set and I'm doing everything that I can do to get my children I'm the most objective\nOf the most rational um two thousand Eighteen guidance possible right not not you know Nineteen Ninety eight guidance but two thousand Eighteen\nAnd I will tell you can that you know when you and I started dating it was very attractive to me that that you were able to ... ... oh yeah I see a therapist I\nLiked that idea and you're like I said I [laughter]\nI don't think he hears that man is ... you know he's\nEmotionally intelligent him right he he knows he's aware of his actions or he's at least trying to become aware they are so I thought that was just really great some men\nWell an ... and so that that leads to that leads me to this point\nUm another thing about their because you've got to be honest about it you got to be you got to be honest you got to be honest when you're sitting there\nWhen that therapists asks you tough questions\nQuestions that you know and in public you would say it was her in public you would say no I did it in public you would say whatever when you're in that room because a therapist are bound by confidentiality and so you can trust that when you talk to a therapist and say something to them that that will not\nAh be repeated out into your circle but you gotta give therapy honesty\nAnother thing you've got to have you got to have the right attitude going into therapy you've got to have the attitude that I'm going into therapy to work on me and I expect me to get\nBetter but to me having the right attitude I mean when you make that decision to go do you think the attitude would be one of uh honesty and and hope hope and [laughter] well so who is going into the ... you're not being pushed into man than some individual\nWell let me tell you about attitude because I'm going to call me out on this one when I went into therapy I went into therapy yes I knew I needed\nNot being pushed into man than some individual\nWell let me tell you about attitude because I'm going to call me out on this one when I went into therapy I went into therapy yes I knew I needed help with an attitude I had the wrong attitude because\nI had the stereotypical attitude so the first time the first therapist asked me about my mother told me about your relationship with your mother I'm like oh here we go [laughter]\nBut I mean now that is correct\nI I Will share that my experience after my divorce when I went back to the secular therapist\nHe's like well you know I Want you to take a piece of paper and that's maybe a couple a piece of paper and and find out you know your childhood tell me about your childhood and writing and I'm like really [laughter]\nWhat does this have to do at that price of right and you don't see that right but but they're ... they're actually is a benefit to those questions\nAnd when the therapist started walking me down my attitude at first was bad and mad and it was like okay we're not talking about my momma did you how about you know how this works [laughter] so but what I allow myself to when I changed my added right and I allowed myself to to not be defensive and that's another big\nThing when you go into therapy you can't go in being defensive you've got to go in being open\nWhere you're paying this person so you might as well get the best out of the\nExactly exactly and when you approach it you must approach it like it's something that is necessary to your survival that's how you have to see therapy for me\nI had to go to therapy because I wanted to become whole again\nI Want it to become mentally\nI'm you know mentally okay again I needed to be mentally whale I needed that healing and I knew that I wasn't going to get it out of a beer bottle I knew I wasn't going to get it from a joined I knew I wasn't going to get it\nYou know in somebody else's bad I knew that in order to get it I had to do the work myself and I had to do it on me and I knew somebody to help put me in the right direction and push me and facilitate it but I knew the work was going to be me\nRight I appreciate that time of reflection\nA because it has you know for me he he is just an an awesome husband we both learned some things from our divorces and we've learned some things about ourselves and we continue to learn about ourselves\nYou know we take 'em any anytime we find any sort of tests the name of the tests that we took the Clifton strength finder find her for ... for marriage is wonderful Clifton strength find her for marriage so when you got into the argument with some bad over okay [laughter]\nI'm just saying it was that one [laughter] okay [laughter] but anyway [laughter]\nThis has helped to identify your top uh your strengths than our God given strengths with you and it it's a it's a telling story you know we took the test and I found I found out that my number\nOne strength is that unreliable I'm Still learning about myself which is cool ... myself I can tell him why am I right kind of cool that is great\nIt is so listen a family we appreciate you joining us on this week we've been talking about uh\nAbout a relationship is talking about therapist and finding the right therapists uh hey stay tuned in to joining us or we're going to be talking in the coming days and coming shows\nAbout marriage or about how to make your relationship stronger we're going to give you some tips on state

thirty\nAnd there's a great likelihood that defined whether it's a corporate monitoring this will find that person could default on its obligations another lesson that we learn um was about mortgage backed securities\nProbably most of you are familiar with how Maurice by security is just about brought down the entire economy two thousand\nAnd you know but up until that point more expensive curious or thought of as being very safe\nReal estate was thought of as being very sick people paying their mortgage obligations um once thought of as being very safe I mean most people will pay that you know otherwise the effect where they live in and most people would not have thought about are considered what happened in two thousand eight\nA mortgage backed securities just about destroyed everything in our economy we've never had a period of time where people walked away from the mortgage so much so many short sales short sales were so overwhelming to the banks that they couldn't even\nEver had a period of time where people walked away from the mortgage\nSo much so many short sales short sales were so overwhelming to the banks that they couldn't even get to them or foreclosed properties or I don't know that anybody including myself are recognized a period of time when real estate prices would decrease\nI live in home one\nAt one point in home when we're upside down and our house we had an equity line on our house reduce it to purchase a car\nWould use it for some other things and run it up well when when it came time to renew that equity line we had to go the bank and the value of our home was less than what we ... we were upside down\nMy wife and I have always I'm invested in rental properties at the beach when you're on a number of properties on thirty a very popular\nA rental one destination area between um destined in Panama City\nOut through the years we've invested a lot of money down there and two thousand two thousand nine I don't know that our slumped we went through a period of time that was just the prices down their decreased eighty percent almost overnight\nI remember one of the one of the houses that we have in a really nice subdivision next to Rosemary beach\nThere was only about eight or nine houses what half the houses were in for closure at one point so when you wrote up and down the street there was a lot of overgrown weeds and places that needed a yard that needed to be cut and it was pretty bleak\nUm you know I've never really thought of real estate is a risky investment I didn't necessarily expect real estate to always go up in value\nOr but I never expected it to go down in value the way that it did the two thousand eight and tell us a lot of lessons to tell us a lot of lessons about mortgage backed securities that they weren't as safe as we thought they were\nAh it also taught us a lot of lessons to balance the days and banks a lot of people have always ah invested in cities as a safe way to preserve their income or is it turned out banks had as much trouble with anybody um I don't know that I ever expected so many different things to go under\nIn fact there were so many different things going under around that time period there was a lot of us that salt the F to see\nWhat happened to be bailed out you know they're already bailed out Fannie and Freddie and the automatic all the makers you know where they have to bail and I went out to you know just a very uncertain time very difficult time\nYou know one of the other um lessons that we learn to two thousand eight or about the rating agencies\nOne of the reasons that a lot of us in the investment community did not realize the risk associated with the mind\nJust because they were highly rated and there was a company ... throughout the course of my career that is always ready to balance and raided the possibility of default possibility that into the may not repay that point\nUm things like more security has had a high rating\nAnd that was promised a lot of people you know we just didn't really expect that and a lot of people felt like there was a big conflict of interest with the rating agencies\nThe um the companies themselves were paying the rating agencies to rate them so obviously it was in their best interest to perceive the higher rating\nBecause it was helpful for their bond prices so there was just an awful lot of trouble that came out of two thousand eight and it really left us with this question though is there anything is there anything\nI says so there was just an awful lot of trouble that came out of two thousand eight and it really left us with this question though is there anything is there anything safe anymore or any kind of safe investment that we can find but let's go to the break and when it come back and talk about that more\nI Can't believe he found them he seems sorry we very clearly told them not to like out there I'm honestly impressed the rebate will do that once I

[noise]\nWelcome back let's continue our discussion of\nWe're looking at retirement we're looking to kill us ways to provide income in retirement safe ways to provide income retirement [noise] top this has been the single biggest change in my career what [noise] what we'll do what do I recommend to\nAs being safe a particular gene thousand I made a profound impact on me taught me a lot of different things about investments that are thought worst safe and apparently they have a lot more risk than I think we all realized\nSo there's been a lot of lessons there and this has been the biggest evolution of the recommendations that I make ... how do I find safe things anymore can you find safe things anymore Kenny find say things that actually pay something that actually have a decent meal um\nTwo thousand eight really changed a lot of the way I thought but in particular really cause me to reflect on being able to look at people and say you are not going to lose money look at them across the table and say you know everything has risk\nBut to but the problem with two thousand eight was that so many of the things that we thought did not have the amount of risk had the risk\nAnd that was very scary to a lot of people I've never really been through a period of time like that I'm not old enough to um to known about the depression\nUm but it really didn't have a profound impact upon me and so back to this question of safety you know how do we find safe investments anymore\nYou know I've been talking about bonds bonds have risk\nAnd or even mortgage backed securities or CD these types of things in that but I but the point that I wanted to make there's I'm not saying these things are bad I'm not saying that if you invested in a binary invested in the mortgage backed security or you have money and CDs\nOr with a bank that that's a bad situation I'm not saying that at all what I'm saying is is that the hidden risk\nThat than all of us thought in two thousand eight just needs to be brought out people need to understand the risk associated with these things\nYou know choosing investments selecting thanks for clients are all about risk getting ready to reward risk and reward and so I just want to talk a little bit more about what I Would see as a safe investment\nUpper people consider him again it's not that it's the only investment it's not that I mean this will bonds or bonds and general or these other types of things\nFor people to consider him again it's not that it's the only investment it's not that I mean this will bonds or bonds and general or these other types of things are not good way to provide income I just want people to realize the risk associated with them\nSo when I'm suggesting thanks for clients and I'm trying to help them provide for income what are the things that I recommend to them and say well the first thing that I Want to do this kind of defined what I mean by safe\nAnd this was kind of got the discussion um there's characteristics that I Want to see when it comes to a safe investment\nFor example I Want to see an investment that assessed civil this liquid one that has guaranteed principle very low likelihood of losing your principal and because of that is not going to have a high rate of return\nBut that is the criteria that I Would call safe liquid guaranteed and just to contrast for example a lot of people that I've talked to use the evidence from stocks as a way of providing for their income\nAnd there's a handful of companies out there that you can purchase either individually or through a mutual fund\nThat have a long history of the evidence they've been around for a long time most of them are household names you've grown up with them they've been around a long long time they've have incredible Devon in histories of fifty or a hundred years which is\nPretty amazing when you think about it that the company has paid every now and time never missed a dividend for a hundred years", "show_name": "The Steve West News Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "28"}
