them to me today\nAnd I I don't know I I see I don't know\nWhat to do about that because I'm not saying that didn't happen but it's just the fact that when they go when you go through his social media he's obvious obviously a Trump supporter he has been the Trump rallies chanting Trump is wearing Trump shirts magna hats all this other stuff up\nTheir race just social media\nWell they did but people that have screen shot and killed video and and pictures clearly him like there's no denying that it's this guy yeah\nYeah I I don't know all that I just think that's interesting that you know nobody from those things look up yourself look up yourself and see what's known about you or whatever and it got changed and we don't think that change\nYou know I Know on on what kind of ... fell in with other now\nWell I'm scared to [laughter] shut is it just it it's I I don't think it I don't know what it means they get such as well and\nI have no problem with with people put myself out there too and I really appreciate the people that look that kind of stuff up because it's like today will as soon as this happen thanks so and as soon as this happened\nI'm I'm I said you know we got to rely on the Internet sleuth on this one because people are going to start digging they're going to find out about this guy the government's going to tell us very little and uh here we go we're off to the races that stuff's already happened and you see there with with Ellen ... about Ryan\nYou know ... and you can do it again and again is ... ... ...\nAnd it's only a matter of time before somebody gets hurt before journalists gets hurt before\nSomething really bad happens\nAnd now that this is here it's their chance to jump on the bandwagon and say see we told you\nIn place the blame directly on Trump I even saw CNN CNN has said that time this whole thing and in putting part of the blame on Sean Hannity why of all people that's right wow\nThe media is eating is up they're going to continue to use this against Trump but I think just like all their other\nTactics in an effort to to work the Republicans' chances in the midterms they're actually going to have the opposite effect and they're going to drive more conservatives to the polls to stop this nonsense Jeremy\nHey hey well way I feel about this\nTo stop this nonsense Jeremy\nHey hey well\nThe way I feel about this whole thing is is if it walks like in the house like in the ... for the postal service for a little while and is there one thing that you notice and missing on those packages\nYeah the stamp does show it's been processed\nShows process so um everyone that I've seen are missing key thing\nA number two most fanatical people everybody's calling this guy and uh I'm calling you don't have a upon I'm calling in whatever yes I Am a conspiracy theories of\nThere's a lot of shady stuff the support that all the way back to the Lincoln won't go there but um\nI think about those people that you see that or [noise]\nUm I don't know\nReally trying to get a point across the bumper stickers\nThe bumper stickers always just typically go straight on a window\nOf most people that are the with bumper stickers they're everywhere on a car drain there is this the financing I live in North Alabama I live in um I live in uh outside of foreign\nAnd um there's this one individual and spruce time Alabama which is going from Russell hold down to um to Hamilton to hack a bird\nDude will pull this trailer he's got he's got this piece of plywood that says American Atheists wow and he he just dates people to pull over there they're talking about somebody that's crazy psycho I mean I can see somebody like this doing something like that or whatever but\nThis guy's got stickers everywhere it's all anti Christian stuff and he's just dude who's just dig and for somebody to debate him into proved him wrong but I'm back to what I'm saying look at those stickers look at look at the when the placement only ... there's nothing out of place it all perfectly owned those windows\nUm it just the whole thing smells funky to me from the beginning\nUm you're not going to make a real bomb um I mean I'm not in a bomb making it for me that I've seen them\nIn a that is not a real ball that's as whatever the intent was to cause fear of the calls media hysteria I feel that it's something to\nYou know to get the media pointed toward small you know that he's this crazy Sacco path that it that he's kind of people and that to me that's the whole ...\nSo tell me this I'm Jeremy do you feel that this poor so here in the phone guy from much larger sinister plan absolutely one hundred percent and go mark one from Madison\nYep yep yep I I Love your show appreciate what you're doing and God Bless America\nWe appreciate you brother moving on up next to Jennifer Jennifer how are you have this rich\n[laughter] well I didn't screened the call I just thought it was sorry [laughter] to name well your name Jennifer so then how are you ...\nAnd I'm I'm just I'm starting to see how Jones made all his money uh these conspiracy theorists or\nYou know baffles me how people with zero evidence can buy all in all the credit conspiracy but then when presented with real evidence are in total denial and and\nAll in all the credit conspiracy but then when presented with real evidence or in total denial and and\nI mean we're cocoa for cooking for cocoa puffs here what evidence is there other democratic conspiracy yeah I mean this guy was talking about bumper stickers are askew on is the guy living in a car\n[laughter] you know I mean not either\nLook I'm not you know look I'm the above far not a Trump supporter and this is this this guy has nothing to do with Trump he's crazy you know crazy people have different things that triggered them some of them it's you know when I was a kid it was done to the drag and some of them and people would have died that are heavy metal music\nAnd some people blame porn or whatever crazy people you can't understand them you can understand what's going to trigger them or or what their fetish or or obsession is gonna be this is a nut job is obsession was or\nWho did this it's a ... row nut job\nWell and it it's the same thing that there's people who will take the Bible and completely flip\nIt on ... and take it out of contacts and make it something it's not and then there'll be labeled all their insane Christian or not but I mean it it makes writing is that they were exactly right I kind of feel the same way about this guy and and for all I Know I could be totally wrong but I'm with you I feel like uh\nFor whatever reason I just have this feeling that this guy's just to not let me just completed and not and he went off the air\nWell in in right now at this stage in the game ...\nThere's as much chance to the guy being in a nod as there is some sinister plan put on my my politicians because we just I mean we're just on the heels of of him and this guy out we we don't have the evidence all we have is a a a book cover which is in the form of a van and a mug shot to go on\nUntil we get more information which should come pretty pretty rapidly\nAt any point let me ask a question real quick I'll let you go to me this is a bigger question\nYou know I spent a lot of time on Facebook with with relatives and friends and you know what's the these political post these political means that are clearly\nFactually untrue and it would take very minimal research to understand that they're not untrue but yet people are so desperate to believe\nThese crazy outlandish what is it ... you know how we as Alex Jones so popular why are people so desperate to believe these elaborate conspiracy theories ... it so Greeks it like a mental illness\nI don't get comes from people and just not wanting to except to what we're told and I think it all starts for a lot of people have it's like you're told stuff and you just believe that and you get to a certain age where you realize just because somebody tells me something doesn't mean it's true and then the search for the truth happens and I think sometimes that spirals and some people for some people it spirals out of control\nFor others it's just you know you're going to have wisdom and ask questions instead of just believing everything you're told and I don't think there's anything wrong with that but I think it can lead to in situations like this you're always like well what if it was blah blah blah and again there's nothing wrong with asking questions but I'm with you I think it's just as possible this guy's just a couple of late night I mean that would make to me I'm telling you that much sense\nSometimes the simple answer is the simple answer but this is the most were ever going to agree guys have a great weekend\nThanks rich you know we don't ever agree with rich I'm\nI I don't know I mean I think if you're exploring why people are are blind in\nTo ah to this stuff you need to look at what what brought them to the point that they were willing to to question it and what series of events happen to get people to where they're like you know I think it's possible that our government would do well when I get\nKavanaugh stuff right I mean that's evidence enough to me that I questioned\nWay they are like you know I think it's possible that our government would do that well like a\n... stuff right I mean that's evidence enough to me that I questioned the motives are what they're capable of our health or they'll take\nIt and we're no conspiracy theorists but we've launched the Democrat Party do some things over the past two years that's a really really bother us and it it's really I opening that makes you think what to tell us that\nWho's to tell us they they wouldn't do that right we don't have any evidence that they did\nBut the the fact the Democratic party has pushed us to a point where we're saying it's possible that this is a false flag that people like Alex Jones voice on but we don't really talk about false flag on this show but maybe that's the thing because these people\nThese people they're they're obviously capable of doing it but the biggest thing is they've shown us they're willing to do some\nKind of like have you ever been in a relationship like or things went sour and you realize that this person you thought you know it was lying to you like most of your relationship and it makes you question every single thing that happened and if you stay with them then it makes you question every things that if in the future for a long period of time to the game your truck back I feel like the same thing it's like\nThey broke our trust because I think that they showed us if if they ever had\nThey showed us what they were capable of like you're saying and now we're just questioning everything but I think that's a very human or saw it\nWell and you know everything's normal in the relationship and instead of bringing you flowers and starts bringing your pie bombs\nAnd you're kind of started climbing yeah like I don't you know and I'm actually ... years back\nTo the Alex Jones thing rich a ritual is bringing up though\nI think another thing to look at it as we're looking at when average Americans started accepting conspiracy theories is what was the one thing that ah", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Steve
