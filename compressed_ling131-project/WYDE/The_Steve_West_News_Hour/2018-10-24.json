from the mid turns at that caravan still trucking along their uh their moon and shaken as we speak\nSo their stuff on that front but the the the bomb the bond scares have really taken over the the news headlines of stock markets heading down and I don't really have a have an explanation for that if it's just what's happening in the news is is against the stock market freaked\nOut I don't know it's because Trump said he was a national us yesterday for probably so probably said I'm just one we thought that was going to be the topic of the day because I think Morning Joe was hoping that would really take over the are the headlines that that that's pretty much the bulk of what they talked about when I watched anyway he was he\nWas really saying he was white nationalism is what they said on clearly that was the insinuation so\nAnd then all this stuff at the bottom and it seems like we're sitting back in the office and I swear every five minutes you're like another bomb has been sent you

I don't know exactly how they do it but they usually go blow these things up and\nAnd nine times out of ten Wendy's bomb squads deal with this and this is just a stand I heard earlier that they're they turn out to not even be real bombs they don't want to ... they may have to but they don't want to blow these up because of the amount of evidence that would be there if they can study keeping intact and actually study\nYeah so well I really believe it's a tactic of loyalty is to\nMake it look like something is now\nAnd go back to the ... baseball fill up in a wash the one that Lerner take liberal shot up all I'm gonna try to kill all of them you know you didn't hear ... jumping up and down you didn't hear well number one democratic come out about that did\nNot well I mean there there were a handful of them but it it ... it's it's not going to be compared to what we're going to hear them harping on this one all it's going to be much more over the ... um ...\nBut it it it's it's not going to be compared to what we're going to hear them harping on this went oh it's going to be much more over the top\nA minute this is a really ... or ... the floor of the loyalists trying to force will cry or so there's no folks and we may never know the truth uh\nYeah well that's how we do who knows girl to go to Diane Jill yes\nSir I'm here's the thing and this is this is what's promoting this outside of what we've seen Democrats do with the uh kind of a nonstop and ... whatever whatever history shows us that would even put them in the category of possibly\nConstructing something like this I look at the situation there and they're getting their brains beat out in the polls they're losing and a lot of important states in early voting which is bad\nBad news for a while and the Kavanaugh saying backfired they\nKept on saying backfired there there there are polls are sagging their their their candidates are getting picked off one by one Trump's backing out a hundred thousand people at rallies edge not looking good for Democrats and then while all that's going on or as a result of\nPeople are not even people\nDonald Trump has taken center stage for this whole thing this whole ... of violence on the ride violence against conservatives from the laugh whether it's changed them at a restaurant or ... or whatever else\nAnd he's branded them with jobs not mumps he's branded the left as a mob as a violent group of people\nAnd that if they're saying and in the polls already and now they're branded as a violent\nGroup desperate times calls for desperate measures they got to figure out a way to make it look like they're not the violent ones\nThat got to be the victims as you're saying\nThe other side and it's got to be the violent ones Conrad our the bunny\nI'm drawn up your your sir\nJust go back so you're a return to sender um it maybe that is where they get rich night it may be the bomb that was delivered there was the one he admitted that he was supposed to oversee the news\nWas oh wouldn't that be good [laughter] like why he says the one that if if the one package that went back to Debbie Wasserman Schultz if that was a return to sender\nWhat if it turns out that that was the package that was supposed to go to Andrew Cuomo and that's why he said he had a package of rest conference but he really does and that's unfortunate [laughter] van fortunate or but it would add a an acquired to spend to this whole thing I wouldn't be surprised just because of how craziest thing is for allies\nAt this point I Would not put us all\nWell and I think that the theory the working theory behind the idea that it could possibly be the lab is that they tend to overdo it you know what I mean all the way they overplay their hand every single time and I guess this would be just another example of that you you can't just send one pipe\nAnd I think some of that's off the topic I think these people really believe that Trump is responsible for all this I Know I talked to a couple of guys uh CNN Today that I I Know and they\nThey think it's they they they think it's a place called the white ... was that after ... G. E. N. N. at his rallies whether that's the truth or not I you know that that remains to be seen if you can if you could realistically tied to what Donald Trump says at a rally that's going to make people do certain things I I think is a\nLittle far fetched but they they should believe this narrative so how far do they take it I think more importantly what what is what's going to be the public's reaction to the scissors or a group of people that they think exist to see this\nSee this other TV it'd be like you know that's enough I'm not voting for any Republican anymore we need more Democrats in office because there's a more civil party I I think\nThat's that that's a bit of a leap in a bit of a stretch and I you know if that's what the hope is I don't think I Would would bet too much money on that\nI I think the real question is is what is the gases that are going to do when he finds out he's got employees\nI think the real question is\nIs what is\nJeff Zucker gonna do when he finds out he's got employees talking to some guy from Breitbart they're going to get\nGoing and [laughter] you got to realize the ... is back in the day in D. C. everybody kind of started out at the same time all those same\n... it's it's a lot closer behind the scenes and you think it is it may it may seem like we're at each other's throat but a day to day you're just kind of you you go to the same party's you see the same people you go to the same bars he uh yeah I had to have people you know it's it's high school to point out\nWell and we we see when stuff like this happens we watch Fox News come together with CNN I mean we've even seen instances of of ah Donald Trump attacking verbally attacking Jim Acosta and and people on Fox News come to his defense and all that which I think I you know there's not not a guy more deserving\nThan Jim Acosta to get blasting the news conference but that's that's neither here nor there and I I get what you're saying are the big thing and and and what's really contributing to this conversation about these packages\nIs the fact that it's less than two weeks from the mid turns and it's a\nWay we've talked to me and you've done several times about the October surprise and Everytime something crazy happens whether it's cabinet or or it's the caravan or it's it's this\nIt almost seems like it's an October surprise but it's not the traditional October surprise where one party brings it out says here's one I've gone on this guy it's like we're in an alternate universe\nYeah it's like a big big bang but it's not a it's not\nLike George W Bush's DUIs are right or or something just to the last minute Access Hollywood tape right\nIt's it's always it's always one of these ground shaking events that you you don't see every day but it's it's not a October quote unquote October\nSurprises just these last minute incidents and I and I you know I Do think they they do have some sort of impact on the on\nThe election what are you saying\nOr with the package stop what do you say to people that have that come out immediately look at this situation and say you know what this is shady\nThe Democrats may or are behind that is there for instance mailing bombs to themselves which is a sense nobody got hurt I felt like that conversations okay we have\nUm what do you say to those people who have such a distrust for the Democrat Party that they're saying I\nPut it past the Democrat Party to do this for their has always an October surprise\nYeah and I have seen a little of that out there and I\nI you know these little ... to have that discussion Reno or of but the fact that it's out there and you see a lot of people\nTalking about it I you know there's ... there's going to be people believe what they want to believe [noise] ah it it will be something if if this does come out and we find out of this sort of this a reverse Orwellian sort of situation where they're they're\nThey're\nWhile waging terrorist attacks on themselves to advance their power right\nThat that would be that would really be something and I I Do think no matter what the you're always going to have a a set of people that are going to believe that the case I you know and then it it it it's probably being discussed right now by Alex Jones or something oh yeah I don't know I've already seen that are going into wars\nIf that's the case you know\nIt's probably being discussed right now by Alex Jones or something oh yeah I don't know I've already seen I had a gun info wars\nMad if that's the case you know I ... if it is the case that I expect the story to go away and not be on the news at all if we find out that this guy's a Democrat doing this in the media ... that's a Democrat or we all about it we'll get back on Russia gate or something\nRight well think about this though Jessica pointed this out to me we've concentrated a lot and then there you are at Breitbart to see a lot of these articles as well\nEr about hoax hate crimes we feel like we see them all the time and it's it's one right after another and it's usually a hoax hate crime that is intended to hurt either Trump or conservatives or whatever the case it's won't we tend to Z so often I'm\nSo that's where people I think get this theory and and have come out so soon to say you know I don't believe this run off the bat because we see those folks around so much\nYeah they poison the well in themselves will hoax hate crimes I think that that's why you were you get a lot of this I'll say this I think this this sort of the survivor right now reminds me of post nine eleven with the anthrax scare that they had a really scared public ... they're just they're just bad\nPeople in this world that want to capitalize on sort of things like that I you know I I think it very well could be one of these cases where somebody sitting at home\nThinking this is how I this is how I make my star eyes on how I get meaning in my life I'll I'll I'll get in the middle of this highly polarized political environment and and do these things\nRight um they're Republicans seemed to have a lot of traction and you may disagree with me here I'm just looking at this from a you know a guy that's just a regular dude that watches politics\nI'm I'm watching these huge rallies Donald Trump split non and granted you know everybody far and wide comes to these rallies and that's how he fills up these arenas and even has tones of people on the outside but I'm seeing reports in in swing states where\nEarly voting is actually favoring the Republicans which is something we never see we're watching conservatives across the board just fired up about midterms which is on President\nOr what do you say ... main pretend we're this is twenty four hours ago before all this went down where do you see\nWhere do you see a U.S landing on election night do you think Republicans keep the momentum on November six\nI I Do think the Kevin also Scott aligning ah I think that did wake Republicans up but it's just a matter of maintaining that are maintaining nuts momentum right so that's you know what what is that is a is it this caravan down in Mexico the does the trick I I don't know uh but I think\nHere two weeks out all it was a day less than two weeks\nI keep on the stock market stock market really changed the ... election in ... in two thousand and eight\nWhen he had that big dip with McCain running against Obama McCain kinda lost his cool a bomber was cool and then I think that had a you know that that really at a impact on the outcome of the two thousand eight election you know 'cause if you recall\nSharp payload just got nominated\nAnd they were showing signs of life off the pale and bounce and then all of a sudden you had this this\nThis economic downfall where it'll lead to Morocco bomb I kind of coming back up to the polls Obama and Biden and and that's what happened you know the rest is history I I think the stock market's definitely going to be a factor\nI think that Trump weathered hurricane season\nA bombing Biden and and that's what happened you know the rest is history I I think the stock market's definitely going to be a factor\nI think that Trump weathered hurricanes cheated pretty well you know obviously the hurricane two weeks ago was was was really you know really bad but\nIt didn't it didn't result in a new orange type situation so I mean I think these are the things that I think will be more of an have more of an impact on the election then the ... the so called pseudo October surprises or anything like that\nI Do wonder though what ... what do you know the caravan does make it it it does sustain itself to be something that gets people out the vote\nRight well we need to talk a little bit of a state raises the governor's race in particular and will do that if you can hang on whether it\nWill uh will take a break come back on the other side also take some of your phone calls if you want to talk to John you want to do is make comments questions or whatever to oh five nine four one one zero one one back after this we saw\nWith Andrew and Jessica\nHDTVs Eric ...\nAnd I
