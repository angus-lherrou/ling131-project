[noise] ... [noise]\nIs Josh Josh by any objective strength\nSenate minority leader Chuck Schumer responded saying that Democrats have not delayed the process\nThe goal of a man to complain about a one week away for an FBI hearing\nWhen he held up\nA nominee for the Supreme Court has kept a seat vacant for ten months stat\nStat for [noise] you ought to just look in the mirror\nSee what he did a year and a half ago forty complains about one week away\n[noise] we've also learned tonight that the FBI will not be interviewing Kavanaugh's accuser Christine Blasey Ford\nThe White House says forwards public testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee was sufficient and that the FBI will be wasting its time speaking to her again about allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nNow his nominee nomination alone has reignited the debate over term limits in fact a new poll out tonight shows at sixty one percent of registered voters support term limits for justices of the high court\nWell the current hearing the highlights one wouldn't have gone to Richard but it would lower the stakes someone if you were pointing someone who could be on the court to twenty twenty five thirty years than it really makes mistakes very high in terms of you have the current Republican majority and they're pushing for a very conservative nominee\nNow the Democrats are obviously opposed back regardless of the particular controversy around sexual assault a bus if the if the nomination lasted only Eighteen years for example which is one of the main a suggestion than it would be important but it wouldn't be nearly as important [noise] and there are some people\nLasted only Eighteen years for example which is one of the main a suggestion then it would still be important but it wouldn't be nearly as important\nAnd there are some people who argue that there should be a limit an Eighteen year limit that's actually something that Justice Stephen Breyer had said he supports that amount of time\nWell there are nine Supreme Court justices and a four year term so the president so uh that would mean that every president going to point two justices put some potentially for if the president got to turn and uh\nNowadays justices assuming for about twenty five years but that's the longest that it's been in history and we have had justice is on the court who have been quite old and a tiny little daughter each to be honest and so it limiting Eighteen years to makes it a decent block of time but without stretching on indefinitely\nFor those who oppose sort of Eighteen year limit they're saying that it would actually make the court and more of an issue each campaign cycling would risk increasing the political ... of the of the court itself do you agree with those arguments\nWell the court has already highly politicized and it's becoming increasingly most or a in a polarized environment or has been left moved towards compromise as we saw in the Merrick Garland nomination\nSo I don't know if that's true but it would make it more radio law as an issue so that would be most certainty that we know that every president would have to coming into every time it would make it a more regular issue but I don't think it would make it became old political\nIn New York in the New York times um column a Harvard law professor suggested that Brett Kavanaugh may actually have to recuse himself from certain cases do you believe the political rhetoric and Kavanaugh's testimony was forced him to do so\nWell we certainly said a lot of things that would\nMake it difficult for him to rule in ... any issue that directly I invoke the Democrats for example there are important gerrymandering cases that it kind of come to the court\nThis term and probably next to and it would be very difficult for him to say that he can really rule and boom and an independent way however there's nothing to force him to recuse himself we rely on his judicial temperament\nIf he's appointed to be a justice and people are raising questions about that temperament based on his behavior at the hearings\nOn but it would really be up to him and so that's why it's so important to make a a wise judicial nomination and confirmation person\nJustice Clarence Thomas who went through a similar confirmation fight after claims of sexual harassment from Anita Hill is there evidence to suggest that Thomas is hearing affected the way he ruled on the court [noise]\n[noise] it's hard to say directly\nBut he's certainly the most extreme justice on the court he's extremely conservative and so that aligns with some of the ways we might expect\nHim to rule if he was affected by allegations against him all the inappropriate conduct discrimination sexual harassment and so on so it's hard to pull apart whether he is just naturally that conservative he was certainly expected to be conservative\nUh where they he was actually affected by the hearing\nWhen you look at some of the recent polls they've indicated that Supreme Court people are losing trust because of this increased tightened political ... I went actually play a bite for you from chief justice John Roberts discussing the political divide in two thousand sixteen this is just prior to the nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court\nYou have to sharply political divisive hearing process it increases the danger that whoever comes out of it will be viewed in those terms you know if\nIf the Democrats or Republicans have been fighting so seriously about whether you're going to be confirmed its natural for some member of the public to think well you must be identified a at a particular way as a result of that process and that's just not how\nFor some member of the public to think well you must be identified a at a particular way as a result of that process and that's just not how are you know we don't work as Democrats or Republicans and I think it's a very unfortunate perception that the public my ... from the confirmation process\nSo Tania if Americans began to view the court as a really politicized body what are the consequences of that\nWell the integrity of the court rests on the public mood you're going to see and said to the extent that cheap joke it's just this robot to correct and people think that regardless of the conservative or liberal nature of the nominated this particular nominee is tainted by the purses [laughter] than I think that really does or their strength to that argument

now to a story we first told you about last night on the news hour yesterday President Trump awarded the medal of honor to a secret service agent for his heroics a decade ago as a Green Beret medic in Afghanistan\nTonight David Martin has more on thirty nine year old Ron sure and the new enemy he's now fighting\nThe medal of honor will humble anyone but no more and more than staff sergeant Ronald

was just to get one day at a time having fish too for Ronald shore knows exactly what do you have to do we're just\nGiven this fight over that we can just just like the last one\n... wish him and his family only the best millennia Trump first lady millennia Trump open her first big so low international trip as a U.S first lady today with wave a smile in a baby in her arms\n... is gone out this is a weeklong trip for countries she'll be focusing she says on children she'll visit hospitals schools along the way she was also going to be highlighting U.S foreign aid of course this is something her husband's administration has drastically reduce this trip does come I mean some controversy of course there was that\nA recent jacket that the first lady war where she said the back of the jackets that I really don't care do you even see that jacket there ah then of course the comments last year for the president where he reportedly he has a derogatory phrase to refer to some African nations he didn't dispute a pretty strongly those comments as\nFirst lady is traveling with journalist so we'll be watching to see if she takes questions about the tripping about these kind of looming controversies she's stores that she's looking forward to bringing her be best campaign abroad\nAnd that's exactly what she's doing she hopes to promote child welfare during you know this five day tour of Africa she did arrive in the west African nation of gone up after an overnight flight from Washington and then quickly made her way to um the hospital and and and visiting children there and by the way that was to get the reporting\nSo it's good she's taking her message abroad gun is a wonderful country\nI'm actually a friend who lives in Canada so I'm\nKind of neat maybe she got to meet the first lady you know it was an interesting yeah and it's kind of neat [noise] All right so I think are male bad question of the day has to we kind of still have to talk about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Fox is reporting tonight that the FBI may complete its investigation by tomorrow\nThat's really fast considering they were giving themselves till friday and everyone thought friday would be a tight deadline but again Fox is saying tonight that it may be done as early as tomorrow\nThat could bode well for Cabot all because it was more instead of ... I I think it it possibly could be a good thing because if it was\nYou would think if they found something bad\nThey would continue to investigate to make sure they could cooperate with that with other things I don't know it could be wrong or I or could be bad that they they ...\nThey found enough that quickly that they don't have to investigate any longer I don't know but I I think uh it's a lot quicker um you the Senate says they are going to vote this week\nOn his confirmation so one way or another by friday I think we're going to know if he's going to be on the Supreme Court or not\nYesterday one of our callers Charles made him very very interesting um statement and something we never thought about he said well what if\nYou know Kevin wasn't President Trump's first pick wasn't somebody who really want it but he worked out a deal with Justice Kennedy who maybe he wanted him to resign so you know President Trump could put in the person who really wanted\nKennedy maybe said okay I'll resign I'll step down but only if you pick this\nNo President Trump could put in the person who really wanted Kennedy maybe said okay I'll resign I'll step down but only if you pick this gentleman referring to Brett Kavanaugh\nWhat if I mean this is all hypothetical this is what Charles is speculating but it made me think I really thought about it after I left here last night going that's really interesting\nAnd so he's saying OK so Trump went along with this because he wanted to have somebody who supported his views and somebody that he could leave at the legacy on the high court\nAnd when all of this happen the president was like well when my quick anyway so that's why he's going along with the FBI investigation that's why he's saying you know\n... you know apparently for the FBI is not going to interview her the FBI felt like everything she said she said during the confirmation hearings and so Trump President Trump is going along with all of this\nYou know saying well if this doesn't work I'll I'm going to get the person I really want\nTo think about that Charles put that out yesterday I was like we do have to consider it because apparently Kennedy um was well versed on Kavanaugh knew him and liked him\nFrom Vancouver [laughter] tell you Charles I'm like OK Charles you're on to something ... beer [laughter] but Charles is one of our callers one of\nOur listeners it has good insight on stuff and it tends to be right on everything [noise]\nAnd then you have who mad who he was the one who called\n... or\n... you know if if and Bush was dreams and looked at all have\n[laughter] okay so that says no you don't buy it but I did make me think and I was pondering that for a good bit of the night going well\nBecause they think it's possible anything's possible um but I thought that was you know and then we have who mad who did call that Doug Jones that what he called and he said Doug Jones was going to win and he was right who met did call that\nHe said uh Doug Jones you you're going to see who's going to win he's going to win the the ... the Senate and Alabama and you're right so I don't know and whom as the one thing that I'm ... said that Kevin I Would not\nConfirm so I'm not sure I bring up the phone lines when we come back to zero five nine four one one zero one one or toll free eight six six five five one nine nine thirty three can't wait to start some stations would get that [noise]\nUh I'm an independent and I'll tell you I think\nWe need to do we need to be five and four and and leave it like that I don't care ... sounded laughter lopsided right\n[noise] well I think we got a clip art is fighting I'm telling you it just looks bad look how long we've been fighting for two years this heart Amanda through half way through the president's\nYeah well that is going to be interesting it's going to be interesting to see what happened I encounter thank you thank you very optic here All right bye high Arman can I say that correct Roy Hi did I pronounce your name correctly or early yes Hi welcome yes are you doing I'm great how about you\nOkay I I'm not sure how much time like that but I mean like most people should know is that the Congress houses and make the laws the president enforcing the laws\nIn is the core state interpret the laws\nThe reason that the Supreme Court is an appointment for why you're so that they won't be swayed to have to be said reelected are so much and they shoot given an unbiased opinion to interpret the laws as the constitution is written\nBut what if it was a case where they couldn't get reelected at the end of ten years and they were just done\nShe does read it but what if\nIt was a case where they couldn't get reelected at the end of ten years and they were just done\nWell ah I I stayed in the courts\nYes I'm Sorry the Supreme Court the justices yeah\nWell and that ten years I it's an appointment if they're running on the case of\nMy performance is going to a ... why you're here in Florida it's whether or not I'm On this court in ten years and I like the I make decisions that are beneficial to them rather than being a fan of beneficial to the ... century\n... what do you mean so you're saying if I'm a justice and I know when I'm appointed I get to search for ten years at the end of the ten years my term is that you're saying that some of my decisions navy base when I Know when I'm no longer on the court they're going to affect me is that what you mean\nYes if I mean if the Supreme if you're talking about are term limited in years I've I you\nKnow they're not up for anything at the end it ten years they would just be done like and that's\nIt what are you saying they could never run again now when it's not a run it's an appointment and you're appointed for say ten years\nWell the main reason is what what this guy who's his arm in arm in arm in saying the main reason that they do this for a lifetime is so that the Supreme Court justices don't have to worry about\nWhat their what their decisions are so ... if they're gonna have to be appointed again they would have to worry about okay if I vote this way nobody's gonna ever a point me again if I vote this way then this person will put me back up there\nI'm saying no appointment you do your term and you're done\nThat's what I'm saying so they can never be appointed again never ... ruining through people like white on rice you think so Oh yes because I mean having the people\nThat would be qualified to do that after so long [noise] ...\nI mean I you know I'm just thinking outside the box but that's the main reason why we do it and the Supreme Court for for life is so that they don't have to worry about any flack coming to them about the way they vote ... I'm ...\nOriginally there were term limits on as an ad until\nUh any right Teddy Roosevelt and act on it was it after Teddy Roosevelt\nI Believe in a cycle in rank running into that Oprah\nLost before ... Roosevelt it was almost the gentleman's agreement sovereign state\nOr Washington was elected president grants for another term and then he found out\nHe had a chance to get new blood to what was going off so ... and then he went so sports wrong it was some time after that if they were going to limit orange resident now you're talking about term limits on the Congress the house\nIn the Senate but than what you do\nIs part of the constitution is you're taking a light light the light wobble in there just because you're putting term limits on I should be able to under the constitution a lead to a woman to for as long as I won't say\nJust because you're putting term limits on I should be able to under the constitution I like to I Want to for as long as I won't say that they're doing a good job I'm Will keep them in office they're doing a job and I go to the polls them outside the mouth\n... and you know I heard the\nThe really the president can put anybody up there with nominate and put somebody up there though he won't put up there I got to go back and research lab but if that's the case I don't agree with that [laughter] I don't agree with that at all [laughter] just any president going hey I think oh\nYou know\nPut this person up there I don't care what Congress say there's no way that's why there's three checks and balances checks and balances you know every town yeah\nAll right arm and thank you so much appreciate it\nAll right thanks thank you I've watched this new show thank you\nHey how're you doing good how are you going to\nClear up so it wasn't me to say that he wouldn't be a fire that was a missile must a robber from husband oh\nI can remember I had an idea you did say that Doug Jones would win and you're right you're right about\nThat and I know that that predicts hobby you know he didn't agree with\nYou all the time limit on how to be done about her middle aged over it I mean we needed to know\nHow long do you think of Supreme Court justice should sausage outfits teen years\nTen yeah 'cause you\nCould make a lot of change and hear a lot of cases right in\nA yes or no Kavanaugh get in a hurry you know I don't put nothing fathom cousins\n[laughter] funny you know I see how they act ACT UP there and\nYou know a ...\n... she was tough pearls up there did you hear me [laughter]\nBut do you think the fact that if they really are done and the FBI is done with their investigation this quickly what does that mean if that's the case\nWell it it might it might mean that might be good for a cab ahead now\nSo like that and you know what's good about that though is man you're talking about some Democrats did not vote in the middle of the bed was an all of them come without you really what\nDo you think about that today the president said this is a scary time for young men what did what do you think about\nIt is not going to listen to it all day people making justify effort but we'll now got scared to ask girl I don't know it's not you you you you carry yourself like a man you can go on a day you can try to just a girl I should say you know\nIt's only a solid harassed you keep doing\nWhat is the woman said you know\nI mean you you are correct over who may I the only problem is is that if you get if a girl gets you with huge she can just say that you did something whether you did it or not\nThe day no respect for the non okay you get what you call it for a sea lane you know what they say they show a lot of people a lot of people like to join us for the hills voice you someplace\nYeah I\nI I'm Sorry but because that's how I grew more on\nYeah I\nI I'm Sorry but because they grew more on it you know because like when I was doing\nA lot of uh a lot of\nYou know volunteer at the ballpark and stuff I Would not even have a meeting with a single mom up in the press box\nOn the stand with San Fran ... killing my time right up look look look no don't don't come here turn and like you run in this show though I think you know\nLook who may you may we got three other callers and you think you can get another team in\nMy time no you're talking about well you know what I'm saying I don't know how to get [noise]\nAll right ... thank you okay he Charles Charles\nHey happy to uh to vote for the change of other than their best interest you okay\nI'm okay how are you today Carole\nOkay let me say this thing I Would point as far as\nTo the Supreme Court alive mhm that way they want to worry about the decisions they make\nAs you can be appointed to the Supreme Court as I Try to get a little while ago to appoint his wife are either point sort of a sudden his wife of Alabama because they could have been appointed and you do not necessarily have to be a lawyer still be appointed to the United States Supreme court", "show_name": "The Steve West News Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "02"}
