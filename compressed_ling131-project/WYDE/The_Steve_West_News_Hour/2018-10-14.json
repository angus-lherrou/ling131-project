and he uh were was performing and ... and I went to see him perform and and Leslie\nGot into an argument with him I you know when your argument wasn't argue mouse Sinbad was top stories he was talking about marriage\nAnd he asked a question and Leslie piped up from the Audi I knew the answer and he heard her I knew the end and for the next several minutes the two of them went back and forth and I mean they literally went back and\nForth so uh and it was about marriage level in ending it [laughter]\nAnyway anyway so uh [laughter] ... well you know and when we looked at that we were\nWe were actually listening to that and then he was talking about marriage and you know marriages marriage is a special special institution and I hear so many times now\nPeople are just really dispirited and talk negatively about and uh and I tell you something that I find really interesting and if you want to join the conversation our toll free number is eight six six one nine nine three three again eight six six by by one nine nine three three but one of the things I find really interesting is literally were you aware that divorce rate in America\nAre going down I was not behind it they're going down that is not at all what you hear anymore and that's good news\nWell why don't we think well wait a minute but there's a reason is going down and the reason is going down is because fewer people\nAre getting married ... are they last shocking that people don't know checking I mean\nI'm Sorry you and your [laughter] I I Am so sorry shocking day reading not why not [laughter] shack what a shock you know I even when I was in the church in young I'm like where did that come from washed jacking up Adam now okay now you know mom pulled back and research and I'll bring it to the next guy yeah exactly so yeah but millennials\nNow are are less likely to marry 'em that you know they believe living together is a better way to go a ... and that that's something that the millennial generation by and large according to studies\nSo I don't want any millennials that they're getting mad and calling me at eight six six five by one nine nine three three you know upset with me this is just what to do a study from the Pew or the Pew Institute\nA former university are showing that fewer people are getting married well when you know the divorce rate of that\nTo just what the ... a study from the Pew or the Pew Institute\nAt Harvard University are showing that fewer people are getting married\nWell when you know the divorce rate is at fifty percent or was that fifty percent\nAnd a lot of marriages unfortunately are accepting this function as a way of life you know it why would you do it you know why would you do it\nWell and and and what they're saying is that fewer people are getting married and the United states they're opting for cohabitation not checking\nCoal sorry cohabitation is the right word our people cohabitation ... [laughter] and speaking of that fortunate because marriage is a beautiful thing I Need to take a right turn on this because I I I have to throw you a bone on something okay I had so many myself the way that I really look at me and\nMy house [laughter] like that on purpose [laughter] I ...\nI cannot stand the word myself missing use 'em like all the time all the time I I just want to strike it from every once in a cab you there so he said like it from the life of Khan [laughter] not not my self people say she at myself or hear myself I Know that okay I'm Sorry\nWell no I just get back to no no no no no no this is important it is not yes this is important how should they use myself level that\nYou can say ah I oh gosh give me some well\nLet let's talk about how they're going to say okay right okay well um you know me myself I doubt ... an hour oh it\nUm I Will tell you that ah the church I attended had a divorce care seminar for the first time they offered this as I was going through my divorce and it was a Thirteen week program that it is all about healing so hurt and helping you to\nTo get back to center and it took place in Jesus in the center of your life life and and helping you to realize that there is a place for you that price loves you and that there is hope so that I you\nKnow if if you can get to a some a church or somewhere local that has a divorce program a divorce care program or even a therapist we definitely believe in that\nIt exactly are we actually have a caller lively and uh uh we have a caller on the line Steve uh our our caller for the evening I had something you wanted to say welcome to the commitments with can literally radio show\nThat you all very much for having money or your ...\nHow to how it is to church you ... do you live in that church\nMhm\nYou take yourself and you have ... and you share in the back of the church but you're still in the church\nUh-huh mhm mhm and you're still in the work though his little bring to you\nMhm\nHey we'll get to you all you have to do is half right for everybody I Know mhm ... ... right I mean I I Know you're doing a\nGreat job your brain science to the title I need to hear\nSteve if I can ask or are you are you divorced\nOh gosh okay man okay\nAnd you've actually seen the effects of divorce on on not only you but on other people as well\nHe was talking about children one ... even ... and lo\nAnd certainly owe it to any of\nThat is a wonderful point in laws while we haven't talked about that\nYeah there well there's so much to talk about um when it comes to divorce because it impacts the entire family and the extended family you\nHave three body in that it supposedly that's\nAll going to have yeah ... ... ... talk about I Wish we had\n... what will Steve thank you thank you so much for calling a and and uh we we certainly an invite you to call back again a level you know Steve talked about the fact that we talk about in laws and yes he was absolutely right there's so much more to talk about\nA ... you know beyond that uh but but talk for a moment about what divorce does in those relationships wow and by the way Steve\nAbout a ... you know beyond that uh but but talk for a moment about what divorce does in those relationships wow and by the way Steve thank you for calling in and please call us a call is going to be a regular absolute All right you have a getting\nDivorced forces or most people to take a side\n... and ... and a lot of people line up with their ... family member ... so you know your in laws are usually going to line up with your spouse and your family is usually going to line up with you but these relationships that have been Seventeen years Fifteen Years Twenty years Twenty years and they're making so it's not easy so then\nIt not only impacts the inlaws\nA but then the the the children and and the cousins and aunts and everyone's impacted who goes where especially when it comes down to the holidays\nYou know it changes everything and I'll give you an example uh I hosted my uh my ex and I hosted thanks get Thanksgiving every year for both sides of our family and we would have thirty thirty thirty five people sitting at the table in every Thanksgiving mhm we split ...\nThanksgiving was for us at that time of year [laughter] it's a matter of fact my my oldest son used to write papers\nAbout Thanksgiving when he was in fourth and fifth grade and how wonderful it was to have all of your family there that is our time of year where we gather as a family and and we know that if nothing else is happening we were all going together for Thanksgiving yeah those are great memories\nYou know that were created and then all of a sudden there's a split so now whose home\nOr your children going to for Thanksgiving ... you don't have that relationship with the inlaws a lotta times anymore so it's those inlaws they they become friends you know that that family right\nAnd and so it's it's just it's very very extremely difficult to navigate\nIt is and and and and you said it exactly right don't don't believe you know for our listeners don't believe that\nAll marriages have contentious relationship with the in laws are because that's just not the case or in my situation I didn't have a contentious relationship with my in laws and all that Israel and I know a lot of people who did not have ... inches relationships but then divorced comes\nAnd you find yourself again dealing with shame because you're trying to figure out how to why\nHow do I explain this to the in laws and uh you know how do I explain it I I certainly don't want to bash their uh their child but how do I explain what happened and and and and afford truth to it and um so so you know Steve our caller said it exactly right\nThere are so many relationships that are injured that are that are impacted that are devastated\nBy divorce and there is there's a lot to talk about because you know when you talk about those relationships we can't just talk about it right we have to talk about solutions\nYeah so so how does a person who is going through divorce how do you navigate that right ... what does navigation look like\nA you know one of the things we want to do here on the commitments with kid in in a Leslie radio show\nIs we want to give you tips wondering if you help we want to get my resources we don't want to just talk about it everybody knows that divorce hurts everybody knows it their issues we want to move beyond that and we want to give you a kind of common sense I'm a I'm a tactics strategies for how to move beyond that\nKen I'm going to tell you that you divorce if you're going through if you're going to actually divorced you do it with decency you do it in a way that honors got there there is no other way that you can do it um you you do it in a way\nAnd she actually divorced you do it with decency you do it in a way that honors got there there is no other way that you can get away\nAnd you you do it in a way that you know I used to wake up every morning and let me do things got that make you smile let me do things that make you happy let me think about you and everything that I Am doing her no matter what came at me no matter what attacks came at me\nI got to do things that are in line with God but you know Steve said something he said something about sitting in the back of the church that your church but the thing is to go to continue to go if you're going through a divorce and\nDon't stop going to church if you have to find a new church home do so but don't stop going I encourage you to continue to have faith and know that each small step you take is leading you to a destination\nA destination of peace joy and love I just encourage you to hold on\nYeah and and and I'll say this you know ... to live with point you know um if if you don't feel comfortable staying in the church where you are that's okay because God is not just in one church right like he's in all different charges and if you're not comfortable then you can certainly come to the house of light church\nLocated in a while [laughter] but I cannot really happening north ... anyway [laughter] whether or not but I'm not a good time at anyway but but the point is is\nThat it it it's exactly right find find a church goodbye will church but but here's the thing that I Want to take a step back for a moment because I Want to talk reality\nThere are a lot of people that are that are going through divorce and they they they are not believers anymore they have lost their fate they have lost their connection with God they have lost that relationship and so it's fine for us to sit here\nAnd talk about oh you know I have this great relationship with God and I did this and I woke up every day and pray but there are people out there who are so devastated by divorce that they have lost their faith\nYou know when Jesus was talking to Peter he said I pray you know the the devil wants to sift through as we'd I pray that your faith ... you're not there are people out there whose faith has failed them and for those people whose faith faith has failed them\nWe want you to know that there is hope we want you to know that there is help we want you to know that there is something beyond where you are there is the ability God loves you and there's the ability for him to restore you and and to help you make sense out of it all\nThat doesn't mean all your questions are going to get answered it doesn't mean that they're going to get answered your way it doesn't mean that he's going to bring your spouse back home\nBut it just means that there is healing and they're hoping there's help and I want to encourage you uh we can't talk about it all in one hour radio show but I encourage you ... and this is not shameful but I encourage you to to reach out to us\nOr we're more than happy to talk to you a one on one we do we do counseling sessions we have our divorce care at our church come to our church and and be a part of that or we would love to talk to you more we would love to have an opportunity to help you see how even if you lost your faith\nEven if you don't feel like God loves you he does and he's still there for you until next week at five thirty Sunday or on this station one on one point one five thirty central time\nOr I Am can and I am Leslie and we are commitments and uh we welcome you to the family we will see you next week they encouraged [noise]\nThose are that's the way that you received the best price if you want to pay the highest price for a car and walk into the dealer and start talking about how much he loved the college excuse me in the car\nAnd let them know that you've already chosen that car so it written so in their mind that doesn't really matter what the price is they're going to offer you whatever they think you're going to change their not going to offer you the best deal\nVery similar to colleges if you go into this college selection process are ready to signing\nThat you want to miss you want to go to two or three schools you're not going to get the best deal you have to create a competitive situation go into it with that kind of mindset\nThat you want the colleges that compete with each other and that competitive situation is what will cause the universities to be more aggressive or less aggressive\nWhen it comes to the financial aid processes are not all colleges are created equal but not all colleges need to work as hard to try to stay in it it is a business\nThey're going to spend the amount of time in the amount of resources they need\nOnly just need to work as hard to attract the student it is a business\nThey're going to spend the amount of time in the amount of resources they need to attract the students that they want you got to create this competitive situation\n... so what we talked about a last week was starting out with eight to ten colleges not one or two you start out with and to colleges and it seems like a lot\nA in a way that you do that is that the faster process so the this website that you go to Spain by the department of education that you provide your income and your assets\nAre you also select the colleges that you're interested in [noise] now does that mean you're going to go to them now does that mean uranium and going to apply for admissions and does not\nIt just means that you're letting them know that they're on your radar by by selecting eight to ten college is the un negotiate the financial aid process with all these different colleges and create that competitive\nSituation that we're talking about I'm In a nice to be a cross section of colleges they came in the same warns it needs to be a college is a different sizes public private a liberal orange different academic\nUm uh reputations and so forth and you will find that cross section a wide variety of financial aid offers but in the competitive situation what you're really trying to do is get the colleges to work you're trying to get them to\nIncrease the financial aid package to attract you're still in it and this is what really reduces the cost of the college\nNow last week also mention um another type of a that you could receive and that was merit they stayed in ... Bay State was not necessarily driven my financial need\nAll of the things that we were talking about with financial aid and general aren't based on financial lean they're based on your resources\nYour ability to pay for college\nThere were there to create an equal playing field and opportunity for everyone\nBut merit based aid is based on the merit of your child it's based on the war in us up your child it's based on the perception of the college um they're attracted ness of your child and the perception that they want him as a student\nSo the third thing that's involved in choosing the right college handful of colleges cross section of colleges but also the cheese colleges that your child is in the top ten percent\nAnd by choosing colleges that your child is in the top ten percent they're going to look very attractive\nTo the university and the way that you can do that you can research the different standards for these different universities what the average grade point average is what the average eighties ACT scores SAT score\nAnd so forth so you get that information as easily found an out there\nSo in the selection of colleges you want to make sure that just in addition to the cross section of colleges\nThat you're choosing colleges that your child is going to be in the top\nTen percent of incoming freshman now depending on the academic standards of the university that's going to drive toward certain schools are away from certain schools depending on the academic strengths have your child\nYou don't necessarily have to be a Rhodes Scholar but if you are a Rhodes Scholar you know you'll probably be attracted you'll probably in the top ten percent of something like an audio school\nUm if your child has an above average student and they might be on the top ten percent\nBut Lee in the top ten percent of something like an RV like school um if your child has an above average student they might be on the top ten percent for someone like south Alabama or\nSomething like that but if they're in the top ten percent it's very unlikely they're going to increase the merit awards which aren't need based [noise] last week I gave me an example of an ... an actual example of a client\nWho did not qualify for financial aid at all they had I income\nAnd we looked at a college that was very attractive to the student was very attracted to them\nAnd that was that when the example that I use was trolling\nUm the student did not want to get into trouble and they wanted to go to Auburn um they were not so attractive to Auburn um they they didn't stand out on the twenty five thousand students that were that were going to a ... year but they weren't very attracted to Troy\nAnd because we chose that is one of the colleges which created that opportunity and competitive situation that we receive such an offer\nAuburn then provide any offers for this person Troy did\nTroy provided her phone rod\nAnd it only happened because we chose multiple colleges in the beginning through the faster process which has a cross section of colleges but we also narrowed it down to colleges that she was in the top ten percent of incoming freshmen\nAnd that is the process that I'm trying to teach the parents\nTo me I'm going to go about choosing are helping their children choose to college\nFor ... for the student and not the norm way and the traditional way that we typically do now and and that's you know what our friends doing when they are and now he's got a good football team in ... before he won the national championship\nAnd so forth I I Know that was the way that I Know when I was in high school and that's the way everybody chose to college um but nowadays you can allow the college and the financial aid and the actual cost of college to be in the driving factor\nIn narrowing down so you start out with a larger send them um colleges you let them responding you he left in providing um financial aid awards you look at those evaluate 'em or after the break we're going to come back and talk about negotiating\nA these awards or what your responsibility will be when they come back to you or further I Want to talk a lot more about this um\nCompetitive situation that I'm trying to get you to do you know selecting these different colleges don't when they when the awards combat what do you do what do you say\nUm how do you increase the orange how do you create this\nCompetitive situation or to increase the aid packages and so forth but the starting place is that we need to have a subset a larger subset of colleges different colleges ones that are child looks very good at a academically stands out from the incoming freshmen\nAnd that's the point in which I Want to stop the prank\nAnd then when we come back I Want to talk about the individual negotiation and so forth that\nGoes on when these different colleges that that that's what really reduces the cost of your college uh and helps you in the selection process\nAnd Social Security benefits or Tea Party planning for retirement many people believe they simply bar and the only decision to make is that what age to begin with Bob ... seven ways and ball and three thousand different rules Apollo nothing could be further from the tree\nThey simply bar and the only decision to make is that what age to begin with Bob ... seven waste and ball and three thousand different

of problems that before ... ...\nThe different actual costs to the parents so [noise]\nUm last in previous weeks we talked about\nActually cost more tuition but ended up costing their parents' house\nAnd the answer to that was that the resources associated with the colleges very quite a bit and so we ... we were looking an example in previous weeks of Auburn MIT\nTalking about how that might work out for someone in the financial aid process but the point I was trying to make is this", "show_name": "The Steve West News Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "14"}
