away we go through for\nA roast beef still comes in here on any given day with a good story of ah what happened\nI got a quick story here for yet I don't like that I'm so thin skinned the you know that's about me than I Am very thin skinned you know through\nA actually view you as the a person with a thick skin of anybody I Know\nAnd I can get my feelings are pretty easily so from time to time we'll post photos on Facebook you take it picks you take yourself or you're hanging out with the tea whatever it is you put it up on Facebook so I sent my sweetheart a picture this morning and she said look handsome black and white picture look hands just my face and in the office it was nothing special\nBut she said it looked good like oh well that makes me feel good I Will make that my new\nFacebook profile mhm now there was nothing particularly notable about is just my big fat face and ... and black and white and it was fine\nBut I didn't have a smile on my face I wasn't the court jester that I guess everyone is used to\nAnd so predictably and this happens every time I post a photo if it doesn't have a gigantic smile on my face and was like why aren't you smiling and so a buddy of mine posted it and here's the patriarch show you I understand no one else can say it's just an ordinary harmless right face in it\nThat shadow on there and makes you look like you got to ... [laughter] I thought was true but it is a good picture\nIt's fine yeah suicide but uh if I don't have a big giant cheese on my face people give me a hard time right\nAnd so I decided that you want a smile on your face I give you a smile on my face and I took the they [laughter] and kind of the clip art or you got the hand drawn thing and get myself good glad and put it up there\nBut ah yeah I smile a lot and I have fun and it's fine but not every photo has to be a giant smile on your face\nSo all that to say I got my feelings hurt and it was a friend of mine he wasn't trying to hurt my feelings he's like do you okay you're not smiling and I just completely freaked out [laughter] so you\nDrew ... mile on your picture and out of spy\nAnd then I made that my profile picture overreacted and deleted my entire face but me no I did [laughter]\nSo it has since been restored oh but I'm a posts are gone all of my pictures are gone I did leave the Google the eyes 'cause it made me smile but uh I'm\nThe younger Democrat I think I got to make a play for that now what what does that mean in the long term I guess that that's that's another discussion for a different day but I I really wonder you when you talk to these Democrat act or some of these like I said democratic staffers for these people have been in democratic politics long time\nThere were really worried about that scenario that\nYou know my job with a Nancy Pelosi for instance what happens you know I was thinking she was going to be speaker of the house again and you know that comes with a better position for me but now looking at this election is not so certain so or you know I\nI I think that there's that element of doubt within the Democratic establishment it kinda says what you need to know about where the selection is right\nNow well I don't you think ... the problem with those Democrats that are currently in power and have been for a while it's not that they've stayed in one place and they they kept the same tone around all that they've moved further and further left\nWhat's going to be the effective if you bring in people like court has an and yellow um\nAll this they moved further and further left what's going to be the effective if you bring in people like court has an and yellow and in in the like and they're even further left in who's in there having them being a moving further to the lab hasn't it been their downfall\nYeah what was that was always sort of similar\nCapital is always I I thought a just a a straight a voter enthusiasm play that's where you you get the excitement that's where you get you know the sort of these antics you see in Portland, Oregon and and really you Jim up the base legion up the base and you know obviously those are the effects\nBut at what point does it become do the you know the sort of a law of diminishing returns and start it becomes kind of a\nIt starts to ... your own you know you're standing in the Democratic party if you find out that based too much\nThat's why things happening here Democrats really probably weren't counting on this they thought they could keep their crazies in check they always have they have kept their they've kept their activist wing and check probably since the since the sixties I mean if you look at it if you think about it [noise]\nThey've been able to kinda nominate their guy the the the establishment guy but now you have that now you have\nFor better you know\nJust lack of a better phrase sea and may run any asylum and that's where you had any scenario so pushy further to the left I think they're kind of getting out of touch with the American people yet they they are the loudest voices in the room and that tends to me what dominates in these primary scenarios and and you know and when would that that's your grass roots\nAnd that's the direction they needed to go to keep the voters engaged I think\nWell uh it just ... I don't I don't see how in the world that would work out for ... the way we see things trendy now I saw\nA few research polls earlier today that we're talking about self identified union members that they're just as likely to vote Republican\nOr as they are Democrat and and that demographic has been lopsided for a while and that's because the unions you know they they tell their members who to vote for and it's always been Democrat if that's shifting what does that tell you\nYeah and I think the Democratic party what used to be sort of more of a blue collar national party is becoming a coastal partying it may be still be blue collar in the sense that\nThe the blue collar types of California and New York and in New England and in a lot of the many clinic they they will vote Democrat that's kind of want the identity of the party is\nBut you can be a national party if you're just the coast that I I think you know in our system in our democracy where you have it on TALK Qadri a representative democracy we have house it's a set of seats and house districts and things like that it doesn't lend itself to just a mass\nOf the popular vote element that's to me wherever the Democrat Party has got to really think about this that that they're not appealing to the blue collar union vote or that they're not appealing to the you know even though the farm states in any sort of way\nOr a meaningful sense there are for the big numbers are going for the big cities and I\nYou know I Do the inevitably that may prove to be you know successful but for the time me and just the way populations distributed throughout all fifty states I I don't think that's a winning strategy and they need to address that\nYeah they've they've most certainly laughter the um the the blue collar Democrats in a blue collar Democrats states in the dust and and they finally picked up on that to where it used to be and this is just judging from the the the reaction I get from people\nStates in the dust and and they finally picked up on that to where it used to be and this is just judging from the the the reaction I get from people I talked to is\nWe've always voted Democrat so that's just what we'll do and you know the way back in the sixties in the seventies it was like well the Democrats are for the working man or the Republicans are for the rich and wealthy and you still hear people say that today but they're realizing that that's actually not the case and the two parties\nHave switched in a sense on their messaging and who they're supposedly looking out for\nYeah and I would add this element to it I think the Democratic party over the last twenty Thirty years is really relied on the minority vote to carry the day\nThat's been ... their bread and butter but when we found out in these last few elections particularly the twenty sixteen presidential election where they were relying on African American vote to carry Pennsylvania to carry Michigan you know the city of Detroit Pittsburgh Philadelphia places like that\nJust are coming out the vote like they are like that wants to have had it I I what I think is going on there is that they they take that for granted I mean you know it's become kind of a political talking points that they like to take the black vote for granted that ended up the Democratic party that is but I think it's true that\nThink that the get out the vote effort truly there I think it gets more\nGoing to win this district we don't really have to put resources and making sure we get the vote out or if they do it's it's still kinda token gesture just to uh to show that there are there now for the struggle but I I\nThink you really need boots on the ground\nAnd the Democratic party just isn't doing that anymore they're they're they're they're taking it for granted and you know it's ... that was a mistake you twenty sixteen I get something to the we we ought to look at it for his first twenty Eighteen goes\nEspecially with some of this falling and and the way it's related at some of these things because you may wake up on a November seventh and ... and some of those places that were supposed to go Democrat\nAnd the most just were there and people that come out to vote like they were supposed to\nYeah matter that would be an ugly picture for Democrats won one quick thing on the front of October surprises I saw a report and I can't tell you who was from Washington Post or whoever\nAh that Mohler is expected to release his findings not necessarily publicly but released his findings or what have you got so far\nBut the report was saying that it may be coming after the the midterms which would eliminate that being an October surprise right\nYeah so that's the idea now my fear is that just give it the people that are working for more right now and we know the politics of it what if one of the elites you know\n... at the eleventh hour south of leaks and it really kind of throws a rich and what we think is going to happen that that would be one fear there's also the the the crazy possibility that they got something up to the Democrats and it's got something obviously they're going to play against Republicans\nWe're sitting here on October seventeenth us we're pretty late in the game for an October surprise and then as it happened I'd say about it at least by the early part of next week is probably too late to really impact the electric is a big way\nNationally there may be something in some more corporations they could do that ... that would would change things in a way that would preclude Alabama from that but I\nI I don't think it's going to matter I think right now for a national sort of Mark Foley situation or or any of that\nAccess Hollywood tape or something like that we're we're we're probably ruin who are pushing the limits on that\nRight ah well speaking of Alabama or an October surprise is there is this whole\nReally pushing the limits on\nThat right ah well speaking of Alabama or an October surprise is there is this whole ivy manic thing ah or within the I've I'd be ... realm that they're trying to pin the Hillary Clinton ask\nHealth problem type thing on Kay Ivey that's the route but there are allegedly taking and saw a W. V. T. M. again in a question with Kay Ivey asking her about it and I obviously she like there's nothing to do that and it's absolutely ridiculous what are you seeing on that\nYeah it and you just considered or the started it started with Bill Brits Alabama political reporter which is kind of go to plays for our democratic opposition research I think that's that's where you start out that that's the first red flag with this but it didn't work for those guys that ran against turned a primary if fact it made her look\nSomewhat you know more of a victim and any kind of a cat I\nCause a lot of people to shower on a on you know the Scott Dawson ah Tommy Battle\nAnd a bill Hightower so I I think it it just it it it ... it bolsters ivy position I think if they try to do that and she plays it correctly now I'll say this I had been probably to half a dozen Kay Ivey rallies and the state in the last two three weeks\nShe doesn't seem to show like signs of this this deterioration that where your ear and about I don't\nWhere they take this does she had some kind of a mini stroke two years ago it was about ... do you think the people of Alabama or think well even if she did or three years ago I guess it is now that\nThat she could not have recovered it it'd be fully healed from that and be is a a capable governor ours ... maybe the Carter tried to play is that she tried to cover it up so we're ... must be more fire I I don't know I don't think it's going to work I don't think this is the last", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Steve West News Hour", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "17"}
