golf all the time and the deficit is going out of out of style we've got to real end that deficit or we're all going to be in trouble\nWhere we're already all in trouble with is just be honest about it but they all allow Mr Dave is on glad about might end up in a more because I really struggled under a bomb and things are doing a lot better now I mean that's the only thing I can go by and but you're right they blame to go around on both sides but it just seems to\nMe to lay off to our our danger if they ever get back in power I fear what this country come too but you have a good and\n... yeah I think I'll\nTell you who you know that's all right a lot of lot of what you are they both sides the left and right they're all rich a leftist Rick's the writers rich okay\nDays in truth is both sides used to love and it's the right they're all rich a leftist Rick's the riders rich OK let's could plans game Paul Ryan is getting ready to retire\nFrom being the speaker of the house and they get the tension of almost three hundred thousand dollars for what for years work what is that\nDo the right in the lab who's in office get the best healthcare polite tell me that he he keeps talking about the left and all this and having a handout who's got a bigger hand them politicians on both sides they are a lead us all of them\nWell I'm a huge Iran they are all leaders and and it drives me crazy\nThat ... and that's one thing that I I don't like about Trump is he said one thing and then he turned around and now he goes employees go all the time and he said if he was elected and he's not even going to take a vacation or nothing like that\nBut I mean I Do think Trump is doing a good job on other stuff and you know I'm ... now he made me ill with the budget when he said ... and and I gave a Planned Parenthood all that money or I mean you\nAnd and you got to remember big days the deficit is going to be worse than what Obama has even come close to and they don't care about the fiscally responsible and fix it they don't care you know what I mean and it's going to be a problem for\nThey don't care about it\nNo they do and if we keep messing with China bad things are going to happen\nOr what do you think number one weird that we're in that to him for one job I can call them the markers\nYou know what plan to get there and not some small country okay they're not afraid of

bullying what you call bullet bullying is him\nTrying to keep them at arm's length\nBut you know what day is if I come and go share with you in good faith I guarantee you um you're not going to come up with some common ground Gina versus meat threatening you because one sided threatened you you don't hear word I say\nThat you know I Do wonder and this is the question I Do always ponder it does seem that most of our presidents have money and even the ones that he didn't go in as millionaires seemed to come out and millionaires Milwaukee why that is now I can be\nHow it happened or the government was originally set up as part time job this was not supposed to be a\nCareer you have made it a career now they make their money Gina from speaking engagements they get money\nFrom a lobbyist people just kind of had their pocket quietly\nNow that doesn't bother me to leave office ... do\nYou have a lot but here's the problem days\nLike Obama right now going and making a hundred thousand dollars for spite hey he's his own person if somebody's going to get him nine hundred thousand dollars okay because they want to know what he had to say about being in an office\nOkay but what how do you explain to senators and the Congress math for all wealthy people now though the scare why should they get the best healthcare that do he keeps talking about the laughter given away

billion dollars cos\nWife because they're getting all the money from speaking engagement video pay they get into bed healthcare they we treat them like the royalty and they work for us and they're confused all of\nWell that's why I say that anyone has been in there longer than two terms how will not vote for\nWell basically I mean really down ever going to do not\nAnd they're never going to change that because you can't have the police themselves\nBut mine going also mean count is if they would uh we can fix the deficit real quick if we would quit sending all this money overseas and leave it right here in the u._s.\nRight and and make sure we cut their salaries down because they don't need that much money they're not up to look at the bickering didn't even get along with themselves\nAnd you know what I'm going to tell you that I Know you've got the call they go out to dinner and just laugh it up the Republican and the Democrat yeah bloody a lot of them are friends\nYou know what I mean mhm and we're sitting back here arguing with one another and this isn't a good life who look at the show we put on them now you know what I mean\nInteresting I think I
