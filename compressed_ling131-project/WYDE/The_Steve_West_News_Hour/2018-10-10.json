I. D. E. A. M. Birmingham W two three Seventy ... W D. J. C. H. D. to Birmingham [noise]\nCovering the news from the state capital to the White House this super station one oh one point one news at six wouldn't Gina Redmond [noise]\nComing up right now\nAt six o'clock here the stories we're following at this hour to give you and then now we begin tonight with the devastation caused by hurricane Michael now the most powerful storm to hit the U.S mainland\nIt made landfall today as a category ... storm striking the Florida Panhandle and at this hour more than fifty seven thousand people remain without power Hillary lane is in Panama City Beach Florida at night\nPicking the Florida Panhandle and at this hour more than fifty seven thousand people remain without power Hillary lane is in Panama City Beach Florida tonight\nThe worst of the storm has passed that's really just some light rain now in the palm trees I can see over my shoulder are blowing up before that around noon today\nThere was wind whipping across we couldn't even come outside because it would be just too dangerous\nI could see if you could see behind me this roof you could see it blowing in the window a little bit earlier today a popped off quite a bit you see street signs in this area on the ground is so many science hanging on a diet I Know earlier today it was a very very scary scene but as it passed through us right now much much calmer\nAnd as the area where you are there in Panama City beach is a pretty much fully evacuated\nYes so much of the area we were actually at a hotel last night in a mandatory evacuation zone so we left so many people there even though there was a mandatory evacuation area\nDidn't want to leave they had different reason this somehow to elderly family member some just wanted to ride the storm out so a lot of people even though they were in the mandatory evacuation areas decided to stay now right here we are not in a mandatory evacuation areas so more people are in this area\nAnd what is the worst of what you see now that the storm has passed as it mostly flooding that people now have to deal with there\nI Would say that is what people are going to have to do especially when it comes to tomorrow when people go outside and begin to rebuild we've also seen quite a bit of damage the structures we just mentioned this rift behind us\nWe're being told we've been able to see some homes have been completely leveled especially some newer structure so when people that have the document to begin to come back they're going to come back to quite a bit that they're going to need to rebuild\nAnd you know Hillary we hear that this is the strongest hurricane that's made landfall in the Florida Panhandle what are the folks there telling you about this I mean have they just send terrified that experience\nYet they say this is absolutely terrifying now the interesting part that people are saying is that they didn't have time to prepare you know with Florence\nPredictors were saying this is going to be a storm for a week but people here were saying they really didn't know about it as a form so quickly so they were getting the mandatory evacuation order this week and that's when they were first learning about it but I think the biggest thing people are saying is for such a powerful gigantic storm they didn't have a lot of time to prepare\nKnow invade and that was a I think what made it so scary for so many people it's certainly you know build strength more than anyone could more quickly than anyone could imagine how many homes you think there are without power are you seeing a lot of power outages where you are\nWe are we're hearing that ultimately there's going to be one hundred fifty thousand to two hundred thousand people without power in this region at our hotel where we're saying we lost it earlier even before the worst of the storm came through\nThat certainly going to be a major issue here we heard Florida's governor earlier today say the number one priority is to get the electricity back on it's crucial when it comes to rebuilding so certainly a large number of people up to two hundred thousand people will be without power and that's really going to hinder the rebuilding efforts later this week\nSo the question now is the worst of the storm now a category three over meteorologist Jeff you're a deli takes a closer look\nWe're down to a hundred and forty miles an hour it's crossing over I tend the next stop will be crossing over the Florida Georgia Line but because there was strengthening would have been blamed for all it means that it's going to weaken up a little less rapidly that means it's going to carry those hurricane force winds and damaging when St through Georgia is going to be a swath of damage\nProbably ... to maybe even cat three type damage in parts of southern Georgia that I've never seen that before\nGeorge or there is going to be a swath of damage\nProbably catch to maybe even cat three type damage\nIn parts of southern Georgia that never seen that before it's rare that a storm will be able to maintain its intensity so far inland we saw with Charlie we saw with this storm and the common denominator as they were strengthening storms at landfall so first they have to fly to then they can begin to weaken and so this storm is going further in them was from the west\nAnd what about rainfall do we have an update on that while\nThe rain at max because the storm moving fast is going to be about a foot give or take a little bit more than that\nAh that's okay in North Florida but it's gonna cause flooding in Georgia and then once it gets into places like south and North Carolina where we still have\nYou know saturated grounded swollen rivers were likely to see another round of substantial flooding there it's going to happen later tonight starting later tonight and a ranger distorted and times the heaviest up moving and later especially tomorrow tomorrow's when the storm as a tropical storm right across the Carolinas also the possibility of isolated tornados as well\nYeah I was going to ask you about that we spoke about the possibility of that storm being followed by tornadoes ... what are you saying and guards to that right now anything any indication\nShore every land falling tropical system produces tornado some produce a lot some produce less a no telling if this'll be a lot or a little bit either way there will be some fast moving rain rap tornadoes\nOr you can't see them and it's very hard to prepare for them when we see them as meteorologists are already moving sixty Seventy eighty miles an hour or so you know we see them we might be able to give you a couple of minutes lead time but either way you might not be able to see them 'cause they're wrapped in rain so\nYou know ... it's just a difficult situation but again the system is going to be weakening tonight and I think by tomorrow morning it should be around tropical storm\nStatus so what's the biggest danger for folks down there overnight\nIt's going to be wind damage ma'am yeah undoubtedly it's going to be when damage and then the focus is going to turn to freshwater rain flooding damage starting tomorrow and into a into friday morning so we're going to be moving offshore on friday morning that's the good news if not moving at the pace of Florence did\nMoving much much slower one other thing to mention if this is not happening in August people will be without power for three weeks or so in certain areas maybe longer the good news is they won't need their air conditioning quite as much at least as they would in August so this will be better for the people\nWho you know rely on air conditioning in electricity but still it's not going to be easy by any means digital\nThat's helpful for the elderly or act so many ... parish when they're they have no air conditioning in mid August\nWe saw with Hurricane Maria it wasn't so much the day on the storm that a lot of people died it was the aftermath with just getting supplies to people and people not having electricity and not having the central to get them through and so we saw a lot of death ... of the day that Maria ...\nIs just got an update it more than two hundred and fifty seven thousand people right now are without power certainly that number is expected to go up you know you you mentioned the as the freshwater surge that will happen is that more dangerous than the ocean surge that will eventually go back out\nWell uh you know they're both somewhat equally dangerous young a surge will go out I mean there's still some onshore flow there's can take a few hours for it to happen but if you're on the beach that will go\nBut as we saw with Florence and some of that freshwater flooding from rivers can linger for days and days um you know the last thing they needed in the Carolinas was freshwater river flooding from heavy rain but they're going to get it again\nNow right now people living in seven Alabama counties are without power here's the latest updates from Alabama Power\nIn Houston county nine thousand residents without power Geneva fifty three hundred deals forty five hundred Henry forty four hundred ... county one thousand one hundred home without power the scene in Barbara County and in Lee county eat hunt\nFour hundred ... county one thousand one hundred home without power the same in Barbara County and in Lee county eight

only a hundred and forty nights\nAnd that was Dr John ... reporting\nToday President Trump to approve legislation that will allow pharmacists to share lowered drug prices with patients for years now most pharmacists couldn't give customers even a clue about an easy way to save money on prescription drugs but now there are strengths are coming off\nIt's the\nWellbeing of every American the price of prescription drugs which way out of whack its way through I\nI've been talking about it for a long time long before I ever decided to run for president look at prices in our country and for the exact same drug in other countries is much lower exact same made in the same plant by the same company\nAnd I said what's going on we have middleman problems we have a lot of other problems well we're ending many of those problems today and we're going to end them are\nBased on what we're shining today two bills will be able to do additional things Mr Secretary over the coming actually months as opposed to years\nAnd we're going to see drug prices not only not go off to come down so today I'm thrilled designed to bills that will lower the cost of prescription drugs it's the no the lowest price act of two thousand Eighteen and the patient right to know drug prices act\nAnd uh obviously based on the name you can tell that this gives people knowledge as to prices at different locations where to buy the drugs that will have an immediate impact to a\nSchool the law of supply and demand pretty simple but we didn't have that they didn't want to have that a lot of people didn't want to have that but now we have it then it's going to really drive\nPrices earlier this year I released are drug pricing blueprint setting out a new agenda to drive down the drug prices for all Americans within a week of announcing the blueprint my administration began to crack down\nOn so called a gag clauses in Medicare part D plans you all know what that is these clauses prevent pharmacist from\nTelling patients about more affordable options for prescription drugs today Congress is building on my administration's actions with legislation very strong legislation\nTo completely and these unjust gag flaws once and for all fall\nSo from now on when the cash price for prescription is actually less than what you would pay using your insurance plan pharmacist will no longer have to keep that secret that's interesting because I don't think that's something I really knew you just assume that the price is going to be cheaper with your insurance\nYou know what I mean yeah yeah but listen I'm back to the fact is nothing is ever cheaper with your in your family yeah I and and this goes away I mean this\nCar rental renting or [laughter] you know when your cars yeah in the shop or a no nothing insurance causes prices to go yeah great\nWell you know that now when I go in for you know I have to get a prescription I'm going to say what is it cheaper for me just to pay for it\nJust to go up yeah great well you know that's now when I go in for you know I have to get a prescription I'm going to say is it cheaper for me just to pay for it or is it cheaper with the insurance\nRight I'm going to ask and they'll have to tell and they'll have more than you know they didn't they weren't required to or actually were forbidden to\nWell you know one thing that I did find out that I learned from someone like for example um penicillin\nSome places you can get that for free yes [laughter] you know what I mean yes it's still really cheap with insurance that you can get it for free so why pay for it right now it's little things like that but\nThe pharmacists I didn't learn that from the pharmacy no you know what I'm saying but now they can actually tell them they could say well yeah it'd be cheaper for you to go acts because you want anything here even with insurance you can have to pay like five bucks right Sam interesting stuff\nAll right well guys my last day on the air is Thursday so today and tomorrow it's going to be free for all it means you guys can pick the topic and I'm going to talk about it because I really want to hear what you guys have to say I only have two

one\n[noise] if we believe in the Christian nation thing universal healthcare would be great because we'd love each other but the problem is\nThe leftist demonstrated that I'm a white man fifty nine years old business owner [noise] um [noise]\nWorked hard a mechanic I get underneath trust I've been laying in the mud all day today fixing trucks broke down on the interstate [noise] but if I was in Portland [noise] I probably would be um beat up by the leftist that would just see me and do that [noise] so [noise]\nThe thing is they say we need universal health care where a Christian nation but when their actions don't demonstrate\nThat they love every one am I making sense there\nYou are um what what's your biggest fear with universal healthcare [noise]\nUm how to pay for it you know paying for is not a problem insurance to dispense him as a business owner I'm paying\nFifty percent for my employees I understand the ex pats you know it's up there and it's one of the things that deal in business the problem was universal healthcare is I have the ability to shop doctors\nThe problem with universal healthcare is okay Dr Bill is open and best summer that's the only place you can go or you got to wait three months to go the doctor\nOkay Dr Bill is open and best summer that's the only place you can go or you got to wait three months to go the doctor Joe down here\nI'm less just I'll give you a perfect example why universal healthcare doesn't work VA [noise]\nOkay he's not allowed to be a system the universal healthcare for or the rents are the ones that have sacrificed and look\nHow much of that system is broken and now we want to turn this over to every single American [noise]\nYou know it's interesting because I have a friend who moved here from Switzerland where they have a universal healthcare and she said there are pros and cons to that she said the proudly car you can receive good medical care like if you have\nA disease like cancer or something like that if you have a minor um illness it might be a long wait she said the negative now is that\nThe taxes are very they pan why in taxes like she said on the fourth time a catastrophic illness will not render you financially dying road yeah right so she sees than I there\nAnd you bring up a good point there is a balance that can be done but [noise]\nWho are we going to decide does that balance do on the side and I'm not going to throw that do we want it you know just for all you know as to what the Christian right to decide if you have cancer and now we're not going to afford it\nOr do we want the left is left the ones that are out there protesting\nUm\nI mean you you got both strength you got the stream that was the church of Florida that goes out and does all this stuff and then you get the people that are yelling at people in elevators or even when you're out for dinner saying hey so who do we want you got these two extremes where where's the proper middle and that's what's happening\nMost people love the middle\nBut the streams the extreme right gets out there in protests like an figure the church in Florida this kind of out there and then you got this strain that what is it ... I'm ... what's that radical group is doing all this stuff\nYou know more about Medicare as an example of universal health care\nAnd Medicare or in your opinion doesn't work pretty good\nIn yes it is for me\nAnd I agree with you for my wife it works pretty good so there there's a balance that\nThe whole problem with the American political system is who who's going to be in charge of this\nYou know you bring up some really good questions ... ...\nI mean I'm actually very much data and I hope you're on the air for many years to\nCome here ... thank you Bye bye high round ... gallon will tell you something yeah nobody will miss you more now we'll recently and I'm going to miss ... T Routh\nA you know I'm basically if you get the insurance companies out of a health care business it would be a lot cheaper because the government the Medicare and Medicaid fun it's run very efficiently and very ... three less costly\nThat's a fact people give it to an insurance company insurance companies are in business to make a profit\nOf mine and banks boy my insurance companies insurance companies [noise] used to have the same ... thanks did in Nineteen twenties and thirties invented by in class\nInsurance companies insurance companies used to have the same ... the Nineteen twenties and thirties fitted Bonnie and Clyde\nSometimes I Wonder if doctors somewhat wish that you know insurance companies would go away and they can find a different system to cover the cost\nOf the reason that some doctors who don't take Medicare and Medicaid is because the government will usually tell you about sixty days later from time to finish will turn\nOut really well and they don't like to do with their money right up front\nI didn't know they paid that late I Know um and I don't know if it's a case here in Pennsylvania I Know from my parents they they benefited from having supplemental insurance to go with their their coverage and our ...\nHealth care provider that it was very expensive yeah they'll do take a home for four dollars or your Social Security checking issue ... premium every month pass a law which is that she had those two together\nAnd all I didn't know that yeah that was French British and that is expensive especially if you're on a fixed income\nExactly exactly and um most people can't afford to afford that anyway oh and I'm you know I'm going to Mars causing it to use it ... them crash but my phone number\nTo outright lie [laughter] oh really [laughter] countries have always\nKnew I'd want to have a a universal health care than for new weapons defense system\nMm well I think everybody health care for most people is up there it's one of the top things unless you're like twenty twenty year old\nWide who [laughter] you know what I mean they're not worried about healthcare but as you get older you start thinking about that\nYou know do toy Yahoo's invisible and fell\nYeah they they don't even they don't even\nKnow enough about little you know a lot bigger fifty unlike mission medical\nYeah they really don't they don't think about it but I\nYou know and no insurance insurance companies or are they are they going to run any type of field program will be ... there's going to be had to be a property in it\nMm we may\nYeah thirty percent thirty percent yeah exactly I agree I agree\nWith you look at a young man that no one should Medicare and Medicaid or the two most officially close to ... less a programs to film it runs its government ran in and you still had to pay so it'd be cheaper than what you have to buy the insurance companies\nThat's true I don't know this country I don't know if we'll ever see universal healthcare\nWell I mean anything can happen it could change but right now I just don't see that happening\nWherever it developed industrial country in the world has universal health in the United states is the only one who does\nMm well maybe maybe a shift in power and a shift in thinking I don't know but you're right there's other countries that habit which\nIs which one doesn't know country he's a college would be more because they don't have the population working there that we have here\nTo support it but it would be nice to be able to go to the doctor or if you had to go to the emergency room and not worry ooh do I have the two hundred and fifty dollar co pay I'm going to need or something like\nThat that just got me now they'll put it out well it's I have a ... some some some deal ... will part days well then you're going to have like ... but you got to pay for\nIt [laughter] because Medicare only ... vice report a hospital\nYeah I'm nervous about the a B C and D [laughter] when I'm going to have to because it does seem like it's confusing he Ralph thanks so much\nAnd I'm going to miss you miss you do better call into my nine okay All right hey here mad\n[laughter]\nIf they're calling to my nine okay All right hey you're mad\nGene Dina [laughter] hey yeah\nNice you Jake of course the the toy Russell the uh-huh I won't\nMiss y'all man Oh thank you [laughter] yeah [laughter] [laughter] so yeah after the game [laughter] now do you cook\nThe Trump they could be wealthy individuals that at the top all changed or whatever they said you know people\nWant to go to monitor what's going on for about ... of all the talk\nYes [noise] [noise] yeah that was the only thing I mean I don't know you can't speak on it but\nMhm I don't know\nMaybe like you know Dr welfare go just 'cause just as you know what I'm saying\n[laughter] was was\nIronic is that you know when I listen to the states now they\nAll this ...
