I think there's a little I don't know it just seems cute you know it seems like they're trying to silence all the message that you're putting out either way I'm going to do with that brand you always\nKnow how to do that thanks RV and within ten times I get it to you know what I'm saying we're seeing you know you just take social media and\nConservatives being silenced their topic we've talked about a lot where you know one little flip up above a Fox News analyst or anchor and they trying to take this person out right and not because the person messed up in their own forgiving it's because they want to silence these conservative voices\nOr that's not the case here although you do in in this on this platform you didn't have some conservative voices being silenced it's just a a different motivation behind it Josh has an accent where are you Josh\nAnd it was of guys and then\nI just want to call and tell you guys that are you guys will be greatly miss then I called in for faction while ago and I said it told Andrea and I I've talked to for before and told him was saying that it hurts my heart to see you guys go because you guys have become a huge part of my life\nEvery day my radio does not change from one oh one point one I'll listen to you guys for regular to you guys and I'm judging at night\nSo yeah we uh unfortunately and that's that's another point they may exist so tough as because I'm like some radio shows and I'm not calling you name because again judging by heart but there's a lot of radio shows out there that just you know they just talk to us\nMake this topic because I'm like some radio shows and I'm not calling you name because again judging by his heart but there's a lot of radio shows out there that just you know they just\nTalk to an audience and they they talk and in the audience should I say but here it's almost like we we do so much interacting with you guys over the phone it's we consider all you guys family so for how you guys feel about this whole thing we feel the exact same way and it's it's not a fun time\nYou know and uh like I said earlier I was praying that uh your future to all your guys his future endeavors will be as productive and prosperous if not more uh hopefully much more you know for you guys\nWell we definitely appreciate that Josh thank you buddy\nGuy with ...\nAnd that's the thing you know there's a lot of ah there's a lot of faith that goes into this a lot of trusting God that this is this is taking you somewhere else then is it going to be bigger and better it's hard to see the the forest for the trees\nBecause there's a lot of trees right now right in our face we can't see past them but\nThat's where the faith comes in and we just got to it's going to hang on time was really all we got that's the only that's the only weapon in our arsenal at the moment Roger what's up\nBut as for the way she still the best I Bayliss ... before ... came on it and a great day just about it they just like\nYeah and I look at how medical ... favorite show over there a way that a lock on ... ... ... years ago and call him a God rally but\nIt got a paper out there and I show all the best I hate to say this happened because a lot shorter lived in a while ago is just ... ... ... ... ... and I'll hear liberal ... job every day all day\nAnd it's good to hear the other side and this has got to get all the king of the other side\nAnd you'd be surprised that her under it's in the hundreds of people after ... ... or follow me listen to the radio or file yeah [laughter] where are you listening to you know\nYou take a call ... house and not and they asked the apron are now ... what area\nAre well they had a ... good people like you and everybody else and listens to show that it's going to keep fighting\nTo uh make sure the the only information out there is not mainstream liberal media and the the the whole country gets indoctrinated and I think we're seeing a change in this country where\nPeople are seeing those those outlets in in those new sources for what they are but it's a it's a never ending fight so you keep doing what you're doing Roger and and we're going to be All right\nYou all have a great one that I'll always shall the fast I Wish I Hope you both in our next next year\nWhere I'm at right now going on here so I'm way around it would be nice and take a little bit of this thing away just in\nJust a tad when if you like your last day you win the lottery I'll just coming out of the nation no no and I actually really good to have everybody their job that mean you'd be non boss\nAh but for those amendments do you want to I don't know if you've got to balance the front of you do you want to give us a rundown on on more of the controversial amendments that people will be seeing statewide\nYeah well we can talk about each the amendments any kind of what I think their their purposes but let me say this the front of it is I I think the amendments are are more of an effort to cow to drive out the vote so they they get through the legislature and you want to have\nA a ... something on the ballot instead that protest abortion you know the protests to reveal a decision and did the second part of that amendment one I think that drives up to vote but the second part is we have a new court now right so what happens if\nThey overturned that court case well this this will lay the groundwork for what the state's reaction would be let's say they overturn it and it but it's only left up to the states to decide what they want to do on the abortion you know on the issue policy wise well then that that would you know this this leads to ground work for the legislature\nAnd the state of Alabama end of the voters perhaps to determine what that should be and I think that's the intention of it but I Do think it's a get out the vote means I think a lot of people will come out and vote for that reason\nAnd I think that's the intention of it but I Do think it's a get out the vote means I think a lot of people will come out and vote for that reason a and the second ... the second amendment the one that's really kind of got a lot of the ACLU and Southern Poverty Law Center type saw wild up as this take commandments ah\nThe displaced so so what is essentially what this is\nIt's not just to take a man ministers all these other uh documents these founding documents declaration of independence the magna car to all these things that we base sort of uh our our our jurors permitted to all these things that make up kind of the foundation for American government\nAnd and wants to make it a you know a ... not not a unconstitutional thing to do in Alabama to have these displays up and so the thing that the truly\nKinda kept us from being a reality in the past is that the state didn't want to deal with the law suits\nSo they just kind of have a blanket ban all Ten Commandments displays they didn't want to deal with the freedom from religion types or or whatever it may be that doesn't want any mention of God in any mention of any biblical reference or anything of that variety\nOn the ballot I've been down about ... display the public places like ... or whatever so so what they I I think what this does\nThis changes this let allows for this changes language to make it you know if if you're a high school Decatur iced or whatever does that icicle you want to have\nThis display with all these documents and you can it would be against the Alabama constitution and where the the I think the part of it that that really appealing to some people they are really out there pushing this as\nWell say the seal you dust sue\nWhatever high school decides to uh exercise this new freedom in the state constitution well\nThere there's a provision in there that says are not going to use public money that pop private institutions will come in and defend against these lawsuits and allow that that that would give the that would put the burden I'll take the bird off the taxpayers to laugh and these displaced so I think\nI think a lot of people say well I I think having to take amendments posted in public schools are public places is a is a good idea and after that if it can be displayed id the state capital where it already is being displayed then why not our schools and I think that's good enough to get some people to come out but\nYeah that's a that's a good point and ... we'll get aggravated when we see but I found a organizations like freedom from religion a foundation and and the others go after\nI mean even to the point of going after local high schools or you know small towns in their Christmas parades and all this kind of stuff\nAh people get fired up when that kind of thing happens so I I agree with you I think that can get some people out there and vote just for that even if they don't care or they think that everything's going to go the Republican's way or they're you know they know Kay Ivey is going to win or whatever the case is\nKnow that could get them out and I I never really thought about it like that to for those things to be put out there and not for the purpose a well entirely for the purpose but just to get people out there to vote because\nThese turnout they're kind of low what what do you think we know the primaries were were pretty low turnout has to be expected but what do you think's going to happen in the general election\nI mean Meryl always says twenty percent Seventeen twenty percent somewhere in there I think he's been pretty accurate what the general election I think he's\nKind of over shot some of the primaries a this has gotten a lot of media attention it's on every channel it'll be the big story on cable news will definitely be it'll be the big story and broadcast TV [noise] I I think that's probably a fair number I don't think you'll be anywhere near a general election but the\nThere's a definitely be it'll be the big storm broadcast TV [noise] I I think that's probably a fair number I don't think you'll be anywhere near a general election but the the the thing that really hurts Alabama's you said there's not a lot of competitive races in some parts of the state I think there's three or four\nSenate races that could be flew a Democrat or Republican there's one in northeast Alabama uh the the the Andrew Williams or correct for battle for US Senate seat up there a ... some of your listeners probably will be participating in that election a\nAlabama red bay a Democrat Johnny Mack Morrow and Larry ... are are going that that seems to be the Democrats think they can flip\nBecause uh it was Roger Bedford who was kind of an institution in Montgomery for years and years and years\nThat's his old seat and he was a Democrat they think they could flip back to Democrat or that that's the other one and no one to a lot of people are talking about I don't think it's gonna flip but just the changes we county with the growth of the changes the demographics\nAnd especially the growth that already university ah\nThe the the ... seat down there it might be a little closer closer than usual than than you would expect the county has traditionally been a solid Republican county\nBut just the way things are growing and it's becoming more of a kind of a suburban cosmopolitan place it's getting it's become kind of a lighter shade a reds usually to three Senate races everyone is talking about all the statewide\nI you know I I Can't see Walt Maddox making a charge a ten a governor you know I think ... got that 'cause a lot of people don't even know who's running against its will ... case you're wondering the one that might be a little interesting is the attorney general's race we're just seeing them and seeing them and ask them name id given his dad was governor and\nSteve Marshall ... they're they're trying to create this cloud of controversy over him that he took money from the Republican attorney general's association and supposedly violates the state's packed a pack transfer laws\nI don't think it's enough for ... but I Do think it's a ... maybe maybe it may make some people either about that that that that that on the ballot blank or or maybe something like ...\nI I watch uh I still scratching my head Everytime I see these people talking about a ... and how he was a political prisoner and all this kind of stuff on just like\nOkay but I I see what you're saying on that front I could see a lot of these people who were outspoken about that issue still voting for voting for Joseph's Eagleman and are trying to beat out the Marshall whether that controversy you're talking about contributes to it or not\nOr I could see that wouldn't be an entire race\nI I don't know about tight but I Do think you know the name id is enough to say oh I I kinda\nKnow see a woman is I remember that name uh I I Know Steve Marshall and the sounds of generic mania marked about for for single men you know that that this type of stuff people do and when they go to vote or they don't necessarily always you know really really bone up on the the the intricacies of it\nNow I I think just by virtue of having an R next to his name Steve Marshall to walk away with it\nBut if you're just looking for any reason to care and see if this really matters I think that race the attorney generation the or the chief justice race\nThe chief justice race between Bob Vance that the office refrigerator guy but a ... [laughter]\nAnd uh uh uh Tom Parker who's kind of against Roy Moore\nSome people think that'll dragging down because he has a role and more baggage but the Vance Parker race is interesting because the trial lawyers\nHave really got me Hi Nancy dumped a bunch of money to his campaign you drive around mount\nFaces interesting because the trial lawyers\nHave really got me high dancer dumped a bunch of money to his campaign you drive around\nDown gum re or Spring Hill immobile and you'll see Bob van signs of peoples' yards I think that's worth a few votes I instead of winning by twenty points I think maybe Parker wins by ten but\nParker hasn't raised any money but he still got that valuable our next to his name and really that's all you need I mean I think in Alabama in this political climate running as a Democrat is just really really too tough of a hurdle to overcome\nYeah and as far as an attorney general's race go I guess we should all just be grateful that Troy King name isn't on the ballot right [laughter]\nYeah well that's a Detroit king seems to be any that he he's he's kind of leaning toward a a voting against Steve Marshall or with a ... there's a\nThings going on with the attorney general's office over the last twenty Thirty years just the way gambling is in Alabama\nAnd the way gambling walls are enforced interpreted what's a game of chance you know all these things what the porch creature doing what the porch Greeks want what they don't want all of these people trying to pedal\nIt and that's you really determine what kind of gambling is legal through what the attorney general does the governor can say whatever she wants but at the end of the day the attorney general is the one to kind of gets to be the top law enforcement officer and enforce these\nLaws now that the ports Craig now this is only interesting to me this specifically because I remember when I worked with Scott ... he had a caller that would regularly call in and accused him because you know he's the center he accused him of accepting money from the port creek Indians and apparently beef and has some secret", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Steve West News Hour", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "31"}
