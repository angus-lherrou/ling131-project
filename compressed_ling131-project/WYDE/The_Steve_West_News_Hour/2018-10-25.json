tend to say if if you are going to really hone in on a celebrity that was the most outspoken I mean just for me anyway so he's not the first person that would pop in my mind you know what I mean there's plenty of other celebrities I feel like I'm Cathy Griffin being one of them that\nHas made these outlandish saying well there's an endless list of all there really is but my point is he's just not at the top of the list so it's I don't know it just seems crazy well in\nThe end of the things crazy man Janeiro has been very outspoken about it um in he's threatened violence against Trump saying he wants to punch them in the face or whatever\nBut uh I don't know it just it as time goes by and and I actually question myself last night I'm like have I'd jump to conclusions are thinking that this could possibly be a fake bomb is on\nIt I've been there for an hour and a half that's how ridiculous is why I said I'm like okay what is it and he goes\nHave you ever had suicidal tendencies

have been concerned that that right actually true\nWell I mean yeah you should have set another five minutes in this office and I may just\nListen here's the thing that I learned a long time ago that

that's where a rat on bombs on twenty Eighteen\nUm the\nReaction to this has been somewhat expected against we knew that run off the bat and the way people would act towards this is all Trump's fall there's two sides to this there's it's Trump's fault and there is hey the Democrats this is a this is an\nInside job right like they're doing it to themselves or one of their supporters is doing it to them and sending them bomb that's not going to explode and for political reasons because they're scared about the midterms\nA Donald Trump however and there was some concern on my part I think of Donald Trump coming out and going with the theory that we've been talking about where being I'm not a real threat and it's all politically motivated I was scared that he was going to come out on Twitter and say that and I don't think it's\nIt's gonna be a good idea for him to do that not right now because not not because he's\nYou know going to be wrong but it's because of the ammunition that that gives the other side Uganda unfortunately play ... with this thing and just sit back and let the investigation take its course but Trump still can't help but stand up for themselves stand up for the people that support him\nAnd as they all are placing the blame on him\nHe turns it right back around and\nSays if if my science going to be taking responsibility for heated rhetoric the media is going to have to take responsibility for their rhetoric any echoed those same things last night's uh at that rally here's here's a tweet from what is today\nTwenty fifth okay there's a tweet was from this morning about five o'clock this morning when Donald Trump ...\nWe from what is today the twenty fifth okay this guy and we was from this morning about five o'clock this morning 'cause that's when Donald Trump ...\nHe's had a very big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely faults and inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I referred to as ... ...\nIt has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description mainstream media must clean up its\nAct fast food and again he said those same sort of things at last night's rally which uh had a crowd very pumped up\nThe\nThe left was not\nVery excited to hear him say these things because\nI guess they expected him to take one hundred percent ownership and responsibility of course they do these bombs and not to point the finger at anybody else because nobody else is guilty and nobody else has has done anything wrong the mainstream media\nA fear mongering on a daily basis about Donald Trump and Trump supporters that's not wrong\nIt's Donald Trump's\nFear mongering or whatever they want to call it\nCelebrities\nTook to Twitter yesterday before knowing anything about anything you know or not they they know nothing other than who's received the moms and you want to hear some of their react ah would love to and do you would that's why I looked up some of these tweets or who you want first how 'bout\nThat member okay she said\nUm [noise] what's happening is all the hate and divisiveness being sold by the person in the White House and\nHis surrogates is coming to a head and people are in mortal danger there will be blood\nOn their hands\nWell I don't think there's been blood so far marine [laughter] if I'm going to blow up for us to give them with all the work first or who else\nRobb Reiner Donald Trump tells his cult followers protesters are paid for by Soros the horror of him\nSaying that well I think one of ... they were they did\nA Hillary Clinton should be locked up John Brennan should lose his clearance CNN is the enemy of the people and blames Obama for everything their wives were all threatened do the math boats\nWell I mean you know reporting actual facts about people's you know record I don't know that that's hate speech\nMhm you've ... Nicole Brown you know her vet ... your vet I thought that was at the Y. silent that are as a vet Nicole mom but I I don't know not as it's not that I Know that any ... hey that could be that you've at whatever let's go with that I like that and that he'd been any that\nAre suspicious and or actual explosive devices mailed to the Clintons and the Obamas jobs not mobs huh\nAt least they didn't ask them to leave a restaurant or ask why they don't believe sexual assault survivors that would be worse\nInsert signed I Am ...\nA ... who else we got ... uh uh\nNicole is mikel brown to says what George Soros CNN bill and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama all have in common all I've been vilified by the occupant\nOf sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue he tells his uh his his\nThat they are the enemies he blames them for everything wrong in America is anyone surprised\nIs uh his his people that they are the enemies he blames them for everything wrong in America is anyone surprised some ... jumped targeted them\nMany driver today a bomb was mailed to the Obamas and the Clintons and the CNN a few days ago woman was melted George Soros if the left is mob does that make the right terrorist\nHere's what doesn't make any sense so if you wanted to I don't know let's say a fact so now the ...\nWouldn't you nailed bombs to the Democrat people who are running against the Republicans I mean I'm not trying to be a mastermind here but if you really wanted to have some type of you know cause and effect\nWhere are you my mailing bombs to these people who people that aren't running for and all that I'm saying I mean Hillary Clinton what it what does she has to do with anything I mean I Know she's got probably a hand and and something as far as the deep state or whatever you want to\nCall again the only one that holds office or would even be up for a reelection is Maxine Waters the rest of 'em are are washed up has been\nThat's what it doesn't make any sense\nMhm [noise] um [noise] then the media's reaction to Trump mainly to test comments last night at the rally you want to hear some of those ... [noise] a Trump warned\nThat made it this is Jerry Sexton should drop more than the media tonight he he was saying if the negative coverage it doesn't improve we should expect\nMore tax that's what he said that the president says rally last night a\nTrump is turning these assassination attempts as a means to blame the media for attacks and taking a swipe at mobs this political it's using it as a means of a fence\nIt's disgusting that was really hard to follow I Wonder if uh Brian Williams is going to claim he got one [laughter] I was there when the bomb was if you use that himself\nRight right um\nAnderson Cooper he made no mention of an explosive device than to his building this building behind me standing in front of the CNN building the headquarters of CNN News organization he routinely a taxi called reporters the enemy of the American people yet he said it's the media's fault\nUh who else two outs\nAnd Jim Roberts in in in rally why ... why can't nobody tweet I Can't understand anybody's tweet\nTrump makes that Trump takes no responsibility for the hospital political environment instead points the finger at opponent in the news media\nA Charlie awards all truly amazing that it's become a common straight faced tactic on the right during times of potential political violence to direct blamed towards the press and the whip up hostility towards them now\nLet's just take a look back to the political violence that we've dealt with just recently are nearing the Trump Administration\nAlways come from the left [noise] and then let's look at blaming the media in part for that violence well\nA lot of comparisons are being made to the the not the less violence with antifa or poor patrons\nOf restaurants getting chased out and screen that and even assaulted in some cases by the way I saw\nA video and I don't I don't have a lot of contacts to it was a black man standing in a restaurant wearing a make America great again hats some racist white liberal got up in his face and started screaming at him and knocked his handlers has had it it's still happening and it's not just to politicians is to regular people\nI have to go back outside of those instances in and think about\nThe baseball field shooting where ah in in Sarah Huckabee Sanders made this comment earlier how nobody blamed Bernie Sanders for that because he was an avid Bernie Sanders supporter and even volunteered for the campaign at one point um that's much more dangerous than fake bombs\nThis guy almost killed Steve skull lease in trying to kill others and was fortunately not able to do so I started digging into that and revisiting some old articles and and just trying to get a feel of what the reaction from Democrats were\nI started digging into that and revisiting some old articles in just trying to get a feel of what the reaction from Democrats were when people would suggest that Democrats\nAnd or Bernie Sanders was to blame\nFor this shooting for their rhetoric against drunk or or or Republicans aren't good about how dangerous Republicans are and and forcing people to take action\nAnd almost a self defense type of mode saying I've got to do something to them or they do something to me 'cause that's the way people mind board proactive so I found the clip of Nancy Pelosi at a press conference talking about that issue when it's brought up by a reporter in the room\nWell\nI guess I'm going to the moon but only a little bit man I don't even have poured them well that's a serious problem or I feel like a domino so excited about that is right on ... on up here we go dragging\nOn and says about fishery all over the last thing is\nWell I think that your question is an excellent one and I think that the comments made by my Republican colleagues are\nOutrageous beneath the dignity of the jobs that they hold an eighth of dignity and respect that we would like Congress to command how dare they say such a thing how dare they are so this sick individual does something despicable\nAnd it was horrible what he did hateful but for them to all of a sudden the sanctimonious as if they don't never seen such a thing before\nAnd I don't even want to go into the president of the United states but in terms of some of the language that he has you so again I let's go there and the other day but since you asked how could they possibly say such as first of all the timing of it all\nEverybody is so sad so concerned so coming together you know let us all take a step back to examine our own conscience see what a um\nNegative attitudes we can all her tail\nBut the sanctimonious at all really really what do you think don't you think it's strange how you think it's strange that instead\nPraying be careful of that all of this that they would start saying let's have this conversation another day okay\n[laughter] maybe maybe names and blows it was a bad example because she's so hard to follow right I'm like what is you just said but she was saying it was so absurd it's so horrible for Republicans to say that the the political environment on the left or the rhetoric\nWas a responsible in any way for them baseball field shooting it's absurd how could you say such a thing I think we all need to come together examine ourselves in any negative vibes we're given out\nAnd go from there and not blame of political party ads on them or the place you could you imagine\nA democratic coming out and saying those things right now no and saying you know what this is not the time to place for politics is not the time and a place to uh to blame Trump for all of that we need to examine ourselves and see where we're at in this this political\nI think both sides to do that and for the reasons I said earlier the last thing in the world either side wants to do and this is jump to conclusions and then you look like an idiot and the ... one of those two things will happen somebody at the end of all of this is going to be looking\nWants to do in this as jump to conclusions and then you look like an idiot ... one of those two things will happen somebody at the end of all of this is going to be looking like in any in ... and who knows who told me\nIt's going to be a whole bunch of people don't want it to be me and it won't be okay you're on the right side of his ... faster than make\nBomb a thon twenty Eighteen stay with me Jessica ... is a burst\nYo la all fall on that thought I'll be the idiot\nYou joining fake bombs on twenty eight team\nYeah okay um they're absolutely fake and I can tell you I'm that\nWhen somebody is building a bomb they build it for a specific purpose\nYou can be a terrorist you can be you could have a grudge that you're is targeting a specific person and if those bombs had tires on them and you send them through the mail how do you set that timer\nHow do you do when the bomb was going to be in close proximity\nRight and as we talked about in non black or you work at the post post office U S P s and but sometimes and and I admitted that the post office has done a lot better these days and they used to\nSometimes you just don't know when the package is going to get there especially I mean not not even a tie you don't know the time you know the day you can\nMake an assumption exact but\nYou have no idea\nFor that bomb to you know if you're if you're trying to\nKill people with a ball\nAt the package bomb it's got to have a switch on so when you open it explodes if you're going to put a timer on it you're going to place that bomb in an area where you know there's got to be a lot of people at a specific times and it's got to go off and say in the crowd\nWho say maximum damage yeah and in that the things that these people received these former politicians received you know we call those things we call it a clock right was yeah\nRight right so so it's it's it's a start\nYeah yeah I don't know who well obviously the person's not bombing [noise] um because bomb makers they are a real bomb maker they have their their bomb in their signature\nAnd they have specific ways that they build those bombs from buffalo refused the Unabomber as an example she created his ball out of wood and you know just the materials that he could find around them and when the FBI\nIs investigating a bomber they will look at how the bomb is constructed and they will figure out this person's quote unquote signature and this is how they build them rights and from what I'm gathering from what's being reported\nThere being mail I might you might as well this mail them a clock at a couple of road lawyers and a battery in a box wrap it up and take spray painted laugh it off you go\nRight ... and I and when I'm getting from you as bomb makers also take a lot of pride in in their ... so that we're not going to just do that you're not going to see this kind of bomb coming from someone who's data waited to getting more arms to people just judging by how many Vincent\nSee this kind of bomb coming from someone who's dedicated to getting more arms to people just judging by how many Vincent\nThey're going to build them they're going to test them and they're going to make sure they're working up the blow themselves up doing [noise] um but troublemakers perfect or craft and then they're gonna ...\nYeah I imagine that if it can't be their first time putting together a ... if this is the ... the the targets they picked out you can't tell me this is like one time bomb maker you know if we do have a legit perpetrator here\nThis can't be just one time and hey here's the thing maybe this is where they're going with trying to pin this on the Republican and thanks Keith I'm Sorry they ... they may be saying that the reason the boundaries so poorly built\nIs because the Republican putting them to gather was in such a hurry because he had to get to work\nNo right because we have jobs we have jobs they don't tell their protest ... jobs not only ... only on a second center sloppy once jobs not bomb okay I like that shark bay\nHey what's going on anybody oh I just found out some very interesting information about all this and you know Hillary is kind of being kicked off to the spot\nAfter losing presidential race just try to get back with all of our friends are democratic friends so she thought what can I Do I Know", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Steve West News Hour",
