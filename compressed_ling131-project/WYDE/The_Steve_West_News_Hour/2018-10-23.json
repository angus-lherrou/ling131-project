go Donald Trump in the oval office speaking to reporters about the up lots of issues and just because that's just been released I Want to bring you back and we do that just got\nA hundred in Denver military hundred and fifty million\nI think that's over a million jobs and many of them just over a million jobs [noise] so we do that which is hurting ourselves\nWe just started ourselves and I know that from a certain standpoint you could also say well it doesn't matter because it is a terrible thing\nBut uh we wouldn't be really are they going to shows will be hurting our companies would be hurting our jobs and uh so we'll see what happens when I should have a pretty good for a couple of seconds I should have a pretty good record\nVersus yes I have two grown just involved on her comments about the nationals gr is concerned that you are sending coded language or a dog whistle some Americans out there that would really be a little more management\nI'm never even heard that I cannot imagine the human Rhode Island last listener I never heard the theory about being a nationalist I've heard them all\nBut I'm somebody that loves our country when I see a nationalist I don't like it when Germany has been one percent of GDP for NATO and we're paying for point three percent I don't like that that's not fair\nI don't like it wasn't as an example we're protecting a year\nAnd we're paying for almost the entire cost of the day that we're paying for a very very substantial portion foreign where to than water today\nA hero and we're paying for almost the entire cost of that we're paying for a very very substantial fortune foreign\nWorded than what it should have a we have great respect for those countries but on top of that I don't like it when they put up barriers to our farm lands were farmers cannot sell in Europe they have trade barriers that they could you guys know better than anybody ... or as severe\nAs China's trade barriers which were coming down they want to make a deal very badly for the coming down\nBut I Am very proud of our country we cannot continue to allow what's happening to our country to continue athletes get let it happen so I'm proud I'm proud of our country and I am a nationalist is the word that has been used too much\nIs is whenever route I think it should be brought back I'm somebody that wants to help other countries of the world\nBut I also have to say we have to take care of our country we cannot continue to allow ourselves to be duped or military and also to address with the European Union as an example\nLast year on trade lost one hundred and fifty one million dollars on top of that we lost hundreds of billions of dollars one protection and so we protect you can we get till\nWe we do the training and they get killed typically I wanted to be here so I Want them to open their borders I Want them to make it fair for our farm lands are are companies are medical companies sell medical equipment they just put restrictions on\nAnd they say and you know this as well as anybody over the course of the year over the course of a number of years they've intercepted many people\nFrom the middle east they've intercepted ISIS they've intercepted all sorts of\nThings intercepted good ones in Bethlehem David yourself do wonderful people from the middle east and they just shut the bad ones they've intercepted wonderful people from South America and from other parts\nFurther south they intercepted a lot of different people but among the people they've intercepted very recently are people from the middle east okay\nSo you can't be surprised when you hear it you've heard that before it happens all the time and I spoke to literally last night I spoke to another one this morning very good relationship with border patrol and ice and they said it happens all the time from the middle east but it's not even saying bad or what's the real bad one\nBut there were just out of there and the ... and they could very well be that there's no\nThere's no proof of anything there's no proof of anything or what they could very well be if you look at what that was building you know they were talking about five or six thousand people I'm pretty good at estimating grabs ... as you probably have figured out you tend to get a\nLittle bit off the real number last night as an example\nWas records sending stuff was nothing but they don't want to talk about that but I Will tell you let me just say that I rarely I Believe that that was pretty bad as that was pretty impressive by any standard and these are great people and the and by the way you vote for senator vote is a and this could be\nBad or indifferent for Democrats or Republicans but the amounts of voting is a level that they've never seen before for her the other day and uh [noise]\nI don't know whether it's supposed to say that's good or bad but I Will tell you on the amount of people voting is that the levels that uh that you've never seen that and the terms a record level by a lot so I think I think very I think it was a very good chance honestly that said you have\nPeople in that I also think there's a very good chance that over the course of a third of time you have for that don't have to necessarily be in that group\nBut certainly you have people coming up through the southern border from the middle east and other places that are not appropriate for our country can't Tom not letting them and they're not coming in\nRight they're not coming in what do they do whatever we after they're not coming and can you imagine trying to still no none of your book is called farms with his rival I'm a very non political person and that's why I got elected president\nDo you not the final spy swap that he's not surprised that you know that you share that had been in prison\nYeah yeah definitely not the finance vitamins that he'd use your life that you know that you share that\nPresident Hernandez when President Trump asked me to call the president of Honduras who was initiated he told me that you can organize but leftist groups\nIn Honduras that were being finance in part by Venezuelan and stuff and foreign eyes by human traffickers who have no regard for human life organized by dangerous gang members moving people more when I spoke to president [noise]\nI'm a and bought them all on informed me that they were already busing\nPeople in the in the care of and back who had been left behind by the side of the road elderly vulnerable families simply left behind this caravan and ... people need to understand people that are driving this caravan or the challenger sovereignty to challenge our borders\nAre doing so without any regard for human life\nIn in doing it through the vents as some political statement or in the case of human traffickers\nStrictly for uh for for the financial profit and the president's absolutely determined\nUse all means disposal organizer which the half Mexico to turn this caravan around and and work with Congress or to close the loop holes that human traffickers use every day to entice vulnerable families to make this dangerous to have no I really think that\nWhat this really shows is that you have to change the longest\nI say is having the very highly respected Democratic senators behind me but we have to do something that we don't agree with we have to change the rules we have to make them much different\nThey're very soft and it's a different time Julie different time\nWhen I could have been appropriate but we have to have immigration laws now that are suitable for this time at work and the ones that we have now are old and they don't work they don't work and they don't come close to work and we need protection we have to have an [noise]\nWe've been building the wall was sort of the wall San Diego's almost completed the whole area that whole area of California but\nWe uh we want to do it quickly we don't have we don't want to take years to do but\nI I really believe that and I think that [noise] I don't see any things\nThat kind of an asset when you look at what's happening when you're looking at a heartache on both sides because it really is it's heartache on both sides but when you look at ten thousand people 'cause I don't believe that was my best and I think it was much more than five thousand people but when you look at a massive group of people on the bridge when you saw it on the bridge grew\nI really think that it probably spells out to us and Congress something has to be that\nYou can have this something has to be done so in that way I think maybe it's going to be a good food and sick [noise]\nWe're going to see what counting on our military will have to call up our military if you need to\nLike we can't let this happen we cannot allow our country to be violated like this and it's very unfair\nPeople are waiting on line that went through a legal system of immigration and they've been going through it and for many years and then worked hard they've done everything they're supposed to do and then people just comes running\nIt's really unfair\nTo the millions of people that are waiting in line to come in legally into our country it's very unfair yeah go ahead\nAnd do you see any argument Mr President four times\nTo the millions of people that are waiting in line to come in legally into our country is very unfair yeah go ahead\nYou see any argument Mr President for time to improve conditions in those countries fight not decreasing aphids perhaps maintain their arguments\nBefore but it hasn't worked for a long time it was kind of things I Want to improve the conditions in our country I Want to improve the conditions you know part of that condition and approving the condition is we're doing so well\nSo many companies are coming in I spoke with a premise Robbie very recently and he informed me that we have five major car companies coming back yeah I'd say you have to do something you have to balance it out 'cause it's like a one way street the credit balance is just so different\nBetween as an example Japan just one Japan and the United states\nUh we're Foxconn coming in they make the phones for what happened or they do a lot of work to do a lot of work for everybody and they're coming they're opening up in this country but we have a lot of companies coming and\nWe need three point seven\nIt's the lowest in many years many decades we need great people coming in and one great people and I want them to come in through the system I look at the people they were talking about I ... I really watch carefully\nFor the networks have to be honest with you and you're not even CNN [noise] it is it's a beautiful shots of some very good people and [noise] I really think that those some of those people a lot of those people I think there's a lot of talented in that group is a lot of talent\nDo need people because I have company was coming into the United states they have to be able to get workers and our great even conservative people\nThat maybe three or four years ago when it felt differently about it they now feel we have to get people to operate these big plants and factories that are opening of the United states I Want him to come in I Want him to come in through a merit based system had I think a lot of people are going to be happy with that I Want to build our country\nI don't want to go to a Catholic countries to rebuild that is what we've done we've tried to rebuild the wild and police the world it's not time to rebuild the United states and the properly police the United states and that's what we're going to do at the same time we're going to help other countries all over the world\nBut we have to focus on our country for ... what was going to do over\nThere you go a Donald Trump speaking at the White House just moments ago we just now got the audio for that so we're playing it for you as\nAs everybody else is watching it and a classic Trump good stuff first of all Andrew Jessica Jessica how are you on great thank you you didn't get a proper introduction that we went straight to bed right wanting to make sure we brought this to you guys for Russell he wanted to come into the beginning of the show something\nHe waited the whole time and literally just laughing like three minutes you know what I'll just come back to where I Am I felt really bad he waited for so long to me and we've gotten a lot of stuff to get to today but off the top from what we just listened to I Want to start\nThe hash tag has sacked I Am a nationalist\nAnd you're trying to get back to the game\nTo ... wow okay figured out the system\nOr ... was most recently deported five months ago for the sixth time\nOut of Birmingham, Alabama another previously\nTo board the illegal alien thirty six year old\nJob raise job or race\nJob to job job job you know from Joe I'm trying to add some sad or too little spend\nA job ras has joined the caravan as well he said quote it's time for me to go back to the United states it's a country where I can live my life unlike Guatemala\nSo they just get to try again it's not just Hondurans in this caravan that are looking for a better life as this thing about the problem we have with me\nAnd this caravan\nThat are looking for a better life as this thing about the problem we have with people south of the border trying to illegally cross into our country and then they see this giant caravan come through their town\nAnd they've already got ambitions to do it again what do you think they're going to do oh here's my chance I can hide in the crowd or do you think\nMS Thirteen saying right here's my chance what do you think ah drug smugglers are saying here's my chance just blend in just blend in they can't stop all of us this is my chance\nTo get back in to the U. S. that's exactly what is going on south of the border not to mention the the the children\nThere are a part of this and we've already given you some stance on who's who and they're saying that children and what they're going through I I don't have an exact number on how many children but there are several images coming out because the mainstream media of doing what they can to pull up your heartstrings on this and saying you know we\nHad a lead them in July and look at it and pulling out the emotional side of the will just look at it are these children\nAre going through some horrible conditions it's Ninety two hundred degree degrees on this track I'm looking at photos of\nOf children that are blistered and I'm Talking children that are one year older last year saying from the sun blistered I yes I Am I'm looking at to some sort of I don't know if this is a Red Cross worker or some sort of\nMagic in in Mexico there's applying what looks like me is for into these areas or other kids that are weighing on cardboard and towels on the hundred degree concrete\nKids are pouring sweat I mean everything from babies to six seven year old kids\nAnd uh they're just\nTell them along with them and I'm looking at some images where it's painfully obvious that this baby does not belong to that person and why I say that this because\nI'm looking at a kid who's got a gold chain hanging off his neck\nSagging pants backwards hat to other guys that look just like him are standing in front of what looks to be a six month old child\nA laying on the ground yeah I saw that picture and I hate to to to profile here but if we're just being real this guy doesn't look like a loving father trying to take a six month old too man that's not to fail I got either no is horrible horrible images coming from a bat caravan\nAnd then\nYou want a little extra to add a under this y'all heard of hurricane Willa which is a category for\nIt's hitting the shores of Mexico right now hurricane Willa is headed straight and if the scary and continues to go it's going to hit straight where this caravan is unless they stop in their tracks which we\nDon't have hurricanes works devil and deal with nasty whether they're going to run right in to this hurricane hurricane Ike a cat for y'all that's what a wasn't Michael a hurricane for when it hit yeah\nThat's the kind of hurricane that's hitting the shores of Mexico and that is a straight for the\nOr at least the caravans pat it's just meant is that the whole thing is so jacked up then out so well this is kind of related to it but I was watching Fox News and um\nMan is that the whole thing is so jacked up then out so well this is kind of related to it but it was watching Fox News and I'm drift Jenkins are you familiar with him on the news\nHe was doing a segment I think this morning on Fox and friends\nAnd he went back and play the video for them where they caught a boat or a raft full of people illegally crossing the border and when they saw Griffith Jenkins they started Pam and the other way will rise to the other side and just stood there on the bank\nAnd going All right just hang on a limb here ... played a clip from Fox News this morning um Fox and friends\nFrom today check this out\nYour boarding guys that's right the caravan seven thousand strong is headed this way there about eleven hundred and forty miles due south um accounting this is the closest nearest port of entry to they could cross\n... where they're going to go California Arizona here but this will be the shortest route and that's why so many Hondurans Guatemalans Salvadorans come here but unfortunately most come income a legally yesterday we late in the bushes and wait and we busted one of those smuggling operations watch\nWho did not have been pushed waiting to witness one of these crossings because ... is like\nSupersede the crocodile hunter rocket al ... is ... natural habitat with right now [noise]\nMy crocodile hunter um impression was weak I thought it was spot on you know judge to\nSee in the\n...
