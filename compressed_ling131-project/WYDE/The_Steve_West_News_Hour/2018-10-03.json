shooting\nNow we were told that the shooter was captured about an hour ago again this investigation is ongoing after five lawman were shot and injured we will continue to follow this developing story and bring you the very latest details as soon as we know more [noise]\nTonight Republican senators are distancing themselves from President Trump's comments last night during a political rally in Mississippi he mocked Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's accuser\nOn the President Trump nominated judge Brett Kavanaugh Senator Schumer declared the Democrats would oppose this\nNomination with everything they had before a single document was produce single meeting with the senator or hearing was ever scheduled Chuck Schumer the Senate Democrats telegraph the strategy to throw the kitchen sink at the judge with no regard for the process decency or standards\nThey're not opposed to judge Kavanaugh's judicial views they're literally trying to undercut the voice of the American people when they elected Donald Trump\nThey've questioned his legitimacy and casually tossed around vicious accusations of perjury also awesome baseless but now they've sunk lower as they spring these eleventh hour accusations and a full scale assault on judge Kavanaugh's integrity this is a coordinated smear campaign no evidence no independent cooperation just mirrors\nWhy does the president saying what she said\nThe president was dating the facts are frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report\nHe was stating facts that were given during Dr forts testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts are and whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been\nPicked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nThe accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits an outrageous this entire process has been in disgrace and the only reason that it's been that way is because Senate Democrats\nDidn't do this the way that it should've been done and they circumvented the entire system and frankly they've undermined and our entire judicial branch by the way that they've acted in the inappropriate Nestle which they've conducted\nThemselves isn't there something wrong with the president of the United states marking somebody's shows us all seemed\nTo me that he was stating facts that Dr for herself\nA laid out in her testimony once again a every single word that judge Kavanaugh\nHas said has been looked at examine picked apart by most of you in this room but not no one is looking at a whether or not the accusations made her corroborated whether or not there's evidence to support them every person that she names I has come out and said either they didn't call it or didn't happen or they weren't there\nEvery single bit of evidence and facts that we've seen in this moment\nHave supported judge Kavanaugh's case and the president's simply pointed out the facts of the matter and that is what the Senate will have to use to determine whether or not they vote to support him or not\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders now this all comes as the FBI nears the end of its investigation into sexual assault allegations made against Kavanaugh by Christine Blasey Ford major Garrett has more\nThere was a time surprising to some here at the White House where President Trump's news measure language and exercise discipline restricted when discussing Brett Kavanaugh and those who would accused him in the past of some form of sexual misconduct those days quite clearly are over Kavanaugh's cheaper accuser Dr blog before it's memory is Mel\nBest of some form of sexual misconduct those days quite clearly are over\nKavanaugh's cheap accuser Dr blog before it's memory is no fair game for the president\nAnd he says cabinet is the one being victimized by a process not because of his past conduct or his answers under sworn testimony to the Senate but because the president says capital represents a scary new political dynamic in the confirmation process guilty until proven innocent\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago when I don't\nKnow [noise]\nFor the first time President Trump openly mocks Dr Christine blogs before he was accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in high school the president who previously described Ford's testimony as credible and compelling ridiculed her story missing detail\nWhat was it and I don't know where [noise] where was I don't know but I [noise]\n\nI don't know man says in tatters a man's life is shattered\nFour testified she remembered capital clearly as the person who tried to a soldier Ford's lawyer Michael Brown which treated Mr Trump had engaged in a vicious vial and soulless attack\nAdding the president was a profile in cowardice\nDr Ford has not yet been interviewed by the FBI is part of its seventh background check on cabinet in a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray Dr Ford's lawyer said it is inconceivable that the FBI could conduct a thorough investigation of Dr forge allegations without interviewing her\nJudiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley accused Ford's team of withholding material evidence despite multiple requests for notes from therapy sessions as well as the full details of Dr Ford's polygraph examination\nI drank beer with my friends almost everyone did\nLetters obtained by the New York times appear to show Kevin ... riding his friends ahead of each week in Nineteen eighty three to warn the neighbors that were loud obnoxious drunks was prolific ... among us\nI don't think you should lie to Congress to me that would that be acceptable yesterday\nThe president appeared to distance himself from his nominee\nI don't even know I met a few weeks ago I don't even know so it's not like you don't want to protect my friends I Want to do what's right for this country\n[noise] Kevin has denied all allegations of sexual misconduct and excessive drinking Joe Manchin of West Virginia Democrat possibly a swing vote in the cabinet confirmations saga said if it's revealed or confirmed the cabinet lie to the Senate political support for his confirmation would collapse\nAgain the FBI could issue it's report to senators as early as tonight with more on the story here's Emma brown\nShe struggled all summer at about whether or not she was going to share the story publicly you know it was many weeks between when she first contacted the Washington Post\nAnd when she decided to go on the record in a story in our newspaper on and I think a lot of what she feared during that time with public backlash from politicians and from from a you know from regular people and she has failed in both of those he's\nYou know not been able to live in her home because of death threats and then also you know to have this happen\nI'm at the rally last night I you know I'm sure with ah with some you know I don't know if she would have anticipated that but I Do think that public attacks on her on her memory and gaps and on her credibility it was something she she anticipated and was worried about\nYou know I don't know if she would have anticipated that but I Do think that public attacks on her on her memory gaps and on her credibility it was something she she anticipated and was worried about\n'em will turn to the FBI investigation what is the latest that you're hearing about the status of the FBI investigation\n[noise] uh it's it sounds like people are preparing um on Capitol Hill for for senators to be able to view the results of this investigation soon I'm McConnell's has said that he's still expects to vote\nIn the coming days on Kavanaugh's nomination and so uh you know the\nThe scope of this investigation has been a matter of great debate on Capitol Hill and really around the country as people are wondering how much new information is going to come out of this\nInvestigation and whether that information is going to be made public um and and so the idea that it would wrap up soon without a lots of people who have said they had information um\nHave already spoken publicly about cabin on about some of the claims um suggest that this this will be a relatively narrow scope\nWell Senator Chuck Grassley is you know has asked a doctor of lousy fourteen to give him the notes that she shared with you a Ford's attorneys have said that they'll only give builds up and the polygraph notes after they're interviewed by the FBI you know why Dr ... team is making that demand\nAll right let's get a check on your forecast now at W.
