laps you alone in the country that our own today this lab is that they were not TV you have the ... uh to be able to cover the hearing today so we're very blessed me to do that and if you got just locking in what we've been telling you got to be covering his all day long that a judge Kevin ...\nUm has been a confirmed he is now and they've done to ceremony he has now been sworn in as a Supreme Court justice ... so he is that guy now so those things are over a broad you broke the news in the last hour that according to CBS ABC ABC that a professor\nFord will not be pursuing her allegations any further than what she has done right now\nSo that's given you got up to date uh what what is going on we've been breaking down all day while you're looking for your thoughts\nAre there is and what she has done right now\nSo that's given you got up to date or what what is going on we've been breaking it down out there what are your feelings were your thoughts got a couple of course you want to put out to the country to the ethics I went on a three three\nThe first question I Want to put out to the ah to America's this right here do you guys think because of what's been happening over the last couple of weeks\nThat own November six that women\nOn either side is going to show up and show out either for because they are outraged of how they think that the full with a liar\nOr the other side what Democrats thing that she was telling the truth ... do you think at the end of the day that this was going to ... motivate women to get out and vote ... uh I\nI Do um I think that is just on precedent looking at the two thousand Seventeen Alabama special election and the allegations came out\nMore [laughter] those allegations invigorated or the female vote on the Democratic side and also had a um a almost a resistance I'm On a lot of Republicans that did not want to cast a vote for Roy Moore on the flip side though I Do\nI mean there's just a lot of rumblings on us through you know just looking at conservatives news outlets and you're talking to my friends who lean conservatively\nOr they're outraged completely and totally outraged\nBy this whole process they feel that he has been railroaded mom that he has been done wrong where unseen just the opposite on the other side where a lot of my liberal friends you know they're just this outrage that he's getting off another another\nSexual saucers getting off a or a privilege white man is getting off though you're getting unemployed and I think that is invigorating votes basis I yeah I don't I don't foresee a blue wave\nOf right now there's a lot of people that are saying that the Republican Party might pick up six Senate seats and that houses now ...\nWhat we're going to see you know I it's hard to tell when you're\nTalking about local elections national elections ... you're talking about local elections um I still think the American people don't realize how important they are looking elections are in a different when there's about around the country um but what I'm looking at right now Robert I sent her to come to a six weeks off I've won three three\nI think there's going to be um definitely conversations I think the media is going to pick up on this and special MSNBC and CNN I think they're going to be running stories now not just about during the Trump but what does this mean to women I mean they're going to put it on a horse dream of America\nAnd I think every Democrat is going to run on the horse of Americans say you see what the process was done you see this is a shame you see that they didn't go um um they didn't go to investigate all the other people\nThat I'm Dr phil wanted him to investigate they only get head a list of people they were trying to control it so the narrative is already being put out it was already being put out\nWe put out even more now\nAnd you're going to have the uh the Republicans coming out and they're going to say you know justice was done you know a ... at the end of the Democrats as paint a picture mhm\nFor America right with no facts and so again for me in the middle of this watching as an American citizen\nBut get both parties okay for me forget for the boys what worries me and I've been saying that for the last couple of weeks as I've been covering the story from TV or radio what worries me is when this truly does happen and the woman is by herself mhm and she decides to come out\nHow do we believe them because\nAnd the woman is by herself mhm and she decided to come out\nHow do we believe them because I think would be put in a while the media what I look and see is\nDepending on who it is they're going to spend us doorway of a way they can not said his role in us and is right but when it really really really happens okay when it happens to a female or a man\nAnd they're by themselves and they decided to it triggers one year later ten years later did this they decided to tell their story are\nWe going to connect this to he's a CEO mhm oh he's a politician oh he's ready to go to a position and it really happened that's my worry\nBut you shouldn't just tribally\nJumped into the boat of believe all women just to believe all women because somebody's coming forward with the story not all stories are accurate not all accusations are accurate I have been a part of a situation where I was trying to do the right thing ... and uh me and my best friend\nOr a girl that worked for me in a missed a couple of days\nGot a phone call from her friends saying that she was raped\nMhm she comes back to work her parents worked\nOf a block and a half away from you know we're we're our business was ... and me and my friend but we we\nTalked about it and we wanted to ensure\nBut there's a lot of people on both sides I think a lot more on the other one that you have to be able to lie to yourself to go along with what they believe you know the idea is just will not withstand any kind of intellectual integrity or honesty\nBut oh back to our bodies question okay and I'm a ... to ...\nDo you think a person I'm a ... magnitude where she lived her life you're being her what ... what is going to be a with a family and teeth is going to subject to her family to do for whatever\nOkay she goes joke she's Audi Murphy for the left okay the fact that she failed as a disappointment but you know whether they think she told the truth or not he still made a Supreme effort in and took one for the team as far as they're concerned\nRun out democratic moment\nYeah now and I'm an I'm Sorry but there ain't no conservatives out there in Palo Alto where she's teach in psychology OK okay\nThere's precious few and universities in Alabama anymore okay of I mean you know it's just I'm Sorry but somebody pointed out that they control the schools and and unfortunately for the most part they do all\nYou know what they won't allow is any kind of a thought diversity all you got her being lockstep with the way they think or you're in trouble all the money from that goes on me accounts mhm\nOkay now next savings are best coaching football oh two ways about it right right\nOkay where's he get his months you get paid by the University of Alabama right but then there's ... money they're yellow wood money\nThere's ... towards the camera endorsements okay okay\nSo the book deals that go funding money\nThis is called on flights and yellow what money if they're passing out those people you know with bags of money passing out cast for protesters to get elected it to be or get arrested at the beginning of this thing ...\nI got to think that she's taking care of\nLimit on these luck we would never know this but I Would like to see who do needed to go I Want to be up\nAnd you find out on to get on you just kind of used to go to the site and we're going to do what I Want to research because\nYou would ordinarily American people go to a million dollar everybody's story short of organizations donated to her right that's a different story you interview individually then it will be the part of a you know the Democratic party or you know some\nKind of a a pack that ...\nI Can't remember the lady's name that got on the elevator with a Jeff Flake uh-huh what you saw the interviewer she just fought admitted that she was with the Soros organization\nThe elevator with a Jeff Flake uh-huh but you saw the interviewer she just fought admitted that she was with a Soros organization\nWhat we know summers in people to disrupt on politics all the time you know that's that's ... now but\nHe's you on that he using the platform okay that's the platform of using the cameras do his thing I'm ... I'm I Want to connect doctor for\nThe money the book deal knowing that she was going to do the plane I can say is a possibility I'm not saying that it's not but when we live in these will affect my partner cynical often we always talk about this is what the record see ... no one is still in Iraq and right now everybody's hypothetically\nHow you can only speculate and they like to\nRead on Monica my clients so far how much is what how much have y'all read on Monica McLean\nI have no other who'd anything I don't know who Monica McLean is\nOh my goodness okay so you're going to monitor McLean is pretty sense okay she is the person that Dr Ford was probably with when the letter was crafted\nShe is the person uh when we talk about a legal in Kaiser was pressured into changing her test the money right she wants to pressure on that she has a ... she's ex FBI\nOkay off some lady who are caught on how to beat the they say they told me how to be the uh the fact that they're\nThe ones that was on hold out of ... protests right he wants to work for the FBI got got okay now she is linked to the ...\nI think I ... I don't know how to say the name right apologize I read it several times ... her for not for somebody who knows how to pronounce it she is connected to a\nPaul lost money mhm these are the people that were in charge mhm not they were investigators they were in charge of the Clinton email trials and found that there was nothing wrong there mhm I I mean you know telling us there's not a deep state just doesn't wash at this point in time\nYou know it's it's not just the same ilk it's kind of the same people that we got the uh email ...\nI mean ... ... what we're saying right now and and I and I hate to push back on because I you know I Love you man but they were saying basically the same thing that when President Clinton was running for president and all these people came out of the woodwork\nConspiracy theory right I mean everybody everybody that came out that came and ran with\nPresident Donald Trump they had a record they did is they did they do connected as they were connected to that\nI mean again we can say these things and you can find people linked to certain things but like I said for me I Do believe I Do\nI'm happy that just kind of got confirmed heard me say that many times\nOkay I'll tell you what to do this for me joke okay go by a six ... six\nCork board okay alright get you a bunch of them pans ... and when you start reading these articles take pictures of these people and write their name on the picture mhm stick them on the court for the\nFirst run its strengths between them\nRight but at the clock I'm with you you can do that but I can do that with President Donald Trump and his connections to with the Russians and all that stuff all the people who connected will they be is still with the Russians I can do that President Obama I can do to President Bush Clinton I could do that with everybody what'd you ask me and I knew I couldn't do that with everybody\nDonald Trump's on business deals wherever Donald Trump figured Donald Trump will make money\nHe but here's the thing clock we're making excuses you know what I'm saying she can say that doesn't see 'cause he can say that doesn't happen I think it said that these people came in afterwards Mm okay because the deep state wanted to come and they thought a platform they they came in after this and they wanted to\nHow can I can say that these people came in afterwards Mm okay because the deep state wanted to come and they saw the platform days they came in after this and they wanted to go to work with her and they and she didn't know nothing about them before they had a I mean there's so many different ways we can go with that so connecting the dots\nIs not really connecting the dots of me because like I say everybody on the national said like the president Donald Trump and Ford and everybody you can connect to something connected not run your representative I did right there if something happened right now I'm doing this here and it's something we've ...\nBig connect me to you know something by as they should or they couldn't let me the clock that was out of the gossip about midnight they connect me to clock to\nVanish [laughter] we we don't ... scrupulous character on your dialogue I got you\nKnow really off you know the compromise shovels has been first and foremost in the news and all that they all did I Know when it's not first and foremost in the news I Will be very surprised if you do not see a lot of stuff come forward on people's names I just mentioned\nThat I wanted to see it in ... like I say I would go on the on my radio show and I will apologize that I was wrong because now\nI think you know I'll go off on a rabbit holes when I see somebody's name or something in an article right so I I just like I'm I'm probably forty eight dollars had it before\nI got to love you man and a half ago\nYou know I hear what everybody's saying Brian then yeah I mean I'm listening but again\nThis is coming from your play book yeah right but what you always ... me about ... ... right now is in black and white and there's nothing you know and black and white everybody is saying but at the end of the day is not in black and white and I'm surprised there you I'm really you more but I don't know because because I don't I don't\nWant him to leave her because there is nothing in black and white ... you go into speculation smarter speculate hill but brought up but I'm\nSaying like here I and I'm just throwing hypotheticals out there I'm not saying I'm One hundred percent behind all this what I'm saying what is you know let's look at the situation and how the situation has on full yet it's not in black and white but it does make you go huh All right that makes me scratching my head a little bit\nBut brown me and you have about a minute times on this show yeah right and we're FBI reports on paper it was in paper it can't be with few if it's written down and he can't be refuted from these certain organizations where we're at the highest thing in the land when it comes to the government yeah All right\nWe get the media covering this you know right and the left or right has not come up with anything that anybody saying though right now in what now the media in anything that she will that he lied that it did not happen there's nothing out there in the media on either side from the left or the right there saying for a fact\nThat she lived there for a fact that this was did not ...\nI'm ... I'm Sorry I I've I've seen from Fox News reports that have gone detailed into what she said and has broken the department of officers\nLogan the park ... proved that she's lying that something they're not helping one ... ... yeah no I no body\nNobody but her in God and who ever did do something to her can refute that\nThat's what I'm saying now it wasn't just Kevin ... like I said we will never know I don't think so I don't think so but then something happened to this one because there are people you've heard on this show on my TV show people that go then\nOkay well Obama wasn't born into not seen sixty one Kenya East Africa wasn't established until Nineteen sixty three because I Googled that to\nLive at the time travel are right now with\nThe born in a place that didn't exist and he was running for president I live in Alabama he submitted three separate and far certificates Alabama and there were all different\nOkay I got to um let me ask you this ... about women okay I understand you do not believe dog before let me ask you do okay let me just are OK okay let me ... I got you but when I ask you this for women that this actually happens too\nAnd there's nobody around and they decided to come out two years or Fifteen Years later\nWhat do she needs to do for people like yourself and other people to believer that it really actually happening\nWherever they should have been more credible we shouldn't have been able to Google the grocery store to find out what the bill when she's climbing she went in there\nAnd confront of that guy ... let me other than the measure the course of the house\nThe grocery store and find out what the bill when she's climbing she\nWent in there to the front of that guy ... let me let me ask you the course of the house that looked like the one she climate Brett Kavanaugh was in ... though when my friends\nHave dropped pictures of her all over the Internet looking like I said it's not\nFollow Paul well America because of course I guess the grocery store was there and she was telling the truth but it would just say would you believe\nUm I I Would I Would think that if I had not been able to ... so much of her story about the fly and the putting in the second door and the and the grocery store and then and the fact that none of her a\nPapal cooperating her story ... got you know there wasn't enough\nIn the fact that she was telling the truth is I had just suffered a setback that she would tell the truth about what it believes\nGossip so there is no point in time uh when it came out did you believe or at all\nUm I well I Do believe or disbelieve until I did the research\nOn the ... the fare and then the more I found I kept saying she's lined\nUp there but I Love you think thanks for the inside there will ever have good even the Iraq um I mean the reason why I was kind of drilling polar bears me goes\nBelow lady you don't find that often where women are going to come out against each other on something like this but this is the bottom of the country I'm In for women to me I think that especially because of the the\nTiming of it all knew it looks like a political hit job ... ... based upon when the information came out how the information came out and then all the dock story and everything that we have gone through um [noise]\nWith the process in there I think that's why a lot of people are looking 'cause I think everybody was kind of been dissipating kind of waiting for that October surprise for this process and then when it hit everybody you know you have on the\nDemocrats going oh ha but then all the Republicans right and ... [laughter]\nRight but you know in two different no trains of thought well you know a radio talk show anchor news I could see rather than doing this and I want to ask your opinion on Syria\nYou know fear what we've seen in last week's seeing how you know this has divided the country among women why women and black women I thought I Would never see something like this on a subject like this\nUm is divided even in politics or what is your observation as a a woman in this time and it's time to them and they see what are you feeling right now about this\nWay a lot of people are responding to these uh\nIt kinda makes a valid points for both sides of the argument on one hand you have people that can come forward and say like this is why so many people are reluctant to come forward when they are victims of some type of sexual assault was as you have so many people coming forward you know saying they she is telling the truth\nThen I'm On the other end of the argument like a a Carlos sad you know there are a lot of inconsistencies in the story\nSo it gives people a reason to say you know she's not telling the truth you know when we go here and find out that the reason they she gave for you know whatever she was actually different so you know I guess it was kind of like you know when you were younger you know she's always tell you it's hard to believe me if you lie like you have a lot about this\nThen you lie about something else and continue to cover it up over and over again ... so just what's the what's in the ... that we're in now\nI'm just what the hell me too movement\nThe thing continue to cover it up over and over again and so yes what's it what's in the sense that we're in now I'm just what the hell me too movement and everything is really our rights and you know find an argument in stand firmly ...\nLet me ask you a question and we can get up to the phone line make six six five\nFive one none ah three three semi rises do you believe that before\n\nThey tend to be hard to answer as in wrestling with it myself\nUm\nI Want to release some way and it was seen as someone a sexual assault mhm and the reason I say that because that is such a heavy allegation and it can cause so many ... boy I'm ... I'm a snake but\nJust like the caller before it isn't a lot of things they seen him in ... saying they weren't true so ...\nDo you believe or not I don't\n... about five one none after we do is get up to the phone lines David luckily and to love to bake\nA brother a great name of the going\nPretty good I I'm quite frankly there's there is an undercurrent\nOf of a situation in the Senate and then the Congress actually ah if you if you Google\nOh God the wealth is I'm a journalist so on you to all he does an interview with George well these are a government analyst he's got a lot of information about what's going on since two thousand and two thousand\nAnd won the Senate a committee only a military Cindy and I'm also the foreign\nRelations Committee the uh there's a lot there's there's about\nNinety percent of the Senate to solve the case or is the most of those programs\nAnd they it was a toss up because I was I've said it wouldn't be going on I was setting aside wouldn't vote him in a really rough yeah oh man and of course I voted for Trump bomb under control and conservative means to conserve the constitution the way it's written right\nOff and I don't believe it's a a living document and all that sort of a judge way it's written\nMhm all but I'm a\n... it's well worth loses an hour and forty five minutes of a sad commentary on that\nYouTube program John the Web and these guys are George ... know John B a wells program and I'm spiraling down the rabbit hole was is the title of it is or what happens is Seth Rich you got to and it's very interesting uh and uh\nIt it connects a lot of dodge of what's going on but these people were not going to vote him it was a toss up because it's a it's a it when they voted manager so sealed the deal that the um\nUh if they didn't do the man it was going to anger the Republican so fast that was going to come out and drove a in the November election in that first but I think they're going to come out in droves anyway we'll see yeah we'll see\nWe'll see I may God Bless America this is the is the size of a sudden I ... I\nThink they um yeah it's gone to the Bible says I Love you may have ... presents or I'll go All right though um you know I always\nLove when people bring up a birther and a center it's into the conversation but just\nMany people he's things I Love all our lives and I do agree or disagree with you know my point of view or my\nThe conversations that just I mean people here's the thing I Love all our listeners I knew we agree with you know my point of view or my asking the questions um but when we look at the whole situation like I say I'm a radio talk show host ... my job is to\nSee what I see posed a question to give my opinion I give us most affected that I Know and then I'm going to act logical question I Am an independent conservative I most of the Republican but at the end of the day\nI still things have to make sense to me right yeah with this situation that we're talking about\nAnd I hear all the rumblings but what's most surprising\nAnd I have to say this I did not think radio talk show hosts news anchors sleepy Rogers would say the answers he said before we went to the caller well that's the process Joe ... a lot\nA lot of this process has been and talked about with her taking the lie detector test you and\nShe was in her sworn testimony she said it took all day she was only asked two questions she was asked his everything that you have written in this\nTo be true and she\nSaid yes and pass the lie detector test that was one of the questions like should we tell\nThe full story she was asked to question but before you get to those two questions they have to prep for you to make sure she was not ... she had to\nBe she would she was there's no way she did not go through the the typical process\nSo when a lot ... than because they have to figure out what what you learn and they don't they did not", "show_name": "The Steve West News Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "06"}
