watch the whole clip and see where the laughing was place where I Know that stuff can be taken out of context and they weren't laughing at that particular story but he wasn't happy about it and he

talking about you know a a or\nAre you know of of of you know of a scary for armed citizen took the guy out over the people in jail\nRight at injuries you know that that should be the right up there on the front of the news mhm okay everything else that's well I got a three hour show it up to us to take care of this stuff and the\nMore they know see the problem is those people were to fish and the synagogue yeah there was no one there to look there's nothing wrong with have honest people that are are\nWay you know as far as they're already starting to come to pray mock trial even though he hasn't said to my knowledge anyway saying well you know he's going to come out and say arm the rabbi and I thought well is that really that crazy you\nKnow well it's not employ laid off at all and we live viable\nI never saw where God set for us to the fences pray when the when the when Jesus as a disciples came to and what I Will come and they're getting rough you know what he told them note arm yourselves you said go by sort they kind of leave that out or you know we gotta remember\nOh we were never supposed to be as a ... mile built rebuilt the wall fed a sword in one hand and and we're and we're building the wall of the other\nRight well and in fact they're\nMere Robert I appreciate it I'm going back to Jessica what you just said with from uh he he did say in his initial remarks to reporters\nAs he was getting on a plane they had the Indiana on Saturday or Illinois where every was going\nOr he did say that if there were armed guards in the church than he could have stopped this from happening or minimize the damage that it was done right uh but that that's\nAnti as far as that comment went and a lot of how they hear it as much has taken it in and ran with it and the media it's really bothered me watching the medium watching the Democrats act as if they are champions for\nUh the Jewish faith or than you wish people I'm Talking about the anti is real media the anti Israel Democrats um the ones that really stand against Israel or former\nAdministration was the same way it's just the Democrats him oh they favor the the the Muslim countries in the middle east more than they favor actual ally in Israel Israel which is that the size of New Jersey surrounded by twenty other Muslim countries that are\nA hundred times larger than the state of Israel Israel who's been over backwards to make peace with these people and all these people want to do is get all those people that the media and the Democrats are all of a sudden champions for the Jewish faith\nThen I just my daughter convert to Judaism yes because she's Jewish okay that's what I thought so ah yeah ... and and of course the blame is being placed aren't let me start bringing his now Roberson who get mad at me in front of him a stories in order and well you haven't done it at the front of the Pakistani\nHow well uh let me do this because there's a lot of stuff that there's really not getting attention or when it comes down to it I've only seen one or two things on it but today it was even today or yesterday I don't know because of the time zone different but a a\nA N n didn't knees in flight has crashed into the ocean killing a hundred and eighty nine\nOn board or they're assuming dental a hundred and eighty nine are dead right which\nInto the ocean killing a hundred and eighty nine\nPeople on board or they're assuming that all a hundred and eighty nine are dead right which chances are that's the case that's crazy right there to um to see that because they're saying that they were experienced pilots fly that plane wasn't a cloud in the sky and and they're just\nThey're befuddled as to why this plane went down\nWell they said something like the uh the pilot like ... minutes after taking off said something about they needed to land yeah and they're not sure if he was trying to turn the plane back around or what happened but it is a little mysterious\nSo you've got that you've also got to the the male bomber that we discussed the line on friday he is obviously in custody and are awaiting trial or or hearing or whatever snacks\nOr there was a news suspicious packages addressed to CNN [noise] that was discovered at the Atlanta post office I guess it was added to the the Atlanta CNN headquarters okay\nUh so that according to authorities is very similar to what they saw what the other packages so it seems as if they are treating it in that fashion that this was not a a copy cat or anything like that it's from that that guy same guy\nSo that's out there and another thing ... Google and Amazon and social media is and all these guys\nHave gone out of their way\nTo hide stuff related to guns you experience than trying to sell whether holster on Facebook right and you couldn't do that because of what they had a gun and that's right and then you're going to have problems on the back side of that with no gun in it right up but they have\nGone out of their way to make sure they hide post about guns and they they had posted about promoting drop anything conservative you even mentioned the word gun control in the post and nobody's going to see it and all this other stuff yet\nYou can Google or you could as of twenty four hours ago Google how to make a pipe bomb\nAnd it doesn't just come up in the search it comes up on the front page of the search south ... usually when you Google stuff you find your answer\nPretty quick you don't have to go to page two and three when I really do that or same thing applies when trying to figure out how to make a pipe bomb on the front page when you Google that phrase now I don't suggest you guys do it because you might have somebody come knocking at your door\nWhile I can ask for their normal reasons why you would need to know how to I mean I'm On night I'm just asking no I mean I I mean I don't know blowing stuff up okay so there's no real legit reason why you would need to know that now I mean unless you're just one of these ... and he just wants to [laughter] right I don't know\nWell it's like you know you get out and you shoot guns out in the field and you like to blow stuff up\nRight you know it's just a manner boiling it I mean I can understand how you know wanting to know how to make like a homemade rocket or something like a project to do with your head but you know how to make a heat seeking missile well I mean you wouldn't think you know what I mean the kids need a project lets the pipe bomb you know [laughter] in the backyard\nThat's a little dangerous also\nAlso and and all this is leading up to to the main story which is what happened on Saturday in Pittsburgh but\nI saw reports today than a North Carolina high school student has died this morning after being shot by a classmate apparently you had a kid they brought a gun to school\nTargeted another kid who they had\nIt's made apparently you had a kid they brought a gun to school\nTargeted another kid who they had had a fight or some sort of be for whatever it wasn't a a you know a school shooting per se where they're just killing anybody and everybody by this kid apparently brings a gun to school and shoots another kid\nThat um there was something going on backstage or whatever and the kid that was shot has ultimately died so that's a tragic story coming out of a North Carolina high school it's butler highschool it's about twelve miles southeast of of Charlotte\nAnd did about seven AM they place the school on on lockdown in emergency crews came in there and got the student that was shot they took the other kid into custody from what I understand but just a tragic tragic situation and then outside of that as we know\nEleven people murdered and a synagogue\nIn Pittsburgh as well as\nSeveral others wounded including for police officers when we get back on the other side outbreak that stuff down and we'll look at what the aftermath of that has been not just for those that were directly affected but us as a country\nEspecially leading up to the midterms which is in fact a week from\nTomorrow all that more will be back right after this we saw\nWith Andrew and Jessica", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Steve West News Hour", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "29"}
