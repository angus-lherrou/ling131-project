J. C. H. these two we're ... we're super station one on one W windy [noise]\nWelcome back welcome back this is Richard Rice on results with Richard Rice and uh we are in our six week and we're happy to be back on the air again we're going to be bringing you some more very interesting and exciting information today or we have a two guests there should be joining us soon\nAnd a while waiting on our guest to join us I Want to just recap kind of um\n[noise] the uh the beginning of of the show the results with Richard Rice we initially presented this idea for the purpose of providing a platform so that we can begin to unpack some of the legal a policy issues that are facing our community\nUm and do it from a collective perspective you know how can we approached some of these um these systemic issues that we face\nIn a more proactive way I'm to began to organize and to make sure that we have sufficient information\nOr to be able to organize in it in an effective way\nAnd in order for us to do that we need to be able to have\nPlatform communities community square so to speak of space so that we can have these type a critical conversations to disseminate information on a regular basis and so\nThat is that is the reason why we formed the show and that's what we're looking to accomplish a week in week out and um you know we we've had several guest on the show so far that of a brought to light issues like pollution a political corruption\nOr we've also spoke about issues like nursing home abuses well a stand your ground laws also and so we're going to continue to to have these types of conversation so that we can\nUm shed light on some of the the key issues that may face a survey face other people in our community and and and then begin to identify some steps that we can take collectively to begin to a reduced those type of instances from occurring in or just recently this week we're happy to receive some some really good news we\nUm my farm and I and um some other local attorneys have been working I'm On a case in particular in which we were defending a young lady that have been charged\nWith murder based on a domestic violence a dispute she'd been in a relationship with someone who had been abusive with her for over a decade and recently or just received word that I'm you know the grand jury decided not to indict in that case and so um this information just came out\nUh just received word that I'm you know the grand jury decided not to indict in that case and so um this information just came out on friday we were really excited to to hear that information and I'm obviously is still a tough situation but at least some of the anxiety around\nWhether or not the young lady will be able to stay with her family and continue on with her with her children um\nYou know that part of the equation at least has been resolved and so\nThat is I'm really big accomplishment that were there were happy about\n[noise] and so today we're going to be speaking about uh how to build political power um some things that we can do a two began to improve elect Toro organizing in our communities\nAnd ah we have some some other topics that are related to that now we want to speak about we want to talk about some local policy issues some recent decisions\nThat have come out on the municipal level such as um the decision to implement a surveillance cameras in um quote unquote high crime areas and so there's been quite a bit of debate about that and um that's something that\nUm that that's been quite a bit of debate about it because obviously is an issue that needs to be addressed we want to began to reduce or some of the violence I'm In the city of course if we can reduce it to zero then that'd be great but we're looking to began to get a reduction in those areas but at what point what what civil rights for the human rights\nWere what ideas of privacy are we willing to forgo in order to began to uh to affect those issues and so\nUh that's going to be some of the things when we're talking about we're also going to be taking calls ah from from a listeners as well so if you have something on your mind that you like to talk about feel free to give us a\nCall at one eight six six by five one nine nine three three or two oh five nine four one one zero one one [noise] um\nAnd so back to this issue with the with the surveillance cameras\nLooks like I'm the city of Birmingham is into the contract with a Alabama Power in order to um put surveillance cameras and certain target areas areas that have been deemed to um see a higher incidence of violent crime than others um and these cameras\nWill be monitored well not necessarily monitor but they'll be managed by Alabama Power and there'll be monitored by a coalition\nOf law enforcement groups that include uh the Birmingham police department or the district attorney's office um and also federal authorities as well including the ATF and FBI and so\nYou know that that's one of those things that many people feel like I'm the current administration out of D.C the Trump Administration and Jeff Sessions\nAs the attorney general have really doubled down on this ideas on these ideas that led to mass incarceration these ideas of um heavy surveillance and um hyper surveillance you ... I should say rather\nAnd in ... in heavy policing and this idea of criminalizing um a lot of activities that are really just associated with being poor and so it's it's understandable that\nGiven the demographics of the city of Birmingham how policy like that may be rejected um other people have advocated for ideas that would be a more progressive ideas that may I'm kind of go to the root cause of a of a crime and violence\nAnd often times that is you know opportunity lack of opportunity um lack of education and things of that nature and so that those\nWere some have said would would be a better investment of the money that we're spending on I'm investing in these cameras which I think it's going to result and maybe like fifty five I'm fifty five thousand dollars or so per month\nWe're spending on I'm investing in these cameras which I think it's going to result and maybe like fifty five I'm fifty five thousand dollars or so per month to be able to get this a first draft of of uh cameras up and running\nAnd I'm upon announcement I'm I looked into some statistics to see about exactly how are these types of cameras have been used previously and and and whether or not they actually\nAre reduced the incidence the incidence of a crime and violence and and at best those are just really dubious and so we're best in quite a bit of money into the strategy and there really isn't a lot of\nStatistical evidence out there in favor of it is certainly is a I'm a big interest in doing something we want to see some action ah think right now the city of Birmingham is it about\nIs that eighty eight homicides actually was just another homicide unfortunately announced this morning on the west side of the city at a local a convenience store\nAnd um that you know brings the number to eighty eight in the past two years we've had you know triple digit homicides in the city of Birmingham and so\nThere's certainly a lot of pressure on the administration to take some action um you know there isn't a need to um approached this violence as a public safety concern and so a holistic approach would definitely be warranted\nI think some for some issues would [noise] some enforcement measures should be engaged but overall if we're going to reduce this type of issue in the long term basis that is something that we may want to invest in more social issues around education job creation um\n[noise] even even doing things as simple as a community gardens can really go a long way I'm ... and there's there's examples out there and various communities around the nation and which community gardens have been used as an organizing tool\nNot only did provide 'em a greater supply of of healthy food options but also just to provide activity and in industry for our people in the local community\nUm to the kind of provide an alternative to engage in some of the other things that that were term previous to that and so [noise] this is um this is definitely a topic that's going to um be be given much more consideration a mini groups have\nDiscuss presenting an open records request to the current administration to find out exactly how\nThe local administration is going to be able to maintain some type of autonomy\nUm or policing the city of Birmingham as opposed to kind of a link wishing that to a on a county level to uh the sheriff's office or even out to the U.S attorney's office um or the FBI you know to what extent um\nBlack people representing the largest voting block and we don't think about that you know and ah when you start with that bloating that voting bloc that's the foundation and then we can expand we find these other issues that um\nThat that that actually liaison or have connections with other communities and they were able to expand that voting bloc right in there and you start off in\nIn areas like Jefferson County you know our work is more minimal in terms of how many other groups we need to bring in with us in order to actually be effective at winning at the polls right yeah but we can still hear on the statewide level do a lot of positive work you know Alabama Mississippi\nGeorgia and you see and that may be more so in Georgia or as well but\nI mean it's something that we just don't even really think about a lot of times\nAnd part of building building power was actually a campaign that I recently launched um and there's a part of the fellowship I'm young people for um is actually a blueprint 'em to change the dynamic of this state\nI'm In a part of that is on building a actually a grassroots coalition of state wide coalition is going to address these issues but also what we're doing is we're we're doing non traditional ways in\nTargeting the um rising elected in this state right right so those those are some things that were doing some of that includes like you see some Facebook um live stream there'd be Instagram there'll be some things that we're we're doing the uh our social media outlets and radio outlets and so forth\nWas good as important you know I ... I Wish I had time we we we want to come back to this but\nI'm the ... this idea of the media and had a ... in in in in use it\nTo get our voice out there really is it's about just having a constant voice and being persistent with it and we don't have to concede the media to elected officials we have the ability to go out and hire a media consultant um do press releases and all of those things and put together a strategy as well too so that's something I Want us to\nAs we have the ability to go out and hire a media consultant um do press releases and all of those things together strategy as well too so that's something I Want us to focus on ... marches I wanted to come back to you and talk a little bit about um eternal laws racism how that relates to political accountability because even when we have a city in which\nUm you know the the black agenda if you want to say that or you know whatever our interests are should be represented how could you be marginalized when you're Seventy four percent majority right\nAnd and so this idea of internalize racism is probably a big component that because we always talk about you know looking at what someone else is doing to us but how much of these ideas this ideology have we internalize and and then what do we do what do we do about it\nYeah so uh what do we do of course is probably the Nobel Peace prize winning Graham you know I think I'm\nThere has been this idea that [noise] representational government looks like a putting someone in place looks like you're right so if you're a woman when you women representation if you're a black person when you like people to represent you\nAnd where where that fails aware that logic becomes faulty is when those people who looked like you don't represent your political interests right [noise] and\nUh the notion of internalize racism into plays with that when we think about black politicians because ... traditionally how black politicians have saw higher office and you can find this in like a lot of like political a political science topics\nThey seek higher office about what we call deregulation so they'll pretend not to be race conscious right not to care about race issues until they get the higher a elect Toro position and then once they get it they might you know get one or two things done for your community\nBut not all the time and so that has been like a strategy that has worked to achieve higher office and so we think that the way to engage with politics is to\nNot make waves not make people think that you're too for or two left or to radical and that comes from a particular ideology that ideology is grounded in our notions of respectability\nHis grounded and notions of um of of of of really white supremacy and how and how how white and its functions\nAnd and we think that we have to ascribe to that in order to achieve like power\nBut what what ends up happening is that we end up reproducing the same violence systems that that we're fighting against and so we'll see 'em and and we can use this for any group right now just by folks but we'll see this with like representation of politics I Will say oh I guess we we finally elected\nWe finally elect to somebody who cares about our issues and then you'll see them very slowly go back to the norms an old ways of doing things and that that is a a symptom of internalize racism right or a symptom of internalizing your own no pressure\nI said exactly and it's you you digest it isn't fair your to kind of play I was a lot of ways and you have to look outside of yourself or outside of the people that look like you for solutions\nTo problems that your experts on because of you experienced it you know you talk about the proximity Brian Stevenson talks about that in ... or did you speak about this I'm a recently\nOn the on the Facebook Live feed and I think it's important because that's what a solution lives you know we have the capability in us and what I've really seen as being used to placate or the electorate and the community is that I'm going to identify with you culturally right I'm going to come out to a barbecue in all your you know I'm going to put out a track list to show you that I like your music\nI'm going I'm going to use the type of language is a slang or whatever that you use so I knew I identify with you culturally but in terms of the policies that I that I put out that or the resources where I direct my money\nIt ... it can be made as well be anybody else we may as well elect to somebody from Russia or John am really represent as it was so you know how do we began to\nOr the resources where I direct my money it ... it could be may as well be anybody else we may as well elect to somebody from Russia or Taliban wrangler representatives and so you know how do we bring into\n'em on one hand educate the public in a way about that difference you know because I think it's something that it is a little bit nuance and it's something that she was obvious to us but I don't know if it is\nTo every one that is that's out there perceiving because it just it works so effectively and and then you're labeled as being negative or this and just antagonism you know right\n[noise] so what are your thoughts on it yeah so\nI Know a lot of like the critiques that we get are like oh are you all just allow activists DL not want to really work with the city government to get changed on\nYou also be kind to them and treat them well and then they'll give you the things that you need and and I'm like no that's not how that's how citizenry works like I'm a citizen of Birmingham at the end of the day I'm an activist and I fight for the things I Believe in by muscle citizen of our manifest there and I pay my taxes and so ... for the rest of my life can critique my government if I so choose right\nBecause I that's what I I pay to be represented and when I feel that I'm being misrepresented to under represent or not getting the things that I Need\nI call it ... right and that's my right as a citizen and so a lot of the feedback that we get a is\nY'all are antique antagonistic to a progress yeah y'all are are are barrier to progress when y'all do these things and I'm saying progress for who and at what cost right\nRight I agree with that completely and so you know and and and just to continue with that is like these I'm going to identify with you culturally I'm going to put someone in office that looks like you but then I'm going to continue implementing policies that are related to this whole neo liberal listed on ideology\nAnd I'm not really going to try anything new or radical that really focuses on creating new institutions\nWithin the community that could be more just an I Want to take a quick example we had about three to four minutes left on the show but briefly this whole idea of surveilling our communities Eric as opposed to\nYou know what what would be an alternative in your opinion as opposed to engage in in you know spending fifty to sixty thousand dollars per month on cameras\nMy opinion and whatever witness in our communities that are young people are literally at war there is no job opportunities available a lot of our\nUm young people that I encounter in my neighborhood on a day to day basis are dealing with issues of of criminal criminal justice issues they don't have an ID they on probation they can't afford probation they can get a job and so sometimes they have to turn to the alternative just to survive\nI'm so my thing is is you can invest fifty six thousand dollars and cameras then turn around and then there's those incentives in hiring and businesses that will actually put young people to work um that would actually you know let's let's enforced is banned the box initiative and is not just something that's on paper but it's actually a reality after a\n... for a loan for yeah I mean ... but no issue a micro loans five people like all of those things are possible like we don't have to like settle for a second class citizenship when resources are there you just diverting resources to the things that you feel like\nAnd actually it's a it's like things that have been researched and proven to to to not work right especially in predominant black communities high prevail over fully saying I'm aggressive tactics um a investments in in in in\nIn anything but the people has been proven it's like not work\nRight and what was seen as it all of those tactics were related to a political agenda and then there was a narrative or fake\nFake news information research put out to justify those types of things based on a true political agenda and so when we have an opportunity in a in a Seventy four percent black city that has a history of this city is under no circumstances should we missed an opportunity to break that pattern right in the most segregated\nIn uh Seventy four percent black city that has a history of this city is under no circumstances should we missed an opportunity to break that pattern right in the most\nSegregated city in America you need to think critically unconsciously about race and when you don't there's a problem\nMost definitely and so and his last two minutes I'm Eric and then I go to you more to it or does does again you know what people want to keep up with what you know they like what you're saying they want to keep up with you they want to be a part of its own how to get in touch with your fun you know keep track of what you're doing\nUm if you want to follow me you can always following me via social media on Facebook my faith live name is Eric ... on linked then you also can follow me there ... at era called Twitter I think it's a lick your call um which is an old Twitter page when I was running for public office\nBut um those are the social media handles that you can actually following the it um and I do encourage you to follow me I Do actually have a Facebook Live coming up on October the twenty third that's going to be very interesting I Do encourage you out to kind of ...\nNow I only do this on the radio and I'll tell you why because I Can't send a minimum wage worker to your house for free and make any money at all frankly the U.S government the IRS says that it costs fifty three cents a mile last time I checked to send a vehicle to your home just in gas and wear and tear\nAfter that there's the technicians wages the chemicals and check the ordinary cost of doing business so we're talking about a loss on this first appointment coming out and doing it for free\nOkay why would we do that well here's what we get out of the\nDeal we ...\nI Can't tell you how many times it's happened where customers have become huge cheerleaders even before we're done there running around telling their neighbors making calls to family members and say you've got to try these guys out\nThat enthusiasm is why the average radio customer provides us with three to seven referrals folks' business people out there what's referral or a new customer worth to you\nIf your furnace or your air conditioner goes out and you call a friend or relative and you say hey I got this furniture air conditioner problem who do you use your air conditioner and they say you got a call freedom heating and cooling they did the best maintenance we had ever\nHad at that point or you can go play Google roulette of course it's\nYou're going to take the advice of your friend or your neighbor or your church buddy or your relative because the company they're recommending served them\nWell that's the power of doing things right for people that's the power\nOf doing a good job customers seeing it appreciating it and then spreading the good worried about your business\nYou\nKnow look I'm going to give this two hundred and fifty two dollar total system rejuvenation away for free right now to the first five callers freedom heating and cooling is going to pay for it all we ask is that if we do a good job for you\nThat you consider becoming a regular client and you tell\nOther people about us that's fair right okay\nYou have to be one of the first five dollars so grab your telephone so that you can get the number and I'm going to give the first five away right now the next five callers are going to get this to not for free\nHere the numbers are you ready dial quickly because they go fast ready to zero five seven to five\nSix zero one one seven to five six zero one one seven to five six zero one one that's two zero five\nSeven to five or six zero one woman we've got our first one nope two callers at two o five\nSeven to five six zero one one three left now at two zero five Seventy five six zero one one Seventy five six zero one one seven to five six zero one one one left last one get it to five\nSeventy five six zero one one\n\nNo look if you can't get to a phone right now but you can get on the line be the very first person to go to clean my AC dot com\nFill out the radio discount requests form click submit and will reserve one of these just for you but you got to be the first person okay that's clean my\nUm fill out the radio discount requests form click submit and will reserve one of these just for you but you got to be the first person okay that's clean my AC dot com\nNow here's the deal folks here's what you're going to experience when I send one of these guys out\nFirst off he's going to park his truck in the street\nNow while our fleet is meticulously maintained this is just a precautionary measure that's going to keep you drew leaks where they belong away from your driveway okay\nWhen he comes up to your front door he's going to knock on the front door and when you invite him and he's going to reach down and put on floor savers or shoot covers over his shoes or boots\nThat's because we're going to be working with some water and stuff cleaning your outdoor air conditioning unit or heat pump and it does tend to get a little murky okay\nHe's going to start his own voice and then he's going to ask you to see the thermostat he's going to ask if he can quickly click it on and when he does he's going to make sure that the system is actually working\nAfter he turns it on he'll then ask you to show him to the outdoor air conditioning unit and then the indoor heating unit and once he's seen those he'll go get to work\nNow his very first task is to remove the top off of the outdoor air conditioning system after that he's going to get the leaves and sticks and mark and debris out of the bottom of the system because all of that stuff holds water when it rains\nIt's going to rush the bottom of your system out prematurely okay so we're going to get all of that junk out of there\nThat alone is going to extend the life of your outdoor unit\nThe next step in my opinion is the best okay we're going to use a semi high pressure nozzle to spray down your out door coils from the inside out\nNow that's going to force all the leaves and grass clippings and dust and whatnot there's been sucked into it over the last six months back out of the coils it's almost like lifting a sweater off of your air conditioning system\nNow managing your eye listeners jogging on a hot summer's day with a sweater on and a strong in your mouth\nYour body can't release the heat right so you get really really hot\nWell the same thing happens to your outdoor air conditioning unit and your indoor unit if it's dirty it's going to overheat you're going to have a compressor failure you're going to have motors fail sometimes we even have to use a booming cleanser to get all that stuff out\nYou're looking at a good forty five minutes just up to this point so can you see now why I say that the other maintenance is our drive by maintenance as if they're there and gone and forty five minutes\nNext we're going to test all the electrical components in your system to make sure that you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires\nYou might have a pending compressor failure because you've got this little starter that's about to go bad\nYou might have a pending motor failure because you've got to filter that's all plugged up and you're not paying attention to it All right so we're gonna check all of those little miniscule components that don't cost that much at all to repair or replace\nNext we're going to check your indoor heating cyst\nAll of those little miniscule components that don't cost that much at all to repair or replace\n\nNext we're going to check your indoor heating system or your furnace we'll check the burners your pressure switches make sure that the exhaust is venting properly all of your hoses your drains a flame sensor\nEven run a little own test they call it on your ignite or because if that little baby goes bad it's gonna get cold in your house in a hurry\nMost importantly we're going to check the heat exchange or that's the part that is known to crack into leak carbon monoxide look\nWe all know that carbon monoxide can kill you write but did you know that a majority of the people that survive a one time carbon monoxide poisoning event\nHave a life long side effects do you see now why I say that you have\nTo do these two naps and inspections every six months you don't really have a choice\nWill go to your indoor air conditioning quail after that and inspect it for any sort of biological growth that might be growing on any dirt and the mole mildew bacteria viruses things like that I mean you've heard that mold grows and heating and air conditioning systems haven't you\nThe fact is that it's common for us to find a combination of things in your air stream last time I checked there were twenty two registered strains of mold and while all twenty two are considered allergens seven of them are actually toxic\nOkay and just what are the side effects of breathing old well every once affected differently right but here's just a fraction of the list of side effects were talking about things like upset stomachs weight gain fatigue\nLosses sleep night sweats headaches rashes sore throats coughing I allergies there's lots of taste loss of smell there's auto immune disorders sexual side effects and\nLet's not forget about depression\nDid she know that one in every four people that you know right now has zero ability within their body to fight mold spores\nOne in four wanted for people folks that\nTheir bodies lack the ability to mark the spores for the white blood cells to exterminate your body your immune system it's supposed to mark or tag unwanted invaders for extermination\nNow all the air and you're home from floor to ceiling from one into your house or the other it goes through your furnace and air conditioning system over one hundred times a day\nAnd because most people don't have really good filtration systems those blower wheels they tend to get a little bit of build up on them and a lot of times we see a good eighth of an inch of build up on them that's about as thick as two quarters stacked right on top of one another\nThat when that happens your system just can't move the appropriate amount of their\nNow just one thirty second of an inch will reduce your air speed by twenty percent\nIf that blow and we'll get kinda nasty if it gets just a little bit of build up on it that will show the whole life right out of your heating and cooling system and if you're lucky you'll be forced to spend twenty five hundred dollars on a new heat exchange or\nOr compress are if you're not so lucky you could never wake up again did you know that cracked heat exchanges leak carbon monoxide into your ear stream\nKnow that according to the CDC someone dies from carbon monoxide poisoning every day in the United states did you know that over fifty percent of the people that survive at one time carbon monoxide poisoning event will suffer long term side effects for the rest of their lives\nHeart problems there were a logical problems nervous system damage mental illness personality and behavioral changes loss of muscle function and loss of bladder control I mean the list is truly scare\nChanges loss of muscle function and loss of bladder control I mean the list is truly scary\nWhat if that was you are one of your family members you probably didn't realize that you're blower for you and your furniture air conditioner getting dirty could kill you did you\nSay look if that blower wheels dirty my technicians will pull it out and they'll show it to you and they'll say look we've got to get this cleaned up and taken all apart and that's above and beyond what you'd normally do in a total system rejuvenation that's restoration work\nBut when we get it put back together you're kind of get more air flow it's going to ... better you're going to have cleaner fresher air you're gonna have a lower energy bills I mean that's what it's all about folks\nHey you want another reason to get your eating an air conditioning system tuned up\nHave you ever heard of Louisiana State university\nWell they did a study that compared electrical usage of a dirty heating and air conditioning system to clean heating and air conditioning equipment and what they found was that the average customer with a clean system just one system in their house a clean one\nSaved thirty two dollars and Seventy cents a month on their energy bills\nThirty two dollars and Seventy cents a month that serious\nNo look and about one or two minutes I'm going to open up these phone lines and if you couldn't get through when I give you the telephone number I'm going to do your entire system both the heating and cooling side not for the two hundred and fifty two dollars we normally charge\nBut for free that's right F. R. E. E. free\nNow I only do this on the radio and they'll tell you why because let's face it I Can't send a minimum wage worker to your house for free and make any money at all\nFrankly the U.S government

ordinary cost of doing business so we're talking about a loss on this first appointment coming out and doing it for free\nWhy would we do that well here's what we get out of the deal we get referrals\nI Can't tell you guys how many times it's happened were customers have become huge cheerleaders even before we're done there running around telling their neighbors making calls to family members saying you\nGotta try these guys out folks that enthusiasm is why the average radio customer provides us with three to seven or referrals\nIf your furnace or your air conditioner breaks down and you call a friend or relative and you say hey I've got this furniture ... who do you use your furnace and they say you gotta called freedom heating and cooling they did the best maintenance we have ever\nHad\nThat point are you going to go play Google roulette of course not you're going to take the advice of your friend or your neighbor or your church buddy or your relatives because the company that they're recommending to you served them well\nNow that's the power of doing things right for people that's the power of doing a good job customers seeing it appreciating it and spreading

drive by maintenance okay somebody you were sitting there laughing going what's the drive by maintenance well if you have somebody come out to your house for an air conditioning or heating tune up that leaves after only spending thirty forty minutes during a tune up\nFrankly if it's less than Seventy five minutes it's a drive by tune up too\nSo what do you want to do if you've got one of those companies\nWell I'll tell you exactly what to do next time they call to schedule the maintenance for you\nAsk them to have the technician give us sixty second heads up before he gets to the house a quick telephone call and when you get that telephone call half of your check already written out and just as quickly as you can run up to the end of the rich project\nAnd as a technician drives by hold that check out and slap it right in his hand as he drives by okay because you're really getting anything and in some cases they're doing more harm than good you can't do it to not been twenty thirty or forty minutes okay it's not possible\n\nNow I'm offering this to you for free today but you only get one shot at it okay at least getting the total system rejuvenation for free from that point forward you'll see the value in the maintenance and you'll become a regular customer and if you get set up on one of our maintenance agreements will\nBe able to give you even more discounts in the future and priorities service almost everybody that we see gets one of those maintenance agreements\nThe fact of the matter\nIs that every body and I mean everybody in the Birmingham area needs this I mean everybody we all have heating and air conditioning systems and we all want someone we can trust don't we\nWe don't want to replace our heating and air conditioning systems prematurely and that is where we're headed without proper cleaning\nI mean if you don't change the oil and your car what's\nOr heating and air conditioning systems prematurely and that is where we're headed without proper cleaning\nI mean if you don't change the oil in your car what's gonna happen\nIf you don't change the brake pads aren't you going to replace the rotors to\nSame deal folks if you have heating and cooling system it is actually required by the manufacturer if you want to keep the warranty and clean one runs so much better than a dirty one\nI get phone calls from customers all the time my ears blowing a lot harder is that normal well yeah we pulled out your blower you had us clean it it was all gone up it should be moving more air\nMy furnishing their conditioning system isn't running as much as it was well that was part of the goal we don't want it to run this much that way your energy bills aren't as high end ... D you middle sized properly or humidifiers properly depending on the season\nSo let's summarize folks real quick so that you know what you're going to get from a company like freedom heating and cooling\nSomewhere between six to twenty dollars and I know it's a big span um I don't think that I Would go for the twenty dollar one and the reason why is because while they are great filters\nThey tend to be pretty restrictive alright the machine has a hard time getting the air through them\nHaving one of those little one inch twenty dollar filters on your furnace or heat pump or air conditioner is like your eye running down the street with a wet cloth stuffed in our mouths\nYour system just has a hard time breathing through those kinds of filters and it can cause some damage All right so I buy one that costs between maybe six Fifteen dollars and here's the ticket folks are you ready for it\nChange it every thirty days whether you think it needs that are not no look I can see how that might be confusing for some of you out there but here's the deal when that filter search to look a little dirty it's becoming hard to move the air through it and when that happens\nYou use more electricity operating your blower motor\nAnd the top that off it damages the blower motor and it damages your compressor\nIt'll damage a lot of things in your system I mean filters have zero sympathy for your heat bump your furnace or your air conditioner okay so change them every thirty days please and I promise you you will absolutely thank us for it long term okay\nNow the other thing you could do is put like a five inch thick pleaded filter on it\nSome of these five inch filters will sit right on the side of your furnace or your air handler and they are way less restrictive then the little one inch twenty dollar ones and they do an amazing job and I'll tell you what\nYou only have to change them about every six sometimes twelve months and that people just love\nSo thoroughly your rock stoppers you're saying sisters folks and get yourself a good filter good filters don't cost you a penny they pay you back in droves they give you a great return on investment okay\nYou know I Can't tell you how many people we talked to on a weekly basis have allergies or kids with allergies where we go out with clean up their system possibly pop in a better filter UV light and the system sterilize or or something like that for them and we get these calls\nMy kids aren't having the same type of allergy symptoms they were having before and we're not sneezing in the house and the whole process takes about an hour and a half to two hours to do the tune out\nNow look\nWe've only got a couple of minutes left in the show folks and I've got maybe four maybe five of these left to give away at the discounted rate and on I think everyone who's called in today you know I don't think business people say thank you enough\nWithout people like you freedom heating and cooling just flat

faith principles of fatherhood for divorce men one of the things that I talk about in the very first chapter is I talk about seven reasons\nOr why marriages fail and one of the seven reasons why marriage or marriage fails has to do with um with extra marital affairs mhm that's real\n... absolutely it is happening and that is certainly one of the reasons but it's not the only reason\nIt it's

the answer right right it's not the answer is nothing to do well\nAnd and and here's what's really interesting if you take a look and and I certainly don't want to kind of open up the door to politics but if you had a ... a lot of political situations\nYou do have a lot of indiscretion a and a lotta infidelity a that has made the news and one of the things that is often asked is what is the spouse going to say what is the spouse of going to do are they going to stay are they going to get a divorce and here's the bottom line\nIf there's a way to a board to avoid divorce absolutely voided at a void if there is a way and and I'm a realist I understand that there are some\nUnions that we're not that we're not God God did not put them together you know people always say oh you know well you know what God has joined together let no man you know tear apart well or woman the woman what some of the\nAh some of these ah marriages were not joined by God absolutely you know they they were joined by last they were joined by him a Tour de they were joined by\nA convenience for a number of different things like that so uh it's not always God that is put some people together but but at the end of the day if if if you have two people that are trying to figure it out but they're just they just can't get through the bumps and they and they just have thrown up their hands and they're just\nYou know I hear people always times oh you know I don't love you anymore you know I'm a ... but here's what I can tell you one person can't make a marriage work\nAbsolutely can't make it work it definitely takes two and I don't love you anymore you know what I'm you can love to learn again I I Do believe that um and I'm getting back to what you were saying it takes two people to make the marriage or sometimes now well it takes to it's not a fifty fifty\nUm deal where is it ever well I you know some days is Ninety ten well\nA lot of days it's not a lot of days it's eighty twenty right you can slip describe it can be the man or the one who has you know the greater\nUh in at that point in time but I'm not sure if it ever is fifty fifty but it takes to like you gotta have something one percent right on that times are in the ...\nI'm not sure if it ever is fifty fifty but it takes to like you got to have something one percent right I'm at times uh in uh the marriage in order to make it work and certainly got has to have a place and that\nHe has to be the head of absolutely if he's not at the head of it then you know I I Am I'm doubtful that it has the ability to work anyway you know what can\nYou talk sometimes about gods permissive well in perfect when we talk a little bit about how that\nAre portrayed in a marriage when you know God didn't put these two people together well\nAnd and sometimes the God doesn't join you together but he can still make a positive outcome I tried it if the two of you and let's just say you're young or neither one of you know crisis as your personal savior or you know you're you're getting married based on on um\nUm you know what what you see based on how gorgeous the other person is\nA based on the physical attributes based on any number of different things you know the person has money\nOr whatever um but God has the ability if the two of you end up going to him\nThe while it was not his perfect will but the two of you came together it it can be his permissive will sure if the two of us knowledge him and and you know the Bible says that more people would call by my Mitt Monday more humble themselves and pray and see my face and turn from their work that way then will I hear from heaven will live\nA healed their lands so God can if you turn it around right if you begin to acknowledge him if if the two of you go to him and humility and go to him and seek him or he can certainly turn it around there's no doubt about sure\nYou know getting back to Chris's comments about the uh spouses going to church together and
