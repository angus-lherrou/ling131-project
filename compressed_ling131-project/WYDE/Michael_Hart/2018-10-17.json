[laughter]\nI'm the more money than I got and we'll hear [laughter] I don't know that there's anything that's that's tough that's supposed to happen to Russell Peters not I mean [laughter] it's all done that\nOver the argument that uses it sounds like something about what happened to row so\nBut you know real so your last turning around\nI don't know about all that yeah when you can go too far in a row still comes in here on any given day with a good story of ah what's happened\nI got a quick story here for yet I don't like that I'm so thin skinned do you notice about me than I Am very thin skinned you know true\nActually view you as the a person with a thick skin out of anybody I Know\nAnd I can get my feelings are pretty easily so from time to time we'll post photos on Facebook you take it picks you take yourself or you're hanging out with the tea whatever it is you put it up on Facebook so I sent my sweetheart a picture this morning and she said look handsome black and white picture look hands just my face is sitting in the office it was nothing special\nBut she said it looked good like oh well that makes me feel that I Will make that my new\nFacebook profile ... now there was nothing particularly notable about is just my big fat face in black and white and it was fine\nBut I didn't have a smile on my face I wasn't the court jester that I guess everyone is used to\nAnd so predictably and this happens every time I post a photo if it doesn't have a gigantic smile on my face and was like why aren't you smiling and so a buddy of mine posted it and here's the picture show you I understand that when I was gonna say it's just an ordinary harmless right face in it\nThat shadow on there and makes you look like you've got to Hitler died at [laughter]\nAll of them was the whole truth but it is a good picture\nFine yeah so it's like but uh if I don't have a big giant cheese on my face people give me a hard time right and so I decided that you want a smile on your face I give you a smiling\nThe big giant cheese on my face people give me a hard time\nRight and so I decided that you want a smile on your face I gave\nMe a smile on my face and I took the they kind of the clip art or yeah kind of the hand drawn thing again it's a good glad to put it up there but uh yeah\nI smile a lot and I have fun and it's fine but not every photo has to be a giant smile on your face so all that to say I got my feelings hurt and it was a friend of mine he wasn't trying to hurt my feelings he's like do you okay you're not smiling and I just completely freaked out that\nYou drew ... mile on your picture and at a spike\nAnd then I made that my profile picture overreacted and deleted my entire face but you know he did did [laughter]\nSo it has since\nBeen restored oh but I'm a posts are gone all of my pictures are gone I did leave the ... because it made me smile but uh I'm Sorry I didn't go\nWhat what does that mean in the long term I guess that that's that's another discussion for a different day but I\nWonder you when you talk to these Democrat act or some of these I think I see democratic staffers for these people have been in democratic politics a long time they were really worried about that scenario that\nYou know my job with a Nancy Pelosi for instance what happens you know I was thinking she was going to be speaker of the house again and you know that comes with a better position for me but now looking at this election is not so certain\nSo or you know I I I think that there's that element of doubt within the Democratic establishment it kinda says what you need to know about where to selection is right\nNow well I I don't you think ... the problem with those Democrats that are currently in power and have been for a while it's not that they've stayed in one place and they they kept the same tone around all that they've moved further and further left\nWhat's going to be the effective if you bring in people like ... and yellow and in in the like and they're even further left in who's in there having them being a moving further to the lab has that been their downfall\nYeah what was that was always sort of similar\nCapital is always I saw a just a a straight a voter enthusiasm play that's where you you get the excitement that's where you get you know the sort of these antics you see in Portland, Oregon and and really you Jim up the base legion up the base and you know obviously those are the effects\nBut at what point does it become do the you know the sort of a law of diminishing returns and start it becomes kind of a it starts to ... your own you know you're standing in the Democratic party fire up that based too much\nThat's why it's happening here Democrats really probably weren't counting on this they thought they could keep their crazies in check they always have they have kept their they've kept their activist wing and check probably since the since the sixties I mean if you look at it if you think about it [noise]\nThey've been able to kinda nominate their guy the the the establishment guy but now you have that now you have\nFor better you know to just lack of a better phrase it's the inmate's run any asylum\nAnd that's where you had any scenario so push further to the left I think they're kind of getting out of touch with the American people yet they they are the loudest voices in the room and that tends to me what dominates in these primary scenarios and and you know and when would that that's your grass roots\nAnd that's the direction they needed to go to keep their voters engaged I think\nWell uh it just ... I don't I don't see how in the world that would work out for ... the way we see things trendy now and saw\nFew research polls earlier today that we're talking about self identified union members that they're just as likely to vote Republican\nOr as they are Democrat and and that demographic has been want sign up for a while and that's because the unions you know they they tell their members who to vote for and it's always been Democrat if that's shifting what does that tell you\nAnd and I think the Democratic party what used to be sort of more of a blue collar national party is becoming a coastal party ... it may be still be blue collar in the sense that\nThe the blue collar types of California and New York and in New England and in a lot of the many clinic they they will vote Democrat that's kind of what the identity of the party is but you can't be uh\nCircuit in New England and in a lot of the many clinic they they will vote Democrat that's kind of what the identity of the party is\nBut you can't be a national party if you're just the coast that I I think you know in our system in our democracy where you have an electoral college or a representative democracy we have house it's a set of seats in house districts and things like that it doesn't lend itself to just a mass\nOf the popular vote element that's to me wherever the Democrat Party has got to really think about this that they're not appealing to the blue collar union vote or that they're not appealing to the you know even uh the ... states in any sort of\nWay or any meaningful sense there are for the big numbers are going for the big cities and I\nYou know I told the inevitably that may prove to be successful but for the time me and just the way populations distributed throughout all fifty states I I don't think that's a winning strategy and they need to address that\nYeah they've they've most certainly lasted the um the the blue collar Democrats in a blue collar Democrats states in the ... and ... and they finally picked up on that to where it used to be and this is just judging from the the the reaction I get from people I talk to as\nWe've always voted Democrat so that's just what we'll do I mean all the way back in the sixties and seventies it was like well the Democrats are for the working man or the Republicans are for the rich and wealthy and you still hear people say that today but they're realizing that that's actually not the case and the two parties\nHave switched in a sense on their messaging and who they're supposedly looking out for\nYeah and I would add this element to it I think the Democratic party over the last twenty Thirty years is really relied on the minority vote to carry the day\nThat's been ... their bread and butter but when we found out in these last few elections particularly the twenty sixteen presidential election where they were all relying on African American vote to carry Pennsylvania to carry Michigan you know the city of Detroit\nPittsburgh Philadelphia places like that just are coming out the vote like they are like that wants to have had it I I what I think is going on there is that they they take that for granted I mean you know it's become kind of a political talking point today like to take the black vote for granted that ended up the Democratic party that is but I think it's true that\nThink the the get out the vote effort surely there I think it gets more\nGoing to win this district we don't really have to put resources and making sure we get the vote out or if they do it's it's some kind of token gesture just to uh to show that they're there now for the struggle but I I\nThink you really need boots on the ground\nAnd the Democratic party just isn't doing that anymore they're they're they're they're taking it for granted and you know it ... that was the mistake of twenty sixteen I it's something that the we we got to look at it as far as Tony Eighteen goes\nEspecially with some of this falling and and the way it's related at some of these things because you may wake up on a November seventh and ... and some of those places that were supposed to go Democrat\nAnd the most just where there are people that come out the vote like they were supposed to\nYeah matter that would be an ugly picture for Democrats won one quick thing on the on the front of October surprises I saw a report and I can't tell you who was from Washington Post or whoever\nAh that Mohler is expected to release his findings not necessarily publicly but released his findings or what have you got so far\nBut the report was saying that it may be coming after the the mid term which would eliminate that being an October surprise right\nSo that's the idea now my fear is that just given the\nThey're the the mid term which would eliminate that being an October surprise right\nYeah so that's the idea and now my fear is that just given the people that are working for more right now and we know the politics of it what if one of the elites you know\n... at the eleventh hour or so the leaks and it really kind of throws a rich and what we think is going to happen that that would be one fear there's also the the the crazy possibility that they got something up to the Democrats and it's got ... they're going to play against Republicans\nWere sitting here on October seventeenth us we're pretty late the game for an October surprise and it doesn't happen I'd say about it at least by the early part of next week is probably too late to really impact the electric a big way nationally there may be something in some more court cases they could do that ... that would would change things ... and I\nWould preclude Alabama from that but I\nI I don't think it's going to matter I think it's right now for a national sort of Mark Foley situation or or any of that\nAccess Hollywood tape or something like that we're we're we're probably ruin who are pushing the limits on that\nRight ah well speaking of Alabama or an October surprise is there is this whole ivy Maddox thing or are within the I've I'd be ... realm that they're trying to pin this Hillary Clinton ask\nHealth problem type thing on Kay Ivey that's the route but there are allegedly taking ... and saw\nA W. V. T. M. again in a question with Kay Ivey asking her about it and I obviously she like there's nothing to do that it's absolutely ridiculous what are you seeing on that\nYeah it and you just consider where the started it started with Bill Brits Alabama political reporter which is kind of go to plays for our democratic opposition research I think that's the story you start out that that's the first red flag with this but it didn't work for those guys that ran against her in a primary in fact it made her look\nSomewhat you know more of a victim and any kind of a cat a\nCause a lot of people to sour on a on you know the Scott Dawson ah Tommy Battle\nAnd a bill Hightower so I I think it it just it it it ... it bolsters IVs position I think if they try to do that and she plays it correctly now I'll say this\nI had been probably to half a dozen Kay Ivey rallies mistake in the last two three weeks she doesn't seem to show signs of this this deterioration that we're hearing about I don't\nWhere they take this does she had some kind of a mini stroke two years ago it was not possible do you think the people of Alabama or think well even if she did or three years ago I guess it is now that\nThat she could not recovered it it'd be fully healed from that it'd be is a a capable governor ours ... maybe the ... that she tried to cover it up so we're ... must be more fire I I don't know I don't think it's going to work I don't think this is the last\nNo doubt about it Well Jeff we appreciate you as always I'll keep in touch buddy and we will do it again next Wednesday\nOn there you go your man Jeff for from yellow hammer news from Breitbart you can check 'em out above the website and get all the stuff you can really here's what you do if you just want to reject for stuff you just Google Jeff poor ride murder Jeff or yellow hammer all the stuff comes up Jeff poor central\nIt's our number two coming up next Andrew big day P.

[laughter] are you alive [laughter] well it's like the man I didn't even see that far but he said it was a mechanical\nAir or something but we've heard of vapors bringing down the plane before that would totally be me to the vape smoke creeping out the bottom of the bathroom door\nI I don't know I don't know what that smell of French toast is or where it's coming from ... [laughter] I got nothing to do with um fruit loops are also a little bit of waiting for you but I don't know if you can\nFind are winning music but the U.S has returned to the number one spot in the economic category for the first time since two thousand and eight\nWow winning that was the one of us now of it's supposed to be the Olympic team so that's okay it's a wedding nonetheless [laughter] [noise] so what would that comes from is\nThe uh what do they call it the the journal love or economic development or whatever anyway world Economic Forum that's what it is and they rank the country's according to how\nEconomic development or whatever anyway world Economic Forum that's what it is and they rank the country's according to how their economy's doing if they've got a good economy a bad economy ... whatever they they rank 'em from one to whatever the U.S was number one in two thousand eight\nFor best economy and then after two thousand eight when President Obama took over we then lost that top spot now two years into the Trump presidency\nWe're back at number one that is a beautiful thing and the hell's winning that tells you that all the stuff we talk about that happens on a daily basis we start off most shows talking about winning women's jobs numbers or GDP or the stock market or whatever\nThose are adding up and those ... it's really happening to wear on the world stage they're having to recognize our economy AS number one yet again a place that has not been for ten years big deal also Canada\nLegalizing marijuana today [noise]\n\n[laughter] we'd is now legal in Canada and the stores were lined up with people from a\nFrom the from the door down the street\nI cross the border into New York [laughter] right and uh they said you can't if you're in Canada you can't bring we'd over the border that's a no no but I didn't know anything about this even happening\nUntil I saw Justin Trudeau post on Instagram that he will lead the wheat and now legalized there to [noise]\nThis is not waiting for us but it's waiting for Canada of with U.S Open your way to the Nile label they've than what it is is Justin Trudeau and his battle with us in his battle with Trump he realizes he's going to have to find money somewhere else\nMore tax money somewhere else I go and legalize we ... because of the truck he will try a bar Joe was not working in his favor and yeah that's true at least not in the fashion that was\nUm so that happened and he posted on his on his Instagram picture was like promises made\nPromises kept and I'm like oh that sounds familiar wonder where you got that little Biddy so that's out there also want to talk about that home in Mexico beach that we've seen on the news time and time again or that did not go down as every house around it\nAre literally disappeared I'll get to that and a few minutes two oh five nine four one one zero one one I've gotten Ryan on the line Ryan how are you\nA a\nSuburb of injury in regards to\nThe economy being the number one\nAnd this is the first time and and yet there are certainly isn't shy to you know continually say that you know it was fantastic the\nTrunk you know just continuing with what Obama did right and it's like a ... in the you know even in the competitive category right\nWell and that's the thing is if you go by their standards and did the economy get better from the time Obama took office of the time he laughed well yeah of course a dead because it was in the gutter and that's what Americans do\nDid the economy get better from the time Obama took office of the time he laughed well yeah of course a dead because it was in the gutter and that's what Americans do where and that's what our economy does when it goes down it goes up but it went at\nThe slowest pace that we've ever seen in this country's history and by the time Donald Trump gets a hold of it it within two years he's breaking every economic record you can think of\nSo if you go buy a lapse standard of this and their version of this that means Obama was just under the mark on every single record that you could possibly break in regards to the economy and for some reason couldn't pass any of them if if what they're saying is true\nYeah big Big Jim you\nAssume that you like to play it all by brothers or\nYes have you ever have you watched the music video\nOh love the music videos got ... areas there's got drunk Clinton bill a bill and Hillary I mean Obama's got 'em all\nAnd I would say that I kind of takes away is that there's you know at the end of it but he also except for Trump gets gets away and it's almost like he got stuck holding and trying to fix everything or take something to take responsibility for all of their screw all\n...\nWell in the last scene Hillary helping him over the world hopes\nYeah Hillary helps pull over the you know they all over the wall and then they all leave\nTrump is left standing there when the police catch him\n... no it's her helping him over the wall she's left there because he argues shirts are hard to go back and look at it again because I've been a World Series was to be\nLooking you know rather than being left you know after a grabbing that store\nNow I don't know anything about that I Know and you'd have to look at his brother's ... born oh my God oh yeah and see if I were coming back I'll play the song I live in the break you look at the video\nWill do it right or thanks bunny always going to hear from you rather fills up next the film with the\nBible is and it just reminded me of one particular [noise] over the border a lot about Twenty years ago Ross Perot\nWhich was what\nWell you know we're talking about NAFTA followed yeah that that you know that but I think that can down you know that's\nRight that's a very bad impression but if I remember what it was it is but it was around before it's time\nBut but I Love the cannon\nBecause they wanted to and and like these people said they wanted it to survive the quote unquote big one\nIn the event that something like this happens it's amazing footage to see this house standing all by itself while everything around it is just completely disappeared but um\n[noise] they they talked about what they did to to make this structure so powerful so sturdy they said it starts with forty foot pilings buried underground okay\nA one foot thick concrete walls one foot and still cables\nThat are woven through the roof to keep it attached in the event of a massive storm like Michael was\nA they estimated that they spend about twenty or thirty percent more for the upgrades but said it was obviously totally worth it you know they've got the specs that you're required to do when bill and had our insurance is was a lot cheaper to maybe\nThat's a good point um\nThe fact that they spent that extra money and and they didn't just stop it what's required they said no we're going to build it bigger and better I think Mike Huckabee has a home on Mexico beach as well and they talk to him as the storm was rolling it on Fox News and he said yeah um we spent the extra\nBeach as well and they talk to him as the storm was rolling it on Fox News and he said yeah um we spent the extra money for this exact reason and I don't know what the result was after the storm was out of there but this is kinda the same scenario\nLike that and Ronnie did they rotted out\nI don't think so I'm not sure I don't think it notes in the story but uh\nIt's cold there the sand palace and I don't know if they use that as a\nVacation home for themselves or they rented out or whatever but the people that built it obviously you know they went the extra mile and it's it's amazing because if you've been to Mexico beach you know a lot of those homes on the beach are older homes it's an older sort of\nRetirement community and it's a mix of all these kinds of different people\nUm and a lot of those houses were built so long ago they weren't going to be able to withstand the big one and that's why you saw so much destruction along that are\nAlong the beach just horrible waving the building code people need to go and look at it may be you know bumped the building codes up to where that is the base\nWell and and as they rebuild this stuff you know they'll they'll be rebuilding in in a different way than it was originally built there is no doubt about it because a lot of it's a matter of you know just\nThe code not being or\nBeing better than it used to be or whatever but you obviously you may even have to go beyond what the suspects are on the current code and because you never know when another Michael's going to roll through that brings up the the whole thing I told you guys about yesterday where my dad is taking supplies\nTo those people in Mexico beach you have absolutely nothing\nOr he's teamed up with my aunt and uncle who own hazel Rick orchards out in Cleveland and Blaine county and people are dropping off supplies there so if you guys want to or if you've been looking for a way to donate to those guys affected they still need a lot of stuff\nAnd you can either get in contact with me or you can go by hail Rick orchards and drop off some ... some supplies\nAre on the Facebook page the line that's W why do you eat at info is they're so they're going to get those supplies together and he himself is going to transport the ... the supplies down in Mexico beach because he's still got a lotta\nFriends down there from from when he lived down there so he's keeping in touch with them seeing what they need their actually good\nOn a they're good on bottled water\nThey've got more than enough of that but what they need now is what they said was camping stuff if you think camping what you need when you go camping it's that kind of stuff they need like\nA tarps bug spray gloves schoolers flashlights batteries towels toilet paper wipes uh alcohol peroxide first date items things of that sort and also non perishable food items spam which I Love\nA Vienna sauce just stuff like that so if you want to help out or you can either go drop off there get in contact with us we'll get you all the info you need\nThing that you know to think about as far as camping is a lot of people the the hurricane lambs because I used a on their ... they're going to need the ... poll for that and that doesn't cost a whole lot right you know what I'm saying a lot of people don't think about\nUsed down they're ... they're going to need\nThe last poll for that and that doesn't cost a whole lot right you know what I'm saying a lot of people don't think about ... the candles and stuff like that and batteries they're going to any batteries more than anything for their flashlights and stuff like that yeah\nThat's exactly right so again they hit us up if you need more info on that if you're willing to donate items or whatever the case is that ah that's the way to do and it's a it's a very small local operation getting down there so it's a it's going to really help some people out that\nThat need to help so let us know if you wanna\nYou wanna make I had was that brought them peaches too yes whether it is\nA well while you're dropping stuff off get you some of them are you are that's right and things were\nYou can go ... orchards and also get you some fantastic teachers and and whatever else you want\nAnd you can make a peach cobbler and you can bring it right here by the station at the same time\nYou know I got a problem with that imagine those beaches though in some ... I've got this stuff\nWas now the ones we were eating that they needed to wrap it up just a little bit more but I'm telling you I don't know I'm On the way home yeah and I too while we were at the remote\n[laughter] that's good that and good and then I\nStole three three more they the right for y'all but also\nI understood when you did I said I Can't even have a big day for that you know they were good I don't know how bad he needs a home we all need those in her life\nOr in before we got a break let me put this out there are we've got to a giants a mass\nMigration deal coming up headed towards our southern border where immigrants from several different countries are making their way in a giant caravan type deal or to\nGet into the U.S as quote unquote asylum seekers because they know if they come as asylum seekers by law we can't turn them away and tell them hey you can go if they're from Honduras or El Salvador gang written El Salvador and whatever else we've\nGotta take 'em in and they know that they've been told that but if we're going by the way the laws are set up the country they come to first they have to\nStay there they have to ah migrate to there and not go onto the next country it's not was not a deal where if you're fleeing persecution or you just keep on going to you get to the country are you like the best\nYou flee your country and the first borders you come into that's where do you get to stay if you are in fact fleeing I'm a persecution\nWell they're not doing that they're going through numerous countries making their way up through Mexico and then Mexico just allowing them to continue on and go into America so Donald Trump puts it out there he's like hey here's the deal\nWe're going to let you people from Honduras from Guatemala from El Salvador know that if you allow your citizens or others to Journey Through their borders and up to the United states with the intention of entering our country illegally\nAll of the payments to you guys all the money you get from the U.S\nThat will cease will be done giving you money if you're not going to play by the rules and you're not going to say hey if you cross the border to seek asylum\nIs where you stay if you're going to be pushing them from your southern borders on to our ...\nAnd you're not going to say hey if you cross the border to seek asylum this\nIs where you stay if you're going to be pushing them from your southern borders onto our southern borders\nWill just stop giving you money straight up\nHe also said anybody entering the United states illegally will be arrested and detained prior\nTo being sent back to their country or stance on immigration has not changed since Donald Trump took office and it's not going to change\nTheir having problems right now with too many immigrants coming across the border us detaining them and then getting to a point where we don't have room for them and having to cut some of them loose\nAnd this is all\nA push them promoted by open borders people whether it's people all around the world that are funding this stuff trying to get it to happen or they're\nOrganizing groups and tell them hey to us is going to take it I have no choice that about ... whatever it is there are people pushing for this and then they're\nPushing back against Donald Trump to try to get him stopped in his attempt to keep this country safe or even Jeff Sessions came out with a stern warning to these\nFar left wing liberal judges federal judges that are trying to obstruct Donald Trump and the Trump Administration and every corner the last one a ...
