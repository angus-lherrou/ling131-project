who's agreed to help us with a very important non profit in the city of Birmingham the grassroots coalition which is a fiber wants to be for\nA that was established really to promote more accountability with a local and state wide politics and in order to do that or we wanted to\nEngage um the electorate the citizens on a regular basis on a day in day out basis through organizing and an advocacy and litigation as well\nAnd ah so I like to to say welcome to Sydney Smith how're you doing today I'm doing well and doing well you're a first year law student Cumberland is that correct

renaissance man in the studio today I have to say so [laughter] he's smiling and he's smiling and he's man humble but it's really true because um\nHe's a first of all want to say he's a graduate of ... and Parker high has so much more is rich rich history a community a Smithfield as well and so you know I think if we can just kind of elevate some of that rich history and culture that we had within the city in neighborhoods and communities like Smithfield around schools with Parker high school like\nPart of our salvation a solution to many of our problems are just an honoring the history correct but um but I Want to say welcome to ah Mr he'll how you doing today sir doing\nGood thanks and thanks for actually engaging I asked me to engage with you in this conversation regarding upcoming top\nMost definitely and so I'm like I said you've you've done quite a few things are here in the city you have a background in sports management you you um organize you know big events uh the diversity class of ... is one of them and\nUm you're also recently started a new organization a nonprofit called ... our love you're serving as a chief executive officer of that organization but give our listeners a little bit of a ... you know tell them a little bit about yourself and then about your new organization that she was damaged\nI'll give you a brief description of the ... the project is it's basically a community service outreach a program that is designed to provide services are far homeless citizens that they normally don't receive a week\nBasically a community service outreach a program that is designed to provide services are far homeless citizens that they normally don't receive a we provide mobile showers services are for our home and citizens within the Birmingham area I came about die early on during the campaign\nA season after observing one of our homes citizens having to use the restroom or the downtown library a as a shower or a bird bath as we say and so being a solution is oriented guy\nA former engineer and my former life I'm just tried to find something uh that would help solve that particular situation so we've been trying to bring our partners and the citizens together or so that we can provide these services to help out on the citizens\nWell that's great I mean it's very um it's very needed obviously it's a timely I'm a solution right now you know is one of those things like you said if you you see a problem there and you know what can I Do to reach out and began to solve it and you know there's been a lot of ... and um\nYou know I guess a disgruntled and this was some of the activists and advocacy community in the city of Birmingham because they like to see our current administration be more aggressive on some of these issues I mean we truly are\nIn Birmingham the civil rights beacon of of the capital of the world I Would say [noise] um and we have an opportunity to move forward and and be a leader and human rights to write and I'm so with our history and our demographics ideology we have a unique opportunity and so many of us kind of cast those hopes and aspirations on our elected officials\nWhich you know I think his rifle but we also still\nIn in terms of holding them accountable one way is through and management but another way is is by setting an example is we'll talk a little bit about that\nWell I one of the lessons learned or from the campaign season or is that politics always benefits the politician\nOr the community service always benefits the community and this is one of those projects or that we can use to benefit the entire community\nEyes wanting to give a individuals that can give back\nTo uplift our other citizens and the community as a whole ah this is a project that uh can do that and also\nIt gives me the opportunity to work with other a community on public servants ah for example I'm actually looking forward and hopefully I'll be able to work with\nThe young lady that has started the um be a blessing Birmingham that's right Ira project which outlawed projects so uh it it it it's encouraging to be able to provide this type of community outreach a service and also kind of bring together or those individuals that have a passion in the hearts of helping each other within the city\nRight right and so that's very important information before we close the show today and um I like to you to give us some information on how we can get in contact\nWith you if you have people that want to donate resources or time or to be a part of our loved and we want them to be able to reach out to you and then of course I Will be recording this this lab episode and posting it to our YouTube page and\nUm you know you you can follow me on Instagram or Facebook and I'll have that information posted for anyone who's interested [noise]\nUm I Want to go in and jumping into the topic today which is ah the November sixth election in particular we want to talk about those ballot initiatives which\nThe ballot initiatives in the state of Alabama actually would amend the constitution the nice you don't want to constitutional state of Alabama is um you know well well well known to be the one of the longest constitutions right now in in the preamble is specifically says that the reason or purpose of force that was in the constitution is so that\nUm to enforce white supremacy to put in place in oppressive economic and political system to disenfranchise people of color primarily African Americans are the people that are [noise] you know who who otherwise we're not landowners at the time and when she was initiated a next years actually to Boston\nAfrican Americans are the people that are [noise] you know who who otherwise would not landowners at the time and when she was initiated a next year is actually the bicentennial\nOf the state of Alabama so I think this presents a good opportunity for us to change the constitution I think we need to have some process and some safeguards in place to make sure that\nUm you know some people that are traditionally locked out of the political process will participate in rewriting the constitution but at the very least I Would like to see that the uh the what I was a racist language removed from it right but today you know as you mentioned we have an uh an opportunity and obligation to uplifting to educate 'em our listeners today we want to talk about these for ... for\nA potential amendments um that we would like to discuss and so uh the first one is ah whether or not or would be legal or to display the ten commandments on state property you know and this is to me\nThat's a little too awfully ... bags and ruined more an exact but what are your thoughts on as you're the expert\nToday I'm just well well again I Would take that as a compliment a like a really like you said is it is politics as usual in the state of Alabama\nI'm I don't see where I think this is one of those initiatives that they're going to play on a Alabama Jefferson County and Birmingham being a part of the Bible belt right in the south and a kind of play on your religious emotions a when in fact um\nIt's it's not healthy when you should have a such a separation of church and state auditioning be a discussion let alone on the ballot\nAnd so if we can you know get outside of our religious emotions are and maintain I Try to maintain a certain level of separation of church and state there should be an easy one uh from my perspective and so um I Would like\nIt at least they could have had a some type\nOf a discussion a about this one rather than just sliding on the ballot a and most people are I Would think\nOutside of you know selecting their individual candidates for different positions or might just ignore it but that ignoring that that particular men it will hurt you two\nAre and so I think we need to really you know educate our citizens ... specifically on this one uh if if people like Roy Moore weren't qualified\nOr to win the seat while we still having this discussion because this is like one of his the fruits of his labor or to Ford even still be on the ballot in the state of Alabama and we also have to understand that\nIf the\nIf the Alabama code code of Alabama constitution was written in a manner that I'm ignores a significant portion of it's a elect tore it\nThat are there for ... minutes that will be appearing on the ballot this year on November ... obviously a statewide election\nI'm very important that we all get out and vote on a lot of times we get so caught up into the the government's oil race or attorney general secretary of state we overlook these amendments and sometimes you know is our guest was saying we can be hoodwinked we don't have all the information that we need individuals come to us with an agenda they told us what they want us to know\nAnd we're not able to really make an informed decision and so that's why we wanted to set some time Assad today to have this conversation\nAbout the amendments that will be appearing on the ballot\nOr next biggest her name is Shawn tell you will soon and she's a campaign manager with Planned Parenthood south east or like to say welcome to the show ... tell you how you're doing is we\nDon't get and you hear me okay yes we can we can I I Know that you're um you're organizing right now you've been working around the clock over the last few weeks but ah we're happy to drew able to take some time aside to speak with us on the air today\nThanks I'm like you said I'm shocked that will stress and I and I do work for Planned Parenthood southeast etiquette set out to them they are an amazing team and I'm Glad that that has kept me uh when my many political haul 'em but also until November snakes ... asked a campaign manager for Alabama for healthy\nFamilies which is our ballot committee that we formed comprised of other grassroots organizations I and the state of Alabama to fight against the limit to\nExcellent excellent and so in mid mid to what what is a ... a little bit about it\nSure before the break it down I actually would like to take the time to read the minute as it read 'em so fast proposing an amendment to the constitution of Alabama Nineteen away as many dead to declare that it is public policy at the state to recognize and support\nAlabama Nineteen or one as the men did to declare that it is public policy at the state to recognize and support the sanctity of unborn life in the right the unborn children most importantly the right to life and all manner and measures appropriate unlawful and to provide that the constitution of the state does not protect the right\nTo abortion or require funding so to answer your question and then that shell a we're looking at a direct attack on women's decisions and in layman's terms to be able to understand this amendment\nYou have to have at least a significant amount of college education to read this amendment as it reads um because for the most part a reflection of Alabama does not reflect the high collegiate\nIQ frankly and so we've taken the time to make sure that our campaign across the\nStage strictly informative or we don't talk about abortion access to reproductive history or trauma amongst black and brown communities in general and that's a layered reason as to why are considering what the the syphilis experiment in ... and several other ways that reproductive a and you know government\nOr have really like effect that women it's really time unnecessary that not only we talk about emitted we talk about\nHow language has been used to make sure people read things that um\nWould be predatory and could be predatory as things are acceptable\nTo loose these men were basically sort of where would we go to the students who does not provide a right to abortion would not require any wandering from the state of Alabama to use their purpose so this is a would be directly your position to ...\nUm you know many see it that way but to be clear and not only is it the men are\nBad for all um Marietta reasons but the far reaching a restrictions including a emphasis of rape incest or at the life of the mother is at risk are you know far reaching restrictions on that our intimate decisions that women should be making and politicians have no um [noise]\nYou know right to make those decisions\nThe ... the little girl was what does it those are asking our listeners to do what would what do you wish you were going to bring the troops were able to do with what we\nSaw\nThe message just simple um we want folks to understand that this is not an issue of where you stand on the idea of abortion um we're not you know framing this as a pro choice or pro life a campaign\nThat's a ... as a strictly informational campaign to strictly assert that women deserve the right to make a ton of his decisions over their bodies especially an intimate moments I'm a lot of folks you know think that\nYou know if hyperbole who you know think of sexual assault and other instances but as we've seen in the past years or so storytelling has been the key to open the door to a lot of things around women's discussions around ... um you know trauma frankly\nThough what I Want to do is ah frankly look at this issue from a lens of protecting\nWomen at all costs\nAlso protecting your own writing access to information um we see time and time again that only with a minute to but other amendments where it's so worthy and legal east\nThat you know what when people don't understand things the natural things is to do is to pick out context clues and put together what makes sense to them and as I read earlier if you just pick that apart and you read off things you'll hear thanks for the life pro tech right and if you just put that in the Senate that can make sense\nTo the average person but is important for us to educate is important for us to not only educate our volunteers to provide opportunities for our bart volunteered\nUm nurture their own talent and weighs about talking about abortion access a sexual trauma or um\nTo provide opportunities bothered to a natural talent and weighs about talking about abortion access to sexual trauma or um you know even like unveiling up you know\nOn Alabama and saying hey you know we have to have a conversation on the Internet and woman is and how you know ... it has been exclusive to a certain demographic for so long and end up paying we have\nSeen 'em and sounding amount of diversity from black for college that I Would love to shout out um but also whether or not call it that are fed up and want to change the course of history now\nWell that's good I'm Glad I'm I'm happy proud of the work you're doing I definitely support the message overall I think we need to get the information now I Want you to stay on the line for me I Want to come back to my guests are in the studio we want to shift gears really quickly is speaking about a minute three of them in before\nQuickly and then we're going to come back to you I'm In school systems where you can speak a little bit about uh where are you how people can contact you after the show\nBut the minute three briefly is uh regarding the Alabama board of trustees membership for the University of Alabama and basically just you know reading through it it looks like the limit is there to concentrate power with the people that are already on the board\nI specifically above us remove the superintendent of education from the board or it would establish that um the congressional districts that are in use for January two thousand Eighteen were would still be used for the purposes of identifying the district for the board of trustees\nOr we're coming up on a new senses and as soon as this could lead to those lines be redrawn and that can shift the power of the current a board of trustees and in the last one of the last component of the amendment would remove the provision establishing an age limit of Seventy\nSo it is again is a concentration of power briefly speak about of member three there or if you ...\nWell it's this is another uh uh amendment where they're using a lot of of of big legal words and phrases to confuse the masses and it it's it's really a simple issue for me it just comes down to this is a good recommendation um\nFor the University of Alabama as a board of trustees uh if it was so good why is it just watching it on the ballot for all of the state universities are bored or to be without the board of 'em\nRight okay well I think that's important to get that information now for our listeners we only have about another minute for you to just briefly highlight amendment for we talked about the uh during the break you and I did but uh they basically deals with if there's a vacancy in the Senate or the house how you know how soon as that would have to be filled but again just\nReal quick we we we that's the situation where we actually need to uh make sure that we understand the the information behind was being asked us to vote on right we need to make sure that uh\nThis understand that this is reaction to Doug Jones winning the Senate and so they're trying to use whatever powers they have to maintain that power\nOr to avoid a special election rhyme put whoever they want you in a situation like that so we need to make sure that we can stop that\nMost definitely again it's about concentrating power and limiting the Democratic process really quickly mission and say you still there on the line with us tell us quickly how we can get in contact with you I'm In after the show\nAbsolutely um that were available on all social media outlet um find us on Facebook\nAnd Instagram under A L healthy families so that

announcement about that coming out soon\nAre we want to have more time on the air to get our message out I Want to thank all of our listeners for toning and again I Want to thank both of our guests mission and say well Susan Mr filament healed junior as well and also want to say thank you to Sunni Smith the joining us as well as saying about eight words on the air today we\nStep that up to about ten or eleven the next time you come as soon as soon as you\nNow I only do this on the radio and I'll tell you why because I Can't send a minimum\nNow I only do this on the radio and I'll tell you why because I Can't send a minimum wage worker to your house for free and make any money at all [noise] Brinkley the U.S government the IRS says that it cost fifty three cents a mile last time I checked to send a vehicle to your home just in gas and wear and tear\nAfter that there's the technicians wages the chemicals and heck the ordinary cost of doing business so\nTalking about a loss on this first appointment coming out and doing it for free okay\nWould we do that well here's what we get out of the deal\nWe federals\nI Can't tell you how many times it's happened where customers have become huge cheerleaders even before we're done there running around telling their neighbors making calls to family members and say you've got to try these guys out\nThat enthusiasm is why the average radio customer provides us with three to seven referrals folks'\nReferral or a new customer worth to you\nIf your furnace or your air conditioner goes out and you call a friend or relative and you say hey I got this furniture air conditioner problem who do you use your air conditioner and they say you got a call freedom heating and cooling they did the best maintenance we had ever had\nYou going to go play Google roulette of course you're going to take the advice of your friend or your neighbor or your church buddy or your relative because the company they're recommending served them well\nThat's the power of doing a good job customers seeing it appreciating it and then spreading the good worried about your business you\nKnow look I'm going to give this two hundred and fifty two dollar total system rejuvenation away for free right now to the first five callers freedom heating and cooling is going to pay for it all we ask is that if we do a good job for you\nThat you've considered becoming a regular client and you tell other people about us\nHave to be one of the first five dollars so grab your telephone so that you can get the number and I'm going to give the first five away right now the next five callers are going to get this to not for free\nHere the numbers are you ready dial quickly because they go fast ready\nTo zero five seven to five\nSix zero one one seven to five six zero one one seven to five six zero one one that's two zero five\nSeven to five or six zero one one we've got our first one nope two callers at two o five\nSeven to five six zero one one three left now at two zero five Seventy five six zero one one Seventy five six zero one one Seventy five six zero one one one left last one get it to five\nSeven to five six zero one one\nLook if you can't get to a phone right now but you can get on the line be the very first person to go to clean my AC dot com fill out the radio discount requests form click submit and will reserve one of these just for you\nBut you got to be the first person okay that's\nDot com fill up the radio discount requests form click submit and will reserve one of these just for you but you got to be the first person okay that's clean my AC dot com\nNow here's the deal folks here's what you're going to experience when I send one of these guys out\nGoing to park his truck in the street\nNow while our fleet is meticulously maintained this is just a precautionary measure that's going to keep you drew leaks where they belong\nAway from your driveway okay\nWhen he comes up to your front door he's going to knock on the front door\nWhen you invite him and he's going to reach down and put on floor savers or she covers over his shoes or boots\nThat's because we're going to be working with some water and stuff cleaning your outdoor air conditioning unit or heat pump and it does tend to get a little muggy okay\nGoing to start his own voice and then he's going to ask you to see the thermostat he's going to ask if he can quickly click it on and when he does he's going to make sure that the system is actually working\nHe turns it on he'll then ask you to show him to the outdoor air conditioning unit\nAnd once he seen those he'll go get to work\nNow his very first task is to remove the top off of the outdoor air conditioning system\nAfter that he's going to get the leaves and sticks and mark and debris out of the bottom of the system because all of that stuff holds water when it rains\nIt's going to rush the bottom of your system out prematurely okay so we're going to get all of that junk out of there\nThat alone is going to extend the life of your outdoor unit\nNext step in my opinion is the best okay we're going to use a semi high pressure nozzle to spray down your out door coils from the inside out\nThat's going to force all the leaves and grass clippings in dust and whatnot that has been sucked into it over the last six months back out of the coils\nAlmost like lifting a sweater off of your air conditioning system\nImagine your eye listeners jogging on a hot summer's day with a sweater on and is drawn your mouth your body can't release the heat right so you get really really hot\nWell the same thing happens to your outdoor air conditioning unit and your indoor unit\nIt's dirty it's going to overheat you're going to have a compressor failure you're going to have motors fail\nSometimes we even have to use a booming cleanser to get all that stuff out\nYou're looking at a good forty five minutes just up to this point so can you see now why I say that the other maintenance as our drive by maintenance as if they're there and gone and forty five minutes\nNext we're going to test all the electrical components in your system to make sure that you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires\nMight have a pending compressor failure because you've got this little starter that's about to go bad\nYou might have a pending motor failure because you've got to filter that's all plugged up and you're not paying attention to it All right so we're going to check all of those little miniscule components that don't cost that much at all so repair or replace\nNext we're going to check your indoor he\nThose little miniscule components that don't cost that much at all to repair or replace\nNext we're going to check your indoor heating system or your furnace we'll check the burners your pressure switches make sure that the exhaust is venting properly\nAll of your hoses your drains a flame sensor\nEven run a little own test they call it on your ignite or because if that little baby goes bad it's going to get cold in your house in a hurry\nMost importantly we're going to check the heat exchange or\nThat's the part that is known to crack and delete carbon monoxide\nLook we all know that carbon monoxide can kill you write but did you know that a majority of the people that survive a one time carbon monoxide poisoning event\nHave a life long side effects\nDo you see now why I say that you have\nTo do these two types and inspections every six months\nYou don't really have a choice\nWill go to your indoor air conditioning coil after that and inspected for any sort of biological growth that might be growing on any dirt any mole mildew bacteria viruses things like that\nMean you've heard that mold grows and heating and air conditioning systems haven't you\nFact is that it's common for us to find a combination of things in your air stream\nLast time I checked there were twenty two registered strains of mold and while all twenty two are considered allergens\nSeven of them are actually toxic okay\nAnd just what are the side effects of breathing mold\nWell every once affected differently right but here's just a fraction of the list of side effects\nTalking about things like upset stomachs\nWeight gain fatigue\nLosses sleep night sweats headaches\nSore throats\nCoughing I allergies there's lots of taste loss of smell there's auto immune disorders sexual side effects and let's not forget about depression\nDid she know that one in every four people that you know right now has zero ability within their body to fight mold spores\nOne in four wonderful people folks\nTheir bodies lack the ability to mark the spores for the white blood cells to exterminate\nYour body your immune system it's supposed to mark or tag unwanted invaders for extermination\nNow all the air and you're home from floor to ceiling from one into your house or the other it goes through your furnace and air conditioning system over one hundred times a day\nAnd because most people don't have really good filtration systems those blower wheels they tend to get a little bit of build up on them\nAnd a lot of times we see a good eighth of an inch of build up on them\nThat's about as thick as two quarters stacked right on top of one another\nThat when that happens your system just can't move the appropriate amount of their\nNow just one thirty second of an inch will reduce your air speed by twenty percent\nThat blow and we'll get kinda nasty\nIt's just a little bit of build up on it\nThat will show the whole life right out of your heating and cooling system and if you're lucky you'll be forced to spend twenty five hundred dollars on a new heated exchange or or compressor\nYou're not so lucky you could never wake up again\nYou know that cracked heat exchanges leak carbon monoxide into your ear stream\nDid you know that according to the CDC\nSomeone dies from carbon monoxide poisoning every day in the United states\nYou know that over fifty percent of the people that survive a one time carbon monoxide poisoning event will suffer long term side effects for the rest of their lives\nHeart problems neurological problems nervous system damage mental illness personality and behavioral changes loss of muscle function and loss of bladder control I mean the list is truly scary\nAnd lots of bladder control I mean the list is truly scary\nAre one of your family members\nProbably didn't realize that you're blower for you and your furniture air conditioner getting dirty\nCould kill you did you\nSay look if that blower wheels dirty my technicians will pull it out\nAnd they'll show it to you and they'll say look we've got to get this cleaned up and taken all apart and that's above and beyond\nYou'd normally do in a total system rejuvenation that's restoration work\nBut when we get it put back together you're kind of get more air flow it's going to ... better you're going to have cleaner fresher air you're gonna have a lower energy bills I mean that's what it's all about folks\nHey you want another reason to get your heating and air conditioning system tuned up\nHave you ever heard of Louisiana State university\nThey did a study that compared electrical usage of a dirty heating and air conditioning system to clean heating and air conditioning equipment and what they found was that the average customer with a clean system\nOne system in their house a clean one saved thirty two dollars and Seventy cents a month on their energy bills\nThirty two dollars and Seventy cents a month that serious\nLook and about one to two minutes I'm going to open up these phone lines and if you couldn't get through when I give you the telephone number I'm going to do your entire system both the heating and cooling side\nNot for the two hundred and fifty two dollars we normally charge\nBut for free that's right F. R. E. E. free\nI only do this on the radio and they'll tell you why because let's face it I Can't send a minimum wage worker to your house for free\nThe U.S government says that it cost fifty three cents a mile last time I checked to send a vehicle to your home\nJust in gas and wear and tear\nAfter that there's the technicians wages the chemicals and pack the ordinary cost of doing business so\nWe're talking about a loss on this first appointment coming out and doing it for free\nHere's what we get out of the deal\nWe get referrals\nI Can't tell you guys how many times it's happened were customers have become huge cheerleaders even before we're done\nRunning around telling their neighbors making calls to family members saying you got to try these guys out\nFolks that enthusiasm is why the average radio customer provides us with three to seven or referrals\nIf your furnace or your air conditioner breaks down and you call a friend or relative and you say hey I've got this furniture air conditioner problem who do you use your furnace and they say you got a call freedom heating and cooling they did the best maintenance we have ever had\nYou going to go play Google roulette\nGoing to take the advice of your friend or your neighbor or your church buddy or your relatives because the company that they're recommending to you served them well\nNow that's the power of doing things right for people that's the power of doing a good job customers seeing it appreciating it and spreading the word about your business you\nKnow look I'm going to give us two hundred and fifty two dollar\n... and spreading the word about your business\nNo look I'm going to give us two hundred and fifty two dollar total system rejuvenation away right now for free that's right free so grab your telephone so that you can get the number\nThe number is going to connect you with one of our total system rejuvenation appointments managers who's going to get your name your telephone number and your service address and help you schedule your appointment\nAnd I'm going to give those five away right now are you ready\nHere are the numbers dial quickly 'cause they go quick to zero five\nSeven to five six zero one one Seventy five six zero one one seven to five\nSix zero one one but two zero five area code seven to five six zero one one man only two left to get them guys\nTwo oh five seven to five six zero one one quickly seven to five six zero one one one left seven to five six zero in one that's two oh five\nSeventy five six zero one one there\nNo look if you weren't able to get through on the telephone lines just then be the first person to go to clean my AC dot com fill out the radio discount requests form and we'll get one of these just for you but you've got to be the first person okay that's clean my a C. dot com All right\nNow I'm going to talk a little bit about the drive by maintenance okay\nSomebody you were sitting there laughing going what's the drive by maintenance well if you have somebody come out to your house for an air conditioning or heating tune up that leaves after only spending thirty forty minutes during a tune up frankly if it's less than Seventy five minutes it's a drive by tune up too\nSo what do you want to do if you've got one of those companies\nI'll tell you exactly what to do next time they call to schedule the maintenance for you\nAsk them to have the technician give us sixty second heads up before he gets to the house of quick telephone call and when you get that telephone call\nHalf your check already written out\nAnd just as quickly as you can run up to the end of the rich get richer and as a technician drives by hold that check out and slap it right in his hand as he drives by okay because you're really getting anything\nAnd in some cases they're doing more harm than good you can't do it to not been twenty thirty or forty minutes okay it's not possible\nNow I'm offering this to you for free today but you only get one shot at it okay at least getting the total system rejuvenation for free\nFrom that point forward you'll see the value in the maintenance and you'll become a regular customer\nAnd if you get set up on one of our maintenance agreements will be able to give you even more discounts in the future and priorities service\nAlmost everybody that we see\nGets one of those maintenance agreements\nIs that every body and I mean everybody in the Birmingham area needs is I mean everybody we all have heating and air conditioning systems and we all want someone who we can trust don't we\nDon't want to replace our heating and air conditioning systems prematurely and that is where we're headed without proper cleaning\nI mean if you don't change the oil and your car what's gonna happen if you don't change the brake pads aren't you\nAre headed without proper cleaning\nI mean if you don't change the oil in your car what's gonna happen if you don't change the brake pads aren't you going to replace the rotors to\nIf you have heating and cooling system it is actually required by the manufacturer\nYou want to keep the warranty\nRuns so much better than a dirty one\nI get phone calls from customers all the time my ears blowing a lot harder is that normal\nYeah we pulled out your blow or you had us clean it it was all gone up it should be moving more air\nFurnishing their conditioning system isn't running as much as it was well that was part of the goal we don't want it to run this much that way your energy bills aren't as high\n... D you middle sized properly\nOr humidifiers properly depending on the season\nIt's going to cost you somewhere between six to twenty dollars and I know it's a big fan\nUm I don't think that I Would go for the twenty dollar one and the reason why is because while they are great filters\nThey tend to be pretty restrictive alright\nThe machine has a hard time getting the air through them\nHaving one of those little one inch twenty dollar filters on your furnace or heat pump or air conditioner is like your eye running down the street\nWith a wet cloth stuffed in our mouths\nSystem just has a hard time breathing through those kinds of filters\nAnd it can cause some damage\nAll right so I buy one that costs between maybe six Fifteen dollars and here's the ticket folks are you ready for it\nChange it every thirty days whether you think it needs that are not\nLook I can see how that might be confusing for some of you out there but here's the deal when that filter search to look a little dirty it's becoming hard to move the air through it and when that happens\nYou use more electricity operating your blower motor and the top that off it damages the blower motor and it damages your compressor\nDamage a lot of things in your system I mean filters have zero sympathy for your heat bump your furnace or your air conditioner okay so change them every thirty days please and I promise you you will absolutely thank us for it long term okay\nThe other thing you could do is put like a five inch thick pleaded filter on it\nBut some of these five inch filters will sit right on the side of your furnace or your air handler and they are way less restrictive than the little one inch twenty dollar ones and they do an amazing job and I'll tell you what\nYou only have to change them about every six sometimes twelve months and that people just love\nSo thoroughly hey you're rock stoppers you're say an sisters folks and get yourself a good filter good filters don't cost you a penny they pay you back in droves they give you a great return on investment okay\nKnow I Can't tell you how many people we talked to on a weekly basis to have allergies or kids with allergies where we go out we clean up their system possibly pop in a better filter UV light and the system sterilize or or something like that for them and we get these calls\nMy kids aren't having the same type of allergy symptoms they were having before and we're not sneezing in the house and the whole process\nTakes about an hour and a half to two hours to do the tuna\nOnly got a couple of minutes left in the

and we are more than happy like I said we have another a number of different programs that we want to connect\nWith you are but as we often do in the first part of the uh the program we want to talk about our last um are left programmer last show\nAnd we want to talk a little bit about our last caller so Leslie as you recall our last caller a last week a Steve talked about or something that prompted a lot of conversation and in a in a lot of different ways we when we talk about divorce\nOr we oftentimes talk about that kind of one on one uh you know interaction and we also talk about that interaction with your children but he brought up in an area that\nA lot of people don't even think about how it affects the divorce\nAbsolutely he he spoke about your in laws and divorce reaches far corners of every part of your life or your friends your your family and certainly your in laws and you know [noise]\nWe really try to encourage those who are are going through divorce if if you're unfortunate enough to be moving through divorce\nTo divorce in a respectful manner in a way that you can preserve the relationship you have with your in laws\nAnd this is extremely important ... especially if you have children right here in your in laws remain your children's family and you want to make sure that you are encouraging\nPositive relationship ships with ah your family you certainly don't want to be the topic of negative conversation over Christmas dinner on why your children are at grandma's house exactly because that's the reality of that and you know I you know unfortunately there are so many people who from day one never got along with their in laws and I know that's\nReality for a lot of people a lot of my friends did not even have a close relationship with their in laws from the beginning but I Will tell you that you know if you're moving through a divorce it's it's more important that you have a positive relationship you're in off because those children need love they need the love of everyone around them and family is a gift\nIt is it is and and you know after after the show last week I had an opportunity to talk to a one of our listeners and they shared with me that that after the show it prompted conversations between\nA between the list or and and their spouse and they talked a lot about wow you know we never thought about the impact of of in laws you know what happens in a lot of cases a lot of people end up becoming very close to their in laws and we're not just talking about the parents\nWere talking about the siblings right now we're talking about you know if you're married um\nThan your husband in your wives have brothers or sisters that you become very close to them you become very close to the cousins or et cetera and because of that you end up developing friendships you know ... and so the big question then becomes once the divorce comes what do you do\nI Will tell you the best example I have of how I why I knew this can work is my mother my parents were divorced when I was about six years old and\n... she was in ... seconds ... so you're about to put your your business in the streets right 'cause you know but you know that people don't put their business in the streets\nOr is old and\n... she was in ... so you're about to put your your business in the streets right 'cause you know you know that people don't put their business and street\nYeah OK anyway [laughter]\nWell you know and and that's why they're so much shame right that exactly why we're doing the show right right um because it's really it's not about putting our business industry it fifty percent of marriages are what is it forty percent of marriages are indoors if what if your business is in the street right it's already there okay hot right price right\nUm but anyway my parents were divorced when I was about six years old and I'm a I'm pretty short was because my my papa was Rolling Stone\nBut nonetheless\nMy grandmother my father's mother and my father's\nFather treated my mother with respect she was one of their children right she was at my parents were divorced and my mother was that holiday dinners at right grandparents' home right and so she was the greatest example she never spoke negatively about my father\nShe never kept us from my grandparents she never kept us from my father right\nSo I Know what God can do I've seen it I've experienced it\nWell but here's the thing and and I I I think this is worth pointing out or we talk about in laws and we talk about the impact that divorce has on a on it extended families but you also brought something that was very interesting what you were in essence said is your mother\nMade it easy to try to do that and there were things that she did and and I want you to repeat those because I think it's worth it was worth mentioning what were the things that your mother did that made it easy for for her inlaws or for your father's family to embrace her\nOh my gosh it it looked like they ... you know and I was that was a young child but then you grow into you know those teenage years and you see my mother which is always she's a ... percent um she loves Christ she loves people but she always did for them she was always so very helpful to my father's parents into my father's family\nUm they all my my father's siblings still considered my mother one of them but her kindness her generosity\nUm you know she like I said she just never had a negative word where to say about anyone for him so that in itself that's it kind of generosity\nWell and and so we we get back to this whole issue of of the inlaws right um I think at the end of the day in laws are impacted but I I think the message here is that if you continue to treat people with kindness if you continue to treat people\nUh you know with respect absolutely then even when divorce comes it doesn't mean it has to destroy all of the relationships that you have to try and I think that's important because those relationships we'll get impacted there's no doubt about\nThat absolutely absolutely I Love to hear from someone I'm moving through divorce now and the and a ... yeah you know feel free to call in if you're in law and the situation we love to hear from\nYou tap slowly absolutely so we're gonna we're going to go to a to break and when we come back from break or we're going to really get into what the show was about four this week I've got some really exciting stuff that we want to talk about uh we want to talk about those four words so join us
