Michael\nElliot how or why all this massive an ally calling Michel the hurricane ... mid sounds more like a cartoon character well let's just different than what you're used to here and it's colorful it is very colorful especially in the middle with all the rainbow colors going on or yeah I like it\nOr we will be getting a live or a port a from Tallahassee where you boy Jeff poor decided to ride out the hurricane\nWell are you being serious now how how I mean I wasn't aware that he was even they are how how much of a direct hit was it at all or how much are they experiencing well have you uh see between Panama City in Gainesville louder oh yeah okay I have you got to start enjoying their\nAnd well ... and the thing is and he'll give us updates east I just tax them a few minutes ago and he says he's good he we should be able to use the queen feed but uh\nIf you see the way that things working its its going counterclockwise so everybody that's on the eastern side of the storm is dealing with the the majority of the storm surge because the wind is blowing from the ocean to land\nAnd it's blowing on that water up onto the mainland where on the other side if you're on the west side of the high it's actually pulling the water back out to the ocean or at least attempting to he's on the eastern side so he's dealing with a storm surge\nUh if if something happens and we don't happen again I'm here in the next thirty minutes or we'll just cross your fingers ... and half\nYeah one who's not on the ... now now it's not gonna see Alice ... already connected but he could just be a thing or not connected and yet well he should a claim to require Internet access well he's got his hotspot he's still got a phone number ... that's shocking that they've even got phone service well\nIt's you look around at some of the areas and we've been literally watching this all day I hits between a Panama City\nAnd Mexico beach are run about\nRight in between those two where Mexico beach would have been on the uh uh eastern side Panama City on the western side\nI invite you to sit around the porch with us 'cause we share our American story on superstation one on one point one [noise] W why do [noise]\nHello this is Adrian Hendricks and Jerry Hendricks of say one more now incorporated where our focus is to loving me come from all activities is honoring human like created in the very image of God\nWe look forward to joining every Sunday at one o'clock pm on superstation one oh one delegate Whitey\nAnd ask you to remember life is good God gift fly God is\nGood hey ... thinks we're listening superstition one or one\n[noise]\nLine two oh five dollars for one one zero one one now just 'cause seeing images from\nAppalachian coal or Florida\nIs kind of in that area we were talking about where they got hit really hard to places flooded as you can see a ...\nIf you watched any of these reporters and these aren't CNN style reporters that pretend to be get knocked down and people are right in the back\nIf you watched any of these reporters and these aren't CNN style reporters they pretend to be getting knocked down and people are right in the background or perfectly fine uh these people were really in harm's way because you have giant chunks of debris\nFlying through the air whether it was pieces of of citing or a you know stripped from metal roofs whatever you imagine how dangerous that if something like that coming at you in a hundred miles an\nHour it was almost like a tornado was ripping through you know I mean it did that that was not like just a windy day that really like tornado level when\nAnd I think a big reason why we've all been watching this so closely is because we're all tied to this and somehow in the sense we've all been to Panama City we've all been to to a desk in orange beach whatever the case in ... where we go to the beach at so you watch this stuff on TV\nAnd you recognize these places because over the years that's where you went we every kid that's where I went to the beach at\nAnd so to see it like that is um it's it's really sad my last trip to the beach which I guess was last night this summer but last and went to a a Gulf shores I think I was at Fort Fort Morgan maybe\nAnd I don't remember the name of that hurricane but one came through while we were there\nAnd even though we were in a giant beach house that really\nWas safe from the stuff we were on the beach and just watching out the window those waves that seemed like they were fifty feet high yeah it was a scare actually had one kid die\nOr just down the road from where we were saying they were out on the beach in in a giant a piece of debris came flying in from the ocean and and the kid ended up dying that's scary it was sad sad situation\nBut that's the scary if you're out there and especially if it's your first time experience in it when which it was for me that year when I was like I'm going to die\nWhen he had a question and this is probably a dumb question the last ... I mean with a hundred and fifty miles per hour when if you were to step outside what'd you blow away yes I mean you know but I'm just wondering 'cause depends on what you've way\nOkay well I mean thank you that's a really on us out there but you know what I'm saying like I Would you like literally because it's ... it's strong enough to rip the roof off of the house right well cutting that take a human being and he's standing there and just take you off your feet\nOr yeah if you if you jump bumping the air or in the middle of it it'll probably slowing down the\nRoad is don't job this was a guy\nI mean it's not going to pick you up and like suck you up in the air but it's\nGoing to why didn't think that in a sling you down like a tumble we there you go that's kind of what a ... a lot of mind\nThat that would happen that kind of thing\nI'm kind of want to experience if less self ... long before\nGet over to Georgia a lot quicker and try to meet this thing while it's a cat to see what happens\nUm another thing to pay attention to with this stuff going on is is the oil and gas production that\nIs in the Gulf that this affects they're having to uh I think shutting down forty or they've had to shut down forty percent of the oil production and thirty percent\nOf the natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico because of a hurricane Michael and I think that happened yesterday morning when they did that uh if if what I saw was the right I think that was from the bureau of safety and environment enforcement but\nWhen they did that uh if\nIf what I saw was right I think that was from the bureau safety and environment enforcement but that\nWas an covers I think Seventeen percent of total us crude oil and five percent of natural gas production\nOr how that affects the markets or how much gas is I really don't know we're in a better position than we've been in the past in the sense of\nA U.S drilling for oil at home and having oil to where we can withstand something like this without and gas prices getting out of control but you never know and on our own the home front here in Alabama we've apparently not even really know this until today\nBut we've got this once in a lifetime cotton crop going on and that is\nBecause of the weather and how it's been the season so on people that are cotton farmers\nThey've had this ... this fantastic opportunity with what they're caught and how it's grew in the price of it and all that kind of stuff\nThis storm could wipe all on that stuff out pretty you guys out in east Alabama to see this when I go over there or you see miles of cotton fields and it's beautiful you know when you see it but\nFor southeastern Alabama and that could really damage one that I haven't been doing all season in in a ... that's a lot of money for them and their families of forms or whatever\nThat kind of stuff you don't really think about that much just because it's not a part of our daily lives but it really is a reality in situations like this\nAnd then I saw a heartwarming story on all of this tragedy about a soldier who's home in North Carolina was ransacked was looted a while he was helping with Hurricane Florence efforts\nHe ended up getting a bunch of donations after that to replace a stuff\nTurns out he the he says he brought in more than he expected or more than he needed as far as\nUh the money people donated things people donated so he took the money that he didn't need just to replace this stuff and ended up donating it to families in the wow that was chemical less people want to just kept that now that's true yeah let me get Jeremy and real quick Jeremy what's up\n[laughter] you know I'm I've worked in the ... in ... in the Gulf of Mexico for over Twenty years better fact come down there right now for the first time in two years\nSo a budget they shut everything down as soon as that I was a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico yeah so it's all going on\nAnd ah what that's all that's another thing that really affects also\nIs ah the tankers that I'm In a ... of its ... worked\nAnd pop off in the Gulf of Mexico and uh so you you might feel a little bit of a price spike but as soon as it gets back out of the Gulf of Mexico that can continue with the operational popped off those tankers and also what bring back on the wells in the Gulf of Mexico\nWell how long this ... just ... from your expertise how long does that last like for instance they shut it down yesterday morning when in this kind of situation would you think they start back up\nAs soon as that ... some lions oh really\nYeah I always thought it was on land and uh most of the production as not off the off of the park I was just full of oil and gas we we've yet to draw leasing out there um but most of the productions off the coast of Texas a Louisiana sweet crude right\nBut uh as far as you were asking about what to do\nAnd ... to Texas a Louisiana swing credit right\nBut uh as far as you're asking about what to do that during a hurricane opposite and Cameron when read it yet\nAnd I put several mob exhaust and love a lot of my main ... just 'cause I didn't want water a bunch of water on down there and we started the wife are mourning\nAnd to make a decision about because I kept those sa and soft and the fat as far as the he was that three hundred and eighty pounds and a hard time stand in the when the\n... get out the window I'm Sorry it was ...\nBut ah you know you know about that\nYou wanted and I'm pretty sure it upon me over but\nThings change they changed the building codes\nAnd the structures are are are more more sturdy they're able to withstand uh uh uh the storms what they would do some of these high rise condos to test the windows they would fire a a four by four out of the cannon and if it just broke a pacifist shattered it didn't pass\nSo they would do these things coming out of hope will and I you know I think this is the first major storms since then to hit that area has got to be interesting to see how you know I I Know it's been about Twenty years since a lot of these changes went into effect but I what I I fully expect to happen is things things given given that that happened\nAre going to be as bad as they might have been when when ... through\nWhat about like a preparations for this thing because we didn't know exactly where it wasn't going to hit we knew the panhandle but when we can name a steady or anything like that until earlier today or the fact that this thing was lacking the preparation or the heads up that we had with Lawrence\nAnd how it seemed to just go from tropical depression to ... for what what was the feel like in Tallahassee are are in the panhandle when when you got word this things actually going to be bad or when ... when did that happen\nSo I think we're about four or five days out probably over the weekend or he started again you know kind of keep an eye on this and and the idea was\nIt was going to be maybe a cat one at worse maybe a tropical those prop tropical storm\nBut once I started you know I I think it really picked up strength and the Gulf and we had an unusually hot summer and an unusually long summer was hot into\nSeptember an early part October I don't think that helped matters a whole lot but I ... the the idea that the storm I think really built up strength there at the end just due to that the warm water in the Gulf of Mexico\nAnd these things have happened in the past uh they should they give a couple of ... on you know I I kinda started my journalism career mobiles so I've kind of watch these storms is the way\nThe way they develop the ones that come out of the Yucatan Peninsula that they come in like that they they have a tendency to really gain strength in a hurry\nThat's why I think happened here and that's why I think he caught I caught some people by surprise down out of school students here to FSU students\nThey cut them loose out of school yesterday so a lot of people in town I think a lot of the students are gone a state government shutdown too but I I think the regular Tallahassee residents are pretty much ride this thing out\nThough is ah Andrew Gillum like hit jumping Jack then you make sure you're OK\nSo uses bizarre controversy going on in Florida right now about a rod scientists his Republican opponent right so ... running for ... for governor of Florida and it's got her public an opponent and\nThe kind of gentleman's agreement that they were going to pull each other's ads and it was going to be a time of coming together or whatever and we're going to get through the store and\nI guess in Jacksonville and maybe another market in Palm Beach they were running some of the commercials criticizing Andrew Gillum for his handling of the hurricane two years ago a with hurricane her mind and that's become kind of the controversy had given one on MSNBC once already today before the ... prior to the one you just saw him on\nAnd he wouldn't complain to raise that point so there's this you know this backdrop the politics of it all kind of playing out\nIn the old double cross and the political had got him when he got him um you expect if if your power goes out or if the power goes on down has to do you expect Andrew Gillum to to take his time and getting your power cut back on\nIf the power goes out and Tallahassee do you expect Andrew Gillum to to take his time and getting your power cut back on a since you work for Breitbart that's a good point\nAbout ... about two hours ago running on a battery power and a hot spot\nRight now I got you you might want to keep the good right [laughter] side effects like any good I think about the the hurricane that I was going to mention a second ago was the fact that there are things hitting land and this goes into the how it's going to affect\nYou are in the coming hours or how it staying at a cat for and then moving down through a cat\nToo and and there's still a major storm by the time it gets up to like South Carolina ... is that normal for you living in that the that part of the country\nNo I I think or you take a Katrina maybe when you think of storms really out of that kind of staying power\nOver land and not breaking up and staying organized there was one thing about this store says it's a little smaller is moving faster that's you know when when when it's moving faster that's given at the ability to kind of stay organized and not break up like a lot of these stores traditionally do I think\nUh otherwise that that it's more it's more about that the good news of that is moving fast it gets over with faster but the bad news is Millwood fast which means that that gives it more it has more coverage area and with that speak a moral wins and faster wins\nRight man or the fact that it's just making that track up through Georgia obviously we here in Birmingham and even maybe in North Alabama will have some spin off from that\nFor a moment right before it reached land I thought that bad boy was going to cut north northwest and maybe not get as much of Georgia and more of Alabama but it actually stay on that track they said it was going\nWell I think a cold front coming through and and we're supposed to get some cooler temperatures of Alabama are coming into the weekend and I think that cold front is really why it's pushing toward Georgia that north easterly track\nYeah mental that'll obviously pushing out to the coast and and send it back where am I wrong yeah get outta here with that mess\nWell we're going to a well obviously keep in touch with the ... and stuff and you can just let me know how things are going what are the other big things in in the news right now now that we're on the backside and we didn't talk to you since the confirmation that Kavanaugh\nUm what was your overview once it was said and done and he was sworn in what was your overview of the whole thing\nYou know I I think the Democrats are overplayed this are they now we're going into it they had to do what they had to do to stop at the ... I think they needed to lease looked like they put up a fight\nBut they they legitimately put up a good fight and a ... for a while but I I think there's some collateral damage I think it hurts them and it helps Republicans you know I think both sides got you know took a little bit of it on the chin but if you're doing a net net analysis of this\nI really think that the Republicans get some some some motivated voters out of it you already have Democrats motivated I don't know what else you could do to motivate the Democratic base right now they're in the streets to chase it down members of Congress\nThey're doing everything you know that that you just appears to have all the enthusiasm now suddenly you see the little lie for the Republican side so to me that's\nThat's really important to somebody's house races now I think it also will will change the map on the Senate I I think they're going to pick up a few seats Republicans now could win Missouri they've jumped out to double digits in uh\nIn North Dakota they they could win West Virginia I think this is really backfire on Democrats in that regard\nWell in the Democrats claimed to have the momentum\nCould win West Virginia I think this is really backfire on Democrats in that regard\nWell in the Democrats claimed to have the momentum of before all this stuff happened and then the result was\nKavanaugh being put on the Supreme Court and depending on who you ask\nThey're going to say that they benefited from it if you ask Republicans they say yeah this has got everybody fired up right before the midterms they're engaged again they're not just kicking back and enjoying a Trump pecan enemy\nThey're actually paying attention and then on the Democratic side you got to say oh we are so high rates were fired up and we're gonna we're gonna take our rates to the ballot box so do you think the Democrats are are a little less\nGenuine on that front\nI I think they got to put on your ... at least make it seem like that that the ride in the moment I'm into the election now here's what you know I wasn't alive but it kinda makes you think of the Nineteen sixties when Woodstock and all these things these these race riots and all this civil unrest what's going on in the country\nBut well what happened like tall presidential politics next one to elections in his second wife he won in a landslide and this was coming on the heels of all the uh the war protests and all of that so I you know you kind of wander there may be a lot of action and all that a lot of activity in the streets on the left\nBut that doesn't necessarily mean that that they can win elections out of this and I I I think there is a all the diminishing returns and I also think they're sort of a counter counter reaction to a lot of this because people don't like this sort of chaos in the streets of turns a lot of voters away especially swing voters\nRight well and we know that when it comes to\nThe record books or tradition when it comes to the era of Donald Trump we got to throw that out the window to an extent and and I think without seeing a president or Republican president that's on the road as much as he is he going from stadium to stadium across the country\nPacking them out everywhere he goes getting people excited almost putting them in a position where they they have\nTo pay attention nobody's talked about more than Donald Trump that I I think that that in itself would have the Republican base more fired up than they generally would be heading into a mid term two years after an election right\nYeah and in a you know Congressman Mike Rogers folks they they they make this point we were sitting now fifty days out thirty days out of the uh twenty sixteen election it looks like rubber Republicans will get wiped out and Congress and it was like ... it was on her way to a landslide\nAnd that turned out not to be the case and Republicans actually held on to Congress but the trick was and and I think this is the magic to sort of the magical lecture here was truck was everywhere on the campaign trail he was doing some times\nNow Brad Jeff have you had any Democrats getting up in your face as a famous Breitbart contributor writer I just got to think maybe he might be targeted\nLike is perpetual state of danger in doubt\nThat it's it's sad but credit stripes and now without power you know when you can say\nYou never know what's gonna happen I checked Jeff found on Breitbart check him out on you know hammer news dot com is all over the place yeah we will talk to you again next Wednesday my friend\nThank you for having me on again and there you go a man Jeff poor will take a break our number two coming up next they'll go anywhere\nW.

crew\nTo get that letter and and we get out and in turn it into what it turned into because you remember the cleaning lady that was friends with I'm friends with Christine Ford the former FBI official she used to work for ... ... what what ...\nHow are you pronounce his last name or just a ...\nAnd uh this is a a very outspoken guy a former a former official very outspoken against Trump like all this stuff ties in to get in any other things we know about Christine board in her ties with her brother and all this other stuff fusion GPS all of a sudden comes in the mix now\nAnd it it it spells out hit job from top to bottom and that's why I have a hard\nTime coming out and saying Christine forwards the victim and she just may be confused it it's hard knowing all those facts to say Christine for was just a innocent or innocent\nPerson an innocent bystander that just so happened to get abused in a political process it there's too many there's too many dots that are being connected for me to gather up\nAnyway we'll get back to the other thing too oh five nine four one one zero one one more your phone calls coming up next\nWas in ruins Jessica\nHey this is the milk and I'm Jonathan good

today and will be posting updates on there as well if anything goes south at least for our immediate listening area\nOn the topic is CNN broke Baldwin\nWas uh doing an interview with a couple of people and they were talking about this mob stuff and how again the comparison is made or lack there of the lock her up people are bad people running\nSenators out of restaurants good the ones that are following the direction of Maxine Waters of of Hillary Clinton those are the good guys because they're doing something of that they're they're pushing back on what they feel is wrong\nSo in that mentality if you went up there that would that would mean going up to a woman and just go and you're pretty you're pretty you're pretty would be wrong but if you stopped her totally fine totally cool that makes\nSense yeah you're a ... ears were both went on CNN talking about the ...\nRight cab and all you know they just do this for the next four weeks do you think that that's a winning strategy\nI definitely think it's a winning strategy for the midterms there could be long term consequences that we look back at this moment and said that this was you know one moment on our way to Republicans having a demographic problem but in terms of the midterms I think Mary Catherine is exactly right\nDemocrats are already motivated Donald Trump like nothing that happened uh you know last week is going to matter to the person who's already upset about all the other things Donald Trump has done Democrats were motivated passionate angry sure they are either going to turn out or they're not\nRepublicans there the team that needed to the excitement the past and the energy they didn't have it\nIn mid term is that is what matters for turnout and now I think they do and it's because I Believe it's the overreaction of a left when you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out or restaurants by a mob oh you're not going to use the word is totally a mop it is without a doubt that there's no other words\nYou would think he just said the N. word right again more yeah you can't use that we're no star\nIt's a little go put a stop on on what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August cigars I'm not it's not what we saw chasing\nAnd we're going back to Charlottesville because the media has concocted this this image that they're in the business of rewriting history and instead of it being\nTo ban sides fighting amongst each other that resulted in an in the wife being taken of of a young woman\nThey they paint that they restructure that for the history books for it to be strictly a white supremacist Trump loving group going and attacking innocent people\nThe history books for it to be strictly a white supremacist Trump loving group going and attacking innocent people and that's why she brings that up because that's what they've turned Charlottesville into\nWe've right what about the people who were at the Supreme Court banging on the walls what do you call that civil protest or that I'm off I think it's easily him\nYeah and if there was a party or as we call it I'm all for ... come on let's be serious\nLet me let me let me let me move past the N. word because I Do feel like that as part of the weaponization of of what's happening now on the right but at the same time I think you do make a really interesting\nShe sent this to the weaponization of what's happening on the right the N. word\nHe really calling at the ... and so she's not allowed to say it correct\nThe N. word now that I'm a sense of this was the same\nThat just last night I'm Sorry the night before I watched Don Lemon play be Billy Bush tapes on edited repeating the ... without believing it out and also carrying on a discussion about\nThe president's private parts\nAnd with a porn star let's not forget about us whole country so many towns that word was\nYou know it was used a ... a hundred and eighty times in the course of three days\nYou know what kind of reminds me of it's like the first time your kids get old enough and they're they're reading the Bible and they realize that jackass is in the Bible and then and then they just as well as in the Bible you know I Know it's one of those deals that's how I feel like MSNBC and CNN or they're like well somebody else said it so let's just keep repeating it\nAnd then Democrat Senator Mazie Hirono\nHere's what she says about what's happening to those representatives on the right she says this on CNN\nWhat they're saying is that democratic protesters are quote an angry mob and we don't want to ask you about it you know it is one thing to protest at the Supreme Court to do it at the Capitol that's been done for for generations and frankly since the founding of the country it's another thing to run senators out of restaurants go to their homes is that going too far\nI think that it just means that\nThere are a lot of people who are very very much ah I'm motivated but what is going on it's not violence it's motivated appeal okay well what happened\nWith that does have an eye on the very beginning this is not a fair process or what the Republicans said with a telegraph after that the fourth accounting for what they tell us that was one that before we don't want to hear from you\nToo if we have to hear from you were going to raise the hearing so that going on is no restaurants for this is what happens you know they because they look at white supremacy says and and all of that and this is what is it coming forth in our country that's a\nTremendous divisiveness in our country but this is the kind of activism that occurs and people make their own decision if they violate the law and that is a\nI mean I disagree with that one if you remember the movie twister they had that thing that that what was it the Dorothy\nA bucket thing but it has answers yeah remember that like let's just get back to that yeah but we're not throwing people inside of a tornado like that's all that we still have sold chasers even though we have that we\nGet one of those barrels stick a bunch of people in it and then the government they weren't sure why not a next\nIs a NO NAME but it seems they say\nI wrote this for the people of Florida as they struggle through vicious Michael okay this is\nA this is a poem [laughter]\nOh well that's and I don't know if I should do it ... your dear member of the volcano though yeah yeah not [laughter] I'm just and I think that one was anonymous um well this one was anonymous is that what I'm thinking I think there's a lot I just kind of I mean if you listen and that's\nWe've got a tragedy going on down on the coast and I wanted to reiterate that little thing and it's a very serious situation lots of people in harm's way and so you're really nervous about this well\nI'm going to go out on a limb and I'm going to say that the writer of this poem\nIs doing this from their hearts I Believe that I Am not in a mocking way\nNo okay well and I mean poetry is a form of art you know so I it's just an act or way to express\nYourself a someone's arch that they created they're very proud of ...

by by one Ninety nine\nThirty three and interview coming up friday with millennia Trump\nI'm really looking forward to that actually just because I said I didn't watch the uh the little clip that was like a preview of the interview but I did read some of the transcript they had in the article and they asked her point blank about Trump's infidelity yeah apparently this is going to be on ABC or\nShe's speaking out on a variety of issues when a subject rather in this interview um\nShe was asked about the state of her marriage about her husband in today\nObjects rather in this interview um\nShe was asked about the state of her marriage about her husband's infidelity and her view is on the me too movement\nShe's asked why she wore the I really don't care do you jacket\nI'll be curious to hear her answer on that too they made a whole new story about it and\nUh she wore that to visit immigrant children who had been separated at the border\nAnd uh\nApparently this is ABC News chief national affairs correspondent\nTom ... is that his name Tom Llamas\nSat down with her during her um recent trip to Africa but this is her in only her\nAnd we haven't gotten in their view like that with millennia I'm Sorry the first lady Ryan quite a while so uh that will be interesting\nTo see yeah 'cause she's always usually pretty she handles herself well anyways and so it will be ah I don't feel like it'll be a really intimate one on one kind of pulling back the curtain if you will\nDo you think they're going to be fair\nWell I mean I I don't see see I don't see them being unfair with her just because the optics look really bad money is not really that a source of controversy I mean the jacket I think and and the times that she wore heels to visit some to get on the plane to go visit cell emergency you know\nI mean it was a master's island or something Harvey in yeah I bet she ended up putting on finish I was a stupid but all that to say she hasn't really been a Sarah controversy I Can't imagine them really pushing hard on her I think it would make them look really bad and I think they have enough sense to know\nBetter than to do that yeah well I I I actually saw\nNumbers from the M R C which is the media research sooner you know they go and they do different studies on whatever's going on in the mainstream media or they reviewed\nEvery single evening news story about Donald Trump on ABC CBS and NBC between June\nFirst in September third\nOr which accounted for just under two thousand minutes of air time\n[noise] and the overall coverage this is what their study produced the overall coverage was Ninety two percent negative and news stories involving Trump were primarily focused on five topics the Russia investigation immigration\nThe nomination of Kavanaugh\nNorth Korea and Donald Trump's relationship with Vladimir ... well that was a five topics that consumed Ninety two percent of their coverage\nI'm Sorry a hundred percent of their coverage Ninety two which were negative across the board\nHey so you know from what I understand and you've got to talk about politics every day either of you do the old school after high school what do you
