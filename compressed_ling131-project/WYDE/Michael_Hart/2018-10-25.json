[noise]\nA Trump warned that made it this is Jared ... more than the media tonight he's he was saying if the negative coverage it doesn't improve we should expect more tax\nThat's what he said that the president says rally last night a\nTrump is turning these assassination attempt as a means to blame the media for attacks and taking a swipe at mobs this is political it's using it as a means\nOf a fence and it's disgusting\nThat was really hard to follow I Wonder if uh Brian Williams is going to claim he got one [laughter] I was there when the bomb was if you use that himself\nRight right um Anderson Cooper he made no mention of an explosive device than to his building this building behind me he's standing in front of the CNN building the headquarters of CNN News organization he routinely a taxi called reporters the enemy of the American people yet he said it's the media's\nFault\nAh ah who else who else and Jim Robert\nSaid it's the media's fault\nAh ah who else two outs and\nJim Robertson and in rally my ... like you know buddy tweet I Can't understand anybody's tweet\nTrump makes and Trump takes no responsibility for the hostile political environment instead points the finger at opponents in the news media\nAre Charlie wars all truly amazing that it's become a common straight faced tactic on the right during times of potential political violence to direct and blamed towards the press and then whip up hostility\nTowards them now let's just take a look back to the political violence that we dealt with\nJust recently are nearing the Trump Administration\nIt's always come from the left and then let's look at blaming the media in part for that violence well\nA lot of comparisons are being made to the the not the less violence with antifa or\nPoor patrons of restaurants getting chased out and screen that and even assaulted in some cases by the way I saw\nA video and I don't have a lot of contacts do it with a black man standing in a restaurant wearing a make America great again hat and some racist white liberal got up in his face and started screaming at him and knocked his handlers has had it it's still happening it's not just to politicians is to regular people\nI have to go back outside of those instances in and think about the\nBaseball field shooting where ah in in Sarah Huckabee Sanders made this coming earlier how nobody blamed Bernie Sanders for that because he was an avid Bernie Sanders supporter and even volunteered for the campaign at one point\nUm that's much more dangerous than fake bombs\nThis guy almost killed Steve skull lease and try to kill others and was fortunately not able to do so\nI started digging into that revisiting some old articles in just trying to get a feel of what the reaction from Democrats were when people would suggest that Democrats\nAnd or Bernie Sanders was to blame\nFor this shooting for their rhetoric against Trump or or or Republicans talking about how dangerous Republicans are and and forcing people to take action\nAnd almost a self defense type of mode saying I've got to do something to them or they do something to me 'cause that's the way people's mind for proactive so I found a clip of Nancy Pelosi at a press conference talking about that issue when it's brought up by a reporter in the room\nWell\nI guess I'm going to the tune that audio little them and I don't even have poured them well that's a serious problem\nAll right I feel like a domino so excited about that just write one ... are here we go drag him\nOn his ... Israel it's left seeing as\nWell I think that your question is an excellent one and I think that the comments made by my Republican colleagues are\nOutrageous beneath the dignity of the jobs that they hold an eighth of dignity and respect that we would like Congress to command how dare they say such a thing how dare they so this sick individual\nDoes something despicable and it was horrible what he did hateful\nBy for them to all of a sudden the sanctimonious as if they don't never seen such a thing before\nAnd I don't even want to go into the president of the United states but in terms of some of the language that he has used so again I I like to go there another day but since you asked how could they possibly say such as first of all the timing of it all\nEverybody is so sad so concerned so coming together you know let us all take a step back examine our own conscience see what a um\nNegative attitudes we can all to tail but the sanctimonious it all really really what do you use\nNegative attitudes we can all to tail but the sanctimonious that all really really what do you think that you think it's strange how you think it's strange that him dead\nPraying pass all of that all of this that they would start saying let's had this conversation another day okay\n[laughter] maybe maybe names and below there was a bad example because she's so hard to follow right I'm like what did you just say but she was saying it was so absurd it's so horrible for Republicans to say that the the political environment\nOn the left of the rhetoric was a responsible in any way for them baseball field shooting it's absurd how could you say such a thing I think we all need to come together examine ourselves in any negative vibes that we're giving out\nAnd go from there and not blame of political party and you don't ask don't run the place yeah could you imagine\nA Democrat and coming out and saying those things right now no I'm saying you know what this is not the time to place for politics but it's not the time in a place to to to blame Trump for all of this we need to examine ourselves and see where we're at in this this political\nClimate I think both sides to do that and for the reasons I said earlier the last thing in the world either side wants to do in this as jump to conclusions and then you look like an idiot in the ... one of those two things will happen somebody at the end of all of this is going to be looking like an idiot and ... and who knows who told me\nIt's going to be a whole bunch of beyond I don't want it to be me and it won't be okay you're on the right side of his hundred homes faster than bake\nBomb a thon twenty Eighteen stay with me Jessica ... is a burst hey\nYo la all fall on that thought I'll be ...\nYou joining fake bombs on twenty deem\nOkay um they're absolutely fake and I can tell you I'm that\nWhen somebody is building a ball they build it for a specific purpose\nYou can be a terrorist you can be it could have a grudge sexual is targeting specific person and\nIf those bombs tires on them and you send them through the mail how do you set that time how do you know when the bomb was getting close proximity\nRight and as we talked about and not black and all that work at the post post office U S P s yeah but sometimes and and I admitted that the post office has done a lot better these days and they used to sometimes you just don't know when the package is going to get there especially I mean\nNot not even a tie you don't know the time you know the date you can make in the gumption but you have no idea\nFor that bomb you know if you're if you're trying to\nKill the Wiffle ball\nIt's a package fall it's got to have a switch so when you open it explodes if you're going to put a timer on it you're going to a place that bomb in an area where you know there's got to be a lot of people at a specific times and it's got to go off and say and\nSay maximum damage yeah and in that the things with these people received these former politicians received you know we call those things\nWe call it a clock right he told me it was yeah right\nRight so so it's it's it's a start\nYeah I don't know\nIt was yeah right right so so it's it's it's a start yeah\nYeah I don't know who well obviously the person's not bombing um we had bomb makers they are a real bomb maker they have their their bomb in search sickness\nAnd they have specific ways that they build those bombs from buffalo if he's the Unabomber as an example she created his fall out of ... and you know just the materials that you can find around them and when the FBI\nIs investigating a bomber they will look at how that bomb was disrupted and they will figure out this person's quote unquote signature this is how they built of rice and from what I'm gathering from what's being reported\nThere being mail I might you might as well this mail them a clock at a couple of players and a battery in a box wrap it up and take spray painted laugh it off you go\nRight ... and I when I'm getting from you is is bomb makers also think a lot of pride in in their adult so exactly we're not going to just do that you're not going to see this kind of bomb coming from someone who's dedicated to getting more arms to people just judging by how many Vincent\nThey're going to build them they're going to test them and they're going to make sure they work and sometimes they blow themselves up doing that um but like a trouble maker is good for the perfect or craft and then they're going to take action\nYeah I imagine it if it can't be their first time putting together a ... if this is the route may took ... the the targets they picked out you can't tell me this is like one time bomb maker you know if we do have a legit perpetrator here\nThis can't be just one time and hey here's the thing maybe this is where they're going with trying to pin this on a Republican and thanks Keith I'm Sorry they ... they may be saying that the\nReason the boundaries so poorly built is because the Republican putting them to gather was in such a hurry because he had to get to work\nNo right because we have jobs have jobs went on to protest that job and not only ... only ... the ones in jobs not bomb okay I like that shark bay\nHey what's going on anybody oh I just found out some very interesting information about all this you know Hillary is kind of been kicked off to the spot\nAfter losing presidential race just try to get back with all of our friends are democratic friends so she thought what can I Do I Know\nI didn't

time what what can I remember like\nNick is on the ground but I Know that sort of growth okay let me ask you that you're here we had an email earlier than they were saying that the bombs were made in various shapes um to resemble certain things and one of the claims was that one of the bombs has made on to resemble the evening day and do you have any idea what that is\nIt shapes um to resemble certain things and one of the claims was that one of the bombs was made on to resemble the evening day and do you have any idea what that is that\nEvening dang [laughter] and I don't I don't at all\nI don't have the first is that like a I don't we don't know it's I don't know well it said\nIt said that was made to resemble a female buzz and an evening dang yeah and I thought\nYou know what I mean I Know we don't know what it means that I tried to look it up and I still got nothing\nI just trying to put it together in a sentence to see if I could give contacts to it you know we have a nice night started off with a female bonds and indeed within the evening day\nAfraid to say that allowed one of one of those things that like Urban Dictionary and\nI I can assure you that I look that up and it was not anywhere in the Urban Dictionary so you're free to say it it it means something to someone um but we're not sure what that is that's\nAsk your girlfriend if she would enjoy an evening dang yeah join her yeah that's a great idea I just I I don't think I Want that showing up on a screen shot later [laughter]\n\nOr you can even say like you know what I'm really in the mood for just an

somebody gets their face blown off or you can lead retract no longer fake bombs on real yeah\nWe've talked about that because no one's gotten hurt yet none of the bombs have actually detonated that's the only reason why we can sit here and talk about the different considerations are theories of what this could be otherwise we wouldn't be\nAllowed to say I'm alert to the court room there's a presumption of faking this instead of a presumption of innocence it you know it's harmless just fake until proven to be around us right\nNow we've just been talking about those theories 'cause you have to be honest it could be a complete nut job to use a Trump supporter or it could be a Democrat who's trying to make it look like it's a not Trump\nAnd watching some of Fox News coverage earlier today they were saying some of the devices didn't even have triggers so they weren't they were made to look like bomb right economically speaking they weren't even those so I don't know\nWell and yesterday we talked about it as nothing more than a theory today we've engaged in full blown fake bombs on\nAnd that's the point I'm at right more went so far with it and now I'm just like that I I I Can't buy everything it's just you ... you saw Joe Biden gets gets two packages intercepted but two packages headed towards him and then Robert De Niro\nI just want Maxine Waters drop and jumping off

they said\nIt may come out and apologized you automatically give to them bet you meant what she's\nBeen in reference to a costume or a Ambien tweet or whatever the case may be\nSo right whenever you want your vets it when you give the left the apology that they're asking for you tell the lip yes I'm racist you caught me when it's just a tongue in cheek statement that not meant the arm of salt yeah and that really that's all I got man I Wish\nPeople would open up and stick by their gun by say something and it gets misinterpreted by ... by what they meant when they said it and not have a\nGood point blank Jeff as all got thank you\nThere you go nuts it it just exactly right and I'm Glad you brought that up when you apologize when when the lap comes out and tells you you've done something wrong and it makes you a racist or whatever when you count down you apologize\nIf if you got something like you got a TV show or whatever and you're apologizing because you're scared of the backlash\nApologizing is actually what's going to cost you all those things right cause and he said you admit guilt you admit that you you were a racist or whatever the case is and then you are done at that point\nNo apologies don't do it back after this\nWith Andrew in just a\nFew like sitting around the board your dinner table sharing stories were friends that's what we like to do here at our

today\nTo refer Julie sweating Nick and Michael ... to the Justice Department to be criminally investigated for making possible false statements during the confirmation process of judge Kavanaugh\nWhile yeah listen I'm I'm Glad to see this happened this is the only thing that's going to deter future events like this from happening again\nHe said when a well meaning citizen comes forward with information relevant to the committee's work and I take it seriously it takes courage to come forward especially with allegations of sexual misconduct or purses personal trauma\nI'm grateful for those who find that courage but in the heat of partisan moments some do try to knowingly mislead the committee that's unfair to my colleagues the nominees and others providing information who are seeking the truth\nIt stifles our ability to work on legitimate lines of inquiry it also waste time and resources for destructive reads in\nOh no ... not as in trouble again how man and he says he's not a shady attorney he said in a tweet it is ironic that Senator Grassley now is interested in investigations he didn't care when it came to putting a man on the Supreme Court for life\nWe welcome the investigation as now we can finally get to the bottom of judge Kavanaugh's ... wives and conduct truth be known\nOkay we can finally get to the bottom line right so like the FBI investigated him or anything that big of an times circus\nYeah there was investigation there was investigations by the committee there was testimonial cry and stuff but he seems to think there wasn't
