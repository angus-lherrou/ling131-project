terrible thing\nBut uh we wouldn't be really hurting ourselves would be hurting our companies would be hurting our jobs and uh so we'll see what happens when I should have a pretty good for a couple of seconds I should have a pretty good report versus\nJust involved on her comments about the nationalist leader is concerned if you are sending coded language or a dog whistle to some Americans out there that when you really need as much of a white nationalist\nI'm never even heard of that I cannot imagine the UV violent nationalism I never heard the series about being a national is I've heard of mall\nWhen I'm somebody that loves our country when I see a nationalist I don't like it when you're least paying one percent of GDP for NATO\nAnd we're paying for point three percent I don't like that that's not fair I don't like it when as an example we're protecting a hero\nAnd we're paying for almost the entire cost of that we're paying for a very very substantial fortune forms\nWhere to than what it should have a we have great respect for those countries but on top of that I don't like it when they put up barriers to our farms where farmers get not sell in Europe they have trade barriers and stuff and they could you guys know better than anybody than trade barriers that are as severe\nAs China's trade barriers which we coming down they want to make a deal very badly for the coming there\nBut I Am very proud of our country we cannot continue to allow what's happening to our country to continue I think can't let it happen so I'm proud I'm proud of our country and I am a nationalist is the word that has been used too much\nIs is whenever route I think it should be brought back I'm somebody that wants to help other countries of the world\nBut I also have to say we have to take care of our country we cannot continue to allow ourselves to be due diligence and also to address with the European Union as an example\nLast year on trade lost one hundred and fifty one million dollars on top of that we lost hundreds of billions of dollars on protection and so we protect and we get to know\nWe we do the training and they get killed typically I Want to be here so I Want them to open their borders I Want them to make it fair for our farm is our our companies are medical companies they sell medical equipment they just put restrictions on\nAnd I spoke to him last name and I spoke to the day before and speak to them all the time [noise] and they say and you know this as well as anybody over the course of the year over the course of a number of years they've intercepted many people\nFrom the middle east they've intercepted ISIS they've intercepted also it's just the\nSame intercepted good ones in Bethlehem David set the wonderful people for the middle east and they just shut the bad ones they've intercepted wonderful people from South America and from other parts\nFurther south they intercepted a lot of different people but among the people they've intercepted very recent there are people from the middle east okay\nSo you can't be surprised when you hear it you've heard that before it happens all the time and I spoke to literally last night I spoke to another one this morning very good relationship with border patrol and I ... and they said it happens all the time but in the middle east but it's not even saying bad or what's the real bad ones\nBut there was a senator and the ... and they could very well be that there's no\nThere's no proof of anything there's no proof of anything that's what they could very well be if you look at what that was building and they were talking about five or six thousand people I'm pretty good at estimating grad size as you've probably and figure it out you tend to get a\nLittle bit off the real number last night as an example\nI was a record setting southwest nothing but they don't want to talk about that but\nWill tell you let me just say that I rarely I Believe that that was really very it was that was pretty impressive by any standard and these are great people and uh and by the way you vote for senator vote is a and this could be\nThat was pretty impressive by any standard and these are great people and uh and by the way you vote\nVote is a and this could be\nBad or indifferent for Democrats or Republicans but the amounts of voting is a level that they've never seen before for her the other day and uh [noise]\nI don't know whether it's supposed to say that's good or bad but I Will tell you or your mouth to people voting is that the levels that are that you've never seen that terms a record level by a lot um so I think I think very I think it was a very good jazz honestly that that you have\nPeople in there I also think there's a very good chance that over the course of a third of job you have for they don't have to necessarily be in that good\nBut certainly you have people coming up through the southern border from the middle east and other places that are not appropriate for our country and Tom not letting them and they're not coming in\nRight they're not coming in what did he do whatever we after they're not coming and going to do if you're not going to try to get to know now that you're comfortable arms to drive a I'm a very non political person and that's why I got elected president\nDo you hear about the science by that he used to live for a lot of that nature that\nPresident Hernandez when President Trump asked me to call the president of Honduras who this man was initiated in front of me that he can organized by leftist groups\nIn Honduras they're being financed in part by Venezuelan and stuff in foreign eyes by human traffickers who have no regard for human life organized by dangerous gang members moving people north when I spoke to president morale and\nI'm a and brought them all and informed me that they were already busing\nPeople in the in the care of and back who had been left behind by the side of the road elderly vulnerable families simply left behind ... people need to understand the people that are driving this caravan north of challenge our sovereignty to challenge our borders\nAre doing so without any regard for human life\nGun and doing it to invent a some political statement or in the face of human traffickers\nStrictly ... worth of work for the financial profit and the president's absolutely determined\nUse all means reduce disposal organizer wants them to have Mexico to turn this caravan around and and work with Congress or to close loopholes human traffickers use every day to entice vulnerable families to make this dangerous criminals I really\nThink that what this really shows\nIs that you have to change the laws\nIs having the very highly respected Democratic senators behind me but we have to do something that we all agree with we have to change the only ones we have to make them much different\nThey're very soft and it's a different time Julie different time\nWhere that could have been appropriate but we have to have immigration laws now that are suitable so this time and work and the ones that we have now are old and they don't work they don't work and they don't come close to work and we need protection we have to have an\nAnd we've been building the wall was sort of the wall San Diego's almost completed the whole area that whole area of California but\nWe uh we want to do it quickly we don't have we don't want to take years to do it but I I really believe that\nThe way of California but we uh we want to do it quickly we don't have we don't want to take years to do it but I I really believe that and I think that [noise] I don't see any things\nThat kind of an asset when you look at what's happening when you're looking at a heartache on both sides because it really is it's hard work on both sides but when you look at ten thousand people 'cause I don't believe that was my passion I think it was much more than five thousand people but when you look at a massive group of people on the bridge when you saw it on the bridge grew\nI really think that it probably spells out to us and Congress something has to do that\nYou can have this something has to be done so in that way I think maybe it's going to be a good food and sick [noise]\nWe're gonna see we're telling our military will have to call up our military if you need to\nBut we can't let this happen we cannot allow our country to be violated like this and it's very unfair people are waiting on line\nThat went through a legal system of immigration and they've been going through it and for many years and then worked hard they've done everything they're supposed to do and then people just come loaded\nIt's really unfair to the millions of people that are waiting in line to come in legally into our country is very unfair you going to just do\nYou see any argument Mr President for time to improve conditions in those countries fighting not decreasing aid but perhaps to maintain and when I heard that argument\nBefore but it hasn't worked for a long time those countries I Want to improve the conditions in our country I Want to improve the conditions you know part of that condition and approving the condition is we are doing so well\nSo many companies are coming in I spoke with the prime minister Rabin very recently and he informed me that we have five major car companies coming back yeah I'd say you have to do something you have to balance it out because it's like a one way street the great imbalance Houston still different between\nAs an example Japan just one Japan and the United states\nUh we have Foxconn coming and they make the phones for what happened or they do a lot of work to do a lot of work for everybody and they're coming they're opening up in this country we have a lot of companies coming and\nWe need and three point seven it's the lowest in many years many decades we need great people coming in I mean one great people go I Want them to come in through the system I look at the people they were talking about I ... I really watch carefully\nAll of the networks they have to be honest with you and you're not even see in that you do you have some beautiful shots of some very good people and\nI really think that those some of those people a lot of those people I think there's a lot of talented in that group there's a lot of talent [noise] do we need people because I have problems coming into the United states they have to be able to get workers and our great even conservative people\nThat made me three four years ago would have felt differently about it they now feel we have to get people to operate these big plants and factories that are opening in the United states I Want him to come in I Want him to come in through a merit based system and I think a lot of people are going to be happy with that I Want to build our country\nI don't want to go to a Catholic countries to rebuild that is what we've done we've tried to rebuild the wild and police the world it's time to rebuild the United states and the properly police the United states and that's what we're going to do at the same time we're going to help other countries all over the world\nBut we have to focus on our country for change and that's what we're going to\nDo over a much higher there you go\nThat is all over the world that we have to focus on our country for what was going to do over\nThere you go a Donald Trump speaking at the White House just moments ago we just now got the audio for that so we're playing it for you as as everybody else is watching it and a classic drop dead stuff first of all Andrew\nJessica Jessica how are you on great ... you didn't get a proper introduction we went straight to the right to make sure we brought this to you guys poor Russell he wanted to come into the beginning of the show and I say something\nHe waited the whole time and literally just laugh like three minutes you know what I'll just come back to where I Am not thought really bad I mean he waited for so long to\nMe and we got a lot of stuff to get do today but off the top from what we just listened to I Want to start\nThe hash tag ... I Am a nationalist\nAnd I want to kill all to tweet that hash tag I'll read tweets or whatever we gotta do to get that has been going I've already put it on Twitter and Andrew maclean who but I'm Glad the president has come out and said I Am a nationalist I Love this country I Want to put\nYou're trying to get back to the game\nTo ... wow okay figure it out the system\nOr ... was most recently deported five months ago for the sixth time\nOut of Birmingham, Alabama another\nPreviously to board the illegal alien thirty six year old job raise\nJob or race job to job\nJob job you know from Joe I'm trying to add some minor sad or tell little spin a\nVisual the ras has joined the caravan as well he said quote it's time for me to go back to the United states it's a country where I can live my life unlike Guatemala\nSo they just get to try again it's not just Hondurans and this caravan\nThat are looking for a better life as this thing about the problem we have with people south of the border trying to illegally cross into our country and then they see this giant caravan\nCome through their town and they've already got ambitions to do it again what\nDo you think they're going to do well here's my chance I can hide in the crowd\nOr do you think MS Thirteen say it right here's my chance what do you think ah drug smugglers are saying here's my chance just blend in just blend in they can't stop all of us this is my chance to get back in to the U. S.\nThat's exactly what is going on south of the border not to mention the the the children\nThat are a part of this and we've already given you some stance on who's who and they're saying the children and what they're going through I I don't have an exact number on how many children but there are several images coming out because the mainstream media of doing what they can to pull up your heartstrings\nOn this and saying you know we gotta let 'em in Japan and look at it and filling out the emotional side of the\nWill just look at it are these children\nAre going through some horrible conditions it's Ninety two hundred degree degrees on this track I'm looking at photos of of children that are blistered and I'm Talking children that are one year older last\nYear saying from the sun Gloucester I I guess I'm I'm looking at to some sort of I don't know if this is a Red Cross worker or some sort of magic in in Mexico there's applying what looks like me a spore\nInto these areas or other kids that are waiting on cardboard and towels on the hundred degree concrete kids are pouring sweat I mean everything from babies to six seven year old kids and\nUh they're just\nTell them along with him and I'm looking at some images where it's painfully obvious that this baby does not belong to that person and why I say that this because I'm looking at a kid who's got a gold chain hanging off his neck\nSagging pants backwards hat to other guys look just like him are standing in front of what looks to be a six month old child or laying on the ground and I saw that picture\nI hate to to to profile here but if we're just being real this guy doesn't look like a loving\nIn on the ground yeah I saw that picture and I hate to to to profile here but if we're just being real this guy doesn't look like a loving father trying to take a six month old too man that's not to fill out either no is horrible horrible images coming from a\nCaravan and then\nYou want a little extra to add on to this y'all heard of hurricane Willa which is a category for it's hitting the shores of Mexico right now\nHurricane Willa is headed straight and if the scary and continue to go\nIt's going to hit straight where this caravan is unless they stopped him at tracks which we don't have hurricanes works to deal with nasty whether\nThey're going to run right in to this hurricane hurricane Ike a cat for y'all that's what a wasn't Michael a hurricane for when it hit yeah\nThat's the kind of hurricane that's hitting the shore to Mexico and advantages straight for the caravan or at least the caravans\nPat it's just meant is that the whole thing is so jacked up then out so well this is kind of related to but it was watching Fox News and I'm drift Jenkins are you familiar with him on the news he was doing a segment I think this morning on Fox and friends\nAnd he went back in play the video for them where they caught a boat or a raft full of people\nCrossing the border when they saw drift Jenkins they started ... when the other way we write the other side and just stood there on the bank and we like nothing was going All right just like when you're ... played the clip is from Fox News this morning um Fox and friends from today check this out\nYour morning guys that's right the caravan seven thousand strong is a head it this way there about eleven hundred and forty miles due south of mckell and this is the closest nearest port of entry to they could cross\n... where they're going to go California Arizona here but this will be the shortest route and that's why so many Hondurans Guatemalans Salvadorans come here but unfortunately most come income a legally yesterday we late in the bushes and wait and we busted one of those smuggling operations watch\nWho did not even to push waiting to witness one of these crossings encouraging him just like\n... percent or direct the crocodile hunter ...\nHow to be here and it's natural habitat and it was right now [noise]\nMy crocodile hunter um impression was weak I thought it was spot on you know you have to\nSee [noise] can you just kind of\nUser [laughter]\nWe tried to cross in America [noise]\nAround all day\nGrave Jenkins this contest again\nGo back and yelling like scares me learn excuse me sir just have a question for you may have seen your documentation [laughter]\nSo we're witnessing now is clearly a family that was being brought over by that smuggler there was paddling in a raft this is a a\nAn attempt to legally cross incidents have gone back over there we seem to fold this attempt but officials tell us that he's probably just gonna look for another five you know it's a legal crossing yes\nYes now this right here in in this this family is going to be a different situation because they've got there's three it looks like three women with uh\nYes now this right here in in this this family is going to be a different situation because they've got there's three it looks like three women with a with a child a very small child and they've been detained by border patrol\nNow the this is a profound with somebody who can go to a port of entry and say I'm scared and receive at least a court date from an immigration judge to to go and plead their case but as they've been detained by border patrol grub Jenkins is talking to them\nOr I mean why why why did you come is where I'm asking you\n\nTo join me why you can't really has this ...\nUnder under what conditions there [noise] it's a laptop where it came to our cache um\nThe criminals always uh [noise]\nGet Giovanni so there's a there's grip Jenkins reporting now again that's a little bit of a different situation but you do have to ask yourself\nYou know what kind of danger where they put in and if they cross illegally they were helped out by coyotes or you know ... or whatever\nAnd what kind of danger did they put themselves in as being three women and they put that child in when we're trying to to do this the right way and we got a lot of improvements to make on on our immigration system and who we let in and out of the country\nBut a net right there seems like\nPeople that aren't dangerous but who's to say who else came with them and and didn't get caught by border patrol the people that smuggled them up there are obviously criminals and where did they go did they go back home or did they continue to cross the border and they go back to get some more right\nIt's a bad bad situation but uh that's what we're looking out on the border right now plenty on that front to talk about also I Want to talk about the rally last night in taxes it was huge like we said it was going to be\nA almost brings tears to your eyes to see that many people that fired up about the money is tournaments
