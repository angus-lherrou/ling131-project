for questions or they have to\nLet it happen and then they send it right back to uh the studios to the stations and stuff so if there's anything that comes out of that will do it it's a Donald Trump is answering questions from the press always entertaining\nSo I thought if there was really be something in there we could definitely\nDefinitely bring it to you but if anything happens will a woman and a half and he's already held a press conference today\nAs you know by now Nikki Haley resigning at the end of the year as the UN ambassador\nThat is uh something that really had no controversy attached to it which I bought was was crazy yeah and uh she seems to be going on on on good terms she set the date that she's gone and and ah that'll happen that gives the administration time to\nTo find a replacement and make a smooth transition at the beginning of two dom Nineteen and here we go we go so we got a dog and a lot of other stuff first of all just how were you\nThinking for

went downhill fairly quickly honey why are these people so angry listen now to know that was not the response I got she started yelling and hollering at it was Morning Joe and uh as they're talking about Kavanaugh still and saying you know\nBasically saying that Trump came out and said he was innocent and he's not an assassin and there was all these you know credible allegations blah blah blah and she's like you\nKnow it's Syria and then START I thought we should look through your high school yearbook\nHow would you like that it's just like that and I was like I got so overwhelmed that I'd change the channel\nHave you ever been\nTo throw the first stone he's I think she got really\n... you can't let these people get under your skin I mean this is really just an experiment I'm watching this just to kind of hear what the other side is saying you just can't take him seriously it's ridiculous but um and I get it if you don't spend that much time watching MSNBC\nBecause this happened to me when I first started watching it I got so enraged sometimes I had to change the channel and that still happens from time to time\nBut it's so ridiculous the crap that they say that it you know the average person would become and writes watching it\nYou've got the devil's triangle written all over you got the devil's triangle and you're\nRight [noise] ... the next time and I thought about it this morning I Wish I'd videotape that's the next time she's in the room I'm gonna cut it on and I'm gonna start videotaping and see what kind of gold we believe it will be good\n\nMaybe I should just

I think I'm I I I get rub the wrong way more with the women\nThat are that ... brag about it they're like for instance breastfeeding activist\nLike it'd be breastfeeding public or whatever that's fine you got to do it in a way it's not a big deal but like if your Instagram pages full of\nPhotos of you breastfeeding white that's what gets on my nerves like stop it there's no need to do that if it's so natural why are you acting like it's some big accomplishment why acting like a you\nKnow you you've save the world because you're you're breastfeeding on your Instagram well\nI mean that's just maybe it's just the way to be proud you know not a not everyone can dress states and maybe they're proud of the fact that they were able to be successful at that it's annoying I Know I don't disagree with you at all because they didn't say a word while he was in here I don't know if it really understand what he was doing in there it's clicking stuff okay when we got that they can they land in here now\nMake millions in there to fix it is that I have and none of it I got to get to some news in since uh our our phones are jacked up for the time being or I can do that\nNow first of all want to start with hurricane Michael's path\nIt's uh on the way to the Florida Panhandle the latest [noise] uh uh ... what do you call it the latest forecast I guess you could say\nThat I saw shows this thing going up about the same place we we talked about yesterday which was the panhandle with Panama City about rain in the middle of it and then sort of\nHooking off to the right once it gets on land I said the right the east\n... which were then put it back over\nSouth Carolina North Carolina it's it ... you hope for those people that that's not the case although it would dramatically reduce in in you know\nIt would ... it would reduce its hurricane status and it would be severe weather but after what those guys went through you hate to see that happen but\nIt is currently unless this change to category two hurricane and it's ... to have wins sustained\nAround a hundred and ten miles an hour which\nIs not good not good for the storm surge that they have to deal with the water\nComing from the ocean on to land mixed with the rain is already coming down nasty nasty stuff so that should be making landfall ... they've been saying mid week so I guess tomorrow and Thursday as women\nWill see the worst worst parts of it and we have to sit and wait and see how that's going to affect us I obviously depending on which way this thing hoax or whatever will directly impact impact us in central and north Alabama so we will keep our eye on it also the Nikki Haley stuff\nA write off the bat everybody started sweating what's the controversy wise Nikki Haley resigning\nThere has to be some new there has to be\nNice to meet that story actually wasn't the the the biggest part of that story was the fact that she\nAnd Donald Trump\nKept a secret for apparently about six month which is notable really and in the ... and any administration one of the fact that it was just between those two I assumed that it was only between those two that's how it was able to to be kept secret that we know neither one of them\nAnd any administration one of the fact\nThat it was just between those two I assume that it was only between those two that's how it was able to to be kept secret\nThat we know neither one of them are the Lakers right that's the problem is that all of the nation\nRight so ah she basically says listen I Want to make sure Donald Trump has got the most\nUh able bodied person strongest person in this position and I I Believe in term limits and I just think it's run its course you know I got kids I think she's got a Seventeen year old daughter and maybe a Fifteen year old son or something like that it's an ... you know when you're the UN ambassador you don't get to be homeless you\nKnow and you talk about Fifteen and Seventeen I that's the age when as a parent you really that'd be paying attention\nSo it's a it's a definitely a loss for the administration but uh it gives Donald Trump the opportunity to one out\nWent up by Nikki Haley and saying you know here's somebody that's just as good or better it's gonna be toms shoes to fill there's no doubt about it\nBut there are people out there that I I feel can do is go to the job is Nikki Haley it she did a fantastic job as UN ambassador the tough talk coming from her the fact that you've got a woman in that position where you're dealing with countries that that view woman as a woman is lesser beings\nI think it speaks volumes I think it gives us a great advantage in places like the UN and and another thing I was thinking is that we're making this announcement because they have like a a\nA they had the press pool in there in the oval office while Trump and Nikki Haley made this announcement even though the news is already broken [noise]\nI couldn't help but think this is a woman in a very very powerful position\nAnd she was put there by Donald Trump a guy that she did not support in the twenties sixteen election she endorsed Marco Rubio and and hated the wage Trump was running his campaign now\nShe got the opportunity to be UN ambassador she's bought into what Donald Trump is doing did a fantastic job but the fact that Donald Trump does that are outside of of people that were enemies during the campaign in bringing them in and letting given them shot to to you know\nRebuild that relationship is the fact that he put a woman in that position I think that was fantastic and obviously she's not ... it's not out of the norm to put a woman in that position you think the Samantha Power\nOr from the Obama administration but still\nSamantha power's had nothing on Nikki Haley in how tough she was when she got out there because it was like usa not taken a crap we're not playing by your stupid UN rules that are absurd and we're going to stand up for Israel no matter what else to say we're going to stand up for Israel your your your\nA man for the people more and more Alabama's stories go to yellow hammer news dot com line Jay Homa [noise]\nString the whole family out there

Michael coming to shore on the Florida Panhandle also talked about Nikki Haley resigning as UN ambassador effective at the end of the year\nGood thing or none of us want to see Nikki Haley go but it's good that she is a giving that kind of noticed it gives the White House time\nAgain they they made it seem\nAs if they had talked about it for a while when this was something that was in the hopper for maybe six months or so and she finally decided to go public go public with it um\nIs a strange move\nBefore the uh the mid term but I I think the saving grace there is the fact that she says she's going to stick it out until the end of the year and I think that minimizes political damage or hurt coming out there and doing it in that fashion opposed to just letting her go over Twitter or whatever the case is\nThat also saves face because they both seemed to be on the same page and the fact that it didn't get leaked at all because it was a apparently just between those two also

she she would come back and say I'm just talking about fighting the Trump Administration was in D.C standing firm yeah but that's not how other people take it people that do have these violent tendencies these people that are a rioting and beating people up in the street and all that stuff\nThey see that as an approval or not of approval CERN yeah and it's only going to continue to get worse as we allow these Democrats and former failed presidential candidates to say those things\nAnd whip people up into a frenzy\nWell she basically said this is all the time to be civil which I think implies a lie yeah I don't know how she really skirt around that\nWell you saw the video of Brian kill made a being harassed on the subway not you know I didn't yeah he was on the subway and there were the people behind them screaming hey everybody this is Brian kill me it is a mouthpiece for the president and he says racist stuff and\nDangerous things so and so forth and and you know there's no reason Bryan killed made by all accounts is a very nice guy and well liked guy in the circles and yet you've got a couple of ... that are following him around\nHarassing him and he's trying to do is ride the subway to work around home or whatever it's unacceptable\nHarassing him and he's trying to do is ride the subway to work right at home or whatever\nIt's unacceptable in every sense of the word they the the two guys apparently there were a couple of comedians they got a lot of backlash for that video and eventually took it down but the fact that he's having to go through that like you don't deserve that\nCan you imagine ethnic ... had to experience something like that that would take over their entire newscasts next\nMorning yeah imagine the riot act in like the left does an average conservatives their their MO was to go out here and harassed these a liberal commentators or politicians or whatever it would be the end of the world\nAbsolutely what they'd be all we hear about twenty four seven\nThese people are straight up out of their mind and the more we win and will continue to win the more they lose their mind I saw one story out of uh Vancouver, Washington Washington state where a guy was at a bar he was drinking\nAnd then he decided at the end of the night he was going to take over home didn't think he was in the shape to drive\nLeaves his car there and then goes back the next day the next morning to pick it up\nAnd it was burnt to Chris in vandalized because he had stickers or something of a sort that showed his support for Donald Trump so that's why I don't think that they spray painted Trump on the side of his uh his truck\nBusted out on the windows and literally burned the car that's ... you can see the the picture of it here I'll show you\nThat says Trump\nOh my gosh and he went back to the bar the next morning thinking hands can pick up my truck and there it is\nAnd it's not like you can't say oh well he you know something may have malfunction in his car burst into flames now they spray painted all over it to make it clear that\nThey burned his truck to the ground because he is a Trump supporter that's what we're dealing with that's that's how these people conduct themselves\nAnd again as I said earlier Rand Paul was on a radio show today\nAnd he says this is this is getting bad somebody's going to get assassinated yeah and there's already been those attempts\n... first person you think of a ... a little of that and the other guys that were involved now here's what he said he said I really worry that someone is going to be killed and that those who are ratcheting up the conversation\nMay have to realize that they bear some responsibility if this elevates to violence well I I have to push back on Rand Paul there it's already escalated to violence were already there\n[noise] he said these people are these are people that are unstable we don't want to encourage\nThem we have to somehow ratcheted down and say we're not encouraging them that violence is ever okay\nCome on\nHe said I think that what people need to realize is when people like Cory Booker say get up in their face he may think that's okay but what he doesn't realize is that for about every one thousand people\nPeople who might want to get up in your face one of them is going to be an stable enough to commit\nViolence right you don't wanna step that fire you know\nExactly All right let's ah squeeze a couple of calls them before the break and then we got emails coming up standards for several Stan\nHey good afternoon [noise] uh when we used the phrase\nAnd as for several stand hey good afternoon\n[noise] ...\nAh when we used the phrase is make America great again or I Want my country back\nThis that's going on is what it sounds like the video clips that we see in the audio clip such a play this is what is going to sell on the radical left is not just handed over to us because we win an election\nIt's going to be a ... it's going to be nasty is going to be dirty and we need to get used to it as conservative Republicans\nCosts winning elections is no longer enough we're gonna have to find a backbone in this country to take back what we say we want to take back right out if we're going to make America great a great again we're going to have to put up with a lot of crap yeah from the left Democrats and that's just the way it's going to be a will lose this country\nYeah and uh we we need to find ourselves and I are more complex and stick with it and don't want anything micro swipe and I just wanted to show that opinion which\nMight stand thanks bonding thing stand your ground Dan I sat staying home just setting emphasized the s tan thanks ... think think Penn Penn daring anybody\nHey how's it going that good um\nYeah labor I hear stuff like that and the other night this is the irradiated what will we really need to do is you have a a attorney general this actually get

in the process of trying to figure out if it if they should be taking any action against Lisa Murkowski after she voted against Brett Kavanaugh\nShe was the lone Republican\nThat voted against Kavanaugh and now that her state's GOP is looking to maybe booed her out of the party that\nTies well and she said when he came back on on the other side and said that was probably one of the worst assistance I've made was she the same or somebody who voted no on hand came back on the other side and was like I probably should have done that and I can't remember who it was it might not have been her\nOr I don't know well\nPrior to the votes here's what Murkowski said I Believe the judge Kavanaugh is a good man he is a good man he's clearly ... learn to judge but in my conscience because that's how I have to vote end of the day is with my conscience\nI cannot conclude that he has the right person\nFor the court at this time\nSo says she later announced a that she would be voting present as a courtesy to Republican senator Steve Gaines and above us\nWe know that you know should they pay or their their vote together because if it was going to cancel each other out in ... so anyway but I I hadn't heard anything about her CNN in the back side maybe she did\nI don't know if that was her or not I mean I'll Try to see if I can find it but somebody said that\nWell outside of that\nA big issue going into the mid term I think people need to pay attention to is\nA voter fraud now according to to Democrats voter fraud is nothing but a mess nothing but a fairy tale yet we see story after story report after report of voter fraud being committed\nIn South Texas a woman is arrested and I'm fired she was a stark county Democrat precinct worker\nApparently Modesto Vila who is sixty years old\nShe was taken into custody in charge with for a felony counts of illegal voting election fraud and\nPossessing a ballot or ballot envelope\nOf another person with the intent to to fraud as well as a misdemeanor charge on lawful assistance of a voter so\nAccording to the store county da's office\nThey open this investigation more than a week ago uh they said that the charges followed a probe into a complaint filed at the election administrators office it allege that Vila\nApproached an elderly voter in the border city of aroma took the voters mail in ballot for the November two thousand Eighteen election coming up\nFilled it out herself and mailed it she allegedly voted differently\nFilled it out herself and mailed it\n\nShe allegedly voted differently than the voter intended subsequently investigators with ah the da's office stopped her while driving on Thursday evening and told her award and had been issued for her arrest and she went to jail [noise]\nNow this is a a precinct worker I Am a Democrat precinct workers is literally taking advantage and I guess on absentee ballots taken advantage of\nElderly people and voting for them so if they're voting one way she says now we're going to do but I don't question the other direction instead of trying to cancel their vote out they were actually going to vote in the other direction this stuff happens and it happens all the time I imagine if\nVoter fraud wasn't the thing well when our elections like in the in ... and ... and he really knows ... what what ... what would be the result of ... we see we see more Republicans winning more often he thinks that across the board\nYou think Hillary got three million more votes or whatever it was because everything was was square and everything was fair no voter fraud work with committed\nCome home well they're still talking about that I heard MSNBC the other day talking about how we absolutely need to abolish the electoral college how it's unfair and doesn't represent a fair voting process or American\nWell how about the California DMV they wrongly quote unquote wrongly registered Fifteen hundred people including non citizens\nTo vote in\nThe November election did you say Fifteen hundred Fifteen hundred that's a lot of accidents accidentally yeah wrongly registered these people to vote\nIt's not just Maria or whatever her name was going to an elderly person's house instill in their ballot and the middle of it in for them filling out the way they want to [noise]\nIt's a a concerted effort from governments local state whatever\nTo swing elections\nThat's why certain states thought Donald Trump so hard about getting the the White House the federal government\nThe voting information so they could try and combat voter fraud swabbing fighting so hard against voter ID laws yeah there in the business of committing these acts and committing\nVoter fraud on a larger scale as they possibly can and they'll find you tooth and nail to be able to keep that ability to keep those opportunities open for voter fraud to be committed because they know it greatly benefits Democrats more than it does Republicans\nIn every case it benefits Democrats and not vice versa [noise]\nAnd then the whole thing we mentioned earlier about Taylor Swift coming out and getting political\nAnd apparently vote dot org said that nearly sixty five thousand Americans between Eighteen and twenty nine registered to vote in roughly the twenty four hours after Taylor Swift social media\nBut that doesn't I mean and I heard them talking about that a morning show this morning though like ha ha ha and people say she doesn't have any you know a effect on people well how do you know that they were registering to vote in the direction she wanted them to vote and\nRight on the order randomly or to say yay or register just because she said to\nIt very well could have been a surge of people like oh heck no and and they're run and who knows that for them to automatically\nDistrict just because she had to write it very well could have been a surge of people like oh heck no and and they're running it and who knows that for them to automatically assume that it's in favor of Taylor sweat ...\nMakes sense for one month away from the election you're obviously going to have a surge of people registering to vote you would expect am because they hear about the midterms they feel they feel like it's important and they decided to go out and get registered\nWhy it seems mosquito apocalypse is in\nFull effect and there seems to be no end in sight and I saw a picture of one of the mosquitoes and you don't want to have anything to do with the mayor was jacked up yes and they're on steroids or something yeah full well that yeah I\nFeel like you're being stab drilling and when you swatted like blood like Roman do yeah arm yet it was like an explosion of fly every now and how can you imagine a ... that's sick oh ...\nAnd when you swatted like blood like roaming do yeah um yeah it was like an explosion of flying everywhere oh can you imagine a ... that's sick\nOh gosh you know my thought the whole thing about mosquitoes\nAs you don't feel the bite so you don't smack on when they bite you because they inject a like a I'm In is that ... that is that right anyway so numbing agent basically say you don't feel what they're doing to you so but apparently this species doesn't because you can it's like you're being stabbed\nVote I vote but that it was one evil creature I agree that if we could just exterminate altogether we would be better oh yeah I don't know the purpose of it otherwise but I'm ... story number three\n[noise] that bad huh\nAnd listen oh okay I'm going to be really honest the the weird news today was was difficult sometimes bountiful today it wasn't and I really I was having a hard time in fact it was almost two o'clock before I finally got all the stories together I Know that sounds ridiculous but it takes a minute so I was kinda forced into this All right\nAnd it's just about fashion that's the only reason why even\nBringing this giant can't be that bad in home down and don't send me an email\n[noise]\nDeep breaths the infamous\nFront and what can be an embarrassing issue for many women especially one wearing high wasted pants or short\nBut several online companies are trying to change public perception on this problem into Amazon now carries several variations of women's underwear that are ... to create a puffy looking for what age um\n[laughter] I Know why I'm going to regret this one company both that the underwear\nBomber the underwear\n[laughter] I'm just going to read it the way it was written one company both of the underwear let you bring the pants pita wherever you go\nWell\nWait a minute pants Peter like\nLike a bridge ...\nI don't know if that's the name of that was a slight I included it because it seemed to be capitalized I mean I'd go with that\nWe've we've brought this topic before under the context of something McKay we said\nYeah yeah I Do remember that I've read says right down the road is a problem\nAnd and and that's the reason I ... I just thought I didn't know this was a thing um but it says\nThat will it will leave an impression on everyone you meet 'em and says people on social media have spotted the interesting underwear and don't know what to make of it questioning why anyone would pay upwards of thirty dollars for something you can create yourself for free\nOr some reports suggest that the trend has been popular in Japan where some women want to accentuate that\nAh however claimed the fashion trend has been adopted by trans women because they're great for concealment her mind and I made the mistake and I will never do it again if going on Amazon and I was just simply curious\nAnd this is a very there's a lot of different companies who market this product and it does seem to be more calmly marketed towards trans\nMen running whatever um but yeah apparently in Japan it's it's a hot ticket item for women as and they're posting pictures on social media showing off and it's I just think it's very odd\nSo it's kind of like how shirts you used to a half shoulder pads and I'm In is like that yes a breeze and it's just it's pleaded if you will [laughter]\nSure she used to uh have shoulder pads and um it
