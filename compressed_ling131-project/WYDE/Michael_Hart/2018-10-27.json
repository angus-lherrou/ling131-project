I probably do that more than you write\nYour ... the kids all say that I'm the girl and you're on the ... in the ... I'm a woman and you're the man that's right so uh I think there's some truth to that I Will dip into our mailbag if we have time like some emails from our listeners if you would like to have your question answered on the radio or television 'cause we didn't have a television show now it runs\nSaturdays and eleven on CBS forty two\nAnd Sundays ten thirty are these are both AM eleven AM and ten thirty AM on Sundays on Fox six\nSo are we had somebody the other day coming I'm Tony and told me the DVR does show so that if they didn't get a chance to they weren't there to watch it they came back and watched it lighter which I thought was something that everyone should do I think that's a good idea for me you know\nAnd so we're going to talk about um\nEmail questions while we're not going to talk about um will after him and then we're going to do are getting into your segment so let's jump right in financial warning lights Tony I'm gonna hit it off to you now okay tell us about some of the financial warning was\nWell I mean it's just it's kind of like this you're driving your car down the road and maybe the engine light comes on or maybe the oil light comes on you know there's all idiot like say come on let's say\nHey pay attention to me um so there are some things in your life and people in in their life financially\nWhich if we're trying to answer the question is a lot of money can alas rye which is the biggest question everyone has in fact I call that the debate questions [laughter] a lot of money going to last our money in the last as long as it most of the kids are we free delivers along does he want to um so\nWe would like to be free to live as\nLong as you know not only that said that it has all the time I have people come in here and there was just telling their their mind you know as the Ninety or eighty nine oh yeah that happened I'm like\nOkay you're done after this after that all bets are off\nSo you know we we we do want we want our the family we all feel free to live as\nAfter this after that all bets are off\nSo you know we we we do want we want our the families that we help to feel free to live as\nLong as they want to [laughter] I mean we we ultimately have no control over that anyway we might as well make it as rosy as possible so I'm so here's one of them here is a here's a warning light that I don't maybe this'll be the dollar sign morning like you know there's all these little\nAre they called him oh geez what are those lights called I don't know anyway whatever those lights are out there ... there's one that looks like an engine which I don't even know what that looks like it was like a I don't ... I Do think they call them warning one so that but that was what were called them well but here's the thing I was saying I don't know what the picture of this would be maybe it's a dollar\nThe dollar sign warning light that should be flashing in your brain right now is that if you have no idea what it costs to find your lifestyle now most people\nThink they know this so maybe you are warning lights not going off\nMaybe your warning I and I got a few more thousand miles for I have to really change that oil [laughter] or I gotta kinda figured out or I just know low tire pressure on them I don't even know what was her pressure I don't even know what that like it always confuses me it looks like\nA horse you with a bunch of stuff on the bottom of the different um different cars\nBut anyway but but my point is that warning light for me sometimes for my in my experience\nDoesn't go all the way it should for people because I think people think and really believe they know what it's gonna take to support their lifestyle when they quit working and the reason they think that uh in my experience is because they've either gone out there on some website they've gone to some seminar at work at their\nAge our department's put on and they tell they run some numbers that look all rosy and cool and\nBut they're typically way off and and and over assuming a bunch of things that I just don't think are very likely to happen for them\nSo you know you said it what's the big question that's on people's mind right is our money last here's another big question\nHow long do I have to work what happens if I get laid off or I'm about to get laid off in what's going to happen or can I can I retired when I Want to do I have to keep working so these are all big questions that people haven't in the morning like that you're talking about\nUh is this is one of the biggest mistakes I mean we see that people are making one of them is they think they know how much they're spending and how much they're going to need and retirement based upon like you said some rule of thumb or you're going to need eighty percent of your pre retirement income hogwash or\nThey have a budget weren't cheat or they have something they keep on their own they're even off then\nYes so so I was sitting down with a family uh recently and they have a budget worksheet and how do you actually use a quick and ...\nAnd we had him do our lifestyle analysis ... which is quick and easy but it misses nothing right you can't hide from yourself and make came back and they said we were off by twenty percent\nYeah and and and they'll even say everything every transaction downloads right into quicken American Express card does that the other thing at all downloads in there but\nBut there's a lot there's things that people are doing out there and leave him through the correct yeah it really does and there's a bunch of different ways people do it I mean I've seen it all you know there's gold bars in our basement there's different things that are happening that they're doing and they're not accounting for it\nSo that's how people get in trouble and I believe to add if I were to look at a warning light of financial warning light that dollar sign them going to call it\nHow much is going out the door every year is so important in\nLet's take it back to the big question the big question\nThat dollar sign I'm going to call it how much is going out the door every year is so important\nIn let's take it back to the big question the big question is will your money laugh and it's everything that was cash flow so so the answer to this question which is how much money is really going out the door\nNot how much does the light bill in the utility you know the utilities and the groceries cost because that's the one another mistake that people may they add up their fixed cost and then they go oh that's what we need to level\nAnd they said oh we probably spend this on restaurants vacation Christmas tax yeah we'll thought Hitler fat estimating that lot which is off always [laughter]\nSo our experiences is off on average of thirty percent so that was the ... the couple I just describe but they have two quick in and all that so I Will say this if you do those kinds of things you're probably closer closer yup but your but our experiences even then you're typically off by Fifteen or twenty\nPercent and that's too much if you're going to quit working so if you're working it's okay it or not if we're going to help somebody answered the big question will your money last and can you quit Eritrea Kenya quit working\nAnd we allow them to give us the wrong answer to this ... this was another thing that I Want to point out\nI have met with so many families whose broker or banker asked them how much are you going to need and retirement they gave him the answer and the broker or bankers said okay fine in their base in all of their projections off the answer they got from a client\nNow I can see why you would do that because you're thinking oh it's your life you're the one that pays the bills you ought to know our experiences smart organized people don't know the answer to this question so our job\nIs not to our job is not if we're Dr our job is not to let the patient self diagnose quite ... yes so our job is not to let you our earth while listener\nDiagnose your retirement or our job is to do that\nWell because Ted it's the first time anybody's typically plan their retirement and they never have the opportunity to get good at it you don't get good at something you've done ones right you're going to make a lot of mistakes\nYeah you you're not going to plan your retirement why don't die ever gonna get good at it now and you're done after that\nYou don't it's not like somebody comes on and says hey we plan my now that you've done years\nIn the well there's a difference between investing in planning you're retired or because there are a lot of people that are savvy investors so when we say this you're never going to get good at it there might be people out there going wait a minute you know I've been managing my own investments for Thirty years I I'm good at it totally different thing ... that's the difference between growing your money\nRight so that was a couple of years ago the markets have been doing a great sense then yeah so he's probably feeling really good about that the ... to stay super aggressive maybe\n... people that are doing that now because we see this a lot so another warning sign is or if the markets have been up for a decade straight ten in all of a sudden you have forgotten what it's like\n... to lose half your money and that's what I told him you're playing the same game you didn't know it got hurt so bad right same game you're doing the same thing expecting a different result the ... well\nAnd and I again I don't remember all the details but but I think I remember you telling me that he had enough money\nHe did that I mean wasn't limited super big lifestyle was out in the country it was it was it was going to be a slam\n... shoulder so the question is not how big of a bucket of money do you have you have\nThe the question is will your retirement plan work so that you can retire live the lifestyle you want and not round to worry about run out of money that's it so for some people that bucket needs to be\nHalf a million dollars for some people that bucket needs to be two and a half a million dollar right everybody's different exactly but the idea of it and I was a we were on vacation I don't know if I told you this we're on vacation I got into a conversation with somebody I was up up a\nAre getting some food at the at the little swim up thing or whatever\nYou know I've gotten a conversation where they found out that we did retirement planning so he goes\nYeah how much money do you need to retire these days I'm thinking three million that I've told her talking about as wide and this is you know we were in November where we were actors or somewhere and he goes I've told her needs to be three million so I'm just curious to know you know if that's the number\nI when I have no idea\nI Know that [laughter] they're like well what kind of good medicines directly these days your doctor\nIt's curious to know you know if that's the number I went\nI have no idea I Know that [laughter] they might think well what kind of good medicine is the right these days you're Dr Dre should've said what do you mean you have no idea you just told me your retirement plan her I said yeah but I'm a good one [laughter] there's I don't know how much you and your wife need\nTo be able to retire yeah y'all live here [laughter] right so so it's a it's all about the ratios of\nHow much money's going out the door so that was the first morning why yeah we have to know how much going out the door really not ... I guess at it and I hope it's going to be less than it is now because\nGolly gee pres we're not just compared to how they looked at as we used to when we were first married we lived on peanut butter and tuna fish we can do that again\nYeah you can but that nobody daddy you really want to do that how does that so we've got so we've got to figure that out\nAnd then when we talk about things like this just a bucket of money it's these ideas a lot of times telling me that people have\nThat they're thinking I've got to do this I've got to do that I had to do the other thing\nBut maybe they're not based upon their actual neat isn't right you you know like the gentleman I was talking to they don't need for him to have a million dollars in savings plans you know to to the two of them together got about one point for they've got a couple of pensions they're going to have Social Security\nIf they want to retire tomorrow it will work like a charm yeah it's good but you know whether they decide to do that or not\nI don't know but the but the point is\nYou may be thinking well I've got to get this rate of return more I I lost a buzz so I've got to make it up or I you know I've only got X number of dollars and I need to have this number because that's what I decided ten years ago was my goal\nThat as a warning sign that very likely\nYou've identified things that you've decided need to happen but they're not really based upon the reality of your circumstance right\nAnd that's what a good retirement planning does lays all this out for you mhm I said a good retirement planning I guess I should say a good retirement plan or good retirement planning [laughter] any effort anyway whatever [noise]\nSo that's what it does for you\nIs it lays all this out in a way that is crystal clear and you can see it with your own two eyes here's how this plays out here's how much we're going to need here's how the plans put together you know my\nUh nine hundred and twenty five thousand dollars is plenty or my nine hundred and twenty five thousand dollars isn't enough and I need to work three more years or I was thinking I needed to work three more years and really I don't have to those are the big questions that are probably on your mind if you would like to get them answered we know how to do that for you\nWe've done hundreds of times we like to think we're pretty good at it\nAnd the goal is for you to walk away with clarity that you're looking for because everybody is trying to answer these big questions but getting that clarity is the hard part we do that without retire with freedom process and we will do in an initial analysis for you\nWhere we gather all of the day that we would want to plan our own retirement\nAnd we analyze it and we get back together and we show you specifically here the things that are going well and these are the things that need to be planned for in more detail and then we show you how we go about doing it\nOur intention isn't this analysis will be one of the most valuable things you've ever done we think you will fill that it is so if you'd like to take advantage of it\nWe do specialize in helping people with five hundred thousand dollars or more planning for their retirement\nSo if you'd like to take advantage of it we do specialize in helping people with five hundred thousand dollars or more planning for their

really answers the big question how has my money gonna last as it gets so we really want to keep going down that road\nThey [noise]\nAre you retired or about to retire and concerned about whether your money's going to last you worried about the volatility of the stock market\nWill the next market crash derail your retirement plans\nThese are the concerns that our client families had when they came

there's some meat here right now\nSo uh we're not just all sizzle we've got steak [laughter] what does that mean you just made that up you've never heard that all sizzling no stop our dollar cowboy and no had no other way around all had no cattle all had no cattle that's it okay I don't know I'll tell [laughter]\nBackwards she was only a little bit [laughter] but you never heard that where's\nThe sizzle or you know like a sizzle reel or something like yeah I Know of artist Israel but so have you ever have never heard people all sizzling no stake Miami oh they're just full of it\nDid you work in finance or something I never I didn't work at Baskin Robbins out an east would mall did your ice cream says all know the ice cream did not ... I was the big deal [noise] but you know I was the head scoop still [laughter]\nOh my gosh okay well let's get back to the topic on financial warning like All right so so one\nOf the things that I think is a big morning light is is does it have as much as it used to but it but it's still does is that people have some kind of mental image that their retirement it's going to look like their parents retirement but there's a lot of difference between our parents' retirement and the retirement\nI'm kind of mental image that their retirement is going to look like their parents retirement but there's a lot of difference between\nOur parents' retirement and the retirement that we're having today a lot of different things first of all most people\nThat retired that our parents age are not living as long as we're going to and and that's just a fact we're living in a lot longer medical science is better than it used to be we're taking better care of our health ... ... our generation and the generations retiring today is going to live\nA lot longer no matter what their ancestors did or their grandparents are parents that they're going to live a lot\nLonger and you're going to put up with me for a long time\nNot gonna last longer so that you are [laughter] you know like a hundred and ... I'm going to get the last word and um\nSo so the point of what that means that everybody is that the money has to last longer like so if if you're you're asking the big question is what money gonna last well how long are you going to last\nAnd the the answer is you're going to last longer than your your parents did so planning for your retirement today is much more difficult and challenging than planet than your parents when they also here's the other thing I find\nI could whether that storm then and I we were able to just hang on and and not panic\nBut we also were still working and we're about to retire and so that was ten years ago if that happens to us while we're retired and we are million dollars becomes half a million dollars\nI Know the money's not going to last no matter what my broker says right exact because now we're pulling money out mhm so so he got it he was like there's a difference between\nSitting there on your half a million and waiting for the markets to rebound seven years later which is what it took\nThere's a difference between that and we got half a million but now we're pulling forty thousand dollars a year out of\nHalf a million and even if the markets rebound our portfolio wall\nYeah I mean ... and ... and here's the question really I keep saying this but the big question that's on everybody's mind I don't care how much they have or how much they're spending or who they are\nIs our money gonna laugh yup will earn money last please not just telling me that in the on the head and tell me my money is going to last show me yeah prove to me let me see it let me touch it let me look at it\nAnd we all my money last even if we lived through a two thousand a write in retire all of that ask yourself this question\nIs your retirement plan going to work\nIf we have another financial crisis yeah because if you don't know the answer I Would strongly encourage you to get the answer and and the answer is not some Monte Carlo analysis or some platitudes from your broker\nHang in there it'll come back it always does that's advice for if you're not pulling money out of your savings right if you're pulling money out of your savings are you going to have to you're going to have to get soon yeah that hanging their advice is potential suicide deer retirement annoyance yeah if you would like\nAn answer to these questions is your money going to last argue protected from another two thousand and they would a financial crisis destroy your retirement\nThe way you're set up now if a two thousand and eight will destroy your retirement the way you're currently structured\nHow do you fix it yeah how do you fix that that's kind of all we answer all of these big questions is part of our retire with freedom process and we will do an

then we're going to do it getting to know your segment\nAnd and had these are questions that they're not just on everybody's mind but if they're not on somebody's mind when they're like literally in the red zone I call it ten years from retirement they should be\nAnd so you know one of the questions you know the big questions that you should that everyone she out there should be asking themselves\nAre I Know we keep sending the biggest question is\nIs not money going to last ... here's another really big important question that is probably on people's minds but if it's not it should be well my family be okay if I get sick or I'm no longer here that's and that's not just about I got some term life insurance and people\nDo not plan for that well enough in their broker and bringing it up their bank or whoever they're managing their money there's you know\nIncome gets lost all kinds of things happen and it does not cause half as much for one person delivers it does too I'm telling you that at a hundred percent\nAdults so we'd go deep into this on the class that we teach Tony we do a class it it just stay right here on valley they'll road in Inverness\nIf you'd like to come to this class I don't know when the next one is Anna in our office is the one that keeps that schedule and she just tells us when to show up and teach the same sort of need to know if you know racist so so I don't know when the next one is\nBut we try to do them once a quarter I think we've got one coming up pretty soon you can call now and the operator will take a message and Anna we'll call you back or you can just call during the week and get on the list for the next class but it's three hours of a deep dive into retirement plan is fine say foul planning is one of the things we talked about he is\nBut if you would like to come to that next class nine a triple zero six\nThat's two oh five nine eight a triple zero six you can call now you can call during the week\nAnd get on the roster for the next class we used to charge tuition for this class Tony ... uh but we don't anymore we used to do two nights but we've condensed into one\nSo people are getting actually more information in a shorter timeframe but because it's less of a commitment of our time we don't charge the tuition anymore so I think it's I think it's one of the best things that people can do for themselves other than coming to see us is come to this class or if you'd like to\nCall and get on the roster for the next one and I can tell you when it is but the reason that came up\nIs widowed women is one of the most is one of the fastest growing poverty groups in the country and it's because people aren't doing exactly what you just said\nThey're not doing well they're not asking themselves well my family be okay if something happens to me\nMaybe the houses wandering\nExactly what you just said they're not doing well they're not asking themselves well my family be okay if something happens to me\nAnd maybe the sauces wandering but sometimes they're uncomfortable making a big deal out yeah what if something happens to you I going to be okay and and and so sometimes what happens is they get platitudes everything's fine don't worry about it\nAnd then they don't really want to dig deep into it because it sounds like you're African yeah it's like\nOkay well I don't care about whether you're here or not I'm just worried about myself\nAnd it's not that now is it the other thing is is the more you know the more powerful and empower do you feel not just gee I Hope everything's okay nobody wants to fill that way so here's the so far let me recap some questions will my money less that should be on everybody's mind you know everybody's mind\nThe other one is is my family okay if something happens to me that should be on your mind\nI got a really good one right now because this really should be a thing we talked about earlier that you may be taking more risk than you actually have to take and I think people should be asking themselves is what if there's a way\nWhatever what if there's a way to make sure my my us what if there's a way that I could take less risk and get all the things that I Want what if there's a way that I can make sure I'm spending all the money I Want to today and I can leave some money behind my kids what if there's a way that I actually get all this figure it out and I don't have to worry about it anymore\nBecause there's a window of opportunity here to figure\nOut if if you're five or seven years away from retirement or even ten or you're already retired\nThere is a small window of opportunity to ensure that you've got a plan in place that answers these big questions\nSo what if there were a way for you to feel confident that you've got the right retirement plan your money's going to last you can see it very clear ways that your retirement is going to be rock solid\nThere's a window of opportunity right now

Nutley yeah\nHe called them basically in and said those of us who live in Alabama and the majority of Alabama's rural ... those people that cling to their guns in their religion you know he demonized\nExactly and that's what that's that's the point right when a president say those things ... because you're thawing red meat to who your audience President Obama did it yes mitten and resident Donald you know same thing\n... because you thought of red meat to who your audience President Obama did it yes mitten and resident Donald you last name the around lately animals right or Donald Trump is doing the exact same thing if people keep giving them a pass on that how is\nHe who is calling rubber ...
