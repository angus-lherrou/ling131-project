{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WYDE", "content": "\n\n\n\n\nThe following programs are paid program uh does not reflect the views of station management or sponsors\n\nBelow every body welcome back to another edition of retire with Freedom House had all this is my wonderful wife Tony joining me\nSony we've got a I think a really good show today because we're going to talk about the topics that we find her own people's minds regularly and we're also going to bring up some things that\nMaybe you're not thinking about but we think you should be so we're gonna talk about I Can't get no satisfaction or can I Do a little stones reference there we're going to talk about irreversible decisions\nSo or be careful when you're making a decision that you can't undo we're going to talk about reading the fine print\nIn the financial world that is very important if we have time we'll take some ah email questions from our listeners if you would like to get your question answered on the air go to ask freedom financial dot com that's ask freedom financial dot com we will or answer your question on the air and we may also answer your question on the television show\nSo I Want everybody to know that uh we've been doing a television show for about a year now and CBS and lemon I Am on Saturday on Saturday thank you for that\nUh but we've also recently added a the show to Fox at ten thirty on Sundays\nRight after Joe oh steam so er about eight in ... so we used to joke about we used to joke about you know if you if you don't have anything to do on a Saturday Night you can always DVR the TV show in and watch this show on a Saturday Night so\nHonest honest to goodness had a family come in last week and they both said like at the same time we DVR your TV show cool [laughter]\nThat's what you do after football so I don't know I I my rather stick myself in the Iowa with a hot poker didn't ah\nI think it's okay though I think it's good that gets I think it's got a good a lot of good information actually won cool thing about it as we can use visual aids you can't be on the radio so we've got you know some pictures and stuff it helps people think about the concepts anyway I Am digressing\nIt's easier well\nLet's get back to I Can't get no satisfaction so what are we talking about here I Can't get no satisfaction\nWell people have\nYou know they go into a high degree of satisfaction in retirement but it's kind of hard for people to really wrap their arms around that next chief that for one thing the big question and everybody cares about is will online us you know I mean that is the number one big question is well my money last\nThat for one thing the big question that everybody cares about is will not money last year I mean that is the number one big question is will my money last and do I have enough\nSo you know one of the things is peace of mind regardless of what's happening in the stock market or around the world I mean so getting satisfaction from that I mean really answers the question do I have enough because a lot of times that we see\nPeople kind of maybe chasing returns trying to jump in the market and trying to eke out another you know upside potential as much as they can because maybe they feel like we're a little behind and we don't have enough of them are trying to play catch up\nAnd you know really it's about having a right dollars in the right thing in the market at the right time as opposed to just go in all in\nWell at first I see both you know I see both things I see people that come in are\nYou know right now with the market's doing so well and have been for so long people are starting to forget what a real a market crash one correction looks like mhm\nAnd ah although if you think back to two thousand and eight just try to remember what that felt like and now imagine that that ... that that happens to you now and you're\nYou know instead of being Fifteen Years away from retirement maybe your five or four three or two or one right\nAnd maybe you're planning on it being five four three two one but maybe your employer has other plans because we see this a lot where people get laid off and they were expecting to to work more and and that's that's a lot that's very challenging so I see people that are that are taking\nA lot of market risk right now because things are going so well and human nature we get a little greedy mhm right yeah we get a little greedy\nAnd uh and that's okay as long as it's money that you're not going to need to live on\nAnd then that in the next five to ten years and\nI Do also see\nA lot of people who are very concerned about the fact that the market's been up for ten years they feel like a correction has to be coming at some point they're closer to retirement than they were in the past and they are trying to answer that big question is my money going to last when can I retire yeah\nDo I have an after you I have enough and what happens if we lived through another two thousand eight what's gonna happen to me right if we lived through another two thousand eight and we say this a lot Tony but\nYou know we can't stop the market from crashing but we can stop market crash from ruining someone's retired oh yeah I'd interact we do it all the time yeah you know I I think one of the most satisfying things uh for me\nIs when people come in and they are worried about the answers to these questions when can I retire is the money going to last is it enough and then we put together our retire with freedom plan\nThat goes through everything you know what are you going to do about how are we going to replace your paycheck how are we how do we allocate your investments if we've got money in the stock market how how much do we allocate and how much risk do we take if we need income was the way to get income and the most a certain way possible\nThat's not going to be impacted by a market crash\nYou know that gives people a lot of peace of mind how do we deal with taxes healthcare a legacy planning so one of the most satisfying things for me is when somebody says you know this is the first time I've really seen all this laid out and I know exactly how this is going to work\nAnd I can see that yes I can retire in two years or whatever the goal was and I can see that it's going to work and I can also see the things that we can't control like stock\nTiring two years or whatever the goal was and I can see that it's going to work and I can also see the things that we can't control like stock market crashes that sort of thing aren't going to ruin our retirement and that's you know in my opinion what a good retirement plan is about really\nTad what people are just asking what's on their mind is do I have enough you know do I have enough money in will my money last as long as we do and that's what gives people the peace of mind knowing and seeing and they have a tangibly touched that\nSo so if you're like the families that we help if you are less than ten years away from retirement or you're already retired or maybe you're five years four years three years two years is getting closer and closer and you're trying to answer the big questions when can you retire\nIs your money going to last how do we do this in a way that's going to insulate you from events beyond your control that's what our retire with freedom process does\nAnd we are happy to sit down with you and walk you through exactly how to have the kind of plan for your retirement you're looking for\nThe kind of plan to answer those questions with certainty where you can see exactly how this was going to work it's more than just a bucket of investments a diversified portfolio is not a retirement plan\nCome sit down with us and let a show you what a retirement plan looks like\nWe specialize in helping people with five hundred thousand dollars or more plan for their retirement\nBut if you think you might be a fit give us a call we will sit down with you personally and help you plan your retirement nine eight eight triple zero six that's two oh five nine eight eight zero zero zero six\nTwo oh five nine eight triple zero six anybody that calls in the next ten minutes we will set aside time on our calendar and sit down with you and help you figure out the answers to the big questions for you and your family\nAnd you know Ted talking about a diversified portfolio not be in a an income plan we do talk about how about that a whole lot inside people come in and actually quote that back to us when they come in but let me say this I I don't know if we've mentioned this before but\nHaving a diversified income you know ... diversified types of income stream is super important right I mean and folks don't think about it like that there is no just one stream of income coming in and like you did it when you had your salary\nYou had the ability when you retire if you put a plan together and to be able to diversify the different places you're getting income from there's a there's many different places and each one of those places and strategies needs to be maximize so that you've got the ability literally\nTo have your money last as long as you do and beyond and then you can last as long as you do your wife does you know and then you're able to ... you know possibly very possibly leave money behind to your kids your grandkids are heavy care about because you've had so much income you've not had to rub your nest eggs so much\nBut you don't get an opportunity to get good at retirement plan it yeah\nYou never get good at it you never get good at night I Know you can cause you do it\nOne time right exact so that's one of the things I feel like we bring to the table is that the fact that we've done it hundreds and hundreds of times and we have figured out how to figure these things out right so [noise]\nAnd sometimes they're working with people who don't know how to figure it out\nI Would say that that's the majority of the time I mean again it's not\nIt's the difference between working with an architect it's kinda like if you're going to build a house or do you just go to the concrete cells person and say how should I design my house and I know\nYou gotta have concrete you gotta have board you got to have all that stuff but you need an architect him to design the thing and so it's kind of like building a house you wouldn't build a house without blueprints\nYou shouldn't plan your retirement without blueprints either and so so I think what's happening for most people as they're working with a broker a banker somebody and it's kind of like the concrete salesman they're managing their investments there's nothing wrong with that that is a a perfectly legitimate thing to be doing is managing people's investments is just not a retirement\nPlan and what we see every time that someone comes in here is they still have the big question on that chart right on my money last will my money unless they're working with somebody but they've never answered the question how my money gonna last well I'd be okay do I have enough is my family going to be taking care of something happens to me I mean there's a lot of questions out there that aren't answered\nThat's why this discussion ram Social Security is important right because it helps answers the answer that question so we've got to figure out how much is going out the door how much are you going to need then we look at all the income sources that you can count on and retirement invent\nUps answers the answer that question so we've got to figure out how much is going out the door how much are you going to need then we look at all the income sources that you can count on and retirement and then we model\nIf we take it early what does it do to your savings long term if we wait until full retirement age what is it do to your savings long term if we wait until Seventy what is it do to your savings long term 'cause at the end of the day\nI don't think people care so much about which way do I get more money from Social Security before the good lord calls me home\nAs they do is my money going to last ... sets so so so so a lot of times people think maybe in again this is natural you're trying to make a decision\nAnd so you're you're looking at that decision in a vacuum like what's the breaking what break even point which way am I going to get the most out of Social Security you know well it sure would be nice to have that paycheck coming in now it would give me a sense of comfort all of these are human nature mhm\nBut what we really need to do is figure out how is this decision going to impact whether you run out of money or not yeah and that's everything that's everything and we also had a software package or just in case we didn't cover every base we have a software package and a team of consultants that used to work for the Social Security administration\nTo help us analyze these things because this is an important decision if you're trying to figure this out\nIf you're not sure is my money going to last when can I retire when should I take Social Security should I take it early is better to wait till till later shouldn't want if you turn it on while the other one weights all of these are things that need to be analyzed\nAnd it's important because if the end of the day it has a huge impact on whether you run out of money or not\nAnd there's a window of opportunity right now before you make that decision if you're close to it there's a window of opportunity to make sure that you get this decision right\nIf you would like to take advantage of us helping you do that we're happy to sit down with you and analyze not just your Social Security but your whole retirement planning tell you here the things that are going well and these are the things that we think\nNeed to be planned for and you need to have a solution in place and you need to have thought through we will give you this detailed analysis at no cost no obligation to you if we decided to work together past that then we explain how that works\nBut this initial analysis is designed to get to help you get your arms around your retirement planning\nYou'd like to take advantage of that we do specialize in helping people with five hundred thousand dollars or more save for retirement plan for their retirement\nBut if you like to take advantage of this call now nine eight eight triple zero six that's two oh five nine eight triple zero six in Tony\nI'm also going to offer anybody that calls in the next ten minutes or you'll get a free copy of our book retire with freedom so I've written a book called retire with freedom that tells you how to retire with freedom [laughter]\nAnd so if you would like to take advantage of that anybody that calls in the next ten minutes that comes to see us we'll also get a free copy of the book nine eight triple zero six\n[noise] you know another decision tab that could be an irreversible says your decision and is if if it's been made is electing the spousal benefits if you have a pension oval and how that happens we see that a lot so so let me say this I'm sometimes those decisions have already been made when folks come in here\nAnd ah so for for if it has been let me say this there's still a window of opportunity effects that station not that we can go back and change the decision\nWas made on well you might be able to somebody you haven't started taking it yet sometimes people have made the decision but they haven't turned it off\nAnd go back and change the decision\nYou made on well you might be able to somebody you haven't started taking it yet sometimes people have made the decision but they haven't turned it on rush but once you've turned on now we got to fix it and we\nWe can't on ring the bell but we can do some things and make some decisions and put some things in place that could really protect\nThe surviving spouse because it's a big question too is is my family going to be okay and what will happen to my family if I'm no longer here you know in my ... are they going to be taken care of and okay and this really answers you know the the decision you make around your pension and Social Security\nI'm really answers that big question not only am I may go as for me and her but you know at our we both going to be okay is she going to be okay if I'm not here anymore and I did something other than some kind of benefit left behind for her and how much that I'll eat behind for her or him if she's got it you\nKnow Tony I I find that this is one of the most concerning questions that people have\nIs my family going to be okay if I'm not around it and and the the the family has the same question particularly the spouse a lot of times like you know am I going to be OK if my spouse isn't here right\nAnd usually in most couples one person passing away will have a significantly higher impact on the one left behind then if it was reversed right it's usually not the same financially I'm not talking about emotionally\nOr a U.S you women do way better without as men than men do without you women [laughter]\nMaybe you know the truth you guys are like [laughter]\nTotally got that your golf around my back [laughter] and we're like wait a minute what are we do we care about ourselves [laughter] where's the can opener right so so financially though a lot of times it's the reverse of that yeah right yeah\nAnd so it's it's it's really concerning for both people it's concerning uh for typically the husband again this is not always the case but it is the most common scenario typically the husband is very concerned about is his wife and to be okay\nAnd his wife is concerned about the same thing yeah and I are going to be okay I'm not gonna cause a lot of times this topic the whole thing about money and investments and all that\nUh is is usually intimidating to people who haven't paid that much attention to it and now again let me let me be clear we've got clients where they'll come in here for view\nAnd we I Can't keep them in a way as the women are the ones that do it all the men have no interest absolute so that is absolutely right now real scenario ... it's not the most common yeah\nIt's more commonly as the other way around right right yeah and so that's a big concern for people\nIn this pension thing so so why tell why is this pinch and things such a big deal\nWell it's a big deal because I mean we I give\nYou know I I actually that like I didn't know the answer and I'll tell you I'm acting well I'm I'm playing the straight man All right go for it so ...\n... decision that important is huge just like the Social Security decision is huge because I've got many stories about this topic in particular but we have a current family that we help now at\nStill hear the they came in five years ago six years ago something like that okay um he had already elected a a benefit for his pension that was just not nothing left behind for the spouse okay nothing left behind so the wife couch because\nHe's much healthier than her um she was a couple of years older than him\nNothing left behind for the wife couch because\nHe's much healthier than her um she was a couple of years older than him but just to [noise]\nUm and that she was more unhealthy show where okay yes she had some health issues and that they both agreed they both agreed they made the decision together that there is no way she'll ever outlive him and this is the best decision possible for them\nSo they already elected the Social Security decisions and they'd already elected her Social Security was very very small her her ... her piece of has a very small guy\nAnd then so they had great income while they were both here\nAbsolutely great income [noise]\nUm unfortunately about a year and a half less than two years later\nHe passed away and but he came in first and was saying we made the decisions because we know this is going to happen and and you know I'm going out with her and this is going to be fine and we don't really need to think about those things we want to think about some other things and plan for some other things\nMake sure you're putting all your money and diversified EPS\nTo make sure you're putting all your money and diversified ATS yeah that that that's not an income plant right that's a bucket of investments but so the fine print ATS have fees as well in some of them more than others you know we talked about um\nWe talked about annuities annuities\nAre one of the ones that you definitely need to know what to ask there are a lot of different kinds of annuities now we've talked on the show plenty of times but\nWe don't think of any of this stuff cash stocks bonds annuities\nLife insurance long term care gold silver real estate and I don't care what it is we don't think of any of that stuff is good or bad and we're very aware of the people out there are very polarized and opinionated about certain things or you should always do this you should never do that\nI think always endeavor is usually bad advice for somebody ... might be great advice for some people in terrible advice for others so\nWe just want to think through what are we trying to solve a problem or we solve it are we trying to get income that we know we can't outlive are we trying to make sure that it's not affected by market crashes or is it money that we're willing to set aside and grow for the long term in which case we're willing to take more risk is an emergency money is it I got to buy a car in three years\nYou know are we just trying to figure out when can I retire you know what can I can I get outta here it is\nSo so annuity there's a lot of polarization out there about annuities are I don't I'm not polarized one way or another I don't think they're good I don't think there are bad I think they're a tool that you need to know what you're doing and so there are a lot of annuities have very high fees and then take a lot of risk that people don't realize they're taking\nSo and also they come a surrender penalties and that sort of thing now ... what can an annuity do well well\nYou can get a you can have if you put the ... in in the right can you can have income going up by eight percent a year for every year you delay you can have the income last for both lifetimes like a pinch and\nYou know so you know you're not gonna run out of money but you also need to understand what the surrender penalties are and all those sorts of things so they can they can make some sense\nBut there are a lot of different kinds into frequently people sit down with us Tony and they think they've got typically they think they've got a fixed annuity and they've got a variable annuity where the fees are three or four percent\nThe income is only going to last for one person's lifetime not for both yep that's alive and if the markets crash and something happens to them the money that's going to be left to their kids is going to be\nIs the is going to go down maybe even cut in half of what they're leaving behind in in it was explained to them very differently than that yeah they thought the money was protected they were getting guaranteed growth and it was going to be for both lifetimes so\nIt's very important and\nThat if you are doing anything in the world a financial planning you understand not just what it's going to do well for you but what are the gotcha is my other limitations what are the limitations and it's not look nothing's perfect\nYou know if we put money in the stock market for somebody's playing in the market crashes that money's going to go down if we use an annuity for somebody's plan and and they need all the money back out six months later they're going to pay a penalty to get it right yes so these are all things that before we do them yeah\nPeople need to be super clear on it and and it it shouldn't be their responsibility to have to go through and catch those things in the fine print exactly\nClear on it in and it it shouldn't be their responsibility to have to go through and catch those things in the fine print exactly the the person that's working with them should lay all of this out and say look nothing's perfect\nEverything we do has benefits and it has drawbacks stocks and bonds have them annuities have life insurance long term cash cash has a everything has pros and cons here the problems we're trying to solve here's the way that we should segment the solutions to take care of the different problems but oh by the way\nEvery single thing that we're doing here we're doing for a good reason but it also comes with risks or limitations or a you know less liquidity or less growth or we've got great growth opportunity where we're taking a bunch of risk all of those things\nBut a good plan cat if you put a good solid plan together for ... for for a family the thing that we can do is we can take different solutions not this diversified portfolio but to diversify the solutions yeah and marry those together in an effort to get all the benefits from each of those strategies\nIf that sounds logical to you that all good plans should have different strategies is part of it if we're trying to solve different problems and you've been wishing and hoping that you could actually sit down with somebody\nThat wasn't a one trick pony trying to get you to do one thing versus another and they were very open about all of the benefits but also the drawbacks the fine print\nThere's nothing perfect out there so we don't try to pretend that there is we just want to make sure that if you're doing something there's a reason for it we've created a plan that we've collaborated on that you understand what we're doing\nIn that you've been involved in the decision in your clear on what the limitations are so that if the limitations raised their head\nIt's not a surprise\nIf you want that kind of straight talk and\nClear explanation of benefits and limitations around all of this stuff as it relates to retirement stocks bonds annuities life insurance what's the real scoop we will help you do that\nUh we will do it at no cost and no obligation we're happy to sit down with you and help you have clarity around what you need to be doing for retirement and what's the best way to go about it for you we do specialize in helping people that have five hundred thousand dollars or more plan for their retirement but let me ask you this\nWould it be worth an

ways the plan for my retirement that I wouldn't have known about otherwise\nAnd if so is it worth an hour of my time to have an impact a significantly positive impact on the next Thirty years if you'd

the unity after you've been through something so horrific 'em to push forward on a daily basis and is it tough if you don't you don't have to answer this question if you want to I just ... is it tough to be in a relationship with a\nMan at this point in time and it was um well for me I'm a lot of prayer in my face and a is what you need the energy and he'll keep going um\nFar as relationships I Will say that um\nIt is taking some time for me to get become more confident in who I Am again mhm because an abuser touch that way at ease your part little by little\nAnd um because I've always been a very strong person for the core of who I Am is very strong and I had that to lean on\nA that was something still there I just had I Choose shows that I wanted to wake her up again and it's not something that happens overnight\nBecause the breakdown is not something that happened you know overnight is is a period of time that this happened um when you ask the question earlier I'm within missile or\nPeriod of time that this happened um when you ask the question earlier um wasn't mental or physical ... mine was primarily mental\nAll mental abuse and it was not until after my mother passed my mother pass in two thousand one and within within two years\nI was you know beat up and that and that incident was what I Would sit in the out the door however that was not the first time

the other cheek\nI ran out of ... I didn't have enough cheap to turn and and I actually\nStarted believing that will maybe it is something I'm doing and maybe I Am bringing too much stress on this man or you know you start you start double second guessing yourself as being the calls as to why he's doing what he's doing\nSo you're creating excuses for the bad behavior lab now there\nBecause you don't want it to be you know where I go when you enter into a marriage you and you don't see anything\nTo tell you that this is what your marriage is gonna be like the four ...\nIt you know your mind can play tricks on you spend especially when you're in a mine manipulation type of um um well my manipulation relationship and so I Will say how has it affected our relationships with me is um it put me in a place where\nI had to learn how to dress myself love myself I'm no that I'm enough ... and if if um if for some reason our relationship doesn't work out it's not because I'm not enough it is because it just doesn't work out it's not\nAnd the reason I ask you that because I was there when you go through the photo shoot you the warm there in the boxing gloves and so I wanted to actually recover you know your fighter

now we're sending cutting a west to talk about prison before\nTo me that I'm making this a joke Kim ... gone there and then we're making it a joke are gay or wherever raising awareness for it out on the joke ...\nPrison reform is being talked about criminal justice reform is now who well apparently not left media because they want to call him coming to them about the love meaty okay hot dog but I'm Talking about individuals who are more educated articulate that can go and speak to them not that much as soon as we can get on him later I'm Talking about who was on the job of allowing to come\nTalk about ... okay rock Obama had no ... and beyond say they talking about whether we fall where they were talking about no type they when they went to go see president\nBrand please go do the research I did do the readers knew where I came in ... new even when you go talk look at what they did they would not they're trying to fix any issues they want them on their standing up front and they didn't want to go visit and perform at the White House and that's what they was therefore they wasn't there saying I'm going to say we're all going to talk about this is you know they were friends\nAnd they performed they'll have a problem with it\nCan get ... for ... for something different here western or do the whole thing about the reform he hadn't been in a prison you haven't done anything with his music and oh by the way for everybody that's sitting here talking about cutting it where it is great guy\nThat's the same guy that let me remind everybody that said President Bush don't like black people and it was called the um um ... was a thug and all of the oh yeah by the way down at the same guy that embarrass sales with him and war show Monday above tell them what the none of some of those same people at the same people saying you also listen to ... now and\nThe other people that were celebrating him are now chastising him so your point\nNo my point is I'm a ... we got don't limit coming up on the other side on this one right here ... west disrespected himself he disrespected Oval Office any disrespect to the community it not disrespect the yeah the brunt of Matt and Jesse Kelly Marie Hi district all of a surfer this I'm OK off\nThis man went into the oval office and even though the president of the United states broke mhm that's disrespectful ... wait a minute are and he went there and he\nCursing in the White House in front of the president and that is disrespect but that does the president of the United states whether you like it or not\nThat's your friend Maryland Mira Wilson is my friend and when I see marijuana in person what do I say sir or mayor I Do not call about first night I was there was a dog was homeboy nothing when you and the president of the president of the United states and you are representing something so important ...\nYou want to call me and broke you want to see that a a blanket ... like ... like um can you wouldn't come and see you that's not disrespect for an open up and this was back in the opposite of president Brian\nAre you done yeah okay no no [noise]\nSo I mean because you know I mean the previous president had um dogs in the White House ankle bracelets when off um who then we had a none of whom ...\nWho are we talking about the ... there there was a rap no no ... and they said well there was an estimator what Brian that his his he was in the oval office he was only while they were\nAnother woman ... who are we talking about the ... there there was a ... no ... and they say there was a nasty within what brought that his his he was in the oval office he was while they were ... his ankle brace it went off so you want to talk about disrespect or do you want to talk about the president that had no one on\nOne hand I went up and do something completely\nDifferent that somebody younger fantasy in front of the president or less in the theater you don't\nThink that people have used profanity in front of a prison before naming\nNaming who who I'm listening because I can tell you couldn't you did last week who else I'm listening\nOn television I don't know I Know I only be you were talking about for the reform act like use industry with one of your home board that an experiment to the opposite of president oh any level for any rights from anybody that it didn't work for it and he only over all the office death trying to make a point that it did not getting very signed the\nOval Office has been banged on okay Bronx you always tell me this yeah because somebody else did it doesn't ... make your right right okay I'm Talking about Kanye West\nYeah ... I ... I asked you on your youth or kill list but he's not representing you he's not there talking about you and he as a black man he went up there talking about prison reform for the black sea and then that and and then and then there's the inherent\nProblem right there was the problem is that somebody is saying that Kanye West represents somebody's skin color and so there is this monolithic idea that's out there on one of their Desmond troubling to talk about prison reform there is an issue in your\nWell let me ask you this question when a president Donald Trump brought in a white man to talk about ... ... people bringing here black people hear about anybody on the coast is just for poor oh here's the community or he was dealt with representing go\nBlack people right but but but well here's all sit here and try to tell me that he's not there for the black people president present you he does not represent me but we use that in there he makes us look bad for what he had to say you know these\nGuys I mean and that sounds like Donna Brazil man sand that set back a hundred and fifty five years that's insane I Know it's not Brian 'cause again well see that same\nGroup my mind that that you call up to ... you know if you're black you have to fall in line with whatever narrative it's being pushed out there and then the pushback criticism against Kanye West is because he's pushing back against a set narrative\nAnd that's why you're upset almost ... almost ... because he's pushing against the nerve to a ... a mirror to the all black people must fall in line and it's here to this certain mindset and that an individualized here have individual often but you know you're in the thing I said yeah and it was this nonsense\nTo me okay Brian I said he disrespect the opposite of president you know anybody that surf what is going to ... no one stands in front of the president and cars right know about it that this was like you said you didn't find a different spin\nOn because I 'cause I look at it with the way that Donald Trump was looking at him and he's like okay this is going on and he knew what he was doing of\nCourse Dylan a slump used us for the country are you saying\nWhen you look at it as an American citizen what ... did was this was back to the office of the president period okay you can sit there and said you know it does not matter but\nI ... my son ... if he had come as he looked up to this guy and the people that the kids are watching if they have to know this is not the way you perform if one of the president of the United states of um I don't know anybody looks at the country was obviously a lot of people do because I guess but when they all live what happened Bryan, Ohio went\nWell that's because he got a black man he was talking to a white man and he's going against the black monolithic marriage so you're saying about it can just blow to encourage that I can go to the White House and create a same there because it was the that is not what the outrage is about\nAnd he's going against the black monolithic marriage\nSo you're saying about it can just go there and create that I can go to the White House and create a same there because it was the\nThat is not what the outrageous about Joe you're looking at it completely do not only mine on a blind to what I'm saying no I'm not you know I Know I'm not wind what you're saying I just think that you're approaching it completely different than what the uh everybody else's selective outrage and then okay what is there but it's like if I read about that he's Kanye West\nAnd that he's being crazy and he's been easy and he's going off on this diet tried that he's been going off on since he was going out there trying to make music make money\nUh-huh so you're you're you're saying that black people don't marry him because he went on to the doctor I\nKnow I'm than black people are mad at him because for some reason people think that if there's a black man that gets out there and says something that's different than the Democratic narrative that there's a monolithic mindset that out there than it is pushing back that you're not falling in line you're not respecting the brothers\nWere brought ... this is what I Love you but I really have to push back when you will or because you're so ms got it on\nThe oh am I because that seems to be the rally all the less every everything that I have read all the criticism CNN MSNBC Fox News every body that is what they are criticizing him out\nThere not criticizing him because he said and after the president Bryan they're criticizing because he when I made a fool of itself is makes a flag will know so but it doesn't matter what environment ... they're\nCriticized for him because he wouldn't have made a fool and stuff and he's not educated own prison reform you can\nGo do do you have to be educated on a subject in order to be passionate about change\nYes no if you're going to talk to the president you know he wasn't given specifics about anything on that but I'm just I listened to the ten minute tirade he was all over the place yes but it was ... ... ... what\nDo you know you had wealthy\nResume and rest you're missing is the point you missing the whole point because you don't care about ... and his outrage what I'm saying\nYou got to the White House every name was there for one reason I\nAm going because of prison reform okay that's where he was therefore if don't like it goes up to the White House to talk to president don't know about president were for what the people want me to talk about\nPrison reform but you knew that wasn't going to happen right does not matter using that and that water down the process for president will fall I'm In the end of the day of easiest sitting there talking about prison reform and he's not talking about it\nThat means to me and a lot of other people that care about this and they've taken it as a joke life oh\nOh his wife what she's an advocate for prison reform\nShe got one person really okay great I'm happy for it but then that prison that there's not a former prison before no but it is\nHaving it continued conversation about it\nRight and I love you to death I mean we got to get to these phone calls but you know totally missing the point because it's easy I'm telling you Brian this is way deeper than dealing with going into ... listen no I hear ya uh-huh I think the year off base\nAnd and and that's just the\nWay I mean we don't we don't we all agree to disagree but yeah they didn't care he's jak I see you got to come up to ... three three what my point here is that what you guys to call and tell them you can take ... take my side do you think this was begging for any man a woman to go in front of the president", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael Hart", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "13"}
