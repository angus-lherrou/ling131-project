all the time with them as Justin Brown right\nDon't look good money doing more work you can make six figures doing that\nPresident Trump needs your help so called this number and press one\nYou Mr call in there now the guy that's a real good to me to ask him how he feels about here here in his words or he probably don't even watch the news you know not as much as we do if I didn't care anyway probably not I wouldn't want to hear if if it was my boys oh wouldn't want to you\nIf you were making bank from your voice you probably be proud\nTo save this country press one\nI could do it at the dirt [noise] All right uh do do I need to play Trump's comments on Christine\nBlood they forward yeah from last night you sure you all ready for this here is Trump speaking in Mississippi and the rally for their candidate there are and he addresses the gap in all situations\nWhat he's going to do this\nI got one right [noise]\nWell do you think it was always wonder how did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago when I don't [noise]\n\nWhat was it and I don't know [noise] I don't know [noise]\n\nAnd I met a man his wife is shattered his daughters were beautiful incredible\nYoung they destroyed\nHis wife is shattered his daughters beautiful incredible\n\nDestroyed people they want to destroy these really evil people\nSo the wife loses their mind over that I even some Republicans founded cringe worthy I didn't know it was fantastic I about Donald Trump is is saying exactly what we're all like I don't know I don't know anything except I had one beer I mean that's is that not the testimony we saw\nIt well do you think the Republicans are really cringing or they just cringing to save face\nI think that here's the problem is we we live in a society where you are not\nAllowed just because somebody made an accusation no matter how incredible that accusation get you're not allowed to go after them they are immune from criticism especially if it's a woman and if you go after them\nYou are than a a a rape you condone right sir you're you're a rapist yourself venue condone this stuff and you're attacking accusers\nI got accused of that because that just simply said accusations don't equal evidence\nAnd I was told that the kind of attitude and the kinds of people that keeps women from coming forward well shit [noise] Mm well I didn't I didn't say those type of things well I did say bad but uh I I wasn't attacking this woman off the bat until she's proven herself to not know what she's talking about\nWell and I mean if you're going to make an allegation of you know that magnitude you have to be prepared for the fact that questions will be asked\nTrump went on to bring up the third accuser which is the most outlandish to date we heard a little bit of her interview yesterday and here's what Trump said on that front\nWe don't just reporter [noise] my\nName is\n... ... and I maintain law because you know that's I think he said that on purpose just to make ... feel like he's even less important that you can't even remember that's what I think\nThese rag oh you're then I'd be unpaid\nAbyei on today [noise]\nJoined\nEven NBC was as bad as even the secret to shelter where that is a woman I was going on\nShe did she had no clue for being honest [laughter] that I mean we played that yesterday and and she did she she talked about how well you had a I Can't say it was Kavanaugh but he was standing in the same room when I started feeling\nNot well Ryan whatever's you that I didn't I felt not well not very well in Kavanaugh was in the room at the ... vaccine ... at the exact same moment\nWhich obviously proved that he's a racist so rapist rapists bans are confusing ... and there are so many accusations out there and I don't know who the race was the news a rapist I'm Sarah Huckabee Sanders\nHad a press briefing today where she was asked about Donald Trump's comments just last night here is a here's how she responded to John\nRoberts to get one in with that whole take your questions scot\nFree people who are the most important whole process are saying look I can call in and this morning says this lake and calls for ...\nHow the president for us for Steve was before\nThe rally Mississippi\nKnowing how to change these issues is that how\nHow the president described Christine was for\nA rally in Mississippi\nKnowing how sensitive to these issues is that how for would be the FBI investigation shows no other compelling evidence Keith judge Kavanaugh\nThese people need to be comfortable with voting for\nThe president said what he did last night in the way that he said\nThat was stating the facts are frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report\nHe was stating facts that were given during Dr forts testimony and this and it has to make a decision based on those facts are and whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been\nPicked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nTrump or you love Trump and there were two Republican parties in that sense\nWe went over the guys that are supposed to be smarter than you and I the the never Trump crowd you know the the people to\nLook at the Supreme Court justice nominations as the end all be all the court all of them are social issues people you know I I just think when you when you when the courts in play that stuff seems to be a wide rallies around you know people rally around Republican side\nThere's one kind of interesting school with all that if this goes on and just drags on and I and I think it was a gram kinda alluded to it a little bit was if this nomination does\nIt go forward then\nYou re nominate Kavanaugh and you give Republicans rallying cry that sort of energize the base that becomes a you know because a referendum on Brett Kavanaugh and I don't know if I'm a Democrat is as kind of dangerous territory because suddenly you already have a energize based on the Democratic side\nWhat does the energize his base in a post in a post presidential election midterm look like for the party in power that's you know Democrats should be walking away with this thing at this point they haven't they haven't really done that yet I think this is Brett Kavanaugh thing makes it makes it really difficult for them it gives us some headwinds\nWell it's something we we discussed yesterday where you know history tells us that the the party in power the party party that's holding the the White House two years in usually doesn't fare well\nIn the mid term they're after but I Am seeing something first of all when it comes to Trump you're going to throw out the history books as far as what we're used to in in politics and how things play out\nOf the second of all I I'm just seeing an energized Republican base and I think this Kavanaugh stuff is working in their favor but even before that\nThey were even energized and it's because they're seeing the results of of what they ask for a November two thousand sixteen\nWhich was bring the economy back up yet people jobs you know we understand you're going to be a jerk you're going to say stuff that makes us cringe but we can look past that if you will just do the job that the president's supposed to do and it's the stark difference between how Republicans and Democrats view of president\nOn the Democratic side it's a popularity contest on the Republican side they just want to ... go in there and do a job no matter what his personality is\nYeah I don't disagree with that I I I think one thing I Would add to that those ... with Donald Trump it was never it was never about popularity ... well some of it was obviously the name id and all that\nBut for the a lot of the conservatives have stuck with him it was never about him as Donald Trump the person and all all the tweets and all the extra stuff\nIt was just having a guy that was a was it going to come in and mental in our day to day lives with Obamacare are are are you know mandated contraception or these like really hot button issues on social issues right\nAnd it was going to be a guy that was kind of kind of protect just ... you know you live and let live way of life and make it you know the regulations do stuff that the government wasn't going to be involved in your everyday life\nI think people look at Donald Trump in that in that regard they don't really look at him as some kind of like moral authority figure ins or Democrats or Republicans a particularly conservatives and liberals cut to defer the way we look at our leaders\nYou know I think it's almost like liberals lead a father figure a or something along those lines it could serve and has just needs somebody to make the government work\nRight right right yeah I agree\nLiberals lead a father figure a or something ... along those lines it could serve it is just need somebody to make the government work\nRight right right yeah I agree with that uh and I just again I Want to keep you guys updated on the the breaking news about the FBI report they're saying that that thing could be done as early as today one copy of that report will go to the White House the other another copy we'll\nGo to the Senate I don't know if it's going I don't guess we'd go to the Judiciary Committee sincerity done with it but it would go to the Senate\nAnd they would review that stuff another point to make is\nAllegedly according to these reports neither ... nor four have been interviewed and most people would say oh that means it's a shame\nBut my thing is they've already been interviewed the FBI it's got the tapes of the er the testimony in front of the committee so why would they need to interview yeah unless they're trying to ... and ... and perjury are they going to be able to transcribe drive right simple as that but anyway that's going on right now so I just wanted a\nKind of keep an eye on that and if anything changes will let you know but as far as\nYour production Jeff and I know you're not I mean I I don't know sometimes you don't like to make predictions but I'm going to make you do this one okay Gavin all does he get confirmed friday or and if not does it get confirmed at another time\nI've done Friday Saturday or Sunday I think McConnell keeps US citizen and such that until it gets through and I wasn't expected to be much longer than that\nWhat do you think now and will play hypothetical here\nSang Kavanaugh doesn't get confirmed and they Trump just pull them or whatever and says you know it will just forget it will but somebody else and then in a certain series of events that would obviously be a lot more complicated than my hypothetical here\nAppoints him as attorney general to drain the swamp oh come on come on how good would that be because think about how angry\nCat and I have to be at the Democrats right now and and the the people that have perpetrated this uh this smear campaign\nWell I I Would say this I I Know the thing about this the smear campaign we don't have to worry about Kavanaugh will be in a swing vote in the future and in a way Kennedy was\nBut he didn't see I think you want with an attorney general somebody that that it's more of an administrator and not as an ideologue I think you need somebody to go in there cleaning up the bureaucracy that knows how to ... works you need a ... type and I you know I never thought just sessions was going to be that kind of guy I thought it was more of an ideological kind of figure\nBut I I I you know I don't know that's that's the fit and I I don't I Can't really tell you if he really be good in that that could kind of bureaucratic\nRoll yeah well and and I think ... I Hope I don't phrase is wrong but and Lindsey Graham proposed if he doesn't get confirmed to to ... ... if I'm not mistaken re nominate him and force it to be a mid term issue and a ride may right makes basically put it on the ballot\nYeah so you have it which would be interesting because suddenly make these these Democrats are these vulnerable rich you know that he's one of all Democrats are red states they got the they got to defend your decision not to back Kavanaugh you know when when Joe Manchin idea and kept uh you know Donnelly in Indiana these these these three red state Democrats\nAre necessarily put to the test and then people do vote can they can they stopped that can stop the Republican challengers from and give that a campaign issue and successfully I don't think they can I think you know Democrats at this point really stay on it if if it gets to that point and I I'm not\nAnd you're making that a campaign issue and successfully I don't think they can I think you know Democrats at this point really stand it if if it gets to that point and I I'm not you know I I don't I I think it's a long shot that the Trump would re nominated in the ... I I think it's interesting just because\nIt does it does make these multiple Democrats really had to play deep and when they need to be kind of on the off chance yeah\nI'm with you on that or here's a little hole do jobs you can hold over for one more segment we'll take some phone calls have you guys want to get into all by nine four one one zero one one you've got questions thoughts comments whatever the gate to bring it on the line Andrew jets ... poor young that we saw\nWith Andrew and Jessica\nW Whitey welcome to the common October fats October third\nThrough the thick join them for live music authentic German cuisine arts and crafts vendors the classic car show in so much more special live performance by American Idol brand new and now there will be on friday October fit at the comments that tall come to celebrate the German heritage at Komen Alabama and see the crowning at twenty eight June\nMid October fest for more information that the common October fest dot\nCom [noise]\n[noise] one day all jobs in here with house does listen joined us every Saturday morning we got a great show is going to be a lot of good information will go talk from roofing to foundation to basements across races whatever's effect in your home so if you need answers call the show they always house dodging ... or ... why I got every Saturday morning\nTo name him right here on superstation one on one do you why the [noise]\n[noise]\nThis is Jamie Gilmore reminding everybody to join us on Friday nights from nine until midnight on the best in high school football school\nWill have special get coaches interviews and take your calls and get you ready for your college football center\nRight here on your high school football leader in all of Alabama\n\nMy dream is a place and the\nWe're America will once again be seen as the last best hope\nAbraham Lincoln where your your whole tone God and country station [noise]\nSuper station one oh one\n\nCom he's all over the place he's a he's a media traveler if you will the magical media traveling that can be a good theme song through Jeff war on that first year that body good to hear from going on there you go man just before\nWe got to get him back in Studio soon ... although it sounds like he's in Studio when a little ... and it was a little I was doing a little hot is a little bit and it's All right it worked out two oh five nine four one one zero one one ticket more of your calls coming up next [noise]\n[noise] do you want to do enough I'm Coleman W why do you um Birmingham W two or three Seventy ...

I. D. E. dot com Andrew ...\nWent to one W why the dot com [noise] going back to Donald Trump\nLast night in Mississippi talking about a doctor\nFor I don't really like to call her doctor for Christine forward\nAnd saying she don't remember anything which is true she doesn't remember a lot of stuff or timelines changed uh in in several several instances it's changed it didn't just change one time of\nUh you know I said it was the late eighties it was the early eighties change like five times right from you know what she originally said from or therapists note from what she said the committee and all that stuff none of it winds up\nAlso Donald Trump mentioned\nIvy on today have read sleazy lawyer ivy on day pause before he said it too which is why I think it was intentional you I don't think it was it was totally intentional I Know who have ...\nShe knows he ... he did that to make them feel dumb\nYeah I don't know I I think Trump really just he must pronounces stuff\nAll the time I Know it does okay so think about if somebody famous was like trying to talk about you and they're like that all Andrew Lane she'd be like oh yeah I mean it's like a dagger in the heart a little bit you're not quite as important as you thought you were\nAndrew I'm not at the end you Elaine [laughter]\nLet's just judge it for what it's worth the if you can not body language but just listened to see if you think he's doing this on purpose gone think he is and I think that's why pauses\nI don't recall\n[laughter]\nOh he does impulse I probably cause somebody to to\n... well he did a little bit named a brain or the young today\nOkay this is talk on tape mainly because\nHe has a sleeping bag I mean Donald Trump preach so much truth or somebody else in a in a uh the\nThe mood to breach the truth is if you will in the mode is Lindsey Graham they have this thing called the the Atlantic festival and it's the Atlantic the publication where they've been bringing people up and having them speak I think John\nKerry was there some others Lindsey Graham was there and they want to talk about the Kavanaugh stuff well Lindsey Graham\nTurned around and gave them a dose of their own medicine and started bringing up the bill Clinton's victims I don't even know them accuses anymore I call them the big Willie victim yeah if you will here's what Lindsey Graham said\nAt that at land at a festival just ah I think this was earlier today that this went down and listen to this\nSo President Trump went through a factual and dish and that I didn't particularly like and I was telling knock it off you're not helping but it can\nBe now he's referring to somebody ... he's referring to Trump's comments are about\nChristine for two weeks\nBut it can be works you can actually kill somebody\nUh about Christine for two weeks\nBut it can be works you can actually kill somebody kept\nIn touch with their tires that get him to shut up so ooh now he's referring back to one either Broderick\nWho uh\nHad at three or four tires flattened in an interview with Hannity she said that she had her cat came up missing and that a stranger came up to her and\nBasically talked\nTo her about her cat was a good cat in the past tense as if it's dead now why do you ever found her cat but ah the person here's here's her a I'm Sorry this was caffeine while we that\nI said Juanita Broderick she said um\nThat in and when talking a handy she says I didn't run into him he approached me one morning he alluded to the fact he eluded to my cat by name in the past tense he said how is that how is he was a nice cat\nHe said that bull's eye was a nice cat\nI guess ... unfortunate handy goes on to say and that was a that was a direct threat you believe on the eve of your testimony to let you know that the cats gone even further testimony testify against Bill Clinton and what happened to her she said yes and that was followed by\nHoward your children oh wow and he named them by name that was followed up by\nThis naming a very dear friends to the children\nThat was fired by did you ever get those tires fixed so this stranger like when I was threatening literally threatening her on the eve of her going to testify against big willing\nOr you know what he said I don't even understand what that means well you don't remember\nWillie in one eight of Roger so you don't at all I don't remember the thing about the cat but what what's the what's the point is that Donald Trump would have said something even worse so we always think of all one is that we've come a long way\nWe'll come a long way or if I find it's what do you like it or not I really don't care here's the point I've seen what happened to these women in Nineteen Ninety eight they came for I don't live with the president said last night\nAt the first person to say I want to hear from Dr Ford I thought she was handled respectfully I thought ... was treated like crap\nYeah voters yourself\n[laughter] you know good will lose yourself\nHe was treated much crap but did you notice this guy did and I'm not sure who the guy is that that Lindsey Graham's up there with the but once he realized where Lindsey Graham was going and bring up the bill Clinton stop he trying to\nSay oh he's shutting down the road that thought he was almost like panicked about it\nAnother thing and since we're talking about Clinton accusers the irony is that Hillary Clinton was at the same planet festival and ironically she was asked about Christine\nFourth I'm a sense of fairness that there's a lot to be concerned about right I Want to ask you a question about Dr for for a minute if\nThere are a lot of Democrats who are a lot of other people who are absolutely certain hundred percent\nHer her recollection is the absolute truth I'm asking this as a lawyer do you feel a hundred percent certain that the events that she described um\nAre true and are therefore disqualify\nOh here comes y'all here it comes to the same Hillary Clinton\nShe described a\nR true and are therefore disqualify\nOh here comes the all here it comes to the same Hillary Clinton that threatened Bill Clinton's accusers said that they were full of it and they were uh uh I don't even remember all the quotes actually watch the video from the other day what do you think Hillary has got to say about Christine Ford who is accusing with zero evidence\n[noise] look I I watch as much of her testimony as I could\nFound her very credible\nYou have to ask yourself why would anybody put themselves through this if they did not believe that they had important information or to convey to the Senate she basically said that she thought it was her civic duty ah so I found I found her presentation I found for a\nWillingness to say I don't remember that but I remember this\nOr to be a very convincing and by the fact I I felt did you hear that swell of you know the fact\nJust because this stuff is out there it is definitely a disc qualifier even if he's innocent\nKavanaugh should withdraw for the greater good of the nation that from Michael Hayden who is now exposed himself\nAs a partisan hack\nJust like his buddy James Comey Andrew McCabe

I'm seeing reports that five\nPolice officers have been shot in some sort of active shooter situation or I don't know if it's the fact that this was brand new information or what have we didn't do it uh but I Can't find a lot of info on it other than uh\nSee who is that this is W. B. T. W. news Thirteen\nThe two of us are but I Can't find a lot of info on it other than uh\nWe'll see who is this this is W. B. T. W. news Thirteen which seems to be a CBS station in the area\nOr maybe outside of the area I don't know they're saying brief Florence county officers are yeah three four Orange County deputies and to city officers had been shot\nNear ... wrote in Florence none of us probably know where that's at but I'm just that the number of police officers involved in that is\nReally a really\nCrazy so if if I get any more information on that all obviously let you guys know but it's either\nI I don't want to say at the faulty news report I ... I just think it may be so new that there's not any information out there on it but as soon as we find something we will uh\nWill bring that to ya out of Florence South Carolina sad situations I have no idea that there's that's involved or what the active shooter who the active shooter in any of that\nThe the details of that are very vague but we're going to keep an eye on it as we also keep an eye on Capitol Hill as word is coming around that the FBI is done with their investigation they did not interview\nA Christine for nor did they interview Brett Kavanaugh said Democrats are already calling it a sham\nBefore they even see the report we will see what happens with all that we've been kind of all over the board the day but we've talked a lot about a Trump last night in his comments on Christine for saying that you don't remember anything except for the fact that she had one beer that night\nShe does remember that and now it's given found her to the left and they lost their mind over the whole thing and you know per usual no surprise there are another thing and we told you all this was going to happen ... since the FBI investigation got kicked off there would be more accusations coming out\nAnd we've told you about three or four since last friday but the newest one is another Michael ... clients shocking shocking enough just as Julie sweat Nick his other quiet as her\nI'm gang rape Rene accusation\nStarts to implode or he's released yet another sworn affidavit from this time and anonymous accuser who claimed she saw Brent Kavanaugh trying to force him cellphone women at various highschool parties\nIn spite parts\nAnd spiked porch he tweeted out this sworn statement allegedly from an anonymous person\nGets ah looks like it's ... it's got the black

he's got a ton of yeah bugs may not be\nSo lonely Andrew Jessica you know I appreciate watch out there doing it okay\nAnd we appreciate you brother there's a there's\nCriticizing Lindsey Graham's at that point in his life and I mean I've gotten to this point to where you just stop caring whether that's right or wrong and and I think that's where he's at and that's where that buys feeling comes from he's just like I don't care what you think I'm going to say what I think I don't put it out there and you can ...\nCalling the honey badger near Atlantic ... honey badger hunter ... knew we could at this point with him\nBrian how are you a afternoon a Andrew and Jessica the Republicans have made a sheer strategic mistakes\nWith flaky flake\nAnd unfortunately the press doesn't fail to call me to get mine ... tail it to the public [noise]\nAh ... flaky flake said that he was not going to vote and vote for judge Kavanaugh unless we had another FBI investigation Trump should have said OK flaky flight we're going to give you that extra FBI investigation\nBut you're going to have to do something for us\nTrump should have said OK flaky flight we're going to give you that extra FBI investigation but you're going to have to do something for us if this FBI investigation does not shed any new light on this you're going to have to promise to vote for him\nThere you go I Would have been going all they ... they missed the boat that they have done it yeah and another quick\nThing or two uh forgot time\nUh my newspaper is the Decatur communist daily\nIt's one of the most radical newspapers probably in the whole state in their all time running a negative articles negative or political cartoons and uh and the uh Tuesday Decatur communist daily they ran a nasty political cartoon\nAnd even though it was his radio I can describe it where you can visualize it real easy it depicts Mrs Ford walking down the sidewalk\nAnd on both sides of the side wall there's dozens of these angry looking old man with clubs and sticks in their hands in there and waiting to adjust club the snot out of every\n... storage right\nAnd the title of this a cartoonist profile in courage for ms forward if this a political cartoon was actually correct it would have judge Kavanaugh walking down through there and it would be Nancy Pelosi and\nMaxine Waters and choked on a bunch of the liberal Democrats fiction to swing hit him with clubs and then I Would have been an accurate card thing\nIt would I mean even if you think the main players out of it you can just paint a picture of how people are actually acting at these protests if you go a with a pro cabinet assigned to one of the road that that's what happened on the campus\nAnd they'll rip design out of your hands and and if they don't attack you they'll definitely threaten the attack you until you leave a that would have been correct maybe they need a new cartoon and\nOne other quick thing I was listening to a national talk radio guy believe it was yesterday and he had a gas to own that will say speech expert and he listened to Mrs Ford's testimony and he didn't care about what she said it was how she said it\nAnd he said based on my training spirits he said Mrs Ford was not talking in her normal a voice and he said it looked at him like that she had been a\nA school and how to change her voice right to make it sound like she was a teenager and he said teenagers teenage girls at the end of a word or a sentence sometimes the tone will go up a little\nBit inflection you are right and that would make sense because the deal is when they put the pictures up on the screen on the news and stuff they'll they'll put a current picture of having all of them will put the high school picture of somebody like\nDr Ford and trying to make people think and look this guy the one that attack this girl the optics recalled Brian I got a break to five nine one one zero one one also quick shout out\nTo dampen Bailey
