or\nRight well as it will reveal his true colors that's right a\nA major McLean jets go here as well jumped Scott how are you today\nUh I'm good you know I had a little bit of an experience in a gas station over the weekend I Want to tell you about um a walk in and there's a there's only one person in front of me so I'm like I'm going to be in and out I'm just trying to get myself a Dr Pepper alright which is like a little treat myself oh the the LDP and there's uh\nThere's a there's only one person in front of me sunlight but I'm going to be in and out I'm just trying to get myself a Dr Pepper alright which is like a little treat for myself over the LDP and there was a lady in front of me and she is chit chatting with the uh the cashier lady which is fine but it goes on for I don't know eight nine minutes and I'm just standing there\nAnd I realized the cashier is telling the lady how she apparently has some sort of anxiety issues\nAnd she's basically trying to solicit medication on to this woman oh I don't know if she's really noticing this as much as I Am but she doesn't fall into it and she's like I have a good day said lady leaves\nAnd then the the gas station attendant start talking to me I'm so sorry that we take so much time chit chatting unlike us you know ... ... fine she goes out here's what I was telling her she goes back to the whole thing is though I haven't been standing there for nine minutes listening to your life story\nAnd I thought to myself because I'm having negative thoughts about this person and I thought you know what I should I should put on the uh do the right attitude art stop thinking about myself maybe she's got some issues here out you know\nAnd I'm like you know what I'm going to start\nWanting us into this like I'm telling you know what you should just pray about it and just see maybe seat God to to kind of help you with your anxiety and I said you know and I'll be praying for you and she looked at me with the most disgusted look on her face I've ever seen and as I turn to walk out the gas station all she does it start yelling\nAt the same thing you know over\nAnd over again as I scurry very quickly out of the gas station and it was um\nI realize that she wanted methods right then and it was then that I realized that my efforts to encourage this woman or in vain right she did not want to hear anything I had to say she really just wanted me to offer her apparently some ... ... for Jesus ... that's right and then and no other order would have a\nWhat a fit so I don't know it was bizarre I've never had that happen to me before and and what I got caught me off guard is obviously she thought that that was going to work that tactic would have actually gotten me to a point rather than like you know what I have some in my purse let me go get you some\nShe may have been able to scare you out of some ... and\nIf I had some it's somewhat them worked um so I don't know I don't think so all she did scare me enough to where I don't think I'll be going back there no I don't I don't want to hear that again and I don't want to be screened at as a well run out the gas station\nA may be time to go ahead and fall for disability\nYeah that might be good oh go ahead and take it on to the house she even told me that she had so much anxiety that she went ahead and divorced her ex husband thinking he was the problem they realize he wasn't but it was too late and I thought well okay I thought she tried everything and apparently even divorce that more so she's anxiety ridden\nNow she's uh I ... and single\nYes and working in the gas station so mean whatever I used to work in a gas station there is no shame in that but um it was just an interesting moment of my life\nJust to start off talking about this this new trade\nDeal between Mexico and Canada and the U.S\nDonald Trump tweeted early this morning about four thirty AM if those of you that are nerds like the rest of us and you get Donald Trump's Twitter notifications sent straight to your phone right you got this uh for thirty this morning late last\nNight's are deadline we reached a wonderful new trade deal with Canada to be added into the deal already reached with Mexico the new name will be the United states and Mexico Canada agreement\nOr us MCA you\nAs soon as he I Know that any more it's not at all okay it is a great deal for all three countries solves many of the mistakes in NAFTA greatly opens markets to our farmers a manufacturer of reduces trade barriers to the\nUs and we'll bring all three great nations to gather in competition with the rest of the world the U.S MCA is a historical transaction congratulations to Mexico and Canada\nSee Trump can be nice course he's ecstatic over this whole thing and he wanted to do a bit of a victory lap as he should and he is a well within his rights to do so they\nTook to the rose garden today\nThey took to the rose garden and and Trump made the announcement\nTold everybody with what's going to be happening and then decided to take some questions okay well\nOf course the question start off not about this uh ...\nAnd questions okay well\nOf course the question start off not about this a miraculous in and uh I'm truly great achievement\nBut about the Kavanaugh stuff and and what Trump has or hasn't done\nInterfering in the FBI investigation All right by the way that's that's the thing Trump's already interfering in the in the capital FBI background check investigation not are interesting yeah I didn't realize that but\nAnd he wants to hear questions about the trade deal and really we all do because that's when they're in the first place\nUm reporters go straight in for the ... stuff and Donald Trump so master fully during this press conference dictated the way it was going to go and of course they're very brash way Donald Trump does\nBut right off the bat as it is they start doing this he's like no we're not asking those questions maybe on the back side but not right now we're talking trait which I could sit down and shut up one after another\nGuy he he holds handled them manhandled told them hey we are not talking about ... at\nThis moment we will do it\nA little bit later in this press or in this this um ceremony if you will at one point this er and I don't know who the ship was with she uh oh it was a CNN reporter\nAnd she was staying in in the ... she was not happy with Donald Trump was only taking trade questions at the time and again he eventually took Kavanaugh of questions but this is a reporter\nWas upset that he wasn't ready to take cabin on questions I Want you to listen to this exchange right here we're ready Jessica\nThing ever done and try and make it sound as bad as a civil but this one's stuff this one people coming out for this one and saying that's incredible what we've been able to do yes behind useless\nMr President now that you've answered several questions on trade I'd like to try to do you do have she gives me do you have a question of dread well even one or two more questions waitress several questions don't do that that's not identify somebody just before\nYou excuse me don't do that you have a question on

African trade question but he's like well that's an ... not doing it right now would you stop after three to my children yeah well and they're acting like children so God and then there was another one\nOkay that he was trying to be nice and trying to be funny you know and in his own way and she'd get up\nAnd uh it says something about I wasn't uh I wasn't thinking about it he accused her of looking like she was shocked that it hold on her yeah did he called on her here's how that went down there\nSo we need steel\nBadly for defense I'm very proud of what's happened with the steel industry okay question yeah go ahead sure\nShe shocked that I picked her it's like of the state of shock [laughter] I'm not thinking that that's okay I Know you're not thinking these overdue\n\nIt's like the state of shock [laughter] I'm not thinking of that sort of hey I Know you're not thinking you never do\nThat kinda hearkens back to the you know there are some days it's a man that's\nA or that disease any better than that\nJock that I picked her as a state of shock [laughter] I'm not thinking of that sort of hey I Know you're not thinking you never do [laughter]\nGo ahead please as we get Mr President you said that it tends to uh can't I Can't even deal with that\nThen that'll be Morning Joe will pick that up tomorrow or discriminated against women ... good\nThough God I Can't get enough of that I was I was eating it up and then there's that whole press conference I was kicked back in my office I'm like man this is is it better than any prime time\nShow going on TV whatever the case it better than any wrestling match right better than a wrestling match the Monday Night raw whatever the case\nAnd this is this is Donald Trump man handling the press if he dies better than any body else\nI enjoy these more than I enjoyed the Trump rallies by the way I think there's one in Tennessee tonight there was one of the west Virginia over the weekend you're gonna see a lot of those Trump rallies happening uh over the\nNext month because you know the midterms come up on November six if I'm not mistaken so he's going to be on a campaign for Republicans in and making it happen let me uh let me take a couple of phone calls before we hit bottom of the hour and then we'll get into some kind of an almost up genes is up first what's up gee\nI'm ready to harness that my big beautiful huge Brian is\nAre we waiting you know I\nJust I Can't take it anymore just waiting for too much I Can't you know ... over ...

Want to go back to not wanting so much I think otherwise let's say all of that\nWell he did say days that we'd get tired of winning there'd be so much winning that you get tired\nOf it right here we

third person makes it even better oh it's good it's good William is next\nYeah a first time caller hey buddy it's a good show\nI'm just want to say two things number one you realize that China is now making noise is that they're manufactured\nGood show I'm just want to say two things number one you realize that China is now making noises that they're manufacturing sector is going down hill\nOh yeah definitely that's a good say it is and secondly\nIt's amazing to me the amount of stuff that is never filled out all the cabinet I'll deal\nBut it's out there but people don't want to report on let me let me clue you in go to the whole to the first amendment and read her ... year book and it might you might find it incredibly shocking what this woman who was doing in school\nAnd that you're talking about the first accuser right yes\nOkay what do you need and what was she did it in high school\nWell the highlight of the junior party or for that particular year the best party ever was me and to my girlfriend's dressed up as playboy bunnies and hiring a mail server to go down to ...\nAbout this one but I Want to start off\nWith this report\nThat was received by Republicans on the committee from the prosecutor from I'm\nFrom Arizona that they hired Rachel Mitchell was her name\nShe gives them a report outlining what she thought of that now we reported last\nWeek that she said there's no way I or anyone else would bring this\nAnywhere near a courtroom which I feel like we've heard those words before to quote a famous former FBI Director no reasonable prosecutor would pursue this right it's the same case here but actually like for real and not just were saying it for political reasons\nI looked through the full report and got a couple of bullet points out of there and I and I want to read you these bullet points that came straight from her report that kind of some a lot of this stuff up\n\nShe lays it out she says uh first off in a July six text to the Washington Post Christine Blasey Ford said\nThat this incident happened in the Nineteen eighties I'm Sorry the mid Nineteen eighties that's what she said no tax to the Washington Post in her July thirtieth ladder to Senator Feinstein she said it happened in the early eighties\nThen her August seventh statement to the a polygraph ever\nSaid that it happened one high school summer in the early eighties so think about this she started off\nTelling people what was in the late eighties moved all the way from a late eighties to the early eighties and then at that point was able to pinpoint that have happened in the summer in the early eighties\nThen she crossed out the word early enter statements for reasons we don't really know\n\nA September sixteenth Washington Post article reported that Dr Ford said it happened in the summer of Nineteen eighty two\nSo she's making her way now that she's seen calendars from Kavanaugh and all this other stuff she's starting to get to where she can pinpoint it you know\nThe Washington Post article reported that notes from an individual therapy session in two thousand Thirteen show were as describing the salt as occurring in her late teens but she told the post and the committee that she was Fifteen when the alleged\nAssault occurred I don't think any of us would consider Fifteen or late teens I Would have no right or\nSo the timeline of the the trauma she claims the event left her ... ... it raises questions she alleges according to this report she alleges that she struggled academically in college but she never made any similar\nClaim about her last two years of high school that's relevant because her final two years of high school were the two years immediately after the incident that's why I'm as important she or the prosecutor moves on to lay out how Ford's version of what happened\nHas been every bit the moving target as ... as far as the timeline of the event\nIt she said\nBeen every bit the moving target as ... as far as the timeline of the event\nIt she said\nWhen speaking to her husband Dr Ford changed her description of the incident\nTo become less specific Dr Ford testify that\nShe told her husband about a sexual assault before they were married\nBut she told the Washington Post that she informed her husband she was the victim of physical abuse\nAt the beginning of their marriage she testified that both times she was referring to the same incident so there's no question there\nMitchell then goes on and explains that Ford's inability to remember where the house or where the events took place raises significant questions and those were an inability to remember how she got from the party back to her house\nShe said she told the Washington Post that the party took place more than seven miles from her childhood home\nThat it was a roughly twenty minute drive from her childhood home she also agreed for the first time in her testimony that she was driven somewhere that night either to the party or from the party or both\nBut she has no memory of who drove her or when north anybody come forward to identify him or herself as the driver given that this all took place before cell phones arranging a ride home would not have been easy\nNecessarily you know and I read that and I don't let that ever cross the line before but back in the day and then you probably you're a little bit younger than me but we experienced as to that that was it was not a thing where you just pick up your cell phone to be like hey can you can take me up at five and you had to sign up land line and and all of that there was no like given the battery and pull your cell phone out kind of deal right\nAnd then she goes on to say indeed she stated that she ran out of the house after coming downstairs and did not state that she made a phone call from the house before she did or that she called anyone else there after\nDr Ford testified that are friendly Lynn apparently the only other girl at the party did not follow up with Dr Ford after the party to ask why she suddenly disappeared don't you think you would do that\nOr I Know I Would if you're a BF fast just disappeared from the partying\nRight and you never\nYou never would speak of it again right\nSo in the Feinstein letter Ford makes it sound as if as though she's hearing the conversation downstairs was her signal that it was safe for her to leave the bathroom we remember this part\nSo then this prosecutor mental points out the glaring inconsistencies and forwards accounts of who and how many people attended the Nineteen eighty two house party not the late eighties house party not the early eighties house party but the summer of eighty two because we get to that point [noise]\nAccording to the Washington Post accounted for therapy notes there were four boys in the bedroom in which she was assaulted she told the post that to notes were erroneous because there were four boys at the party but only two in the bedroom\nThat's often party right now for people for people\nIn her letter to Feinstein she said me and for others were present at the party in her testimony she said that there were four boys in addition to wheeling Kaiser\nAnd herself\nCannot remember the name of the fourth boy and no one's come forward Dr Ford lifted Patrick Smith PJ as a bystander inner statement to the ...\nShe cannot remember the name of the fourth boy and no one's come forward Dr Ford lifted Patrick Smith PJ as a bystander enter statement to the polygraph are and in her July six text of the Washington Post although she testified that it was an accurate to call him a bystander\nShe did not list legal and Kaiser even though they're good friends Leland Kaiser's presence should've been more memorable than PJ Smith\nPresidents that should be F F again\nSo why would for a failed to know in her a polygraph statement that her best friend Leland Kaiser was at the party a woman who is still a lifelong friend\nDespite their friendship Jessica Kaiser maintains under the penalty a felony\nShe has no memory of this house party and that she has never even met cabinet that's problematic and when she was asked about that at the hearing she said she's got some health problems\nOh okay I Gotcha and that's why I smoke and ... and something that wasn't in the report that and I don't know if we talked about on the show last week but she claims that she was in the bedroom\nAnd that they turn the music up to drown out her potential screens right well if it's an empty bad room number one why is there a music playing in the bedroom and you know I mean that just see if the parties downstairs there also a party and an empty bad right where no one else in his music playing right\nAnd then and that kind of or\nThat kind of clashed with her story of I could hear them talking downstairs right if the music was in fact that loud a Dr\nFord struggled to remember her interactions with the Washington Post that's another point of uh importance\nShe could not remember if she showed a full or partial taxed or a set of the therapy notes to the Washington Post reporter she doesn't remember whether she showed the post reporter the therapist notes\nSo she can't remember what happened a couple of weeks ago that right okay\nOr she couldn't remember if she showed the reporter her own summary of the notes\nThe Washington Post article says the portions of her therapist notes were provided by forward and review review by the post but in her testimony Ford could not recall whether she summarize the notes for the reporter or showed her the actual documents\nShe does not remember she actually had a copy of the notes when she tax of the Washington Post\nOn July sixth you can touch the Washington Post well yeah apparently thing I don't know about the X. them through the ... oh okay\nA Ford said in her first what's that message to the post that she had a therapy notes talking about the incident where she contacted the post tip line\nIf this is all bull crap [noise]\nWhich is highly unlikely\nShe's already lied under oath what is she going to do in this FBI background or investigation comes

I ask your personal opinion about his calendar 'cause I'm just being a hundred percent human I was like really I mean I don't I mean I I'm a cabin on the border I I don't think the guy's guilty but

him is that what you're going to do is that the first thing you're going to do and you get on the Supreme Court or trying to overturn roe versus when he's like no you know and he kept referring back to\nPrecedent Annette and he many decided once you said it a million times we're all tired of hearing it but they still just run with that\nI and I I I I feel so sorry for him I feel so sorry for family like I said I generally on the opposite calling a lot of times you got but I said to death of Doug Jones and the way he's not NATO stay in one way or the other\nIs adding like Switzerland

before I well I you know just like this got subway\nThat's got to get a Roy Moore\nOkay well ... anyway it's it's it's disgusting and what they've done obviously but\nThe fact that Doug Jones in and other Democrats involved in the ... have have literally gone against kind of if they're being genuine and they're wanting to get to the truth and they're really concerned about sexual assault that was perpetrated on this woman\nThey are literally saying because Brett Kavanaugh is a man\nWe believe Christine Ford\nAnd it can be you know other than gender and just look at it the fat nothing else makes sense you know\nEnded up having all then it all you know they would let me it would have been a completely different yeah yeah\nI mean that they may you know that could have easily they just started not looking at any of that and the fact that they hide the fact that Democrats Hadi is what I think is the worst part of the whole political as\nWell say say Christine for rape ... all the Democrats would say oh that's reverse right he forced her right rape him so she re time right [laughter] ... reverse you want to yeah I got\nBanks buddy I got good to hear from you I gotta I gotta go

uh either Google Search will get your number but in case you want it and again I'm from the school of thought of Doug Jones is going to vote no anyway so make it more likely that he doesn't serve another term\nUh two ... two two to four forty one twenty four two O. two\nTwo to four forty one twenty four [noise]\nAnd if a direct one to Doug ... column out dug in any way\nI mean you saw what the are the voices dead the Jeff Flake as he's on the elevator and when they're screaming in his face screaming\nPack of coyotes\nI'm not saying get up and down giants they start screaming that maybe if he gets enough pressure from the public I mean you just never know the power of a voice well don't\nI mean you know just don't do Maxine Waters and hey you know if you see these people out in public attack um yeah you know verbally or such as ... in such a [laughter] or you know a a senator and or the such as ah the Doug Jones in such as\nUm yeah that that's or whatever it is the thing is is we're on the side of the hour we're so civilized in the way we\nHandle these kinds of issues you got one side that wants to confront people at a restaurant or whatever the case and scream at them and their wife and their family\nTo the point of those people are scared for their safety and sometimes worse\nAnd then you have on our side where yeah we may get on the radio and yell and scream and events\nAnd sometimes worse and then you have on our side where yeah we may get on the radio and yell and scream invent and event that's perfect corn and vent\nBut the way we look to make changes not by getting in their face and screaming at emitted at the polling place\nMaybe wearing an ad in some screening though I mean could it if if we're not being as belligerent as them if we try to find someone that's a little ... on the left if there is anyone um maybe we can make it I mean they just may start making a sane and I've got some of these hearings and just do what they I don't know I'm I'm just putting it out there as options yeah\nWell the problem is there's there's hardly any squishy that's true and most of us are working right so hard even red state Democrats it's hard to find some of those that are ... although you know you've got um [noise]\nAh from Virginia Joe Manchin who is somewhat of a squishy Democrat but I I don't I don't have faith in his party enough to allow him to vote yes on Kavanaugh yeah and the fact that Trump trash to admit the it's\nGoing to be and Riley yeah I'm going to be an issue than just forget that\nAnyway anyway um the FBI investigation uh itself\nIs and will be causing a problem for Kavanaugh\nAnd I'm not saying it's gonna it's going to\nResult in the un desired outcome but when we come back on the other side I Want to give you examples that show where we could and will likely be headed\nThroughout this week now I've literally been sitting on pins and needles all day waiting for a new accusation that come out\nThere have been more accusations outside of these three accusers that haven't picked up steam but all it takes is one more Christine forward\nOr one more ah Deborah Ramirez or one more or whatever the ... name is okay I don't have it in front of me\nAll it takes is one more wind that\nOne more female to\nContact her Democrat Senator or Dianne Feinstein or whoever to start opening the floodgates\nBut that's what I was asking last week are they gonna then once this is complete and the whole thing about a week's not long enough walk heard earlier today that the FBI said they could be done with this as early as tomorrow so that's the discussion it's not you know Republicans saying you have until tomorrow so if they're able to\nWrap it up and potentially by tomorrow before the end of the week then obviously they know what they're doing but is it is it they got to be OK well what about Rodrigues we need an FBI investigation to that and then when that scientists are going to be ... what about the third woman we'd right I mean are they going to just keep doing this\nRight in the fields Dave writes in he says Andrew I stand with my Democrat brothers and sisters all female accuser should be you believe simply because they are women and women cannot lie or be wrong\nWomen are always right that's what my wife said anyway [laughter] [noise]\nOh yeah next to does scare and she says Andrew has

I. D. E. dot com here's why\nThere's FBI investigations spells bad news Jessica [noise]\nThere have been other accusations against Brett Kavanaugh that haven't been widely reported for one reason or another one of those is a former yelled basketball player who claims to socialize with Brett Kavanaugh when when they were in college\nHe issued a statement late yesterday about Kavanaugh's drinking and he recounted the story about cabinet and starting a fight his name is Chad\nLondon in London says\nYes he's an associate professor in North Carolina State University he told the New York times last night because the New York times on these other reporters are finding everybody from his college here and they're asking them questions Dick and he said when Brad got drunk he was often belligerent and aggressive\nOn one of the last occasions I purposely socialized with Brett I witnessed him respond to a semi hostile remark\nNot by diffusing this situation but by throwing his beer in the man's face in starting a fight that ended with one of our mutual friends in jail\nThat seems like you could really dig and trying to figure out if that shirt somebody ended up in jail than the police were involved All right All right okay well then let's dig well let me put that out there without first going to the cops and trying to find that police report\nSaid he plans on providing a statement about the alleged by the FBI today whether he's done that or not I don't know but he went on to say that he felt like Kavanaugh lied to the Senate Judiciary committee last Thursday in regards to his drinking habits\nHe's been Brett was a frequent drinker and heavy drinker I Know because especially in our first two years of college I often drink with him on many occasions I heard Brett slurring his words and saw him staggering from alcohol consumption\nOften drink with him on many occasions I heard Brett slurring his words and saw him staggering from alcohol consumption not all of which was beer\nIf he lied about his past actions on national television and more especially while speaking under oath in front of the United States Senate I Believe those lies should have\nConsequences now keep in mind we have a another professor here this one from North Carolina state NC State wolf pack\nWhy does everybody that comes out against Brett Kavanaugh seemed to be\nExtremely left leaning think that's a coincidence [laughter] and and I'm not saying that I Know this this Chad ... or ... London to and\nI don't know is political affiliation but if I got to place a bet on whether any given college professor university professor as liberal or not\nTen times out of ten I'm going to put more money on his liberal yeah well I think that's a safe that like we all know the state of universities in two thousand and Eighteen so that's an accusation that's come out\nSince the FBI investigation and got a got kicked off and they're going to continue to ... even though that one's not a of sexual nature it is yet another accusation Mitch trying to paint him as a liar in front of the Senate Judiciary committee here's another one\nThe Senate Judiciary committee received a letter from a man who made a rape claim against Kavanaugh what\nA mayor in ... well listen I let me tell you the story you didn't write but man okay or he's not alleged ...\nBut this guy\nSent a letter to the a Judiciary Committee\nAnd\nHe said that a\nJudge Kavanaugh raped one of his friends back in the Nineteen eighties he said he and another friend went to beat judge Kavanaugh up then said he recognized him recently on television when\nA he was giving his testimony\nSo you don't tell authorities you don't tell a parent you just go to beat them up in every day but you never tell anyone that a rapist is on the loose\nRight just went to beat him up I don't guess he ever did or didn't know that part but he made that claim to the Judiciary Committee\nThey haven't named the guy but they said after reporters tracked this guy down\nHe recanted and says the story wasn't true\nChuck Grassley was not happy about it because the committee asked the FBI and this was Saturday asked the FBI to investigate this guy who made this unfounded\nRape claim wasting the FBI's resources\nAnd the man to exactly what Grassley said he said we wasted a precious resources on trying to track this guy down and getting a statement from him and it shows you that Republicans are taking these accusations serious but this guy made a claim\nAfter after the testimony\nThe FBI investigation and the point of that is the fact that the the the accusations are going to come out whether they're coordinating with the Democrats are they're just somebody that hates Trump or hates Kavanaugh\nThe point of that is the fact that the the the accusations are going to come out whether they're coordinating with the Democrats are they're just somebody that hates Trump or hates Kavanaugh and feels like they can throw an accusation out there and not have to back it up just to to stoke the fire of this stuff\nAnd it will continue to happen this week it will you'll see it again I saw two of\nBrett Kavanaugh's former classmates allegedly or when the two women that went to school one was at one time this Denver Ramirez his roommate\nThey go and Chris Cuomo and start telling their story which echoes what this guy was saying he was a belligerent drunks\nHe's lying under oath about ... drinking habits and all this other stuff and what I'll do is play you some of that interview when we get back on the other side\nBut it it's just ... you got to brace yourself guys you got to brace yourself because we are in for a lot of this stuff this week and when I say what I don't even really know what I mean by that\nBut you can guarantee yourself it's going to happen again back after this [noise]\nLast within ruined Jessica\nRefrained and sexually assaulting\nJust dry doesn't only or raping people write a gang writing them at that\nHate drink spare so that means Hillary scientifically right that's about ...

I Can't go to the FBI or at least as it relates to this particular matter we have made it known to the Senate Judiciary committee I've made it known publicly for a week now we want an FBI investigation\nMy client wants to sit down with FBI agents immediately I've made that clear I've asked for it repeatedly we haven't heard from the FBI this investigation is a scam\nIt's a sham and it's a ... job and we know that because the White House is controlling who get spoken to who gets investigated and who gets interviews\nSo now the FBI investigation three days in\nIs a sham it's a ... job and it's not suffice\nBecause the White House was involved in one way or another\nThe White House had to direct the FBI start the investigation and then told them to do whatever they had to do just don't go which on on it right to keep it within a timeframe of a week but we only made it till Monday\nBefore the FBI investigation wasn't enough\nSo they think that this is a sham but they're good with them you'll or investigation correct that's interesting\nMichel ... screamed for an FBI investigation\n\nThe FBI investigation and now says the FBI investigation as a sham which will be echoed by Democrats senators and everybody else who's on the opposite side of this thing they get what they want they scream it's not enough they want more\nWell I guess in that regard they probably wish this was the Mueller investigation that's probably the issue\nThat's they they are looking for nothing more than for Kavanaugh\nTo come out and say this is not worth it anymore it's destroying my name is destroying my family is it's it's it's whatever it's just it's too much and it's not worth it so I'm going to withdraw money down is their number one goal in in all of this\nThey're trying to wear 'em down they're wearing and\nDown and the longer this goes without him being confirmed the more the higher the chances that he'll get worn\nDown either him or Trump fondly saying you know what this and just pull 'em right I don't think he would do that but I mean at the St toms truck can be a little and unpredictable sometimes\nAlso another revelation where Kellyanne Conway was going back and forth with Jake Tapper over the weekend\nOr she actually revealed that\nShe herself as a victim of sexual assault and that doesn't mean that she has to believe are believed the woman listen to this killing it gone way on CNN\nFrankly for victims of sexual assault sexual harassment and break that [noise]\nI ...

I'd rather have your just because I'm now I'm Sorry but I just don't like the people\nUp somebody called end about actually I've been sitting here going over there is a true story fact and it comes from may I've been listening this now sets long enough I'm tired of it they're cheap claiming that women don't want that these attacks they don't lie about these things and that's not true\nFacts Nineteen eighty five Albuquerque New Mexico plays told similar medical product I was working on a shame that was supposed to be developing a test for\nFinding a HIV virus and blood Iran or worked in their auto crave a park bench clean room department was trained by a lady who on the third day I was working they're just trying to make me go in and do the work while she was saying outside the clean room and not working\nWhen I refused to not signed the logbook or not signed the tapes and the machines that's proving I was doing the work and she was not join in the next morning I was on second shift she went on the next morning his whole the supervisors losses that I was sexually harassing\nHer including Bruce comments contact trying to get him to have sex with me out there on the premises\nAll a lie I uh they my state which I make my chest Romney went on for three days with a loss of pay while they investigated it and I was called back Irish restored I was put back to my job position I was chastised eight my self and she was terminated because the security system in\nI was called back Irish restored I was put back my job I was chastised eight ... self that she was terminated because the security system in building show but I was doing the job I was in the clean room and your other job while she was sitting out in the foyer talking with her boyfriend\nAnd opening up the Cleveland area secure areas allowing building while they had this research going on into HIV positive\nWhile it's great and that's the truth that's fact I got to use the job I Love the job to job gave me the money to buy my dream motorcycle how to go away\nAnd I worked at that place until my motorcycle accident in Nineteen eighty six and that's the only reason I left a job because the actual so bad I could not recover in time to go back to work well that's the truth that's the fact\nWell and in just a points out the fact that that those kinds of things happen and they happen more often than I'm In any of us realize not to say the majority of the cases are like that but it it's a it's a reality it's a sad reality we've seen obviously high profile cases like\nDuke lacrosse in in Virginia through one of the Virginia\nTech and all this other stuff but you know it happens on level is Alan they're described you know that the Baptists story that you're you're not going to hear anywhere else over to gay but\nI don't know if that was just I don't think that's his name oh game\nJames well that was close and well it sounds similar deal I gave\nThat okay well I'm Still ... go ahead gave okay\nWhen I'm Around [laughter]\nLet's let the silk for for a second that ah\nThat Kavanaugh does that get a pick from and they they put a ... foot another a nominee up there a woman the woman that was on the shortlist for example if a woman at the same value system they plan as capital\nWhat are they going to do about her ...\nShe is a um she hates some sort of ethnicity or race or they're going to say she's racist I mean they can't go to sexual harassment route but it'll be that she hates some groups of people\nAnd they will all the time that they would attack her just as they attack as Sarah Huckabee Sanders or any other woman that the Trump surrounds himself with\nThey will a saying that she does not have the temperament or the uh the the fairness of mind to be on the Supreme Court simply because Trump likes her\nName is getting so they may not go with dirty as they've gone with Kavanaugh\nBut ah they'll go low\nFor a woman who ... especially if it's a woman but em meticulous if Donald Trump were to nominate an African American to be on the Supreme Court that's when you would see it get the worst it would be the nastiest at that point\nWe saw it with Clarence Thomas obviously but it's a it's a different level now if if the Democrat Party\nHas to go up against the person that they feel like they own which they do feel about African Americans that's when we see the worst come out\nEventually get anybody to chop nominate it's gotta be you know subject to all the\nThat's what drives every bit of this and that's because you think about it there's there's nothing that shows us that Brett Kavanaugh would do anything of this sort of like overturn roe v Wade or take rights away from women or any of this stuff although that's what we've been\nI'm a non would do anything of the sort of like overturn roe v Wade or take rights away from women or any of this stuff although that's what we've been told he is going to do with no proof whatsoever because they know that that's not true they need to scare tactics\nGetting back to prove what if they could come out say hey if you're making it that way your proof you don't have to prove it got up and move on and there you go\nOkay well persona I like that yeah it was good boy James appreciated buddy you know James is fired oh he really was or should I say gay but it's fired up over to Glenn Fred that's one of the table or watch\nThe glass or it spread prince okay what's up for what\nYou want to know what this is what happened to say but we're we're in our our country has been sick for a long long time getting sicker and sicker and sicker and paypal several say walk with the Democrats calls the illness\nThey are sick most people are sick while why is it pretty mild business all\nShe has had to put video cameras and and all kinds of security devices in our business because of this is she right here about she's a woman that don't trust other women what they might fly into business was wow that is\nAn odd because she's afraid something's gonna happen to a woman but she has to ensure that women aren't lying on other people\nListen to the employer she has is not all are are not going to bother wall period okay but book called just watch it is\nYou know there's another expense that you have to pass on the guest speaker you\nPass it on to you because at the by the security
