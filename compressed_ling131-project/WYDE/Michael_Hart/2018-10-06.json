I don't never know [laughter] double negative I don't\nNever know like 'cause we just talk to each other all the time it's just kind of how we communicate and yeah but then sometimes I'll listen back to the show and I'm like oh I'm interrupting too much or you know\nNo I Am well to interrupt there just I don't know if our listeners would know this or not ... but\nBut our studios right here in our office so it is kind of it's casual for me and to add we are just really talking to each other about a topic we are talking about and [laughter] and talk about every day and deal with all day long every day so it is kind of just the ebb and flow kind of conversation and I think you know get some benefit from\nYour in your conference room is on the left hand side of the studio and minds on the right hand side depends on what side of the table you know we we ... yeah right I guess yeah if I'm facing your way minds on the left and you're on the right if you're facing my way of yours is on the left and minds on the right\nThen I sell that right who cares [laughter] so we're going to talk about procrastination but but the other point I was going to make was let's put it through the lens of what really is on people's minds All right so let's think about\nAre the folks that we help mhm water they worrying about what's on their minds what are the big questions they have\nThe biggest question is will my money last yep that is number one that isn't that is number one and everything is part two is that really that will not money last do I have enough yup I'm what's gonna happen to me if something you know if I get sick or die well my family be okay\nOr or the reverse of that if something happens to my spouse will I be OK ally be OK Jacqueline um [noise] you know when can I retire is also a huge what you know [laughter] when can I get out of here and retire yeah and and how do I make\nSure that I'm not making a mistake so so you know I Want to you know we were talking about this recently and I think sometimes we\nHopefully we do a good job of explaining stuff to people but we need to make sure that that we are tying it to what they really care about is like it makes sense to us but sometimes I think that it's helpful for for our listeners\nIf we're clearly drawing that correlation yeah you know we're talking about procrastination well who cares everybody procrastinates why is that a big deal well it's a big deal because if you want to know when you can retire yeah or if you want to know if your money's going to last\nOr if you want to know if your family's going to be okay if something happens to you or if you're going to be okay if something happens to your spouse\nThere's a limited window of opportunity a lotta times on those things I mean you really want to take care of things before those things you know before you retire and the four things happen right and even if you've already retired let me say this too and he's already made some decisions around that\nThe things you know before you retire before things happen right and even if you've already retired let me say this to and have already made some decisions around that you know there are still opportunities you know that we can take advantage of or maybe fix or improve on those situations as well\nExactly so All right so now that we now that we've established widest procrastination murder let's talk about some specific surrounded what what do you see\nAre the reasons that people procrastinate typically as it relates to retirement planning as it relates to getting all this stuff figured out\nWell here's one that I don't see I hear a lot anymore but I hear it every once in a while and it's my parents never really did any retirement planning and everything just seemed to work out fine for them so surely things work out for me too\nYeah and you know it's a I think people are more aware than there used to be maybe yeah but there but I Do it and it makes sense right I mean I understand why people added field is wide understands help because what we learn from our parents was\nNever touched the principal live off the dividends and everything will be fine\nAnd enter and and I think even if people don't actually say that any more tattoo it does it is in the back of the folks as mines because\nBecause it is the ... their experience it is the experience of what their parents did there aren't seemed to be fine surely there'll be okay to even if they don't really feel that way it kinda puts a little it kinda puts you know sand in their boots they slow progress and they've all but we can wait longer\n... and so the point of this as is\nWe're not our parents anymore the world's not like our parents world was we're living longer we're having a different experiences the economy's different economics or different there's electronic trading now the world moves at a faster pace way faster than it used to\nWell in pensions used to be a lot more common than we are now yeah you know I think you just said this but you talk about this all the time you know the money has to last longer you know we're living longer right as a society\nAnd that's the number one thing people worry about is will my money last will my money last and that is the big question ...\nYou know in the idea of will just live off the interest in the dividends interest for as not what it was the interest rates are coming up a little bit yeah but not enough to know exactly where you can get any real interest rate a decent interest rate on bonds or you know CDs or anything like\nThat and so the the point in your head is is there's a lot of things that people do that might have been a good idea at the time even your parents to put things your parents did or were probably a great idea and maybe the only thing to do with the time that just like times have changed opportunities of change situations that change\nSo if you don't have to figure this out on your own that's that's really kind of impossible because you only retire at once so nobody gets good at no nobody ever gets good at retirement planning because they've only ... they're going to try at one time\nAnd it and if they're working with somebody that Darwin do retirement planning they don't do it either yeah so so they're getting advice so it's you know I don't know\nWhat people do right right I mean during the science is between a rock and a hard place because they're trying to do I mean\nThe the people that were we work with Tony they're smart successful people that know how to make good decisions a lot of them have a pretty deep knowledge of in investing in a lot of ways\nBut but they're not retirement planners their advisor their broker or their banker is a a retirement plan or\nAnd so\nThey've got these questions and they don't really feel like they're getting the answer right but they're not sure what to do yeah right\nAnd and and it's very listen this is all basis is meant to say this it's okay\nTo pull over and ask for directions [laughter] I mean it's okay to stop and ask for directions up it's kind of like this one time tied and I were driving to a wedding to it's a good friend of ours this has been many many years ago and are going to a wedding\nI don't like the way this has had [laughter] it doesn't make you look good [laughter] but there are stories that don't make me look good either so I'll I'll think of some of those while you're telling me this\nOne so anyway we're driving to a wedding and and I you know and we're in it's rural and we're up in the north part of the state and we are not familiar with the area and we keep getting lost and we don't know where every going and it's getting closer and closer to the kick off at a wedding if you will [laughter] it's like ten minutes to kick off and we're still not in it we don't know where we are\nAustin we don't know where we're going and it's getting closer and closer to the kick off of the wedding if you will [laughter] it's like ten minutes to get golf and we're still not in it we don't know where we are and\nWe're getting more and more lost and more frustrated and we're now we're fighting with each other going like why don't you just ask somebody like who can like I Can't find anybody so we we finally do finally find a gas station and we find out and we weren't\nFar off track because we thought we were it was just that there was a lot of twists and turns and and roads that look the same class with a bunch of trees on them\nAnd we couldn't get the GPS 'cause we're out in the middle of\n... yeah it was horrible and it was bad and so yeah we ended up a little bit late and had to slip into the back in ... was a little embarrassing but but we ended up having a great time and it was fine so the story ended up good but my point is that\nDon't wander around lost when there's help to be there I mean and so so let me say this so you know what tad here's what I Would recommend people be thinking about\nHow 'bout picture a day when you don't have to worry if you have enough money because you know you do\nYou know that you don't picture day when your health care cost recovered and you don't have to worry about that or when you can go visit your grandkids travel\nYou know you have enough money to help out the grandkids are the are the kids if they need it and you can swoop in and be the hero and help out with something picture a day when that can happen picture day when you know that all these things are taken care of\nSo today that day\nIs the first step pick up the phone and call nine ... triple zero six and figure out with us together how we can make all this stuff happened where you can literally stop worrying about this\nPicture that day when all this has done and taking care of and you can just go and do the things you love to do nine eight eight triple zero six\nWe have got to take a break now but when we come back we will continue to talk about a little bit of procrastination stuff and how that could impact people's ability to retire when they walk how it can impact their ability to have their money last\nUh after that we will talk about retirement uncertainties these are going to be huge issues that affect the big questions the big questions being will your money last winter and you retire or you're going to be okay here's your spouse going to be OK\nAll the things that\nKeep you up at night or a or what's on your mind in the morning if you're if you're trying to get near retirement so we're going to talk about all those things you do not want to miss this stay tuned\n[noise]\n\nAre you retired or about to retire and concerned about whether your money is going to last you worried about the volatility of the stock market\nWill the next market crash derail your retirement plans\nThese are the concerns that our client families had when they came to see us and that's exactly what our retire with freedom process

couple of investing in risk including the potential loss of principle [noise]\n\n[noise]\nOkay we're back and we're talking about retirement planning and the big question is will my money last ... last as long as the both of us do\nYou know what happens if we if we have a health care problem or something like that is or how long will we be taking care of how well my family be OK I'm when can I retire those kinds of questions all those questions or what we're answering today so a\nDraw closer and we'll talk more about that one of the big things that we're talking about now is procrastinating and putting it off 'cause it seems like it's in the distance here's a biggie [laughter]\nYou should have put in ... and your boots [laughter] hard somebody say one time um you know\nWhen it comes to when it comes to taking care of these things a lot of people are like a a metal man on a magnetic cow yeah right yes yes so that's so that's a procrastination across the nation across the nation area\nOr being a metal on metal person we don't want to be we don't want to exclude the ladies there's metal ladies on them on a magnetic couch to\nYeah there there are so one of the big ... this is one of the biggest I'm too busy oh yeah I'm too busy I'm busy at work and visit I mean one of the things is if you're too busy to figure out if you can quit being busy when are you if you wait till you're not busy you'll never do anything right because we're all too busy\nHow many times do you sit with folks that you know we've been working with him we we get them through you know they they finally retired turning the paperwork\nAnd one of my favorite favorite reviews to do with the client is is after they've retired you know how's it going how much every and you know what\nThey either say oh this is great this is terrific should have done it five years ago all these different things\nBut one of the babies are always here is I'm so busy now I have no idea how how I had a chance to work or any time and work all the [laughter] I'm busy doing everything I've got honey do list I've got things I'm doing a project you know stuff I've been putting off plus they throw in the fun stuff to travel the grand kids\nYou know sometimes they're now keeping the grandkids a couple of times a week there's just some lots of things going on\nSo the thing about this is is we're all busy I'm busy you're busy I mean we're busy doing things\nBut I think that people should ask themselves\nOr we busy just being busy or we busy actually accomplishing something it's okay to be busy with stuff that doesn't that's irrelevant and\nBusy just being busy or we busy actually accomplishing something it's okay to be busy with stuff that doesn't it's irrelevant and just frivolous and fun it's fun to but sometimes it's tend to like accomplish something and say I need to clear out all the\nEmpty busy work and really say All right right now and lift my head up I'm ten five years away from retirement\nWhat matters to me if that's something I'm interested in doing if I Would like to figure out do do we have enough for a little behind you know what do we need to do if I'd like to figure that out now is probably the time to do that because um I got to focus on that little more that wasn't that important when I was forty but now it's becoming very important\nWell and and I know this is true for you too but if if people are already retired mhm than in I Would say about half the people that come see us are already retired and about half of them are still working planning on it if they're already retired than their big concern is\nAnd I think a lot of times people\nYou know feel like they don't know where to start like you said because it's the first time they've done this in him and they're not going to get good at it because they're only going to do at once right you know you're in less your retirement plan and you're never going to be good at retirement plan right I mean the things I've done once I'm not very good at right\nUh and I think some of that also is that you know maybe they're they're worried about what they're going to find out you know are concerned about\nWell what's the answer going to be it may not be the answer I walked in so I Would say this you know it's it's like our conversation earlier about the ... the asking for directions we weren't very far we were a lot closer than we thought we were in our experience is\nThat you're probably fine you know you need to have a complete plan in place\nWe need to have strategies to protect you from the next market crashed we need to have strategies to generate income you know how are you going to turn your savings in your investments in your portfolio into\nIncome that's going to sustain you and your and your spouse for the rest of your lifetime ... there are things that need to be done to protect you\nBut our experiences it's very doable yeah and chances are you're in better shape than you think\nSo I Would encourage you to think about this if there was a way\nThat you knew you had a plan that you know your name was going to last\nYou had a health care situations taking care of your family is going to be taken care of you know when you can retire confidently and and you know you can go and visit grandkids if their local or not local or you can help out with the kids if they need a little help you know sprinkles they get a real problem you're able to swoop and they're like a hero and do it and you feel good about it\nI'm not worried that is that it was too much you know if there was a way that you could look and say All right where are we where do we stand in where are we headed and you could clearly nowhere that path is\nI mean wouldn't that be something that you'd want to know about wouldn't that be something you'd be interested in exploring and it'd be a compelling future like you said a lot of people are worried about what's gonna happen they're worried and they come in yeah I don't think I've saved enough I'm not sure we have enough I don't think you know and I'm I don't think I can retire yet\nSo a lot of times we find that that that's not the truth sometimes you find out that there is a way to do that so if there was a way out just encourage people to figure that out now don't sit there and worry alone you know don't worry that there may not be a way so there's no use in even trying to figure\nOut our experiences there is almost always a way I Know it it you know a lot of times there are definite improvements that need to be made to protect you better right to make sure that you're\nThat it is going to work ... but if there was a way to do that to give you confidence right when would you want to have a plan like pat in place so we would you know we're talking about procrastination we encourage you\nTo take action and we're happy to sit down with you and go through our retire with freedom process and show you how do we help people do

two\nHe will be you know he'd be my brother the job but he has been confirmed by the Senate so by all means necessary he is a Supreme Court justice so ladies\nOnce you got to weigh in on is that what you're thinking I got my main one and only probably don't bring 'em in because he'd been over this all week long you been out there we have been out there on Facebook the backing off\nA lot there may even have a boat with the oh yeah I Know I I've I've seen his a Facebook post and you know very entertaining everybody know who you want to know the man Andrew maclean was up Andrew\nHey whoa hey now

into this brown Andrew maclean y'all got you got the one on the edge McLean from the line he called dais locking me with a loving debate today to break down what actually happened to get to this point\nSo Brian ... would you first\nHow do we get here no which part what today you know we need to do you have all that was the boat right right and then today but that was a chance that one of the students had to go Mary's daughter oh\nRight yeah and so they had to hold a vote open for him to come fly back of the American daughter so he can gumbo didn't they didn't\nOne of the senators had to go marry his daughter oh All right yeah and so they had to hold a vote open for him to come fly back of the American daughter so he can gumbo didn't they didn't they didn't come back no he didn't come back no I'm\nA guy that wasn't calling it was a who was the guy Andrew [noise]\n[noise] uh dangers that the senators it wasn't there who he was attending is is\nDoing his own wedding west yeah right but ah\nLook I'm not mistaken mark ... is the senator who haired her her hopes with Janesville which basically took us two votes away so you're taking away one T I spoke with dance being at that wedding right Murkowski used Senate rules to say I woke up all my vote with his and we'll just\nTake out two votes from the Senate so really instead of having a hundred votes like you normally would in the Senate you only had Ninety eight right and that's why we finished off with a vote that was his key to forty eight\nWith that and that's the one when Mike ... of the time\nSo Andrew let me ask you this um now that you know it went through the day I mean it would have took a really close to afford not to go through today or what do you feel in my\nMan I Am I Am around I Want to say this is what I'm most proud about I'm proud to be an American I'm proud to see the way the Supreme Court is being structured [noise]\nUm I'm proud of our president who stood his ground and said I Know this is a good guy and I'm not in a whole has nomination uncle that this process cried out\nBut I'm mostly proud of the Republicans\nThat me as well as lots of other people lots of other conservatives have been so frustrated with for so long as they did not have back though they were used to stand up to the other side they stand up for the things they told us they would stand up for when they would campaign when they would ask her votes\nAnd over the past week we have seen those we eat Republicans quote backbone and when you know following the lead of Donald Trump or just it's just coincidence that they finally said enough said enough I'm proud of the Republicans are finally ended up in saying we're not going to be pushed around any more\nBrown your thoughts uh well I thought this whole process has been absolutely disgusting I'm bringing unfounded uncorroborated and baseless accusations against somebody at the thirteenth our or the ... before they were supposed to vote out of committee ... or ...\nAs this process has continued to go forward and uh you know last week I said I Believe both um\nProfessor Ford\nA judge Kavanaugh uh now that I Know that they were trying to strong arm witnesses now that I Know that I'm more as more information has come out I Do not believe Dr Ford metal and um\nYou know it's just a shame as to what the Democrats in the Senate Judiciary committee in the Senate or what they resorted to their destroyed two families they destroyed the credibility in the reputation of a good judge and um\nThey are slowly not no no I'm not going to say so if they were quickly turning into a the national socialist party a with their um the aggressive behavior and they're brown shirt or ... tactics\nYou know I must say this um [noise] after watching this stuff over the last couple of weeks I'm\nI'm Glad just Kevin I've got confirmed and I thought he should have been confirmed last week I was on board with him I think thirty six years and after hearing the testimony a couple of weeks ago you know I Would not convinced that I'm actually in the thing that they could prove anything happen I'm I'm\nThe testimony a couple of weeks ago you know I Would not convinced that I'm actually anything that they can prove anything happen I'm I'm Still going to say that I Do believe Dr forward that something did happen with whom I don't know\nBecause I still active one question that no one can ... since he's on the line with us today or what does he have to gain from it because he's losing everything\nI mean she's pretty much lost everything right now in gained a million dollars that's a ... I mean everything I've yet to see her where it's been documented defect as you always say that she has gotten a million dollars that there are people talking about what goes on me accounts to commit to go from you go out and said he will do a bunch of dollars for what are they are these actually for her\nShe's actually receive no one's actually documentation which he ever receive that money\nBecause before on ... when she was on um the hearings she said that she had no access to any of these account well the thing with the go fund me accounts if you have it go on me and you raise it for an individual has to go towards that individual or you can be charged with a crime but I think\nWhat you know what you got your is the fact that none of us can accurately\nAnswer what was what did she see there was to gain when she started this whole thing and as far as I'm concerned I've seen this play out ... ... it seems to be political and I I'll I'll even go with you Joe I think\nShe's been sexually assaulted and she recounts this with a therapist years ago and all that kind of stuff\nBut I think I think what's happened is is this this person this woman Dr Ford has taken taken her tragedy or for instance of being sexually assaulted and just act an innocent man aim along with it because he was the pick\nFor the Supreme Court we knew that they weren't going to hate whatever that Donald Trump made that didn't matter who was going to be right we're going to the guy and so her with a you know relations to senator and everything else friends family whatever\nThey ended up talking a plan and saying let's just take the things that happened to you which was very vulnerable let stack Brett Kavanaugh name on it and then once politicize the crap out of it and I see she can complicit in that and the reason I think that's because\nI don't think Brett Kavanaugh did it but she gets up there and she says I Am one hundred per cent without a doubt sure that it is ... ... and if she's saying that and it's not really him and she's in on this whole thing\nBut he lied under oath but here's the thing to do and again I think Rick I'm not too big American when people understand\nThat we don't know ...\nHe stuck to his guns yes well she doesn't know right we're already I mean she can't remember a thing about she can't remember these things but again like I said I'm just being fair on both of them that that's the way I've been able to tell you I think I'm not going to change the day ... you know because like I say I don't see\nAgain for political gain for what she does and being a professor and for a million dollars a screw up your family to screw up your life really well\n[laughter] well and that's another question and that\nNo no no but she said that under oath by saying agree with her if she was going after this why did she come out and say first and foremost she wanted to remain anonymous\nIt could not an end here's the thing with the with the letter it's not\nBased in any truth but she gave the letter and says she wanted to remind them as a ... half the game and here's the thing though and you have to\nTake on on the entire situation Dianne Feinstein did move on it she sat on it if she thought that it was credible she would have moved on it and I think that there's one of her staffers were so upset that the process that they couldn't bring anything in the initial judiciary hearing a that would tarnished judge Kavanaugh\nWhich are really wasn't anything I mean he's gone is a spotless a judicial careers you can get right um\nThey they they read it at the thirteenth our ... I Believe they lead them or find the man has something to do with it you know I could kill us I think she should be I think the FBI investigation to go into all of the fun of how to get help\nI'm asking you got this course let me bring bill into it to this and they were too high that we got Baylor cook for in the morning it was going on bail\nJoe how you doing good doing good um we got Andrew maclean from the line we got ... with us today and we got the morning so here\nWe we all know what are you right now we break now becoming over here and with the radio talk show host of this ... right now bail real cook we bring the wheel quick let me ask you this question what do you think that um about the comforts confirmation they are you\nAlabama we probably the only one love right now bail real cook we bring the we have a quick let me ask you this question what do you think that um about the ... you you ... where do you happy with what\nI'm very excited or I'm very excited because the basic tenets of the American\nJudicial system prevails presumption of innocence was one of the things that our judicial system it's a\nBad rock and in veils today because if we can say we believe Christine forward to the till the cows come home at the end of the day there was no corroboration to her story no rational validation validation of any kind\nSo you can't ruin the man's career thirty five years it's nothing says to the antithesis of what we've seen throughout his career I mean you you just can't so I'm happy with\nAnd I really don't like the argument that you know for didn't want to take it to the media you all are talking about this just a second ago and the Ford wants to remain anonymous well so allegedly did Anita Hill but she became public and now when we're talking about sports she after she ...\nTo find signs office then she turned around and went to the Washington Post three separate times she she herself admitted that you don't go to the Washington Post if you want to remain anonymous that's just not how it works\nWell at the end of the again okay bay lemme ask you this and we'll get back to um I'm a Andrew and I'm\nI'm Brian I think that your name right [laughter] um [laughter]\nBecause I'm an ex you and I actually didn't own a TV show um Baylor what does he got the getting\nWhat does she have the gang up well look I didn't think she got anything again but we cannot overlook the fact that she now has roughly a million dollars in Gulf on me that are going to be given to her I'm not saying that was our motives at all but she is now a millionaire because of coming out and\nLet me ask you this ... again I hear about a saying we don't know for effect do you know for a fact go Andrew or I'm Brian ... affected that money's going to go to her\nDid it get like I said if you open up and go on to me and you said this go on me money has to go towards this individual ... you cannot raise money for purposes other than what you were saying you were doing so if she has go ... opened up\nIn her honor in her name that those funds as soon as that go fund me close is they have\nTo go to them or else they can be persecuted oh let's let's say hypothetically speaking their y'all are correct\nThis woman and I like I said I'm happy just Kevin of that come from I think thirty six years ago that there was no evidence he should have been confirmed less we asked them from all that but my question to everybody that this\nHer family her livelihood is worth a million dollars [noise]\nI well I go back to what I said about as a martyr thing and I mean I I Know you brought up\nThe whole thing about her wanting to remain anonymous is going to add that into my hypothetical go ahead and we're going to have to assume that she's being completely honest 'cause\nReally if you look at the two they post everything they said was under oath soon ... flying right on the right line so if she it turned out to be the liar\nShe can lie about wanting to be anonymous and actually hit them working with these people\nHave to find anyone of love for to do 'cause she can really you don't think Senator Feinstein would stoop to that level of what I'm saying look what the only way to make it made her look back over here on it made her look bad no she wouldn't ally she said no no that wouldn't have happened because it made her an overlooked by well she she did why she said what I'm saying for that particular question\nWhen they wish they would act she said yes she did and I'm asked to remain anonymous\nSo I'm saying at that point in time right\nShe she wouldn't have taken the heat for it\nNo she pushed it back on Fort Sam Ford was one that leaked everything and that does however ... you're not going to put it in the back but I'm saying we're beginning she said yes she was she first came to me see\nOne that leaked everything and that does however\nDown you know to put it in about what I'm saying we're beginning she said yes she when she first came to me she\nActed to remain anonymous and I'm at that at that point in that point in time for the whole question hold on doesn't mean those are the men at that point in time right when ... and her was talking to how they got together and she remain anonymous what does he have the game at that point\nMartyrdom looking go ahead and I\nDon't come from I got a question before we get to the ideological Santa Marta them and stuff like that there's just one basic question if you want to remain anonymous do you go to the Washington Post on three separate occasions or did you you just go to your senator and the question\nTo ask you Baylor how long after that she gave that letter D.C go to the Washington about what the next day or whenever they start hitting the famous you want to get her set up as it was already out\nBut that's a strong argument I Want to know if you want to remain anonymous\nIf the ... information got out that she wanted to be none of us now for her to tell her story too you know she she went to the press over her\nA letter to issue and then which rates to her and and then went straight to the Washington Post this was her testimony under a\n... the way strangers and she went straight to the press and on and\nThen she went to her congresswoman and then the congresswoman then got in touch with Senator Feinstein\nOkay go see that now that they'll make an assistant because why are you going to say you want to remain anonymous right then and then you go straight to the Washington Post that wasn't the timing of it I don't I'm not ... I'm going to take your word on that she did but to my understanding that she did that after it was\nIt came out no no it was before she she\nShe didn't give the letter but she did contact the Washington Post because she thought that would be the best way in order to get whatever information that she wanted to get out out the woman she's going to take the Washington Post for to letting them know that judge Kavanaugh that she had a recollection that he had committed a sexual assault against or when they were teenagers\n... none of these guys when they go to Andrew go ahead\nOh ... that's what I got man I Am I stand by because again I I Can't\nStress enough how one of the two line on the road a crime was committed in right here in a way around it\nBut it I ... I Can't say enough how much how passionate people are in this political climate\nHow passionate people get about whether it's anti Trump was opposed Trump or whatever to where they will be willing to do anything you know if that's putting her family in harm's way you know they they feel like they've got their own a\nMoral high ground by this in a sense because it's it it wasn't it's not about\nHaving your family's sent death threats or getting talked about and having the name brands are bought 'em all over\nNational television and God was about ... about saving the future of women's ability to be able to get abortions on demand or the rights of gay people whatever other things that they've set about Kavanaugh that\nHe's going to do if she's on the Supreme Court they have literally create the American public out over ... off as if this guy is going to come in and make was our last decisions that are going to change the landscape of this entire country\nSo I uh we got Andrew maclean we've got Baylor cook I'm from the morning so Andrew moving from the line we got brand people just do that with me we figured out you guys long ago we got we got all the talk to and a half a day we breaking down the Kevin overhearing he had just been confirmed today for Supreme Court just get up the phone call a six six by about one nine three three might be locked into ... debate\nHey hey hey how's it going going going oh let me say this I\nYou like the delivery debate hey hey\nHey how's it going I'm going to go to a ... let me say this I understand and can appreciate the Republican point of view of people looking at it from the conservative side I Am a believer in law I'm a believer in the constitution\nWhich is why have which is why I got so upset and so ticked off when Republicans for a almost a year held up the nomination of Merrick Garland ... now\nAll things being equal\nDemocrats shouldn't do use this as a learning to\nThis is what you do when you have power you use it now I'll flip the script back the other way\nDemocrats used a learning ... Democrats used as a tool all Republicans with President Obama got elected they had sixty into how mean sixty in the Senate and they had a old they had a majority in the house so they pushed to Obamacare\nThat's how you do Republicans took that to the next level they use the Senate album they broke ... vote majority they used their power in the Senate minority to block the arrest all bottles appointments and to do everything they could until after twenty twelve the Democrats\nYeah why do we ... we don't have ... you all do it on my home I Will do art Andrew I'm barely I got to go you don't wanna hold on [noise]\nA whole lot of time or\nAre we looking like there are so this dog show a couple of hours but we got a card and we were looking at a news Kevin overhead\nVery but we know what was the government would you go where on the other uh [noise]\n[noise] so we want him to do we ... do you do thirty seven Berman W we do see huge me to\n\n[noise] do you find yourself wearing the same thing over and over how about not knowing how to apply your make up for enhanced your feature love is what you've been looking for I think left offered one on one styling wardrobe shopping closet reconstruction beauty classes and much more to help you with your fast at work\nFor seen it a secret today and take advantage of our radio only special offers call too fast\nSeveral uh Ninety five right now or head to W.

public\nAnd there was forty six days in order to conduct a thorough investigation right in yet senator Feinstein's office sat on it right all the ... the American public should not have been privy to any of that but\nShe sat on it okay and like I say let's keep the record straight\nBecause the lady said she wanted what remain anonymous us that's why she said she play politics with someone else to
