tell who's\n... that's what that's really what I'm just trying to identify the person wants to the door because they're going to come out and I want to be like going I'm all over at your good let's see what the last person then here was it not on trade ties\nWas I was just a tree with some blossoms on it okay\nIt's just like a self taken picture or the services AT and T. that's got to be time

that's right up my alley all those things out of her rally\nYou used to she makes you think of a chicken ... anti smile\nI don't know I'm just saying all those things together I can envision this and then I got to arm is like it's a squeaky\nWell it's better than it consistently falling into your lap thanks that's good [laughter] why do they have the whole show line that extra squeaky today I don't know maybe it's been tightened and said that's just the way it's going to sound\nWhat'd you prefer it to be loose and not squeaky can well okay so they just want to go look at it I mean the whole Nestle\nIs trying to snuggle with me All right a welcome to your Tuesday edition of the line a plenty of of stuff out there to get to it's it's one of those weeks Halloween\nTo moral the midterms are weak away and I know it's important for us to talk about um mid term stuff\nBut there's really only so much to say about it I I mean you know we were going to talk about what's going to be on the ballot in Alabama tomorrow with Jeff in the three thirty our mail lucky for you guys that are listening right now between the hours of six and seven on the replay\nYou will be able to hear that conversation tomorrow evening after we go off and live and then they do that first our replace we have two chances to hear that if you want some clarification on what's what as far as your ballots concerned next Tuesday a week from today so we'll try and make sure you guys are\nCompletely in foreign we've had people ask us to to go through the entire ballot or you know\nThat would be fun all afternoon violation that what I Do but I don't think I'm going to do that oh okay you know right\nThat's why people started backing away from the Democrats because of that old tired strategy when these things happen\nFor some reason the Democrats go back to that same playbook and doing that a week and two weeks before the mid term elections\nIs kind of a bizarre move if you ask me now granted their overall fame as a tack from in every way you can but seems like they\nShould do it more subtly and concentrate on what they're going to do if the people of their respective sane state or their district vote for them and vote them in the office what they're going to do for them opposed to just\nI'm On a puzzle everything Trump Dutch\nSeems like you need to come up with a different ... for the Democrats for the media\nThey do the same thing and it causes the same effect it causes people to back way and they're like man\nThis is all the people care about do they not care about other things like jobs are my child's future or my four oh one K. or any of all they care about us talking about Trump and horrible of a person he is now he's this and that and the other\nIt turns people off so when you hear Don Lemon spent his show talking about with Chris Cuomo talking about how the biggest terror threat in this country are white men that\nDoesn't that doesn't get middle America excited about going out and voting next Tuesday\nMay get I'm excited about voting but it doesn't get them excited to vote about a vote for Democrats listen to a little bit of what happened last night on CNN when they did the whole transition between Cuomo prime time and Don Lemon show\nAfter ... not just the bomber there was another hate filled criminal just last week in Kentucky\n... prime time and Don Lemon show\nNot just ... it's not just the bomber there was another hate filled criminal just last week in Kentucky and other white man history of violence custody for shooting and killing two African Americans or grocery store rovers\nBut when he tried to do was barge into a predominantly black church fail and then he picked a secondary part is being investigated for hate crimes Don Lemon is here right now we barely have time to cover it because we were distracted by another extremists that was doing bad things and then ...\nYeah and then now another one and you have all of them in a row and you know we talked we message about this little with this weekend I keep trying to point out to people not to demonize any one group or anyone ethnicity\nBut we keep thinking that the biggest terrorist threat of something else some ... some people who are marching you know towards the border like a feminine and when the last time they did this a couple of hundred people came and they you know\nMost did get into the country most of them tired you know got stuck it out before they even made it to the border um\nSo we have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threats in this country is white men most have been radicalized ... up to the right\nAnd we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nThere was no ban on you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy ban so what do we do about that\nSo and\nAt first of all let me just say this\nMores style or does a name and Vicki Jones and may have been lost in all of this to people who were killed him was that you talked about they have been lost about this and I know that people feel that this story has not gotten enough coverage and we will honor them tonight a program for the longest are good no no no\nI'm going to new and they go on and on and and Don Lemon even seemingly to propose a white guy ban quote unquote\nIn this country even though the Muslim ban that he's brought up this time last night in in several other times in the past there was never a Muslim ban there was a ban on travel from particular countries that were infested with terrorism\nBut there never was a Muslim ban it's just it's funny to me that if you listen to that he leads up to this whole the biggest terror threaten America are white guys white men\nThe whole time leading up to that he talks about how we don't need to classify a certain group of like one or one group of people that as being a threat to the country we don't need to classify Muslims is a threat to the country then he goes but white men are the biggest\nThreats are gone yeah not even realizing in San ... see I just I just wonder what would have happened if somebody were to have said that about the black man\nWe'll see how that sounds black men are the biggest threat to this country\nDoes that sound it well it sounds pretty rice and it does and I'm just that the frame of mind that if you can take something and insert the opposite race into that Senate and it sounds racist it's probably racist\nAnd I'm sure it's probably racist that if we're looking to dream each other equally\nAnd looking at our our fellow man ... without the the the lens\nOf of race then you should be able to use that theory in any situation and find out if it's racist or not if you can use one\nBut not the other chances are both of those are very racist not just one it's never just one side is racist if we're actually concerned about race\nCancers are both of those are very racist not just one it's never just one side is racist if we're actually concerned about racism they'll after isn't concerned about races the left is racist\nThe left puts on a happy face and says we're here to fight against the races all the while they're wolves in sheep's clothing\nTheir racist disguised as crusaders against those they claim are racist\nYou've got racist fight non racist the problem is that the people instigating it are the racist pretending to be non racist I Know that sounds confusing that ... that is that's that's exactly what we've got going on not just those in the media but those um [noise]\nAh those Democrat and politicians and and Democrat Party leaders are the the biggest culprits in that whole thing or another thing is in in their tying the the shooting in Kentucky that we did talk about on the show and also the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh or\nThey're referring to that in most part one thing that bothered me is is something we brought up on the show yesterday the the I saw several media outlets claiming\nThat there were numerous Jewish leaders in Pittsburgh saying that they do not want Donald Trump to visit\nTo to pay his respects to to stand in solidarity with Pittsburgh and the Jewish community there they did not want him there and the media painted this is\nTen or eleven Jewish leaders in the community had come out and said that that ... to paint the picture that it's all the Jewish people in Pittsburgh do not want the president there because this is his fault\nWhat bothered me about that 'cause I was not surprised to see NBC and and CNN and whoever else a repeat that false could repeat that why\nBut then I see John Roberts on Fox News who you know he's he's one of the guys the White House correspondent gray headed dude he's in the White House press briefings and all that\nI watched him on three different occasions repeat\nThat Jewish leaders have rejected Donald Trump's intention of\nOf visiting Pittsburgh I watched him do it three different times now just if you didn't hear a song about this yesterday the Jewish leaders they're talking about are actually just members of a group of a group called bend the arc\nWhich are Soros funded\nLeft wing political activists and not Jewish leaders it's a Soros funded a political action group political activist group\nThat is only Jewish by name and they're certainly not Jewish leaders for the Jewish community in Pittsburgh\nI someone and bringing up at the White House press briefing I saw him bring it up on Shepard Smith show yesterday and I watched him say it again for the third time\nOn Brett Bayer show yesterday evening three times\nMeter the host Shepard Smith are bred Bayer corrected him on that front ... they knew that was fake news\nBut they just let him go and John Roberts went on his merry way and continued to repeat\nBut they just let him go and John Roberts went on his merry way and continued to repeat the line\nAnd maybe maybe they feel like they're they're getting close with their partners at CNN or MSNBC or the people that that uh perpetrate these lies\nBecause if things like when something tragic happens like an animal that you can consider a tragic but but the ah the the the the pipe bombs that were intercepted that was most certainly\nOr the potential to be a tragic situation they come in and they stand arm in arm of CNN and they do the same thing when Donald Trump call CNN out for me and fake news they say no we're not going to put up with that kind of talk\nThat is what does that Fox News day or so maybe they feel like they can just take their word on this whole Jewish leaders of Pittsburgh thing that\nAmerica this is not even a close call we talked about Lou Dobbs\nAmerica this is not even a close call we talked about Lou Dobbs spreading conspiracy theories about the bombs being fake I mean and the same thing with ... inches of Congress to improving certain back the interest of Congress you're giving money to somebody\nThis is actually spreading the big lie right now talking about the others lying about smallpox lying about leprosy no no no Mika I Wish they were only complicit\nOr this is far worse than that Jeffrey Goldberg\nIt's so some nice to to be able to to watch people and Joe Scarborough who is just so informed yeah that he knows Fifteen thousand migrants or heard\nOf Fifteen thousand migrants that have been walking hundreds and thousands of miles all have a clean bill of health\nWell sure yeah and they have no criminal history and they're not going to be any of that into the country I mean it's amazing because I don't think that they even have the papers to pray for coming in with a blue for you know what I'm saying is I vaccination record so out for him to be able to even say that\nI think it's a there was some was something that actually discussing the possibility of what could happen with the you know at the flux of people coming into the country I think it would be stupid to not question as\nWell and once you look at the details and as to what has happened as this caravan moves through Mexico Mexican authorities are coming out and they're like hey ah\n... we're having Honduran men with weapons guns shooting at us on their way through they arrested two guys and recovered some hand guns from some of these migrants in this caravan that were firing weapons that them both competing\nThey were firing bullet and said these guys they're throwing Molotov cocktails I watch now keep in mind there's a second\nMigrant caravan coming through the Boston through the Guatemalan border Mexico and Guatemala\nAnd they were throwing rocks and bottles and whatever else they could get their hands on at these authorities and busting down the gates okay of violent group of people they want to be next in line and they want to create the second caravan that's coming up behind the first one\nAnd there's some dangerous people in these groups but yet\nPeople like Joe Scarborough says we're white nationalist for even questioning that it was funny because Fox News and I know him hammer and Fox News but there's a couple of good people ...\n... was out in a inside the Caribbean and and they were interviewing people and they came across this one guy and kind of asked him you know hey are you willing to go to the U.S and break the law and he's like oh sees in your he ... a\n... he's got a translator was I just want you to listen to how that and I am going to play the whole clip not just the interview part B\nJust because the way that's being set up but just listen to this this segment from Fox News I think this was over the weekend it's Griffith Jenkins the same guy that was sneaking up on the adult across our letter that he's getting some good interviews in the Caribbean lately but listen to this right here\nThey weren't San Pedro tapping nev attached\nBut you can see here they're still waiting for a press conference from the leaders there for us in front of terrorist group if you look here you can see them all in this square there very tired they've been going since October thirteenth there's a lot of coughing here they've got blisters on their feet it's been tough but a\nLot of coughing going on there but no need to work\nThey've been going since October thirteenth there's a lot of coughing here they've got blisters on their feet it's been tough but a\nLot of coughing going on there but no need to where they're all healthy and\nDon't screen them no screen today that they're not accepting Mexico's offer for temporary a silent temporary jobs ... there\nTo listen\nFree health care\nThat they were offering them asylum in Mexico healthcare they're offering them temporary jobs in temporary healthcare okay\nAnd they're turning it down because they're going to keep on track and do America even though they know the military will be meeting them at the border\nAre definitely not heating President Trump's warnings to not show up at the border they all say they're coming organizes you're saying in fact the group may be too big but yet they're still going to go forward and they're going to show up on the border one person is probably not going to have luck once he gets there is Jose we spoke to earlier who had prior convictions ...\nIsn't that what are called every migrant in this caravan was hosing right even than women and children are all Jose listen [noise]\nAre you willing to break the law\nTo get back to the United states you'll get all that as a but it'll better don't she says he wants to apply for them for the felony committed can you ask him exactly what happened\n[noise] I'm In one place to stay on the\nAgree felony ... the my data attempted murder [laughter]\n[laughter] yeah yeah\nThe only guys I re oh oh now by other number three\nIs that okay a third degree felony okay ... what was it attempted\nMurder hey it's no big deal it's been deported multiple times he's been convicted of attempted\nMurder and yet\nJoe Scarborough says don't worry about these guys sounded like he was ordering something else McDonald's and you what do you have a good number three you'll ...\nYou'll get them to admit to come by three ... three [noise]\nCrazy all this is seriously happening and we're supposed to just turn a blind eye and just let these people walk in\nAnd I\nI I shouldn't say this and I really don't even want to say it because most people should have enough commonsense to realize this but we're not saying everybody in the group is a felon and\nConvicted of attempted murder but the fact that there's one two three five\nHundred whatever doesn't matter gets to the bigger point they we can't just allow big group of people coming in if we know this is in the middle of it\nIs it's not that the first time we've seen in an interview like that either we played it on the show where they interviewed people have been deported ten times that's just the name of the game you just keep going back\nWell let me ask you this too if it's somebody said hey there's a bunch of ... there was like Fifteen hundred people at your front door I Need you to let them all in and there was like three that were had been convicted of attempted murder would you be like no that's fine just go ahead and let them in my home you know where my children left that nobody would do that it's the same thing\nTwo oh five nine four one one zero one one keeping an eye on line shots of Pittsburgh as the president has arrived\nAt the tree of life synagogue where they're going to be visiting and paying their respects to the eleven people that died over the weekend so just to say you know we're giving our own that anything goes down we will let you know Don is going to be first Don how're you\nHave a good afternoon I wanted to make a comment about Mr lemon and his comment about a white man and being the real threat I won't lower the factory you know after you\nYeah I wanted to make a comment about Mr lemon and his comments about a white man and being the real threat\nI think we're all over the fact that after you know after he just says that the Bob the pipe bomb mailer and this guy that shot a synagogue oh these are well I got a male is not white\nIs half Filipino half seminal last time I checked that was not Caucasian yeah uh you know so\nThat I Know what not they ... at the Warren has proven to out to even point zero one percent of a race matters a little white then he's white\nWell I mean he is skin color or maybe a little on the on the lighter shade but he would not be considered Caucasian and he's had a yeah uh and going back to um the rest of that nonsense you know they know what they're saying it and it's all\nPremeditated uh they are basically lying to everyone in the country or they are doing this to gin up their base of on the left\nAnd division because they can see that you can see that can see by the polls and they will never bring this up because the the CNN than the NS NBC\nOf the world will never bring up a poll that shows trending up when it's for the Republican it won't happen right now if it they'll bring up the polls that show a cup and some of the candidates that are trailing um\nYou know they say well this guy's James is down by your job James down by seven points what they say what they say is that he used to be down by the\nRight yeah they're going and they they do that I I even watch Fox News do it earlier where they were like oh this has gone from heavily leaning to Republican and it's gone down to just kind of leaning Republican and and they don't even want to show you the numbers on some of them which is you know they don't\nBring up ... anymore [laughter] right well and that's the one they're like pork\nAfter sorrows talk tens of millions of dollars into Texas well going to go down in flames I Love the seed Soros wasting your money\nThe the about to say Thanks Don or the the hostility in this country towards people in their political beliefs as really skewed polls that happened in two thousand six team where people decided hey I'm not willing to just go out there and tell you who I'm voting for because I Want to be getting beat up on TV from supporting Republican\nI'm not going to put that out there so then they get an accurate reading on what the polls are\nAnd everything they put forty on TV and they're like this ... this poll says that\nIt's it doesn't it doesn't work as well as it used to not saying it's completely ineffective but if you're going to make your predictions based on a lot of these polls and only the polls you're going to be misleading yourself and then to Don's first point\nNow well if if if we're supposed to be open minded and and welcoming these people with open arms were asking\nFor that kind of stuff [noise] but again I go back to\nPeople in this country people they control the media and others they want that they want polio they want smallpox and they want another
