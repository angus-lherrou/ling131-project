I'm I'm just I'm starting to see how Jones made all his money\nUh these conspiracy theorist a\nYou know baffles me how people with zero evidence can buy all in all the credit conspiracy but then when presented with real evidence or in total denial\nAnd and I mean we're cocoa for cuckoo for cocoa puffs here\nWhat evidence is there other democratic conspiracy yeah eight and I mean there's got to talking about bumper stickers are askew on is the guy living in a\nCar [laughter] I mean not he's a\nLook I'm not you know look I'm the I'm by far not a Trump supporter and this is this this guy has nothing to do with Trump he's crazy yeah and crazy people have different things that triggered to some of them it's you know when I was a kid with dungeons and dragons some of them and people would have died that are heavy metal music\nAnd some people blame porn or whatever crazy people you can't understand them you can understand what's going to trigger them or or what their fetish or or obsession is going to be this is a nut job is obsession was off\nWho did this it's a row nut job\nWell and if it if the same thing that there's people who will take the Bible and completely flip\nIt on ... and take it out of contacts and make it something it's not and then there'll be labeled all their insane Christian will not they're not but I mean it it may seem as though they were exactly right I kinda feel the same way about this guy and and for all I Know I could be totally wrong but I'm with you I feel like\nFor whatever reason I just have this feeling that this guy's just not I mean just completed and not and he went off the air\nWell in in right now at this stage in the game ... there's as much chance and the guy being in a nod as there is some sinister plan\nPut on my my politicians because we just I mean we're just on the heels of of him and this guy off we we don't have the evidence all we have is a a a book cover which is in the form of a man and a mug shot to go on\nUntil we get more information which should come pretty pretty rapidly and any point let me ask a question\nReal quick I'll let you go it to me this is begs a bigger question you know I spent a lot of time on Facebook with with relatives and friends and you know with the these political post these political names that are clearly\nFactually untrue and it would take very minimal research to understand that they're not on true but yeah people are so desperate to believe\nThese crazy outlandish what is it what you know how is Alex Jones so popular why are people so desperate to believe these elaborate conspiracy theories it it reeks of like a mental illness\nI don't get comes from people and just not wanting to accept\nSo desperate to believe these elaborate conspiracy theories it reeks of like a mental illness\nI don't get comes from people and just not wanting to accept what we're told and I think it all starts for a lot of people tell you it's like a ... year told stuff and you just believe that and you get to a certain age where you realize just because somebody tells me something doesn't mean it's true and then the search for the truth happen and I think sometimes that spiral and some people for some people it spirals out of control\nFor others it's just you know you're going to have wisdom and ask questions instead of just believing everything you're told and I don't think there's anything wrong with that but I think it can lead to in situations like this you're always like well what if it was blah blah blah and again there's nothing wrong with asking questions but I'm with you I think it's just as possible this guy's just a couple of late night I mean that would make to me as much sense\nSometimes the simple answer is the simple answer but this is the most were ever going to agree got to have a great week\nThanks rich you know we don't ever agree with rich I'm I I don't know I mean I think if you're exploring why people are are buying in to ah\nTo this stuff you need to look at what what brought them to the point that they were willing to to question it and what series of events happen to get people to where they're like you know I think it's possible that our government would do well like a\nCamera on stuff right I mean that's evidence enough to me that I questioned the motives are what they're capable of our how far they'll take\nIt and we're no conspiracy theorist but we've launched the Democratic party do some things over the past two years that's really really bother us and it it it's really eye opening that makes you think what's to tell us that\nWho's to tell us they they wouldn't do that right we don't have any evidence that they did\nBut the the fact the Democratic party has pushed us to a point where we're saying it's possible that this is a false flag that people like Alex Jones voice on but we don't really talk about false flag on this show but maybe that's the thing because these people\nThese people they're they're obviously capable of doing it but the biggest thing is they've shown us they're willing to do some\nKind of like have you ever been in a relationship like where things went sour and you realize that this person you thought you knew it was lying to you like most of your relationship and it makes you question every single thing that happened and if you stay with them then it makes you question every things that if in the future for a long period of time to the game you're trust back I feel like the same thing it's like\nThey broke our trust because I think that they showed us if if they ever had\nThey showed us what they were capable of like you're saying and now we're just questioning everything but I think that's a very human response\nWell and you know everything's normal in the relationship and instead of bringing you flowers he starts bringing your pie bomb\nThings are kind of start questioning yeah thank God you're not on her ... and we're back\nTo the Alex Jones thing rich a ritual was bringing up though\nI think another thing to look at it as we're looking at when average Americans started accepting conspiracy theories is what was the one thing that ah\nSomebody else would have to be helping him in as well\nAnd it is we learn more about this guy like we will in the coming days I heard one reporter spoke with an attorney representing them on one of his minor\nCriminal charges and he said he was the nicest guy he had ever represented\nNormal ... great guy nice guy and can than of good things about him and I'm just like man\nIt's it's weird

back in the seventies\nOr ... or the sixties or whatever and they're like but they're not they they've gone so far over over the line over over to the left that this is a party left me want to go and I I think that's where you've seen this surge of\nOf people like yourself that not only leave the\nThe Democratic party but they they gravitate towards Trump because he almost embodies that old Democrat looking out for the working man type of mentality\nYou're absolutely right and and I think that the the left is so focused on identity politics and\nGroup's thinking you know all this ... that really never existed before you know I mean you know I talk to Democrats they name one policy that you guys are really pushing and talking about right now besides bashing Trump and nobody could\nWrite began to know what I'm saying\nSo big it racism and all that stuff but anyway thanks for letting me share\nOf course then throw procedure buddy Derek Brian Jeff coming to you guys next

right\nAfter I got you\nKnow [noise] [noise] effort\nI Gotcha less ...\nLess than Ron we we and we talk about that on the show there's not a lot that changed\nSince back in the uh the early Nineteen hundreds a Nineteen fifties and sixties\nFor the Democrat Party ... and that last call where I talked about the Democratic party ideology changing what what they feel is important which was economic issues which was middle class working Americans that's who they were working for\nThey moved on they moved far laugh they moved on to to social issues being much more important than the economy so on and so forth and that's when the party left a lot of the law to their followers but\nOne thing that's been consistent with the Democrat Party is how they feel towards minorities and how they feel towards black people they back you know during the civil rights era that's the that's the where the birth of the the the Klan started coming out of the Democratic party that's where these people\nOnce African Americans were able to vote the Democratic party used tactics to intimidate them\n[laughter] I don't even know what that means during the lion king right I guess ... ... net in the jungle the mighty jungle\nI'm not going away when I got another one and then I don't I wouldn't understand ... why do Michael while room that wind or a\nBuddy [noise] you know I I think that uh the guy was set

somebody about that and it's often I save him up and said hey here's what we may get a day\nWhen he was going to end ... yeah and this and you know the\nData that up and down or you know for water raising hey was what the base somebody to do something for the call and I I knew it\nAnd when I go there you go\nI Am I ... I got you I noted your theory rule and put it in the record in well in in you know why would the FBI do that Raul is at Lincoln again they're corrupt to sign\nMy well my my my point to that would be they've already tried trying\nTo railroad an entire presidential election I remember that they go in a different way than the American people desired\nSo uh you know it's just it's one of those things not promoting any of these conspiracy theories what I Will promote is the government's ability to pull this off I can I can vouch for that Ryan how are you\nSure uh I was listening to a Nashville talk radio show earlier today and they played a clip earlier in that program a guy called in city personally knew this guy and he said he definitely was not a Trump supporter but he wasn't nut job\nAnd then of course a Rush Limbaugh today was talking about the stickers and he said they just look to neat and and just do nice to have been done by him since he's probably a slob\nAnd er here here's the theory what if a representative from shore oh Charlotte Clinton ... foundation or the DNC went and set out this guy and had to talk with him said\nI wouldn't want to do a deal we said we want you to be a fall guy for us you might spend some time in prison but uh we know some judges are in a year to the public little won't even remember your name and we'll get you out early and when you get out we'll pay you five million dollars in that nut job ... man Warren ...\nWell the Democrats convinced a some women to do that over Supreme Court hearing [laughter] you know that\nThere's a lot of jobs out there you go to prison for a year or two for three five million dollars whatever\nYeah there's no doubt coffee with the ah with the male bummer so I have a cup of Joe and talk about a month I like I'll go with that Brian I appreciate it run hung up on me let me try next on the line I have a\nHenry Henry has been on hold for thirty two minutes wow in rehab record that's for sure\nIt is not not you've been through hardware yeah\nHi I'm ...
