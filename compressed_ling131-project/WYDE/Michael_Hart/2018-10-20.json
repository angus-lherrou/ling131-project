host of retiring freedom I Am here as always with my lovely and talented dry Tony Tony how are you doing this\nSo uh we've got a great show for you to do we have we're going to talk about what happens if you were forced to retire Sonia we see that a lot or we're going to talk about financial warning lights so things that\nAre are blinking red you may or may not be thinking about and that you need to be we\nWill talk about emotions and retirement planning we're going to try to get to all of this will get a lot we got so much\nStuff we've got we're just we have a what's the word I'm looking for\nWe're we have a plethora [laughter] I've learned a horrifying but also in addition to that we've got our good friends\nAre and and the person who's his team does all of our tax stuff\nBugs cruise with parents level easier with this uh this morning and so uh we're going to start with that\nBecause we're gonna we're just going to start with the best and go from there are going to see them I guess we're going to say that's not what this what what what wait a minute I forgot about that ... or ... or or bugs how you doing I'm\nDoing great and Tony thanks for having me here\nIt's a pleasure as always so you got a lot of good stuff to to ah help our listeners think about as it relates to taxes and and we're going to talk about a couple of things that are are recent\nAnd uh and how to think about those are some as it relates to the new tax law in there and executive word it was just science so we got a lot of good stuff to talk about here so above as what uh what do you want to talk about first tell us tell us what's on your mind well I've\nGot a lot of clients that are that are Seventy and a half or older and they're taking required minimum distributions are empty from the Arab raise yeah so they got to take that out every year and they've got one problem the new tax law\nHas itemized deductions limits of twenty four thousand dollars and if you think about people that are pre retirees are retirees twenty four thousand dollars to exceed that amounts pretty hard to do because it's going to be\nTypically mortgage interest and the taxes that would be your property taxes your income taxes in your car tax will will that's kept it ten thousand dollars to so many people even\nEven people with great well or not I am I see no one way to to to solve that problem especially if they have a charitable inclination they want to give money to charity or with or their church\nAnd they can take part of that are empty and make it qualified charitable distribution that could take all or part of it so\nThe money to charity or or their church they can take part of that are empty and make a qualified charitable distribution they could take all or part of it so it just it it comes out of the IRA directly to the charity now\nThe the amount of the income doesn't get including an income but of course they don't get to take the charitable deduction eat higher right but they wouldn't have taken it otherwise because they're not item us and so that's the way to to kind of beat that a new law and and to get up in the state taxes by making terrible contributions\nSo I Want to help clarify for folks on this because this is something that we've helped our clients to for a while because this when did this first become a thing it's been seven or eight years right and it was temporary for a while but then they made it permanent right right so\nSo I just want to clarify you need to be Seventy and a half or older to be able to do this right buzz that is correct and what happens is you the government's making you take a distribution out culture required minimum distribution and you have to do it anyway but if you are tightening or giving money to charity\nThan you can send that money directly to the institution you can't take possession of it right you can't take a distribution and then contributed Scott to go directly from your custodian\nTo the organization but I have that right correct it goes from the trust of the of the IRA directly to the charity so if you do that that means that you're our MD is not taxable\nAnd in what buses saying as you don't get that as a tax deduction anyway\nUh but with the new item position rule yeah most people are not armor as well and even if you could let me let me ask you this bus even if you could itemize it's still better to do it that way right because you're paying no tax on the money versus just getting a tax deduction\nThat you would have otherwise even before the new tax law it was still a good idea to do that right\nAbsolutely 'cause it may help you and other ways because as your income goes up there may be other things like Social Security make that become more taxes or you or you could lose other deductions like your medical expenses which are related which are tied to a percentage of your income right\nYou know and and the other thing is you know all those things your taxable income goes up so everybody worries about how much tax and not paying how much do I owe and all those kinds of things and why do I owe so much after I'm already retired and what you're saying is right I mean I I mean exactly right and let people worry about the most as\nAs I Am pulling money out of an IRA or a ... tax deferred account\nThat is considered taxable income so the more you are pulling out whether you want to have to it makes everything else more attacks or I mean you you know you just got more income then and then your Social Security gets taxed at a higher rate possibly so yeah it's a good idea it's a great idea\nSo [noise] buzz you mentioned a ... it can cause your Social Security tax to go out why don't you help people understand how Social Security is tax\nSocial Security is tax depending on what your combined income is in combined income is your total income that would be dividends interest pensions you name it\nPlus one half of your Social Security benefits so if you're a combined income is thirty two thousand dollars or less you pay zero taxes on your Social Security\nIf it's greater than thirty two thousand dollars less than forty four thousand dollars then only fifty percent of your Social Security is taxable\nHowever when you get about forty four thousand dollars and combined income eighty five percent of your Social Security is taxable so people that are in those brackets need to be aware of that 'cause you can as you can see in very\nOrson combined income eighty five percent of your Social Security is taxable so people that are in those brackets need to be aware of that 'cause you can as you can see in very short increments the amount of tax you pay can go up pretty drastic and\nSo sometimes people here that and I go oh my goodness I'm paying eighty five percent tax on my Social Security so I Want to help clarify what that means is that eighty five percent fifty or eighty five percent depending on where you fall of the amount of Social Security receive is subject to taxation at whatever your tax rate\nBut a lot of folks don't know that Social Security tax at all they're surprised especially when they first file or whatever they're like oh my gosh this is going to be taxed too\nWell it is double taxation [laughter] so [laughter] we we paid it on the front in and they were paying it again it wasn't always that route yeah if the law [laughter] so so that's good to know and you know I I it just uh it it\nDawned on me as you're talking about our MDs and the amount of money you're having to pull out and that sort of thing or another thing that I've been talking to our clients about in fact we just we did a client event recently where I was going through and telling everyone that you know this is an analysis that\nWe needed to do for them [noise] was\nWith the new tax brackets so so most taxpayers are their tax brackets are going down I mean everybody is going down and most people I I ... I should the tax brackets are going down period but for most people that are going to pay less taxes when the new tax\nSo and you mentioned earlier you said you know even people with great wealth a lot of wealth they don't necessarily have a lot of income\nAnd we see that all the time with our clients that are retired\nThat have done a really good job of of building up wealth is you know let's say they've got a million dollars or more you know several million but they don't have a lot of income right and there are younger than Seventy and a half so the government hasn't made them start taking\nMoney out of their tax deferred accounts because it's Seventy and a half you have to start taking money out of your tax deferred accounts called RMC required minimum distribution\nSo they might be sixty sixty two sixty five whatever younger than Seventy and a half\nIf they don't have a lot of income there is a small window of opportunity for those people to get some of that tax deferred money into a tax free bucket by converting door off\nAnd buzz I'm just curious to know you know what your thoughts are on that for people that that are in that circumstance that I just describe what\nLet me give you an example and I've got a client who was he's been very successful and he recently retired he's not Seventy and a half yet therefore he's not in the ... he's not taking required minimum distributions promise IRAs which which are quite large Rob the way he listens to the show where we can because he told me that [laughter]\nWhat this is one of those things they say don't try this at home [laughter] don't try a lot of this at home you need professional help I mean really\nI mean truthfully doing you're retired or think about retirement planning like this [noise] ask yourself this question\nThe first time you do something as it usually your very best effort now you know it's like you never get good at it [laughter] I don't want yeah if you do something one time you never get good at it and never have a chance to get good at it and\nSo what we help people do is benefit from the experience of the fact that there have been a lot of people that have done this is just they all did it once\nAnd we've helped hundreds of people do this so so a whole lot of what we do here is just help people be aware of what can be done yeah all of the things that are available to them\nThat they may not have known about and buzz I Know you do the exact same thing for your clients and that's why you know if if people are needing tax planning\nThis deeper than what we can help them with 'cause we're not CPAs but there's a lot of tax stuff that goes on and retirement plan absolutely and that's why we have become as knowledgeable as we have\nSo that we can help people figure this stuff out but then when the rubber hits the road we really need somebody like you buzz\nHelping people do this and so that's we bring a team of people to the table you know al ...\nAnd all that and what people are trying to figure out as we all my money last is this going to last is it going to work and if you're not managing your taxes properly I mean there's an opportunity you're missing that you could really be you could really be maximizing how long your money's gonna last\nAnd so we don't want to evade taxes because that's illegal it starts with an evening we do want to avoid taxes if we can do it legally\nYeah and so we don't want to evade taxes because that's illegal it starts with an evening we do want to avoid taxes if we can do it legally right rice a living so if you're\nTrying to figure out is my money going to last how long do I have to work\nWhat's gonna happen when we retire how do we take our savings and turn it into a paycheck that we can have confidence is going to last as long as we do what are all of the things right now that we can be taken advantage of tax wise that maybe we didn't know about\nWe answer all of those things as part of our retirement planning stress test this analysis we will do for you for free\nWe do it for anybody that comes in and sit down with us and it's a very comfortable environment\nI

time caller is right now [noise]\nInvestment advisor we services offered only do we register individuals through a wolf management Elsie AWAC freedom financial group are not affiliated companies [noise]\nSony we're going to talk about forced retirement [noise] unfortunately uh we're seeing this more and more and so\nOur listeners if you are\nFacing a forced retirement or you're being offered a package and you're not sure what to do yeah or you're working at a company that continues to force retirement and you've just been fortunate that it hasn't happened to you know yet right then this is something to pay attention because\nThe big question one of the big question is that everyone has when they come in here if they're still working as when can I retire right and when I retire might me the question of um is it okay for me to accept this package on being offered in how will that work and how all my money last if\nI Do or will it last as I Do on the other thing is um you know loops it's not it's not ... they're making me go right so how does this work and how will my money laugh is\nIs is my money go yeah am I going to or we you know my my spouse and I are we going to be able to sustain our lifestyle that's the big question and you know a lot of people\nThey're going to be able to sustain their lifestyle but they're scared to spend the money 'cause I don't want to be older and out of money and you know they blow through too much too fast so I mean there are a handful of really big questions that are on\nPretty much everyone's mind when they're facing a situation like this\nAnd unfortunately if you get it wrong it's you know sometimes it's not fixable if we don't figure it out yeah really well\nSo let's talk about some of the questions should accept a retirement buyout offer typically one that will include a severance or take my chances and stay with the job\nAnd people ask a satellite\nSo so what are your thoughts on that\nYou know here's my here's my thought here's my whole thought of that whole thing you're one ... one whole thought on that please please do not go with your gut yeah please please get advice get get it analyze not just somebody who tells you sure that looks like enough money\nI have an asking any questions about what you're spending and what's happening and why do you want to be doing and all the big things I'm not letting you guess at things and we're not guessing that thanks please please get a real solid analysis that you understand and can see\nHow your money's gonna last as long as the both of you do well before you take this off\nWe have a lifestyle analysis process that we go through\nAnd you know you said if if somebody's not asking questions about how much you're spending and that sort of thing I think even brokers it you know big brokerage firms and people at banks\nAsk people they do at how much are you going to need and retirement the problem with that is in in please don't take this the wrong way are loyal and wonderful listeners our experience tells us\nIn an IED in retirement the problem with that is in in please don't take this the wrong way are loyal and wonderful listeners our experience tells us you don't know the answer right so even if they're asking the question if they don't have a process that they're giving you to say go do this so that\nWe can nail this down and it's not a budget NATO budget work she lays out a much larger worksheets don't work so we so we have a proprietary process that we call our lifestyle analysis\nAnd are inaccurate and we choose not to share it on the air because we don't really want to be educating our competition on how to do retirement planning if they can't figure it out on their own [laughter]\nSo ah so this is if you're trying to decide do I take this evidence or not you know Tony you just said don't go with your gut 'cause everybody's got is\nOh yeah let me out of ... and it and it and let me out\nSo when you when you get a figure of thrown at you it seems like a lot of money at the time right I mean it seems like a lot of money and south you know seeming and feeling and hoping is not falling apart\nPoint yeah because here's the thing I mean the men are usually going to go first\nOr us ladies live longer and you know that's that's the thing that we're going to have other jobs not just financial problems but we're also going to have to figure out who's going to clean the gutters and all that stuff so there's a lot of things that we don't do now\nWhile we have a husband that we will be doing at some point and money is one of those things and money can be one of those things that super emotional it can be very fearful ... for a lot of folks\nUm what I Would say to you grace and into every woman out there that's trying to do this for the first time on their own first of all don't be intimidated and don't say I I'm never going to understand this to yourself\nIf you are working with the right person who can not only know about financial stuff but it's able to meet you on whatever level you're on and can talk to you\nI'm In in plain English about what you're wanting to do where we need to go where are you right now where do you stand\nAnd just stay with you in that in that conversation until you understand and we move forward about what we're going to do and make good decisions I had I have yet to sit down with any lady that had that I have not been able to\nSit with them at whatever level of understanding they have and we haven't been able to make clear confident decisions\nUp some of the one of the best I guess I'm compliments I get is ladies told me all the time this is the first time I've ever understood it this is the first time somebody hasn't talked over my head this is the first time actually feel empowered you know so at least I've got other things that I've got to deal with but I don't have to worry about the money piece\nUm that's just that's some something that I Love to do you know it's a passion of mine and I think that everyone should have that level of confidence and understanding about their finances\nWell you know Tony it's not that complicated it's scary for people because they think that it is and chances are they've worked with people in in the financial industry before ... who has made it complicated yeah\nAnd and the thing is is a lot of folks I mean Todd we catch ourselves doing this the longer you do something and become confident that it whatever it is I mean you go to the doctor and he starts talking about stuff and you're like wait I don't even know what that means you know it's because when you get in in a certain you know career field and you you know things\nYou start using terms in terminology that that are common sense to us and common place to us\nBut but not so much for everybody else and so I doubt I think we both of us even when you sit down with with single ladies\nDo a great job I think if I Will say we do a great job of something that is one thing is is really saying ... I'm not going to do that I'm going to talk your language I'm going to say things in a way that you say things um I don't blame things until you understand exactly what\nI've always had this there's a big difference between knowing something and being able to teach mhm [noise]\nI think there's a lot of people with a lot of knowledge that aren't good teachers right and you know again if if if we may be so bold as to to complement ourselves I think that's one of the things that we do really well yeah\nUse help people that are financial planners understand all this stuff\nAnd if you explain it the right way and you explain it\nTo help people that aren't financial planners understand all this stuff\nAnd if you explain it the right way and you explain it using examples that they get right you know we talk about our fiscal house so we talk about building a retirement plans like building a house and we have\nIt in ... we do this in our it just dawned on me you know we do a three hour retirement plan in class we typically do it right here just state by her office in Inverness and if you would like to come to that is three hours\nAre typically on a Tuesday or Thursday we used to charge tuition for it but we don't anymore\nAnd we do a deep dive where\nI personally think\nThis is one of the most valuable things you can do for yourself and your family is coming to this class and I'm not just talking now about people that don't have a grasp on financial matters I'm Talking about people that think they have a a great grasp on financial matters right\nUnless you plant hundreds of retirements even if you're the one that manages all the investments and understands all that I think there's a lot to be learned in this class if you'd like to come to that call you can call the operator and leave a message and our staff will get back with your next week or you can call during the week and just get on the list for the next class it's nine at a triple zero six\nTwo oh five nine a zero zero zero six but we were talking ... in that class we're using a lot of\nA very approachable examples right for people to get it and you know ... uh we did one recently there were a lot of single women in there and they were given us the same feedback you know this is the first time this has made a lot of sense to us right\nAnd there's a different you just said something a second ago had you know even if it's somebody who does has done prior to retire at all of their investments in their own thing\nI'm there is a huge difference that people sometimes don't understand between accumulating money saving for retirement and now now I've got a ... I've got to start using my money\nAnd I got to make sure it lasts as long as I Do and I got to look at health care and taxes and inflation and\nAll the things that are going to happen to me that I've never faced before\nSo grades you know going back to your mom I mean I I Would recommend she come see us I mean you know I mean but honestly\nYou really want her in and if you even if you don't know about money I think it's important maybe that you interview people with her so that you guys are comfortable with with the folks that you're working with it should be someone you literally felt like\nThere are taking your ... your mom by the hand and guiding her through her through this and not in a way like don't you worry about it we're going to just take care of it for you in a way that empowers your mom so your mom knows what she's doing and why she's doing it and then it makes sense to hurt that is important because\nEven if you think you're working with somebody I'll say this titled him even if you believe our hope you're working with somebody that understands that all quote unquote and has a plan for you quote unquote ... if you don't understand what it is\nI when as soon as you retire or soon as this decision and this money gets foisted on you\nYou're gonna wake up in a sweat in the middle of the night it's going to happen from time to time I I Can't tell you how many people say oh my gosh I Hope this doesn't apply to me whatever hurting the news and whatever the economy's doing and whatever the president's doing and whatever this is happening\nSo you don't have those panic attacks in the middle of the night when you understand what's happening\nIt's when it's the unknown that scares the devil out of you know so and and I know this is scary and I'm not making a lot of this I I care about this deeply because you know your mom should know your mom should be at least resting and the fact that she's got that call\nWell this is scary and I'm not making light of this I I care about this deeply because you know your mom should know your mom should be at least rafting and the fact that she's got that cover and not worrying\nAbout him I Would say for you grace you know you said I don't know that much about this either get it I Know I Would say you know fix that before it happens to have yeah yeah and and so you know I'm inspired after this question I'm inspired to to do a special offer now\nThis is for\nWomen only they would like to empower yourself you have to understand retirement planning yeah and uh we we don't normally do this either but sometimes I've found Tony ... ladies are more comfortable with you\nAnd sometimes there are more comfortable with me they are yeah and so it's you know uh it's kind of a you don't know [noise] All right so in addition to an offer only for women I Would also like to give you\nEmpower you to choose huh I think she liked to sit down with Tony or would you like to sit down with me\nThat lady's joy but\nEither way here's what's gonna happen we will go through in detail in help you think through where are you now water what's going on what are the things that really should be paid attention to and how to go about paying attention to them\nWe will give you very clear feedback in plain English about what where are you are and what needs to be done to get you on the best possible position\nAnd we'll explain how our process works so that you are empowered to make the decisions obviously we're guiding you but you know and again we may decide to work together long term we may decide where the right fit to to help you\nAnd maybe not but this initial analysis is does is designed to get you to get your sea legs under you as it relates to all this so that you can feel confident with what's going on if you'd like to take advantage of that\nA lady's call in the next Fifteen minutes and uh one when you come into our office\nAfter we sat down will also give you a copy of the book that I

job and all that other good stuff she's been on me\nHey she got to hold you to your word I bet you made a promise and I'm sure\nI I I did but I have been so busy I really have but but\nWe had two two we had to\nBreak up chairs and pull up linoleum from the floor\nIn order to have firewood and to keep ... you had to break up the furniture in the house yet or use to make errors would share we had to break up the war chairs a man to pull all known him from the floor in order to make a fire to keep more\nAll right there that support that I certainly don't know and probably a great many people that are listening to this can't even relate to 'em you said something about going next door to use your your neighbor water\nDigital neighbors have an open door for this I mean did they understand that kind of poor what they equally as poor or they just open their Web back bag and it'll tell you\nWhat back in ... you can always go back\nNext door to a neighbor and get\nA cup of sugar a cup of flour were so if you will water or if you are the sugar back in the day that I grew up in you could do that and they didn't think nothing of it and and they didn't mind sharing that when I came up they would share\nThey would share well let me let me ask you this because you talk about another thing or in the book and and I want to say something here when you when you first started talking about this you were talking about the pain and the shame what was that Shane\nTalk about another thing or in the book and and I want to say something here when you when you first start talking about this you were talking about the pain and the shame what was that Shane\nShane was when I was at school I didn't have no food to eat so the key is made fun of me and they laughed at me because when I walked\nIn the lunchroom\nThey would look at me and smiled because I didn't have any money to even buy my own food\nThat's that that's something there and ... and speaking about that I I Want to say this because this was a really heavy topic er during these times because when you were actually experiencing what bullying yes did you are perceived as being bullying even back then are these are just mean kids\nBack in the town that I came in ... it wasn't called blue in and you really didn't think of it as it is kids just being me just give me me because now they call it bubbling but it would just mean kids back in time I came\nMhm and I'm I'm gonna sit there for just one minute because you know to day you've got bullying and you and as a result of that building and social media of course you've got kids doing things like\nUm committing suicide or being under that kind of pressure where they're always trying to fit in making a difference wouldn't want to make a name for themselves you know wouldn't want to be falling in with the crowd just this popular or whatever how does a kid growing up when you did so by that kind of pressure did you ignore it\nDidn't you did you did you meet back what you know to\nSee should read it as a young child my mom taught us about prayer\nShe taught us about Jesus and then I Will if you will by you would know that my mom taught us all about prayer and all about Jesus and we knew all about it so we knew we didn't fight back with fish and bus well\nWe did we prayed and God blessed us\nAnd and he did and that's the thing about this book as I was going through this book and I love I Love a story like this because Everytime you talk about it yesterday or something that you would through\nYou talk about how God brought you through it yeah it relates to scripture maybe or is not you know you don't go to a whole book and then you talk about God guy carried to even through this book\nOr someone to talk about um you know when people buy this book um what is it that you want them to get out of it\nYou know what what part what part of this book do you think is probably going to have the most impact on them\nI Would like to tell a young person and my my book is can relate to young people and old people should read\nIt will take you back to where you are and where you want to go now young kids have goals they're in college now and they health goes to where they really want to go and what and what they want to achieve what they really want to be\nBut one thing I Would like to tell them this year reader you can't do anything not unless you have God in your life okay if you saw him number one\nThen you'll be able to achieve anything you want to do anything that you want to do yet and they have to keep that top of mind all the time all of that mindset\nThat have that mindset you know and and Joe talked about this earlier about when he wrote this book and and you know\nThe top of mind all the time all that ...\nThat have that mindset you know and and Joe talked about this earlier about when he wrote a book and and you know that sort of inspired you to write to write your own books yet when he wrote that book and you were going through it or that chapter ah the he wrote and you were reading it what was it about that chapter that made you say you know what I'm gonna tell my story\nThe reason why they gave me an idea to write the book when Joe invited his dad and I to come to his book opening\nI got home that night and read the book but the thing to inspire me the most when you start talking about radio ... he said I came to my mom and my dad\nAnd he said and I told them what I Want to do he said but my mom told me San you could do anything you want to do and he said from day you know he went on through and he made\nBut added spat me because I'm saying like\nIf he can do it mhm uh six or seven year old lady I feel like I can do it to you could do it too oh yeah\nYeah and I and I love that because um you know Joe being being grown Joe okay he obviously learned some lessons as judge Joe yeah and I what I'm saying so a lot of times we don't see that until they get to be a be an adult in that chapter\nTo me both you and papa lock it would very apparent\nThrough those lessons to Utah to him and I think through this book or the like you say young and old yeah learn something from his book up I Want and I want to talk about the book process to because I think that everybody has a story in them\nYeah okay and I know as a young person my cousin I used to always talk about if we can write a book when you can read book\nOkay and everybody's got a story tell so tell me about that process can do\nIt right in a book I have learned in my time in writing a book you have you have to put yourself in it spiritual why\nIt's already in your head when you write in the book only thing you're doing is just putting you know they just\nPut it on pay you already have it in your mind mhm what you\nWant to write about but you really you are with nailing it to the world when you put it down on a paper\n[noise] do you have any reservations about that because you know I ... I remember the first one of the first books that I was a\nCoauthor on my my chapter just happened to be about depression and thoughts of suicide and so when I decided to write that I wrote the whole chapter I came up with I just wrote it probably about about Fifteen or twenty minutes and then I'll pull back because I was like oh\nMy God how\nDo I want people to know just bought me so some of the stuff that you talk\nAbout a year being poor you know going to school being bullied a your sickness did you have any reservations about revealing that\nPeople know she read it I did not simply because I rode it I wanted the world to know do never forget where you come from ... and I'm not ashamed because I was poor\nBut I wasn't the only one being for my sisters and brothers was poor alone with me mhm and God have brought our last through to where we are today\nI don't have anything I'm lead every end it\nLets me mhm and God have brought our last through to where we are today\nSo I don't have anything I'm Lynn every any anybody know to date and that's listening at me you could be poor but you don't have to stay there you don't have to stay there\nGod can bring you from Paul to the richer but you got to ... and you got I got this he is doing and now you're not doing this on your own\nWhich ain't got to stay there and you ain't got the ... [laughter]\nGot to walk because he'll pick you up I don't care how far you fall into that show right he will pull you up and he will shake you off and he'll turn you around and not what are you all about that won't even know what he'll do you do\nYou do it every time we haven't chart you would\nDo it every time I Know that I don't know on hold witness Cerrito\nI'm a witness you'll do it I don't care how far you go had darkest thing\nI don't care what situation un I don't care if you feel like you want to commit suicide is a God and I as a living God he will bring you don't\nThat you're a stroke just grab the personal but we're talking about the judge Joe luggage oh we got married in a house and some God is the brown would somehow white lawyer on who you think he goes over my studio or did you guys go into words do a lot of jokes [noise]\nW. or do you ever going to be ...

I mean you talked about he said you're going to affect me once a week\nUm [noise]\nThe few things that have happened oh I I was in Chicago we were going to hold on hold on to the news and\nWell well let's let's break it down slowly number one\nUm I was in Chicago I was actually flown out a vi I'm a ... a company called city has its ... companies in the optical and ah they flew me out because the bowls and then he did a partnership and basically they missed the first response of the Chicago Bulls Iran to social media I'll sit behind Scotty Pippin and Tony ... the announcement\nAt a good time not the first thing second thing um which I think you're alluding to it's been a crazy a few days but uh later this month I Will be beginning and transitioning into television I Will MSG Network\nIn New York City has to network that's mixed in New York rangers play on so a lot of good things happening I left a couple of weeks so yeah I think that's I mean as you were talking about\nThat's lump on the news but if somebody's going to be appearing on once a week\nKeeping up\nOh you know yeah you have to say the best but last yeah most of the guy did you [laughter]\nKnow\nBride no I Know brand new yet a lot going on but yeah it's good to be made going to be stopping by my TV show\nOn bringing down the sport for he's gonna be an expert in stopping in once a week when he can to talk about sports and bringing the reality that he can be spoken with these kind of I spoken to him and I ...\nA man I mean at the intersection of sport and politics is definitely\nA thing but it's nothing really new I just think that the twenty four hour war types of of news a pop culture sports is colliding and ah I didn't even music you know that I agree I think is a is a A R\nIs notable you know and I've said this week or um and I said I just I I think when you look at politics right now um I think\nPresident Obama made\nWell you know and I've said this week or nominates and I just I I think when you look at politics right now um I think President Obama made the office of president\nAttainable for the person who came after having him President Trump ... who\nWas not eight who didn't have any political um experience but yeah\nIt have experience running his own company and if you look at just um the way politics look right now just the way the world works I mean do you compare it to sports like you had Jason Kidd a MBA hall of famer played many is an MBA won a championship\nNo experiences as they head coach ... came to my school of Brooklyn where it was the team he used to play or in you know they say a point guard extensions of the of the coach on the floor\nAnd he was able to leave the nest the play offs and they're going to Milwaukee make things happen I make that comparison to President Trump the only difference there is\nUm the the nets went to the playoffs we're still figuring out what President Trump is going um and and leadership is the difference you know you have to lead by example and um you know you have ethics involve you have other things involved but\nAll that aside Saturday I don't want a oldie alienate people you're near me what I Would say that\nUm I think it's a change of the guard of people putting in my ... year for me to be with experience\nAh in their respective wield and I think that's kinda representative of the times right now is a ... bad the book is still being written\nExactly exactly and the other thing is I Know that you know when you talk about politics you talk about sports right now in our society when we're looking at sports and politics we have seen lately where politics have entered the sports arena\nMhm and you know with that being said what are your thoughts on\nYou know ... athletes actually just you know play football and leave their political stance on the sidelines or do you think right now with sports is going and going in the direction where people are able to use that platform to speak their political beliefs\n[noise] I was raised to speak truth column even and people don't necessarily want to hear it I'm like I said previously I think that sports\nAnd folks uh sports have always spoke their mind but I'll tell you when it's happening on them when you look at the sixties and seventies outlet e bill Russell they were outspoken about their\nUh their stance or the early in the ... and you can you had a max you had all these different people speaking out about things that ... right right uh but then with if I Believe in the end up happening is that\nThe major contracts came along\nUm Nike Reebok Adidas and whatever and um and so I don't know if they voluntarily were quiet because they knew that maybe it would mess up their paycheck ... uh but then along came probably capital make them along and the brawn James and none of these other ...\nAnd the money wasn't necessarily issue I'm standing up for what was right in their opinion is maybe what their their their their meals and I think that um when you're talking about how we can frantic I think we'll get lost in translation is it about the flat", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael Hart", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "20"}
