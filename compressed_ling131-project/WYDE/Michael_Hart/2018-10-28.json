B. C. H. do we're going we're super six of one on one W windy [noise]\nWelcome back welcome back this is rich or rice on results with Richard Rice and we are\nIn our eighth episode I Believe eighth or ninth episode yeah already and Thomas flying we're having a good time or this week we're really really excited about the show you know I say that every week but I really mean at this time I'm In the studio with us today we have some I'm very I'm what I Would say progressive\nAnd the entrepreneurial thinking individuals who are going to introduce you to maybe something that you've heard about maybe in a different context or maybe just introduce you to a new concept altogether\nSo today we have with us from his Karen Johnson say hello care hello thanks for having me sees me so modest today and also we have Mr Brian Williams all everyone\nAnd a camera Johnson is the founder of launch solutions L L C um it's a um locally based business that set up to a provide all types of\nUm ... PR services and helps businesses or develop new ideas new programs in and helps entrepreneur take concepts from being just the concept to making an idea become more marketable and producing whatever type of value in products that they're interested in\nCreating and Mr Williams here is an expert on a block chain development and crypto currency and also on the cannabis industry\nAbsolutely and so today we're going to be discussing those topics and talking about how ah crypto currency and cannabis king guard merging together to a great somewhat of a new market\nUm and so before we get too far into that conversation I like to go to our two guests and start with ms Johnson and and tell us who you are and so it's a little bit about yourself\nYes so I Am a Birmingham native born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama and been here all of my life and I was raised by a woman who um was very\nDead set on me expanding and creating my own possibilities and and and and not so much from an entrepreneurial standpoint um but a lot of the things that I learned in my schooling and three of my professional experiences\nAnd entrepreneurship just kind of started to flow naturally added though my insurance with peek into\nAnd how we can address certain everyday challenges um that are being at kind of address I guess on some level by larger corporate companies how we can start to do that as entrepreneur as as smaller and more grassroots level organizations in cell\nAnd my ... and I'm kind of civic involvement has taken me around\nThe city and beyond and the kids exploring different models and as you know Frank ... doctor is Atkins and right\nUm the city and beyond um inches exploring different models um as you know for good friends with Mr Dr Atkins and um held him established the cooperative new school forever and said he's an environmental just ... and um that was a model that kind of spearheaded\nJust looking at different markets looking at different industries that we're doing things and just slightly different ways um as we know I Love the city had been here all my life but there is a\nUm tendency a lot of times to just do the same thing over and over again and so I Am a and have always been a person that says if it's not working I'm let's find new possibilities and and let's in some cases create those new possibilities for ourselves\nMost definitely and I'm Glad that you have been mentioned Dr Hanson and the cooperative middle school or just maybe an hour ago I registered for\nThe court system and ordered there'll be hosting this weekend or Saturday I think I'm a moon I Believe is the term that will be taking off and on this particular topic just became more about organizing and some of those um oh there are ways that we can bring these new ideas to the forefront and I think is really important for us to think about\nHow do we not only whole current institutions accountable you know and there's a lot of the work that we do but how do we create new institutions that are more just\nAnd um and that's why I think it was so important for you to have the foresight to bring Mr Williams here because that is one of those opportunities where we see these new industries new markets are merging than we can kind of ... how we distribute the value and the resources that are being created as a result of the\nExactly yeah and that was the that was the goal and\n'em knowing it's interesting um you know since I decided to do this event it's interesting how people have kind of perceived though it\nIs it's a can of his party or what was happening here um but it is it really is about the um industry as an industry can of as as an industry and the opportunity that holds for\nUm brown and black people who had been disenfranchised from the criminalization of of that industry and so I'm meeting Brian was really a a dream come through is what I say because it's just so important for us to\nFeel like this type of opportunity is accessible for us as everyday people\nThat were perfect does good and ah so how did you do me you know just\n[noise] um I'm doing all the shot out today so um another wonderful friend of mine Jessica Latin um who was the founder of we are artists war Inc\nI'm In Birmingham ... it was started in two thousand nine or ten I Believe even further back than that I Want to say two thousand seven or eight actually\nUm like she is just a dear friend of mine um is back in Birmingham and we were having a conversation and I said you know I'm really interested about these two industries canvassing crypto and\nUm you know she said well I have just the guy you shoot me he's the one that convinced me to go to school and get my MBA and I said well we're ... and you know connections are my thing I\nI Love knowing and getting to know new people and so I reached out to Brian the very next day and we had a ... actually that same day we had our first conversation um\nThat Monday and it was just I I told her he broke my brain but I was so ... it was like\nAffirmation confirmation of things that I had thought um and quite frankly I I Am a millennial am also a mother a wife I'm and I'm a just a regular black woman and getting excited about an\nI'm not their wife I'm and I'm just a regular black woman and getting excited about an industry and knowing all the information is one thing but feeling like you had the tools and information to actually\nUm capitalizing take advantage of that industry is a totally either ... talking to Brian in kind of getting an insight into just how like really at our fingertips kids at\nThe candidates and and also the crypto currency industries are which Jay right it was amazing\nThat I definitely definitely so without further ado I mean that's the perfect segue to Mr Brown Williams itself I mean he's just told me before we got over here there's this this is the precipice of the gold rush like this is\nThis is a modern day opportunity for us too I'm In a lot of ways read to close the wealth gap no could close the gap and a lot of ways it could be um and is is is one of the tools that we can use to address it\nBut er Brian tell us about you know who you are how did you arrive at this point and then we can get into some of the nuts and bolts of the two industries that will be discussing\nWell if he's asked me to describe myself I'll call myself a finance in technology narrative color\nOkay that's good [laughter]\nI mean I think being a nerve very seriously right when I tell you about my background you'll see a pretty clearly cooker so starting at the beginning um I was in high school of and another limit\n[laughter] and got my engineering degree at Purdue University so I was one of two black people who are in on his program at the time I was there some current and like that at all has to do my brothers and sisters and other classes right messed up\nBut nonetheless adaptor that I'm I'm also NBA when's the University of Texas I'm within the venture capital organization they're\nSo uh between those two I got a series seven moved to New York stock broker so out of sausages me\nSo when you add those things together you have the engineering that teaches you how to think to a problem logically\nYou have the financial tools that show you how the sausages made with regard to the financial tools trading options stocks securities things of that nature and then you have the business piece that shows you how to work with those tools right in the middle and you start to see how you can put problems together using those three things in order to complete and sort of industrial understand\nSo when it comes to understanding the industry of candidates I see a lot of different intersections that create opportunities that are short lived and I must stress that that are short lived you cannot wait to get these opportunities they will pass 'em but right now they're very large opportunities because no one is actually\nA no one has become the front runner in many of the spaces where these opportunities exist and I believe that in communities of color those who are most dramatically impacted negatively by the war on drugs I think the level of creativity as well as the level of need\nI'm a little bit about it All right so I I I got to plug my business a little bit here and I'm definitely a very ... so I'm I'm a partner and co founded a company\nCalled Wayne and read and we are a black chain and high technology consultancy and an adventurous studio I'm so we'll be involved in building businesses surrounding block Chang and using technology as well as other a high technologies as well as consulting organizations on how they can as well\nAnd um [noise] side of the result I have a a keen understanding of what's called private permission blocking which is it the ones that are used to such as the theory on bitcoin\nSo there are first I talk about ... and then I'll talk about the two different flavors of blocked and we got as quickly as I can okay\nSo the ones that most people understand or the applications called bitcoin application called the theory and\nThose are implementation of a money sort of system and the way it works is through what's called a consensus mechanism what ... is like an ism is is a bunch of computers agree that a ... a transaction is valid so if someone tries to act the system or put something on there that shouldn't be there the consensus mechanism won't let that transaction go through\nAnd one of the ways that that works is through something called proof of work and that's where you see the miners and what not using computers trying to figure out above all\nProof of work is it'll give you a string of numbers that's really hard to figure out the coach too\nAnd they can leave off a certain amount of digits and the more they just they leave off that you have to use your computer to figure out the longer it takes a computer to do it the first one to figure it out in the world gets rewarded in some form of bitcoin and then that transaction gets copy all around the world\nNow the downside to that is that it takes a bunch of computing energy to do it the upside of it is you don't need any central body in order to regulate it so when you want to do something public that's one of the consensus mechanisms that weren't\nSo for public block change you have that energy that you have to use in order to de centralized\nIn business that doesn't make sense right that consensus does not work at all you have to work\nSo for public block change you have that energy that you have to use in order to de centralized\nIn business that doesn't make sense right that consensus does not work at all you have to work at speed you have to have a certain level of privacy you have to know who's dealing with your data\nSo in the business and they don't use those public consensus mechanisms they use private ones that's where my business place we make enterprise applications where they don't use that system they use more code based consistency mechanisms where at all of the computers involved All right in cold what that means it's this will be\nSo basically if me you in several other people decide that we're going to do transactions together we code in this is what a valid transaction is according to us\nAnd we're the ones building the network so we can say what that will be and we all have to adhere to it and since we agree to it as a group we all have to be honest one hundred percent of the time because it's problematic right so there is no way that anyone can cheat the system in all businesses can trust it at the same time not take it out of businesses and apply that to nonprofits and churches\nRight where everyone has to be honest that the same time an edge in applying that to a city government a nonprofit a church and the community organization where everyone has to be honest at the same time you see how the technology can start turning into things that can really inside changed just lie technologist applying it in an intellectual way\nRight right and I mean even if even if like the technological side of how all of this work some some seems seems somewhat overwhelming maybe to a new listen there I mean we still understand this idea of of ah you know creating value right and having an honest honest exchange of of how they value is passed from one person to another\nAnd ah with traditional currency a lotta times\nWe can see so many people create value in different areas of our market but the money never really follows where the value is created mhm and you can even look at something as um [noise] well known as the NFL right [noise] and so with the NFL right now they have I Believe like a fifty one percent forty nine percent profit\nSharing amongst the owners and the players right and so in in in in ... I think we could all reasonably agree that the players\nThat's where the values created absolutely but yet they are in a situation where they're all you know losing out ocean or fifty one percent of the profit what the owners and is based on all of these disparities\nIn traditional ways of doing things and and so maybe if there is a way for us to have you know a different type of currency then it could create more ... you know ... more just outcome\nAbsolutely and I mean you can cut the kind of see something like that it's possible I mean people are spending a currency is left and right right but the thing that makes currency valuable as a scarcity is the reason why gold is worth something and you know pine needles or not\nIs because you can't find gold everywhere\nIn as a result of that that increases its value the thing that made that claim valuable is that over time the scarcity of it made its value go up\nSo if there was a little group of people right if if an organization if if a fraternity wanted to have a a currency fray only thing stopping them from actually doing that is the value that they can inject into the worth of that currents they can get people to accept in trans act with it it becomes about\nWhere I Am so it's really more psychology and scarcity and value than it is a technology your application\nYeah I mean I Would argue that it is I Would argue that is more psychology than anything like whatever we choose to collectively assigned value to we can write and then like it and then at some point is going to be related to what the limited to all of us no matter how much value I create or how much money I came away\nI don't control how much time I have here on planet earth right and so if I'm investing a certain amount of time in in in developing whatever it is my main goal or\nMining um you know crypto currency is whatever they may be then that is going to assign a value to it as well and then this\nBeing whatever it is mining goal or mining um you know crypto currencies and whatever they may be then that is going to assign a value to it as well and then the psychological part I'm becomes a a component of it as well and it\nAnd I think that um for me and and when I whenever I hear Bryan pockets like I'm learning new things every single time\nBut that consensus nice um you know consensus as currency consensus as it just depends that that example that you gave about the NFL players\nThe reason why they are at a disadvantage then that team owners and and the management is because there's no consensus among them of what that value is going to be separate\nYeah and in and they don't feel that they don't even feel like they have the bargaining power look what happened the comic happening so maybe it's understandable why they don't feel like they have the bargaining power\nBut they don't feel like they have the bargaining power to make the distribution of wealth and value more just and these are individual millionaires and that you know in in a lot of people's mind people in you know here in Birmingham and all over there like\nIf they reach that status of a millionaire and then everything else falls in place but it's still like certain disparities are based on this current system of wealth distribution that really can't you know there are very difficult to be broken and so we do need to look at ways of creating accountability in the current system\nBut also creating new institutions and Lincoln those new institutions together or to promote more justice system as well what I like to do is come back to each one of you and to allow you to talk about your organization's a little bit more tell people how they can contact you can go ahead\nSure sell 'em at lunch solutions is really designed to make\n'em ... possible more accessible to everyone till\nI'm ... from from I ... into and figuring out how to take a business idea from just that idea of faith to an actual ... Lucian in really candidate that same conversation at figuring out ways that we can add value with people\nOn and business owners to a larger community how we can actually use their businesses that solve everyday problems\nAnd so that's what I Do on a full time basis now on my website is seamless S. E. A. N. L. E. S. S. launch L. A. U. N. C. H. dot com on and on Facebook as well and um that me\nAll right well great great great thank you but I Do a ... about two minutes left I Want you to go ahead and in a plug your organizations are\nActually well I Am the co founder and partner at Wayne and read a we do have an allergy consulting we build projects out a on it and across level\nOr we only work with private permission block chain we don't go to any crypto currency is at all um [noise] we also have a job where we look to uh find interesting opportunities to stock or to support the opportunities that see a rise with the technology scope and background that we understand [noise]\nUm so for us we're looking to always learn and work with excellent excellent people who have very high standards for what they want to achieve and we enable that\nExcellent excellent and um are you at this time engagement offering any type of consulting or regulatory advised to any um corporations are companies that are interested in engaging in and either one of the two markets we just go to\nA consulting yes regulatory no okay um that's a moving target that changes every time someone changes office but yes we are absolutely available for conversation can find us at Wayne and read dot com\nExcellent excellent I Want to say thank you to Broadway and they can earn Johnson is his results with Richard Rice want you to tune in next Sunday again at three PM thank you\nHey trust Bill thanks for listening superstition ... won\nThe karaoke bar Greg shows the telltale signs of being wasted [noise] first off season a karaoke bar ... she can be as backup singer\nBreak asks his buddy if he met his backup singer he takes another shot and realizes he's not sitting in his body then she spends an hour searching for the perfect song food menu\nAfter that there's the technicians wages the chemicals and heck the ordinary cost of doing business so we're talking about a loss on this first appointment coming out and doing it for free okay\nWhy would we do that well here's what we get out of the deal\nWe ... I Can't tell you\nHow many times it's happened where customers have become a huge cheerleaders even before we're done the running around telling their neighbors making calls to family members and say you've got to try these guys out\nThat enthusiasm is why the average radio customer provides us with three to seven referrals folks'\nBusiness people out there\nWhat's referral or a new customer worth to you\nIf your furnace or your air conditioner goes out and you call a friend or relative and you say hey I've got this furniture air conditioner problem who do you use your air conditioner and they say you got a call freedom heating and cooling they did the best maintenance we have\nEver had at that point or you can go play Google roulette of course\nYou're going to take the advice of your friend or your neighbor or your church buddy or your relatives because the company they're recommending served them\nWow that's the power of doing things right for people\nThat's the power of doing a good job customers seeing it appreciating it and then spreading the good worried about your business\nYou\nKnow look I'm going to give this two hundred and fifty two dollar total system rejuvenation away for free right now to the first five callers freedom heating and cooling is going to pay for it all we ask is that if we do a good job for you\nThat you considered becoming a regular client and you tell other people about\nUs that's fair right okay\nYou have to be one of the first five dollars so grab your telephone so that you can get the number and I'm going to give the first five away right now the next five callers are going to get this to not for free\n\nHere the numbers are you ready dial quickly because they go fast ready to zero five\nSeven to five six zero one one seven to five six zero one one seven to five six zero one one that's two zero five\nSeven to five or six zero one one we've got our first one no two callers at two o five\nSeven to five six zero one one three left now at two zero five Seventy five six zero one one Seventy five six zero one one seven to five six zero one one one left last one get it to five\nSeven to five six zero one one\nNo look if you can't get to a phone right now but you can get on the line be the very first person to go to clean my AC dot com\nFill out the radio discount requests form click submit and will reserve one of these just for you but you got to be the first person okay that's clean my AC dot com\nNow here's the deal folks here\nIt'll be the first person okay that's clean my AC dot com\nNow here's the deal folks here's what you're going to experience when I send one of these guys out\nFirst off he's going to park his truck in the street\nNow while our fleet is meticulously maintained this is just a precautionary measure that's going to keep you drew leaks where they belong away from your driveway okay\nWhen he comes up to your front door he's going to knock on the front door and when you invite him and he's going to reach down and put on floor savers or she covers over his shoes or boots\nThat's because we're going to be working with some water and stuff cleaning your outdoor air conditioning unit or heat pump and it does tend to get a little muggy okay\nHe's going to start his own voice and then he's going to ask you to see the thermostat he's going to ask if he can quickly click it on and when he does he's going to make sure that the system is actually working\nAfter he turns it on he'll then ask you to show him to be out door air conditioning unit and then the indoor heating unit and once he's seen those he'll go get to work\nNow his very first task is to remove the top off of the outdoor air conditioning system after that he's going to get the leaves and sticks and mark and debris out of the bottom of the system because all of that stuff holds water when it rains\nIt's going to rush the bottom of your system out prematurely okay so we're going to get all of that junk out of there\nThat alone is going to extend the life of your outdoor unit\nThe next step in my opinion is the best okay we're going to use a semi high pressure nozzle to spray down your out door coils from the inside out\nNow that's going to force all the leaves and grass clippings and dust and whatnot that has been sucked into it over the last six months back out of the coils it's almost like lifting a sweater off of your air conditioning system\nNow imagine you were I listeners jogging on a hot summer's day with a sweater on and is drawn your mouth\nYour body can't release the heat right so you get really really hot\nWell the same thing happens to your outdoor air conditioning unit and your indoor unit if it's dirty it's going to overheat you're going to have a compressor failure you're going to have motors fail sometimes we even have to use a booming cleanser to get all that stuff out\nYou're looking at a good forty five minutes just up to this point so can you see now why I say that the other maintenance is our drive by maintenance as if they're there and gone in forty five minutes\nNext we're going to test all the electrical components in your system to make sure that you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires\nYou might have a pending compressor failure because you've got this little starter that's about to go bad\nYou might have a pending motor failure because you've got to filter that's all plugged up and you're not paying attention to it All right so we're gonna check all of those little miniscule components that don't cost that much at all to repair or replace\nNext we're going to check your indoor heating system or your furnace we'll check the burners your pressure switches make sure that the exhaust is\nNext we're going to check your indoor heating system or your furnace we'll check the burners your pressure switches make sure that the exhaust is venting properly\nAll of your hoses your drains a flame sensor even run a little own test they call it on your ignite or because if that little baby goes bad it's gonna get cold in your house in a hurry\nMost importantly we're going to check the heat exchange or that's the part that is known to crack and delete carbon monoxide\nLook we all know that carbon monoxide can kill you write but did you know that a majority of the people that survive a one time carbon monoxide poisoning event have a life long side effects\nDo you see now why I say that you have\nTo do these two naps and inspections every six months you don't really have a choice\nWill go to your indoor air conditioning coil after that and inspected for any sort of biological growth that might be growing on any dirt and the mole mildew bacteria viruses things like that I mean you've heard that mold grows and heating and air conditioning systems haven't you\nThe fact is that it's common for us to find a combination of things in your air stream last time I checked there were twenty two registered strains of mold and while all twenty two are considered allergens seven of them are actually toxic okay\nAnd just what are the side effects of breathing mold\nWell everyone's affected differently right but here's just a fraction of the list of side effects were talking about things like upset stomachs weight gain fatigue\nLosses sleep night sweats headaches rashes sore throats coughing I allergies there's lots of taste loss of smell there's auto immune disorders sexual side effects and let's not forget about depression\nDid she know that one in every four people that you know right now has zero ability within their body to fight mold spores\nOne in four one of four people folks that their bodies lack the ability to mark the spores for the white blood cells to exterminate\nYour body your immune system it's supposed to mark or tag unwanted invaders for extermination\nWhat if your body is one of the one in four that can't fight back what is that what is your son or your daughter or your wife or your husband or your father or your mother when do we usually realize that we have a health problem\nAnd because most people don't have really good filtration systems those blower wheels they tend to get a little bit of build up on them and a lot of times we see a good eighth of an inch of build up on them that's about as thick as two quarters stacked right on top of one another\nNow when that happens your system just can't move the appropriate amount of their\nNow just one thirty second of an inch will reduce your air speed by twenty percent\nIf that blow and we'll get kinda nasty if it gets just a little bit of build up on it that will show the whole life right out of your heating and cooling system and if you're lucky you'll be forced to spend twenty five hundred dollars on a new heated exchange or or compress or\nIf you're not so lucky you could never wake up again\nDid you know that cracked heat exchanges leak carbon monoxide into your ear stream did you know that according to the CDC someone dies from carbon monoxide poisoning every day in the United states\nDid you know that over fifty percent of the people that survive a one time carbon monoxide poisoning event will suffer long term side effects for the rest of their lives\nHeart problems neurological problems nervous system damage mental illness personality and behavioral changes loss of muscle function and loss of bladder control I mean the list is\nTruly scary what if that was you are one of your family members you probably didn't realize that your blood\n... scary wonder if that was you are one of your family members you probably didn't realize that you're blower for you and your furniture air conditioner getting dirty could kill you did you\nSay look if that blower wheels dirty my technicians will pull it out and they'll show it to you and they'll say look we've got to get this cleaned up and taken all apart and that's above and beyond what you'd normally do in a total system rejuvenation that's restoration work but\nWhen we get it put back together you can get more air flow it's going to ... that are you going to have cleaner fresher air you're gonna have a lower energy bills I mean that's what it's all about folks\nHey you want another reason to get your heating and air conditioning system tuned up\nHave you ever heard of Louisiana State university\nWell they did a study that compared electrical usage of a dirty heating and air conditioning system to clean heating and air conditioning equipment and what they found was that the average customer with a clean system just one system in their house clean one\nSaved thirty two dollars and Seventy cents a month on their energy bills\nThirty two dollars and Seventy cents a month that serious\nNo look and about one or two minutes I'm going to open up these phone lines and if you couldn't get through when I give you the telephone number I'm going to do your entire system both the heating and cooling side not for the two hundred and fifty two dollars we normally charge\nBut for free that's right F. R. E. E. free\nNow I only do this on the radio and they'll tell you why because let's face it I Can't send a minimum wage worker to your house for free and make any money at all frankly the U.S government\nSays that it costs fifty three cents a mile last time I checked to send a vehicle to your home just in gas and wear and tear\nAfter that there's the technicians wages the chemicals and pack the ordinary cost of doing business so we're talking about a loss on this first appointment coming out and doing it for free why would we do that well here's what we get out of the deal\nWe get referrals\nI Can't tell you guys how many times it's happened where customers have become huge cheerleaders even before we're done there running around telling their neighbors making calls to family members saying you've got to try these guys out\nBooks that enthusiasm is why the average radio customer provides us with three to seven referrals\nIf your furnace or your air conditioner breaks down and you call a friend or relative and you say hey I've got this furniture air conditioner problem who do you use your furnace and they say you got a call freedom heating and cooling they did the best maintenance we have ever\nHad\nAt that point are you going to go play Google roulette of course not you're going to take the advice of your friend or your neighbor or your church buddy or your relatives because the company that they're recommending to you served them well\nNow that's the power of doing things right for people that's the power of doing a good job customers seeing it appreciating it and spreading the word about your business\nNo look I'm going to give this two hundred and fifty two dollar total system rejuvenation away right now for free\nNo look I'm going to give this two hundred and fifty two dollar total system rejuvenation away right now for free that's right free so grab your telephone so that you can get the number\nThe number is going to connect you with one of our total system rejuvenation appointment managers who's going to get your name your telephone number and your service address and help you schedule your appointment and I'm going to give those five away right now are you ready\nHere are the numbers dialed quickly 'cause they go quick to zero five\nSeven to five six zero one one Seventy five six zero one one seven to five\nSix zero one one to two zero five area code seven to five six zero one one man only two left get them guys two oh five\nSeven to five six zero one one quickly seven to five and six zero one one one left seven to five six zero in one that's two oh five\nSeventy five six zero one one there\nNo look if you weren't able to get through on the telephone lines just then\nBe the first person to go to clean my AC dot com fill out the radio discount requests form and we'll get one of these just for you but you've got to be the first person okay that's clean my a C. dot com All right\nWell look I Want to talk a little bit about the drive by maintenance okay somebody you were sitting there laughing going what's the drive by maintenance\nWell if you have somebody come out to your house for an air conditioning or heating tune up that leaves after only spending thirty forty minutes doing a tune up frankly if it's less than Seventy five minutes it's a drive by tune up too\nSo what do you want to do if you got one of those companies\nWell I'll tell you exactly what to do next time they call to schedule the maintenance for you\nAsk them to have the technician give us sixty seconds heads up before he gets to the house a quick telephone call and when you get that telephone call half of your check already written out and just as quickly as you can run up to the end of the rich project\nAnd as a technician drives by hold that check out and slap it right in his hand as he drives by okay because you're really getting anything\nAnd in some cases they're doing more harm than good you can't do it to not been twenty thirty or forty minutes okay it's not possible\nNow I'm offering this to you for free today but you only get one shot at it okay at least getting the total system rejuvenation for free from that point forward you'll see the value in the maintenance and you'll become a regular customer\nAnd if you get set up on one of our maintenance agreements will be able to give you even more discounts in the future and priorities service almost everybody that we see gets one of those maintenance agreements\nThe fact of the matter is that every body and I mean everybody in the Birmingham area needs is I mean everybody we all have heating and air conditioning systems and we all want someone we can trust don't we\nWe don't want to replace our heating and air conditioning systems prematurely and that is where we're headed without proper cleaning\nI mean if you don't change the oil and your car what's gonna happen if you don't change the brake pads aren't you going to replace the rotors to same deal folks\nAnd change the oil in your car what's gonna happen if you don't change the brake pads aren't you going to replace the rotors to\nSame deal folks if you have heating and cooling system it is actually required by the manufacturer if you want to keep the warranty and clean one runs so much better than a dirty one\nI get phone calls from customers all the time my ears blowing a lot harder is that normal well yeah we pulled out your blow or you had as clean it it was all gung top it should be moving more air\nMy furnishing their conditioning system isn't running as much as it was well that was part of the goal we don't want it to run this much that way your energy\nBills aren't as high end ... D you middle sized properly or humidifiers properly depending on the season\nSo let's summarize folks real quick so that you know what you're going to get from a company like freedom heating and cooling\nThen I'm going to open up those phone lines again and allow some more people to get that two hundred and fifty two dollar total system rejuvenation for free and you're absolutely going to love the surface I promise\nThey tend to be pretty restrictive alright the machine has a hard time getting the air through them\nHaving one of those little one inch twenty dollar filters on your furnace or heat pump or air conditioner is like your eye running down the street with a wet cloth stuffed in our mouths\nYour system just has a hard time breathing through those kinds of filters and it can cause some damage All right so I buy one that costs between maybe six Fifteen dollars and here's the ticket folks are you ready for it\nChange it every thirty days whether you think it needs that are not no look I can see how that might be confusing for some of you out there but here's the deal when that filter search to look a little dirty it's becoming harder to move the air through it and when that happens\nYou use more electricity operating your blower motor\nAnd the top that off it damages the blower motor and it damages your compressor\nIt'll damage a lot of things in your system I mean filters have zero sympathy for your heat bump your furnace or your air conditioner okay so change them every thirty days please and I promise you you will absolutely thank us for it long term okay\nNow the other thing you could do is put like a five\nInch thick pleaded filter on it some of these five inch filters will sit right on the side of your furnace or your air handler and they are way less restrictive then the little one inch twenty dollar ones and they do an amazing job and I'll tell you what\nYou only have to change them about every six sometimes twelve months and that people just love\nSo thoroughly your rock steppers you're saying ... votes and get yourself a good filter good filters don't cost you a penny they pay you back in droves they give you a great return on investment okay\nYou know I Can't tell you\nHow many people we talked to on a weekly basis to have allergies or kids with allergies where we go out with clean up their system possibly pop in a better filter UV light and the system sterilize or or something like that for them and we get these calls\nMy kids aren't having the same type of allergy symptoms they were having before and we're not

motivation so kind of your super bubbly person and you like social activities and you like hanging out with friends but now all you really want to do was laying in bed in under eat or over eat or you know just kinda disengaged from activities that you ... you might want to kind of take a look at that\nIf you have excessive irritability now everybody get a little irritated the traffic you know the ... the cashier or what [laughter] yeah\nBut if it's excessive irritability okay or some outburst that's accompanying the irritability you might want to kind of think about those things okay um\nFear of dying a on a a fear of dying that you'd have not dealt with not everybody has a fear of dying but don't get me wrong in the sense that it's constantly on your mind ... not just you know thinking about mortality right but a constant um\nEvery day you wake up the ... um and so those are some of the things that you might need to start thinking about okay maybe I Need to see someone excessive sad news excess of crime scene um those types of things\nOkay okay so kinda really paying attention\nOne excessive sad news excess of crime scene um those types of things okay\nOkay so kind of really paying attention to your emotions and you're the way you handle things 'cause sometimes\nI'm being frustrated being mad that's less normal human emotions but it's how you respond to say that anger ... like do you break things you know or\nDo you yell you know or do you just get mad and take a deep breath that's a that's a big difference you know as paying attention to how you handle certain situations absolutely okay agree okay I don't know if we all do a good job of that self assessment\nOf really paying attention and being in tune with ourselves and so that's something we all could probably work on it's just kind of paying attention you know like okay\nI'm a you know me meeting my fist on the death the other day at work is that a problem was that a one\nTime thing ... yeah or do I do that every time I get mad and I'm\nI'm I'm so happy that you brought that up because [noise]\nSometimes for some people they have had issues for so long that it has morphed into their I dance ... that they don't even know that is the issue ... um [noise] and so it'll be oh this just who I Am\nAnd it's kinda hard it's kinda tricky to determine if this problem if this is problematic or not you know you've been doing it for that person has been doing it for so long\nUm but anything in excess in the motion okay with the anger like you were talking about the ... I think yelling it's almost kind of normal and pat abnormal okay but when you start to look at\nIs excessive ... is an excessive\nYelling am I doing it all the time and my hurting ... ... um [noise] am I hurting myself I'm not putting myself in situations where\nI could lose something working you know get in some type of trouble so I think the excessive needs of you know the anger or whatever that emotion is is something that needs to be looked at and we don't have to look at how long I've been doing is\nWhat causes me to do this when did this even start ... and it's kind of tricky to be able to nail that down for someone who's done it for a very long time\nAnd if you grew up in an atmosphere where that it was it was always some kind of fight or physical fighter yelling your that's your normal that's your normal so you don't know any different you don't so you don't know that you need help\nMhm and we're talking and so we're talking about generational mhm mental health issues we're talking about generational emotional issues mhm and so at what point do we start to deal with that and yeah and even though there may be a way of life there's another side\nOf that like it doesn't always have to be excess of anger mhm it can be balanced anger and happiness and joy ... able to utilize anger and the more healthy way mhm\nTake that to the gym or something I learned yeah and find another way to release that energy or that that aggression\nAbsolutely right well we're going to hear much more about the importance of of talking to a mental health professional and we'll hear more about your story I Want to dive into your your background and why you chose this as a career when we get back\nThe following year does not necessarily reflect the opinions or abuse of Crawford Broadcasting its employees affiliates or advertiser\nIf you want someone to fight for you do ...\nIt'd be opinions or views have proper broadcasting its employees affiliates or advertise\nIf you want someone to fight for you know ... or if\nYou want someone who is passionate about consumers who writes the car on the core if you want someone dedicated to improving the quality of life for all people McCord makes moved with you in mind power in the corps for public service commission place one paid for by the committee to like ... or\nNot a city counseling services is here to give us a call two oh five to seven six seven to seven [noise]\nSo how's life as a new copy shop owner so far so good I'm getting new customers each day but I'm not at the point where I can afford to buy insurance coverage for myself have you ever heard of direct primary care it works for me and my pocket\nHealth care that's affordable sounds too good to be true it's the\nReal deal it's like a membership to a doctor's office you pay a monthly flat rate the of Seventy dollars for unlimited visits and direct access to your doctor okay I'm a check this out you won't regret it stopped by brownstone total family health care or called two oh five to oh two five six five zero for more information\nOr if you're interested in advertising during solutions with Rhonda Robin send the e mail ... communications Gmail dot com [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nSometimes you feel secure\nCharging it off I just and\nYou know medically oh just knows that field and [noise]\nYou know so when you\nSee ...

new copy shop owner so far so good I'm getting new customers each day but I'm not at the point where I can afford to buy insurance coverage for myself have you ever heard of direct primary care it works for me and my pocket\nHealth care that's affordable sounds too good to be true to the real deal it's\nLike a membership to a doctor's office you pay a monthly flat rate the F Seventy dollars for unlimited visits and direct access to your doctor okay I made check this out you won't regret it stopped by brownstone total family health care or called two oh five to oh two five six five zero for more information\nThan if you're interested in advertising during solutions with Rhonda Robin send an email ... communications Gmail dot com and\nHe just wants to be beautiful she go unnoticed she no no and the tend to say this and and he plays the Scott did it by ...\n... oh she don't see that I did speak with any ice getting paid nearly a million dollars\nWould come back in ... and you're listening to solutions hey thanks for hanging out with us we are talking with Chanel Brazil of a magic city counseling services we want to talk some more about what people can do you know if they feel like they are like anxious or depressed\nOr having some mental health issues what are some things you suggest they tried doing on their own\nMhm and so um there are simple things that you can do um take a trip it doesn't have to be something that cost a lot of money can be a simple road trip um you can get out go shopping\nIt doesn't have to be something that costs a lot of money can be a simple road trip\nUm you can get out go shopping they'll have to spend a lot of money just window shop\nYou can exercise change your diet I'm hanging out with friends like the gamut like we did see here like all night long to talk about some of the things that ... can do but I Would most likely encourage a person to get back to doing what they haven't been doing\nOkay you know what I mean have you been laying in bed and can't get seem to get out of bed and try to get a five minute okay\nSo and worked at a increments you don't have to get up and stay up the whole day in his start in in in ... and then you'll see the progress at the end of the week you can see yourself being up three or four hour ... um if there's something\nYou will always wanted to do something new okay mhm okay\nOkay so there there are things you can do on your own now this is not in place of seeing a mental health professional but maybe this gets the ball rolling and get you back to some sense of a a normal day\nAbsolutely and I think one of the benefits of working with\nA mental health professional is is that everything that you do with them will be individualized ... you won't have to try to figure it out on your own\nThey can sit with you and come up with an individualized self care plan yeah I'm ways to deal with whatever if this depression\nBased on your symptoms what would be some suggestions in terms of things that you can do right it's very individualistic and in this one of the benefits another benefit of seeing the mental health professional because they can help you sort through those things\nAnd and one more thing to remember that your conversation is confidential absolutely so don't go ... worried about you know who's going to know about what you talked about because\nThey should near your your health care professional should not be sharing that information with Amy one absolutely\nNot if they're outside of the supervision um there is a period of time about three years where I'm\nCounsellors are in what's called supervision where they meet with a more seasoned counselor and we wouldn't know all about that you would have to consent to a certain things only certain things but outside of that yeah your information should not be discussed at all yeah\nYeah and I didn't even know there are some health care professionals\nLike if you happen to see them out in public at an event they may even shy away from even talking to you and a social way because they want to keep that professional you know relationships sacred yes ma'am they are absolutely\nRight like typically and in ... for the most part I Would never acknowledge a client of mine period and the only way I Would say something to them if they say something to me first\nDr otherwise I don't know you and you don't know right right and that's probably best to you know because no one needs to know you know [noise] wow that in a\nWhile it's I I Try to put that out there because sometimes that can help people will be a little more comfortable if they know when they go to see a mental health professional that what they're going to talk about it's going to be kept you know between the two individuals yeah\nAnd I think that's the most important part of building relationships is you know the person feeling comfortable to pull this stuff out yeah auto and talk to you about it and know that when they walk away that the conversation won't happen again right enter your business\nHey do your research you know find out about\nIt and know that when they walk away that the conversation won't happen again\nRight in your business and hey do your research\nYou know find out about your your whoever you're considering\nGetting an appointment with you know look 'em up make sure they have the the certification they're qualified are there any complaints about the individual on line you know if you feel more comfortable talking to all female then look for female counselor or a male counselor or whatever you know if it's\nIf it's if it's for marriage counseling you may say I want someone who has been married you know so I\nDo research and think through what it is that you need help\nWith and I'm find someone that you feel comfortable with ... yeah and it's nothing wrong with even interviewing your counselor you know it's nothing wrong with asking your counselor some questions\nAnd to you feel comfortable like you know how long have you been seeing clients and um then whatever question comes to mind and\nTypically counsellors have that information on Psychology Today so um you know it's a very detailed about the counseling staff now I'm a lot of information about the counselor that you can even save you know time on\nYou know because if you want to interview them they may charge you that's true that bed accountable patient yeah yeah so that that's a good that's a good little tip the Psychology Today is that a website that is a website guys that\nI'm host um from that provide information about um counselors and the different disciplines what they\nDo ... for the everything yeah do they specialize in children and you know whatever yeah that that's that because the Psychology Today profiled is actually an interview mhm mhm mhm yeah ... okay so if folks want to reach out to you how did they find ya\nWell they can give me a call it to zero five to seven ... seven to seven nine or they can email me at magic city council in dot com veggie male dot com\nOkay magic city counseling and Gmail dot com and um you have been doing a lot of work I'm just getting your business up and off the ground but now you're kind of ready to hit the ground running right\nYeah I Am open for business I'm accepting people I Do not want though magic city council and to become a conveyor belt uh-huh not want that I Want people to be able to come in and get good quality care the quality service\nAnd hopefully some solutions to some of the things that they're struggling with so yeah kind of on the ground now\nThat's good though I mean one of the most frustrating things for me out I don't like to wait\nAnd sell you know five Senate appointment for you know ten o'clock I won't I won't I won't I don't want to sit in the waiting room for two hours I Want to go in at ten o'clock so I can appreciate the fact that year not wanting a revolving door of patients that you really want to provide\nThe trauma it's not the um the you know it's not the other things that we see manifest that is the problem ... because some people think his them why what what'd I Do it's the fact that you witnessed the and now here on these manifestation of that experience\nAnd a lot of kids ah they deal with guilt like I should have did more to protect my mama or you know um I I should have did more to protect my little sister or whatever um it's tough\nIt's really really really tough especially when you get judged for the manifestations so how many of us see someone out there yelling and screaming or customer care no and we fight ... but a lot of times those people are survivors or thrive as a trauma mhm but society is so rough\nAnd judge in behavior that we don't think huh I Wonder why they're\nActing like that right and we're not helping them you know we judge and put them down and I'm Glad I like them yeah and that's not my business mhm that's our that's our whole thing you know well you know I hear the neighbors they fussing fight every night and I hear them throwing furniture but that's not my business yes as I all of us\nIt's our business we got to take better care of each other absolutely I think that would be so wonderful we can do that yeah\nThen you wonder like should I step in should I say anything I Know that something's wrong with that child\nWould be so wonderful we can do that yeah then you wonder like should I step in should I say anything I Know that something's wrong with that child they beat in that child should I say something or should I just my my business\nBut that's a huge thing because if you know there's some suspicion of a child or a vulnerable adults being abused you know\nWe have to report that to the department of human resources even if it's just you know we're not for ... they will come in and you can report it anonymously they'll do an investigation and you will get to see the result either the chow is put in a safe place or\nYou know this the the um allegations were not true but I think we should just feel safe enough to step out on behalf of the child in you know report make that report so that child can be singing about him if there needs to be an intervention to intervention can happen\nYeah so if there is a um so you deal with those who witness trauma and do you deal with those who are victims of\nTrials are literally look at it is and becomes a trauma okay says over the summer absolutely okay\nSo because we all can talk about domestic violence but it's not just men who are the the abusers right there are women who abuse men absolute you know are women who will use other women and you know\nSo I think it's important to um make sure we point that out that um there are all kinds of folks who are abusers in there all kinds of victims [laughter] um so how do you can you hear from that if you're in a volatile relationship that's a violent\nCan you hear from that and and still be a couple or is it best to part ways in both of you get your help with a mental health professional and move on with your life and so that's why the expertise come in yeah and and\n\nAnd it takes time there's this idea or this this model called the cycle of violence ... that can continue to go on and on and on and on and on\nAnd at some point I mean this just I wouldn't even say common sense but for safety reasons to remove yourself from any type of abusive\nRelationship yeah any kind you and your children I think after hard work\nThat a person can start on a journey of healing ... mid may take some time for you to get where you feel like you want to be a way you need to be in terms of where you are emotionally\nHow you respond to things um [noise] but healing as possible I Will say trauma causes the brain to change yeah yeah\nForever yeah and so the reactions in response is may be different than before you experience Mm Mm So it's almost like a fight going on between the immediate dilemma\nThe prefrontal cortex wow\nAnd then every relationship is different every relationship you know ... some relationships they may find themselves back to each other and they may find a way it may find that come back together and there are some that yeah you probably don't need to ... 'cause you have some better co dependent you know and it's just\nA toxic situation no matter what the us and you just gotta part ways as hard as it may be and then there are some success stories where I guess some people figure it out\nI guess it's just depends on the relationship that's exactly right\nSome success stories where I guess some people figure it out\nI guess it's just depends on the relationship that's exactly right yeah your individual would leave ... wow what are the key is making sure that you definitely get the help if you need it and if you know someone who needs the help speak up for that person after losing absolutely I totally agree and like I say\nWhy do you see a they have some really good a domestic violence services\nFamily court actually has a domestic violence court ... the services have really been increased and they're really good they're seeing ... so I mean they are doing some good stuff and we all miss the mountains of some\n... again if they want to

in the same direction want the same kinds of things\nWhat we see a lot of times and a lot of marriages is sometimes they start off with both people wanting the same thing right something sometimes they start off both people that have the same goals but somewhere in there they grow apart right they do somewhere in there um the goals become different and when that happens\nThey inevitably go in their own different directions and ultimately what can happen\nIs when two people are not pulling on the ropes together than they are clearly pulling on the rope against one another\nAbsolutely that's why it's important to make your marriage a topic of conversation and Ken as as our anniversary rolls around each year I always talk about okay it's time for a state of the union\nAnd so at our anniversary as as you know if we talk in between that time of course but at our anniversary our anniversary it's about the marriage is not about buying a gift for one another it's about we're going to do something to honor the marriage\nAnd I'm just going to need to interrupt you because I Need you to share what what we agreed upon at your suggestion about the ... the anniversary and what we would do\nWell we talked about anniversary and I can ... a great gift giver and what that is not my love language not that I don't like gifts but that's not my language but because I recognize that the marriage always has to be a topic of conversation and we have to prioritize era\nI suggested that we honor our marriage at our anniversary\nAnd and do something whether we take a class together on communication or marriage whether we take a trip together we're or whether we buy a painting or\nAnything to honor of the marriage that's what we would you rather than by a gift he buy gift for me and I guess for him so that we do I caught the state of the union and happens at each and every\n... and so what happens then ultimately is the anniversary becomes about us right or in in in in our listeners case the anniversary becomes about the the marriage\nAbout the relationship it doesn't because it doesn't become about an individual person which person is going to buy more for the other person which person forget or doesn't forgets right I have a gotcha because you didn't send me roses you didn't send me flowers\nOr whatever it is and you don't ever remember ... those are traps that we set for one another that can lead to problems in our relationship but when you make a conscious decision that the anniversary is about us the anniversary is about this marriage and to gather we will approach what do we want to do how\nDo we want to honor the relationship and and what that means is there's no competition there is no forgetting it it's whoever brings up the topic and has that open conversation about what are we going to do to honor our marriage this year\nThe first year that we did we fight and I get a yes\nThere's a lot of what it has you know [laughter]\nAt that time we're also sharing our\nUh yes of course I Wonder how did you say you know [laughter]\nAt\nThat time we're also sharing our feelings um you know the hearts that the things that were feeling the things we want to talk about and it's just a time to reset mhm and so it's\n... and I think one year we actually uh went to a marriage seminar and where did we did ... so what what we have what we have learned from our divorces what we have learned from our experiences\nIs that too many times in relationships people end up\nAllowing it to to be all about one person or the other\nAnd they don't do the work of the ... the U.S work right right right posted the worker the you work they don't do the U.S work and we learned from that and you know one of the ... the greatest teachers in the world\nIs not a book you can read that's not a class you can take some sometimes one of the best teachers in the world of the negative experience to look like\nAbsolutely and you know the thing is we all have these experiences everyone has one it's just a matter of what did you learn from it that's exactly what did you learn from it so I Can't I Want to share this I was reading an article in Psychology Today and it said that a noted marriage researcher John gotten in claims that the average couple\nWho enters into marriage counseling has been in a troubled relationship for over six years so you now have a troubled relationship it's been about six year she decided to go to marriage counseling and you want the marriage counselor to help you through there and five sessions\nYeah and and and you you want the marriage counselor or the therapist to to be a magician\nRain or a you know and it's just many of us many of us you know when it comes to God and our lives\nOr we don't want to be our father we got to be our magicians\nRight you know and that's unfortunate so yeah so we appreciate our listener I'm I'm ... and our Facebook friend uh that uh gave us that information and we applaud him and his wife for doing a great job allowing us to hold them up as role models or will be back on the other side to talk a little bit more about uh about uh the rest of the show [noise]\nIt took me a long

[noise] girls for the rest of the Rockies and the town [noise]\n\nAll right family we are back um and we are talking on the uh commitments with\nKen and Leslie show we're talking about relationships were talking about how to make them better if you want to join in on that conversation eight six six\nFive five one nine nine three three again eight six six five five one nine nine three three uh get you in toll free and or you can join in on the conversation so uh we were talking a little bit earlier about about the the last show and one of the things that are that the the last show prompted towards the end\nWas a there was a caller that that came on that did not want to actually come on the air but wanted to know where he could find a good therapists he was looking for good therapists for his son\nAnd he didn't want to actually come on buddy wanted that information from us and and that really as Leslie and I were talking in discussing it it made us really think about the fact that there are a lot of people out there are who need a therapist but had no idea how to go about choosing a therapist\nOr they don't know what kinds of things to look for and it's really interesting because on as we were listening to um uh our our station family member Rhonda Robinson who had a show her show with solutions that airs for thirty on Sundays for thirty five thirty right before we did a she was actually talking to a therapist and we were like wow she is\nRight in our will house Ron to get out of our well [laughter] she was looking over our shoulder reading our notice only it was so timely because a nation\nWe knew we were talking on the show today about therapists and and how do you choose a therapist so Leslie let let me just ask you when when you you're a believer in therapy when you decided at either during or after your divorce that you wanted or needed a therapist\nHow did you choose a therapist in ... and and before you answer that\nThe the first question is what made you even think you needed one and then how did you go about choosing one\nWell I thought we needed something I don't mean the way I'm Talking about okay I knew\nWhen you were when when when the divorce was underway and you were on your way you were ... ... at what point did you say I now I Know that the the we part but what point did you say I lazily meet a therapist and then how did you go about choosing that person\nI decided that I wanted to see that assistance on a therapist because I just needed to make sure that", "show_name": "Michael Hart", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham",
