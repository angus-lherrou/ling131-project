W E Jaycee Dugard me\nThe following program is a paid program and does not reflect the views of station management or sponsors [noise]\nWelcome back welcome back this is Richard Rice on results with Richard Rice and we're excited this is our fifth show\nUm you know we're trying something different I'm trying to build up a larger platform to discuss public interest issues were taking the traditional look at legal issues but we're also broadening that perspective to incorporate the community and today on our fifth show we're happy to have river majority but routine and also a ribbon river an even melts\nInhale Ireland right fine how are you on ... they get off the mayor today and so we're we're going to uh have a very thoughtful I'm thought thoughtful for\nToday I'm about a public housing in the city of Birmingham in particular we're going to be speaking about the south town a public housing community which has been you know much talk about over the last year a based on his proposed redevelopment\nAnd um you know about a year ago in September a my farm along with another local attorney or April Collins we filed a lawsuit on behalf of the residents of south town and public housing residents throughout the city of Birmingham generally as well basically arguing that\nThe city of Birmingham and that the local housing authority which is the\nHousing authority of Birmingham District have an affirmative duty to further the mission of the fair housing act and as you may know we're we're coming up on the fiftieth anniversary of the a fair housing act being passed that one of my one of my good friends it is\nA Wilson has been working on a documentary that will be airing it real real park I Believe it's sometime in the next week or so\nI'm just going to kind of give a historical perspective on the fair housing act as it relates to Birmingham obviously the fair housing act was one of the accomplishments achievements coming out of the civil rights movement and we know that Birmingham obviously played a tremendous role\nIn the um [noise] in the civil rights movement and and the civil rights act and the fair housing act being passed and so we certainly have it continue responsibility to to continue to shine a light on those principles and issues and that's what we want to talk about today\nAnd uh you know if you're listening in and you have comments that you like to chime in on widows please give us a call at two o five nine four one one zero one one or you can reach us at one eight six six five five one nine nine three three\nAnd first of all I'd

expressions which is basically a high cat dedicated to um highlighting and issues that African American community as well as finding solutions solutions that are still left from the community um I've been to I work with the richer for about two years than it's been a lot of fun so that's really just who I Am\nAwesome awesome and that's really good um you know that in terms of the communal expressions is a lotta times we don't have that space within the media to have these type of conversations\nUm to to really look for solutions that have a community or orientation to them so we definitely want to give you a double salutes for the for vitamin D space and it's something that since you started his really began to catch on to more people are kind of gravitating towards that type of platform yep\nCool cool so majority how you doing today sir I'm fine how are you\nWill doing well thank you so much for joining us or you're involved in so many things you most recently\nYou added to the a team over at a GM greater Birmingham ministry congratulations on that I think you said is long overdue brother you know because you do so much tremendous work in the community and oftentimes you know uh people like yourself and um or just take it for granted you know it's like\nYou're doing the work because you're passionate about that you care about it but you know you can't you can't take passion\nNow than I Do publicity you can't [laughter] I got the money now that that's it and let me hold something once you've got I got you got to go get it get it\nBut in addition to that you're also one of the founders of the uh dynamite he'll Smithfield community land trust and that worked as um you know very near and dear to my heart and also a very relevant to the topic today in terms of permanently affordable a low income housing but tell tell our listeners a little bit about your so\nOkay so I'm ... I'm an at peace with a temple ministries which is led by a priest is married say shot 'em we deal with the understanding of what's called the divine feminine\nI'm I'm also a community organizer now with greater Birmingham ministries which is going on his fiftieth anniversary next year really incredible organization that doubles\nUm community organizing along with a direct services directly feeding folk were happy but also trying to find solutions through voting on through community engagement um and the enhancement of the community as a whole\nI'm and I'm the community engagement director for dynamite hill Smithfield community land was founded by the brilliant Susan dying Mitchell and she's our visionary I'm\nA will get into what land trust is split dynamite hills community interests where community led um five oh one C. three nonprofit I'm into historic Smithfield community of Birmingham, Alabama and the goal\nThree three initiatives primarily one permanently affordable housing and that's different than something I'm for them for about ... different conflict will get into that and we do regenerative urban agriculture and then the other community education initiative as well which kind of buttresses on the other two as well\nNow and we want to set aside from time to get into that as well specifically what the land trust there isn't today obviously will be on the air for thirty minutes and then after the show would just want to continue this conversation or will be online streaming on our Facebook pages are individual Facebook pages you can find each one of those but I just you know searching\nThe minutes and then after the show we're just want to continue this conversation or will be online streaming on our Facebook pages are individual Facebook pages you can find each one of those but I just you know searching for our name\nUm and also will be on the friends of south town page later and all the content from today's show the first thirty minutes and then after show also will be on our personal website as well so um you know if you if you want to go back and listen to a certain segments you certainly can do that\nAlso but you know before we get into the conversation and specifically what I guess I just want to lay the foundation by giving up a bit of background information as I stated earlier myself in the attorney commons we filed a lawsuit on behalf of five south town residents named individually as plain as however\nUm the actual action itself would impact at all of the the one thousand residents delivered the south town community ah one thousand residents who who are resigning living within four hundred and fifty five low income public housing units currently sitting on twenty six acres in the heart of\nDowntown Birmingham I'm this properties adjacent to the veterans hospital St Vincent you may be\nAnd I'm also right there by a red mountain express highway thirty one and so this is one of the most valuable plots of land within the city value close to thirty million dollars um based on some of the spec speculation around some of the the current redevelopment plans that are going to be taken place\nThat lawsuit that we saw specifically was asking for the residents to be able to have a meaningful opportunity to be a including in the planning process\nOf that redevelopment and so at the time that we filed and the judge actually said that he believed that we filed the lawsuit too soon that it was there was prematurely filed and kind of laid out a road map in the order about some things that needs to take place in order for us to prevent in and got back in the same place again later down the road\nAnd so we we've had some I'm really good conversations with the residents with some of the stakeholders including a Southside developing a group or also at the executive team over at the housing authority and we've been encouraged by those conversations but you know we still would like to see more definitive action being taken\nA as a recently is maybe two weeks ago maybe a little bit less south side development group along with the housing authority specifically laid out what their plans to read of element of ... developed the property what looked like\nAnd it would be a mix used community some commercial some residential or some some market rate housing and there maybe some low income housing as well as a as of today that that redevelopment would include two hotels several commercial structures and then one high rise of two hundred units for low income housing which particularly would be reserved\nFor the elderly and disabled\nSo right off the top what you would see is that the current site has the current public housing side has four hundred and fifty five low income units the new development would only have two hundred units so that would be two hundred and fifty five units that would be displaced from that particular site and so we would want to do is mitigate\nUm the brilliant revolutionary Angela why Davis\nUm and we live and we sit at the top of dynamite hill right on myself and my partner and\nIt is still physically a beautiful area definitely we suffered now though because of red lining\n'em all types of issues with banks um the removal of and and I want to clear something up people think that gentrification is just folks moving into space it's and that's not what happened when the black folks moved into this area we did not gentrified white folks out of there\nThey left of the oval dish and because you know they want to get in the pool and get something on them you know this kind of this kind of silly this was going on um but in that process of resisting against our fair share moving buying a home buying land\nThey begin to use dynamite to try to kill us you know I'm over fifty bombs\nOver a period of twenty plus years right trying to kill us in that process and that history of resistance is there and also we were resisting against a Bull Connor and the police force and the um and the the government of Birmingham, Alabama right and it seems like we're\nKinda unfortunately in that same kind of vibration now it's just that the characters have changed spaces but they're\nA faces but they're still in the same places\nI Want to come right back to talk a little bit about low income housing as it relates to permanently affordable housing but first even I wanted to just here's some your thoughts on gentrification and like what are your you know why is it important for us to preserve our historical and cultural identity and spaces like the city of Birmingham or life so my wise that you know something that you think that we should\nWhy is it important for us to preserve our historical and cultural identity and spaces like the city of Birmingham or life so my wise that you know something that you think that we should explain to do\nWell I think identity is everything and when you start is placing people\nIt's displacing families you're displacing generations\nAnd when that displacement is happening against their will they really don't have a say in it and they're not really beginning much of a say in exactly where they're going\nI'm either going to lose part of the history and identity of people and when I did he starts to being metal with a lot of things come behind that right so your self esteem mhm um the love of your people a lot of your culture for as long as you start racing and I'm tinkering with history the lives of people\nYou are impacting generations to calm and not just that particular family\nMost definitely and so I'm just real quickly majority tell us a little bit about what is low income housing as it relates to market rate low income housing and and what has permanently affordable housing and then I Want to get into this proposal really quickly 'cause we only got about eight minutes left on air and there will be going to have to have to show show\nOkay so hub uses the term um the department of housing and urban development they defined affordable dwelling as one where the household can um obtain for thirty percent or less of their income\nOn housing okay okay so that's they're using the term low income and looking at um families or what have you and low income is also defined by you know if you make less than eighty percent of the median income in that local area\nSo we have that pretty much all over Birmingham, Alabama\nAnd that leads to a ... a large swaths of the population just being marginalized and the term marginalized just seem so innocent right but in this context to be marginalized says you know it could be the difference between being having a home and not having\nA ... right exactly and home we we consider home is a human rights will use that term often right I'm young I'm Susan looking into the un declaration on human rights home housing is a human rights so on at the Ford about housing idea um we debate\nOn that term affordable housing because you have to think about who are we referring to affordable\nFor who is it affordable for regular very broad stroke friend our work is permanently affordable housing and what happens is that the community land trust holds land specifically but it can hold buildings um structures for community development\nUsing um um the communities owned will it's skill sets it gets its assets so what happens with dynamite he'll Smith Khamenei land trust is organizing around the community itself along with partners and allies or what have you\nOn to develop mentally permanently affordable housing where basically the land is owned by the community in this nonprofit that has formed\nAnd the um improvements the housing on that is owned by the person who buys the house for and what happens is it becomes less and less uh less expensive friend later on if that family should want to leave that home those subsidies that the committee land trust puts on the house stayed with the house\nAnd so it stays permanently affordable from there on out\nDefinitely so that's a great explanation and that's where we really want to look to provide as if we believe the housing or home is a fundamental right then how do we make sure that the provision of it is a burden and available to those who are in need of it and so uh we have about five minutes left on the air reminds you that um\nYou're listening to W why D. E. one on one point one fan and we're speaking about the south town propose redevelopment and I want to talk to a little bit about some of the limitations of what the proposal is um obviously this\nOn FM and we're speaking about the south town propose redevelopment and I want to talk to you a little bit about some of the limitations\nOf what the proposal is um obviously this structure here south town is in need to be re developed\nWe understand that there are certain economic limitations on the ability of local housing authority to maintain these profit properties over time and therefore this type of redevelopment is a necessity and if we could re develop the property in such a way to create additional value\nTo increase the provision of affordable permanently affordable low income housing\nThen that's something that we we should do something that we can all be in favor of as this thing is right now the current redevelopment\nProposed by south side development group on behalf of the housing authority of Birmingham is a mixed use redevelopment so you would have commercial and residential you're decreasing the the provision of low income public housing from four hundred and fifty five units to two hundred units right so that's two hundred and fifty five units\nThat will be disappearing from that particular site\nThere currently no current current no complimentary plan to relocate those two hundred and fifty five low income units with in the city limits of Birmingham\nNow the housing authority does have legal responsibilities and duties to those residents the uniform relocation outlays those out the federal Housing Act also asked to\nTo specifically state with those duties art and so what we would be asking is that you know those residents who are not able to return to the south town campus the current campus\nWould then have an opportunity to leverage their section ... vouchers should they choose LeBron's no section ... vouchers for an opportunity to become homeowners and this is something that can be done these individuals to form a cooperative housing community\nThey would even have the ability to partner with the land trust is already established wars that was a assistant land trust\nThat would work in much of the same way that\nThat a majority has mentioned on a few moments ago\nAnd so that's really what we would be proposing myself along with several local developers\nAnd a couple of other attorneys is what will be proposing we have meetings scheduled to sit down with the housing authority in the coming weeks\nAnd uh we're also working closely with mayor ... executive team or to continue to have their support a mayor wasn't as continuously since we filed a lawsuit in the job that you were there for this when we did a press conference and so are you\nEven though specifically said that he was in support of a one for one replacement\nAs we know right now when he's saying that to me I'm understanding that to me that if they're smarter than fifty five units there now that he would want to see four hundred and fifty five low income units returned there\nAnd the developers have the finances along with the city um to do that that can be done is not improbable if not impossible that can be done would talk on the equity right is that uh we want something that we're not do you can't just this place people and that's just like whatever happened to them\nThat's true and they had the capacity to do that so we want to do is find that proper area that that middle ground of a balance because you know if we say that we take away two hundred units and we're giving a plot were were given a plot of land with in the city city\nLand land that's already home by the city within the city limits if we could re developed one or two of those sites\nFor you know one hundred units on one side and one hundred units on the other side\nThen anyone any one of those units that are being displaced from the current campus would be relocated within the city limits and so you can see how that could mitigate some of the negative impacts\nOf gentrification and I want to unpack this conversation a little bit more in the next thirty minutes are we got about two minutes left 'em on here so I Want to give our two guests and opportunity once again it tell us who you are and organizations you with and people like what you had to say on there today somehow they can find your after this\nWant to give our two guests an opportunity once again it tell us who you are and organizations you with and people like what you had to say on the other day someone had I can find you after this you\nHave found even mouth and you can find me on all social media platforms I'm ...

A. C. dot com fill up the radio discount requests form click submit and will reserve one of these just for you but you got to be the first person okay that's clean my AC dot com\nNow here's the deal folks here's what you're going to experience when I send one of these guys out\nFirst off he's going to park his truck in the street\nNow while our fleet is meticulously maintained this is just a precautionary measure that's going to keep you drew leaks where they belong away from your driveway okay\nWhen he comes up to your front door he's going to knock on the front door and when you invite him and he's going to reach down and put on floor savers or she covers over his shoes or boots\nThat's because we're going to be working with some water and stuff cleaning your outdoor air conditioning unit or heat pump and it does tend to get a little muggy okay\nHe's going to start his own voice and then he's going to ask you to see the thermostat he's going to ask if he can quickly click it on and when he does he's going to make sure that the system is actually working\nAfter returns it on he'll then ask you to show him to be out door air conditioning unit and then the indoor heating unit and once he's seen those he'll go get to work\nNow his very first task is to remove the top off of the outdoor air conditioning system after that he's going to get the leaves and sticks and mark into Bre out of the bottom of the system because all of that stuff holds water when it rains\nIt's going to rush the bottom of your system out prematurely okay so we're going to get all of that junk out of there\nThat alone is going to extend the life of your outdoor unit\nThe next step in my opinion is the best okay we're going to use a semi high pressure nozzle to spray down your out door coils from the inside out\nNow that's going to force all the leaves and grass clippings and dust and whatnot that has been sucked into it over the last six months back out of the coils it's almost like lifting a sweater off of your air conditioning system\nNow imagine you are I listeners jogging on a hot summer's day with a sweater on and it's drawn your mouth\nYour body can't release the heat right so you get really really hot\nWell the same thing happens to your outdoor air conditioning unit and your indoor unit if it's dirty it's going to overheat you're going to have a compressor failure you're going to have motors fail sometimes we even have to use a booming cleanser to get all that stuff out\nYou're looking at a good forty five minutes just up to this point so can you see now why I say that the other maintenance as our drive by maintenance as if they're there and gone and forty five minutes\nNext we're going to test all the electrical components in your system to make sure that you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires\nYou might have a pending compressor failure because you've got this little starter that's about to go bad\nYou might have a pending motor failure because you've got a filter that's all plugged up and you're not paying attention to it All right so we're gonna check all of those little miniscule components that don't cost that much at all to repair or replace next\nWe're gonna check all of those little miniscule components that don't cost that much at all to repair or replace\n\nNext we're going to check your indoor heating system or your furnace\nWe'll check the burners your pressure switches make sure that the exhaust is venting properly all of your hoses your drains a flame sensor even run a little own test they call it on your ignite here because if that little baby goes bad it's gonna get cold in your house in a hurry\nMost importantly we're going to check the heat exchange or that's the part that is known to crack into leak carbon monoxide look\nWe all know that carbon monoxide can kill you write but did you know that a majority of the people that survive a one time carbon monoxide poisoning\nEvent have a life long side effects do you see now why I say that you have\nTo do these two naps and inspections every six months you don't really have a choice\nWill go to your indoor air conditioning coil after that and inspected for any sort of biological growth that might be growing on any dirt any mole mildew bacteria viruses things like that I mean you've heard that mold grows and heating and air conditioning systems haven't you\nThe fact is that it's common for us to find a combination of things in your air stream last time I checked there were twenty two registered strains of mold and while all twenty two are considered allergens\nSeven of them are actually toxic okay and just what are the side effects of breathing mold\nWell every once affected differently right but here's just a fraction of the list of side effects were talking about things like upset stomachs weight gain fatigue losses sleep\nNight sweats headaches rashes sore throats coughing I allergies there's lots of taste loss of smell there's auto immune disorders sexual side effects and\nLet's not forget about depression\nDid she know that one in every four people that you know right now has zero ability within their body to fight mold spores\nOne in four one of the four people folks that their bodies lack the ability to mark the spores for the white blood cells to exterminate\nYour body your immune system it's supposed to mark or tag unwanted invaders for extermination\nAnd because most people don't have really good filtration systems those blower wheels they tend to get a little bit of build up on them and a lot of times we see a good eighth of an inch of build up on them\nThat's about as thick as to corners stacked right on top of one another now when that happens your system just can't move the appropriate amount of air\nNow just one thirty second of an inch will reduce your air speed by ... percent if that blow and we'll get kinda nasty if it gets just a little bit of build up on it\nThat will show the whole life right out of your heating and cooling system and if you're lucky you'll be forced to spend twenty five hundred dollars on a new heat exchange or\nOr compress or if you're not so lucky you could never wake up again\nDid you know that cracked heat exchanges leak carbon monoxide into your ear stream did you know that according to the CDC someone dies from carbon monoxide poisoning every day in the United states\nDid you know that over fifty percent of the people that survive a one time carbon monoxide poisoning event will suffer long term side effects for the rest of their lives\nHeart problems neurological problems nervous system damage mental illness personality and behavioral changes loss of muscle function and loss of bladder control I mean the list is truly scary\nLoss of muscle function and loss of bladder control I mean the list is truly scary\nWhat if that was you are one of your family members\nYou probably didn't realize that you're blower for you and your furniture air conditioner getting dirty could kill you did you\nSay look if that blower wheels dirty my technicians will pull it out and they'll show it to you and they'll say look we've got to get this cleaned up and taken all apart and that's above and beyond what you'd normally do in the total system rejuvenation that's restoration work\nBut when we get it put back together you're kind of get more air flow it's going to ... better you're going to have cleaner fresher air you're gonna have a lower energy bills I mean that's what it's all about folks\n\nHey you want another reason to get your eating an air conditioning system tuned up\nHave you ever heard of Louisiana State university\nWell they did a study that compared electrical usage of a dirty heating and air conditioning system to clean heating and air conditioning equipment and what they found was that the average customer with a clean system just one system in their house a clean one\nSaved thirty two dollars and Seventy cents a month on their energy bills\nThirty two dollars and Seventy cents a month that's serious\n\nNo look at about one or two minutes I'm going to open up these phone lines and if you can get through when I give you the telephone number I'm going to do your entire system both the heating and cooling side not for the two hundred and fifty two dollars we normally charge\nBut for free that's right F. R. E. E. free\nNow I only do this on the radio and they'll tell you why because let's face it I Can't send a minimum wage worker to your house for free and make any money at all\nFrankly the U.S government says that it costs fifty three cents a mile last time I checked to send a vehicle to your home just in gas and wear and tear\nAfter that there's the technicians wages the chemicals and check the ordinary cost of doing business so we're talking about a loss on this first appointment coming out and doing it for free why would we do that well here's what we get out of the deal\nWe get referrals\nI Can't tell you guys how many times it's happened were customers had become huge cheerleaders even before we're done there running around telling their neighbors making calls to family members saying you've got to try these guys out\nFolks that enthusiasm is why the average radio customers provides us with three to seven referrals\nIf your furnace or your air conditioner breaks down and you call a friend or relative and you say hey I've got this furniture air conditioner problem who do you use your furnace and they say you got a call freedom heating and cooling they did the best maintenance we have ever\nHad\nAt that point are you going to go play Google roulette of course not you're going to take the advice of your friend or your neighbor or your church buddy or your relatives because the company that they're recommending to you served them well\nNow that's the power of doing things right for people that's the power of doing a good job customers seeing it appreciating it and spreading the word about your business\n\nCustomers seeing it appreciating it and spreading the word about your business\nNo look I'm going to give us two hundred and fifty two dollar total system rejuvenation away right now for free that's right free so grab your telephone so that you can get the number\nThe number is going to connect you with one of our total system rejuvenation appointments managers who's going to get your name your telephone number and your service address and help you schedule your appointment and I'm going to give those five away right now are you ready\nHere are the numbers dialed quickly 'cause they go quick to zero five\nSeven to five six zero one one Seventy five six zero one one seven to five\nSix zero one one but two zero five area code seven to five six zero one one man only two left get them guys two oh five\nSeven to five six zero one one quickly seven to five six zero one one one left seven to five six zero in one that's two oh five\nSeventy five six zero one one there\nNo look if you weren't able to get through on the telephone lines just then\nBe the first person to go to clean my eighth seat dot com fill out the radio discount requests form and we'll get one of these just for you but you got to be the first person okay that's clean my a C. dot com All right\nWell look I Want to talk a little bit about the drive by maintenance okay somebody you were sitting there laughing going what's the drive by maintenance\nWell if you have somebody come out to your house for an air conditioning or heating tune up that leaves after only spending thirty forty minutes doing a tune up frankly if it's less than Seventy five minutes it's a drive by tune up too\nSo what do you want to do if you've got one of those companies\nWell I'll tell you exactly what to do next time they call to schedule the maintenance for you\nAsk them to have the technician give us sixty second heads up before he gets to the house a quick telephone call and when you get that telephone call half of your check already written out and just as quickly as you can run up to the end of the rich project\nAnd as a technician drives by hold that check out and slap it right and this happens he drives by okay because you're really getting anything\nAnd in some cases they're doing more harm than good you can't do it to not been twenty thirty or forty minutes okay it's not possible\nNow I'm offering this to you for free today but you only get one shot at it okay at least getting the total system rejuvenation for free from that point forward you'll see the value and the maintenance and you'll become a regular customer\nAnd if you get set up on one of our maintenance agreements will be able to give you even more discounts in the future and priorities service almost everybody that we see gets one of those maintenance agreements\nThe fact of the matter is that every body and I mean everybody in the Birmingham area needs this I mean everybody we all have heating and air conditioning systems and we all want someone we can trust don't we\nWe don't want to replace our heating and air conditioning systems prematurely and that is where we're headed without proper cleaning\nI mean if you don't change the oil in your car what's gonna happen\nAnd that is where we're headed without proper cleaning\nI mean if you don't change the oil in your car what's gonna happen if you don't change the brake pads aren't you going to replace the rotors to same deal folks if you have heating and cooling system it is actually required by the manufacturer\nIf you want to keep the war in the end it clean one runs so much better than a dirty one\nI get phone calls from customers all the time my ears blowing a lot harder is that normal well yeah we pulled out your blow or you had us clean it it was all gone up it should be moving more air\nMy furnace and air conditioning system isn't running as much as it was well that was part of the goals we don't want it to run this much that way your energy bills aren't as high end ... D you middle sized properly or humidifiers properly depending on the season\nSo let's summarize folks real quick so that you know what you're going to get from a company like freedom heating and cooling\nAnd it's going to cost you somewhere between six to twenty dollars and I know it's a big fan um I don't think that I Would go for the twenty dollar one and the reason why is because while they are great filters\nThey tend to be pretty restrictive alright the machine has a hard time getting the air through them having one of those little one inch twenty dollar filters on your furnace or heat pump or air conditioner is like your eye running down the street with a wet cloth stuffed in our mouths\nYour system just has a hard time breathing through those kinds of filters and it can cause some damage All right so I buy one that costs between maybe six Fifteen dollars and here's the ticket folks are you ready for it\nChange it every thirty days whether you think it needs that are not no look I can see how that might be confusing for some of you out there but here's the deal when that filter starts to look a little dirty it's becoming hard to move the air through it and when that happens\nYou use more electricity operating your blower motor and the top that off it damages the blower motor and it damages your compressor\nIt'll damage a lot of things in your system I mean filters have zero sympathy for your heat bumped your furnace or air conditioner okay so change them every thirty days please and I promise you you will absolutely thank us for it long term okay\nNow the other thing you could do is put like a five inch thick pleaded filter on some of these five inch filters will fit right on the side of your furnace or your air handler and they are way less restrictive\nThan the little one inch twenty dollar ones and they do an amazing job and I'll tell you what\nYou only have to change them about every six sometimes twelve months and that people just love\nSo thoroughly your rock steppers you're saying sisters folks and get yourself a good filter good filters don't cost you a penny they pay you back in the rose they give you a great return on investment okay\nYou know I Can't tell you how many people we talked to on a weekly basis have allergies or kids with allergies where we go out we clean up their system possibly pop in a better filter UV light and the system sterilize or or something like that for them and we get these calls\nMy kids aren't having the same type of allergy symptoms they were having before and we're not sneezing in the house and the whole process takes about an hour and a half to two hours to do the tuna\nNow look\nWe've only got a couple of minutes left in the show folks and I've got maybe four maybe five of

and crystal feel free to jump in here but I Want to ask the question why don't we talk about it what what what is the problem is it embarrassment what what is it yeah I\nThink on one of the biggest issues is fear and um and that's why it's important that um when we recognize individuals are experiencing a domestic violence domestic um abused that someone approach\nUm when we recognize individuals are experiencing um domestic violence domestic um abused that someone approach them and ... you know not in a ... an aggressive way so but two eggs what can I Do to support you and not be forceful\nI'm there can be safety issues involved and you know if you're not a profession professional and don't know how to intervene is important to direct them to resources\nSo I think look for isolation\nAnd look for I mean most people are shame they're embarrassed and you know I'm like you were mentioning it doesn't matter what your socioeconomic status is but some people want to maintain the status quo\nYou know and they wear a mask I Would say because they don't want people to know what they're struggling with it and it occurs with many people it doesn't matter you know she said how much money you make how beautiful you are or how\nUm you know what community you living in or what position you hold in the community so we want to be proactive and supported and when we recognize that these people are isolating or that if there if if things look different you know just Inquirer what can I Do to support\nOr help you can go ahead I'm\nI have worked with many individuals um over the course of my career that did not realize that they were in a domestic violence situation wow um the the behaviors of domestic violence such is jealousy such as controlling controlling access to friends family finances\nAre often sometimes seen as signs of oh well he is checking up on me he cares about me and he wants to provide for me and that's why he controls all of the money and so\nThey had been in it for a while before they realize wait a minute this this may not be um and I think we were talking earlier about\nIf you if you've not seen a pattern of a safe relationship healthy relationship where you were allowed to have a job have friends have access to your family then you don't necessarily know that there's anything in the different dead right and wrong\nAnd on the number one thing that has brought individuals to see me as they\nSay you know I I Want you to maybe get him to have some counseling about his anger or I Want you to get him to get some help for his drinking because that's when you know they they don't come saying I'm a survivor I'm a victim of domestic violence it's it's something else they might not even have the vocabulary to say\nThis is not right but you know I Want to do something different\nAnd I think that's ... views are cars slow and gradual okay that I recognize that they are in a abusive relationship and I mean it could be generational like behavior that's repeated [laughter] I'd be\nDomestic violence just does not affect the abuser um but also the victim and it it affects everyone mhm um the abuser is\nYou know shame they suffer with shame and guilt for their behavior and they you know try to apologize and then they continue to repeat the behavior um and the objective is to get gang control and power over their individual\nAnd if you were raising a family so your parents were they there was an abusive situation and that's normal for you\nAnd you don't know that my normal yeah I and often times the abuser [noise] um ... or the

talking about their um candidates forum coming up it's going to be a mouth college\nReally want you to stop by being informed voter almost along I Am inviting guest into the studio to talk about domestic violence or awareness and breast cancer awareness I because it is a multiple October\nAnd also joining me here in the studio we have\nA Helen have director of communications for the YWCA Catherine Alexander bright also with the YWCA and strive counseling services crystal Mullen Johnson thank you guys so much for sharing your time on this Sunday less dive back in here\nI and discuss more I like to talk about red flags [noise]\nSo I was discussing ah with crystal about how you know I may be the type of person who I may not pick up on the red flags so let's talk to our listeners those of us who've never been in a in a in a situation of a an abusive situation or maybe we're not raised in that situation\nGrowing up what would you look for\nThat mention um earlier um that'd be the cars that gradually over time okay I think that'd be they're usually present themselves to be you know romantic levine they validate their partner\nIs it gradually over time he'll kind of I think that'd be ... usually present themselves to be you know romantic loving they validate their partner anything very supportive\nAnd you know they seem to be living they fall in love overtime the couple and you know you're pretty much committed at that point ... you know you may start to make investments together like buying a home together you may have a child together so\nAt that point you're really expecting the relationship to develop deeper okay and you may start to notice his tolerance level may decrease\nAnd he may start using demeaning words or may 'til you shut up I think you should be listening for things of that nature and also shaming you in front of your friends your family\nAnd um even co workers I mean you can get pretty bad where you know um they don't discriminate ... you know who they shame you in front of and also it can become really violent\nWhere they threatened you with weapons\nAnd the and I'm the victims start to fear for her life or even\nIf they have children they can't live without is difficult at that point to escape and many people questioned why she just won't leave well and there's a lot invested at that point so\nImpressed so I'd add to that point you know the statistically the ... the riskiest time even the deadliest time um for a domestic violence victim is when they leave and so um I think there is a myth that okay if it's that bad the person will leave\n'em and that's why it takes a I Can't take up to seven times of somebody trying to leave and they reconcile because they love this person if this person wants to get help they've been with them for a long time that may have children with them they want to be in that relationship\nBut when leaving triggers sometimes very violent reactions and that's when most I'm Serious injuries and fatalities a car so it's not as easy as saying well you should just leave because you don't know the circumstances that person may lose their life\nYeah we actually had a one survivor from our we have shelters here and I'm confident she'll shelters in Jefferson County and in our St Clair counties okay and I'm One of our\nUm first victims that ever agreed to tell her story with us she was leaving and her brother was standing there with her and they were standing out in the driveway and the husband came out with a shotgun\nAnd actually shot the lower portion of her arm oh my goodness which damaged her she was a nurse so she was no longer able to be a nurse but I Want I Want to talk of second about how the wind up you can help people in those situations because\nWe have a twenty four seven I'm hotline than cattle can call which is three to two hurts and um that's for eight seven eight H U R T deaf [noise]\nThree to four eighty seven eight and when somebody calls us um we do have those shelters we can take them in we can take them in with their children the Y W has a nationally credited daycare um at our facilities and we leave spaces\nFor um victims of domestic violence and I'm so when somebody comes into our shelter\nThey can rest assured sometimes the biggest question is if they come in and they leave they still have to go to work the next day right you know they can't afford to be without a job and who's going to take care of their kids\nThey come in and they leave they still have to go to work the next day right you know they can't afford to be without a job and who's going to take care of their kids so we work with are victims to make sure that they can do that a lot of people don't know that that is that as an option\nUm there is another thing um pets for some time you know in a domestic situations and other Shelby County humane society\nGive a shout out to them they developed a Shelby County say pet this year so um if somebody is faring leaving\nBecause I'm On a lot of the times the other person will use that animal as as a\nYou know as a as a card that person can't we the Shelby County humane society will take that pet in and we'll give them health care and will care for it and find out of foster home until that person is able to get back on their feet so\nAn either situations we work with the victims to each individual situation to get them the help that when you eat\nAnd then we need them from our shelter situation into a temporary living situation if they need it um I I you know I I Love to tell the stories of you know some of the victims so that it takes about a year and a half for them to get their lives turned around but they can do it right and and we have the people that can help them do it\nSo we were talking about red flags and so if you're one of those individuals who you don't know what to look for you could actually called this line\nThrough to hurt it may be asking questions like is this normal you know is this weird or I feel weird about this uh that could be a red flag for you even if you've never been into an abusive situation if something is done to you are said to you and it makes you feel uncomfortable or you're like that something's not right\nThen ask that someone asked me about it yeah\nI greatly values the services that though why did you see a all far um I Do believe that a holistic approach is necessary to\nTreat individuals that have survived domestic violence um Ashraf counseling provides counseling services for that um victimization is correlated with higher rates of depression and bill is that right\nI'm also anxiety wow so it's important when a client come in to see me to do some psycho education if they have not yet had that I where I can help them understand what's happening um because they started to second guess themselves yeah you know and they're not very sure I mean it was a huge reality to have to face\nI can imagine you're like I'm In my overreacting is is really happening to me or am I being dramatic later I'm so here's the other question do you guys\nCan you recover from this if I Am an abuser can I get proper counseling and and ... and treatment and can I reconciled with the person I victimize or is that do should you just say cut our losses and move on not\nYou can and I'm David Crystal our look at each other [laughter]\nAre there are therapeutic techniques are designed\nSo even if you see like a red flag that control or manipulation you leave then or do you try to go to counseling and hope it doesn't involve physical at some point is\nIf someone is listening to this or somebody has seen signs of abuse and they believe that that is happening to them then that would be the time to talk to a crisis on our talk to a trained experts to create a safety plan and do an assessment and see what their options are it's going to it's going to depend on the individuals\nIt when we ... I mean because they're they're couples that\nThey may minimize how abusive their relationship is and they decided let's get\nMarital counseling you know this will resolve the issue you know but\nThey eat the issues are deeper because their individual lives mhm you know so the individual and need to work on their impulse control issues\nYou know their anger is okay and the woman needs to work on his self esteem issues and if I recognize those red flags into an issue of fish and I would not continue therapy with them only discouraged while and I will let them know\nYou know that these are the things that I'm noticing and the relationship and I encourage you to seek out individual therapy well you know\nSo you mentioned crystal gradual so I'm Wondering like if it starts with the manipulation and then all of a sudden the person is hitting walls are destroying things and then they should you fear that eventually they're going to hit you\nUp at that automatically yes I think that's where he is\nPolls are destroying things and then they should you fear that eventually they're going to hit you\nUp at that automatically yes I think that's where he ran away absolutely\nBecause it and um you know that I I keep forgetting where on the radio I'm trying to draw a circle [laughter]\nIt's a it's a cycle of you know the individual may it may start out with name calling or didn't you know like you said graduates to hitting a wall or even a person a child an animal kid graduate to weapons\nUm and then the the abuse or\nFeels awful they feel terrible so just the person who's received the abuse they feel bad they want to stay with the person the person says they're sorry they want to stay with that person and believe that they're sorry and it goes throughout the cycle back to what you call a honeymoon period where I think it's OK and everybody's nice\nAnd then it happens again and that's part of you know we talked earlier segment about it takes seven times because if you love somebody and they do something but they say they're sorry and they want to get help you want to believe that that can happen\nBut if it's come to a point where there's you know there's weapons there's physical safety children are a danger um\nThat that\nEven prior to getting to that point is when I'm you know we encourage people to call a hotline call an advocate talked to somebody because it it gets worse\nAnd guys and I I she actually had an example yeah why you know I did an isolation from family is another thing too okay so um\nYou're abuser can say you know I don't want to see your family I don't like her family unlike your friends you can't go here you can't do that so there is some of that but we um I was visiting our our shelter and St Clair a few weeks\nAgo and uh we had um an elderly gentleman there and he had married a younger woman and I'm\nThe police were there the police directed him to us to help get the family get an objection order she was hitting him and she had cleared out his bank account wow and um [noise]\nYou know it's a really super sad situation so you know it's just one of those things that you know we talk about women a lot and I think that um that happens to the ... it happens to 'em educated\nUm women and then you were saying homosexual relationship it regardless those are the sons you know to look for in terms of\nYou know I I think in terms of friends how do I know my friends because if you look at the south it's one in four women think about how many people you know one of them for women and one in seven men\nWow that's a lot that is a lot of people that's a lot of people\nAnd and so if you're looking at your friends\nAnd you're thinking the relationship is a bad relationship that's hard to have that discussion with your friends but maybe you call the wall W maybe get some information and maybe sit down with them and have a serious conversation yeah hey I'll see some of these warning signs and your relationship my concern is for you I Want to make sure you're okay\nYes and also I Would like to chime in um\nViolence is most common to happen between the ages of Eighteen and twenty four and okay so in the age of Eighteen think about when you're Eighteen do you have the coping skills to deal with the violent relationship right I mean you definitely will be embarrassed right right and ... I mean your problem solving skills probably art\nAs they are they're unlike adult problem with problem solving skills\nAnd your least likely to speak up about it\nHealth economic resource at us I don't have the ... or to go into\nProblem solving skills and your least likely to speak up about it mental health economic resource addicts I don't have the ... or to go into that is why it's important for parents to\nModel healthy relationships if possible um if you are you know talk to your children about healthy relationships yes development and less understand how domestic violence and pick children yeah it affects their school performance it creates stress\nUm children don't display mental health conditions like adult so we have to be mindful of that I'm a registered play therapist so I mean there's definitely a difference in you know the way children respond to respond to stress and anxiety opposed to adults\nAnd children are smarter than we think they yeah they are and I know literally they see a lot they may not say anything but they see a lot I have a twelve year old and that's what gives me stress because I always think about\nEvery day I Am teaching her what kind of man she may grow up and marry or what kind of a woman she will be and and so we actually give me strength to be a better parent because of that but you're absolutely right they see and hear a lot we have to think of the children you have to\nThe research shows that males that are exposed to domestic violence they likely grow up to be abusers and then women who are exposed they often go out to either be victims or they become abusers themselves because\nThey're over compensating ... um for themselves so um they really do they see all they know all\nAround and if you don't have any other information and we were all challenge that the ... early this week to come up with the one thing that we can do and mine was for my child from a three year old daughter isn't a model conflict resolution tomato healthy relationships for her\nBecause if that's the one thing I can do is to teach her what a healthy relationship look like and to teach her you know what what safety looks like if I can do that then I feel like I Am making a difference in the lives of others and preventing domestic you have to talk\nTo the young people or I Know like how does this make you feel that you know how are you dealing with this right are you okay are you afraid mhm we need to do that to do a better job of that\nAnd we we we do have a community outreach coordinator kinetic Atkins and we do have a healthy relationships program so if there's anybody you know listening that as an a middle school or high school and they want us to come out and talk to them\nWe have information that we present to students and that goes through what are healthy relationships and what people\nKnow should not ask you to\nWell we thank you all so much for joining us we're going to do one more around if you want to give out any phone numbers or information for our final thoughts and then we get out of here today\n[noise] I give\nThe ... the crisis Lonegan to zero five three T.

this evening to her\nAbout a why is it necessary to have a show\nThat deals fundamentally with divorce why is that one of the the major topics that we are going to to focus on and so Leslie I'm going to ask if you can uh to just uh provide us with some numbers give us some numbers on a exactly what it is that\nPeople you know ... some of the effects of divorce or based on we have some studies here from Harvard from the Pew Research center et cetera so Leslie share a little bit of that information with us\nAbout what we have a recorded here and what we have captured is that\nAccording to Paul Amato a top to force research researcher between forty to forty five percent of marriages and the United states will end in divorce and while it's good news that it's not as high as fifty percent that's distressing\nIs so distressing the main factor that has caused this decrease and the marriage rates I'm basically\nIs that the marriage rates have yeah that is really no reason right it's yeah\nIt's not like all of a sudden somebody has figured out how to ah\nYou know reduce will do the work they're just not getting married yeah they're they're just basically like getting married anymore that\nSo and here's some other statistics about divorce in the United states that you need to understand every Thirteen seconds someone somewhere filed for divorce every Thirteen seconds unbelievable right right sixty six percent of divorces\nAre filed by when I well I I can attest to that I I filed yeah I'm not something I wanted to do but you'll hear my story later so hold on\nSixty six two thirds of the divorces are are are started initiated by women there's a reason for that and and that's part of the reasons behind what we're going to talk about on the show\nFour percent of people in the military filed for divorce each year you fifty percent of children in the United states will see their parents divorce in their lifetime right forty three percent of children in the United states are living without their father involved in their lives\nAnd and let ... let me just let me just stop you right there because I I think that for me that's one of the big things that that makes a lot of a lot of difference fifty percent I'm Sorry forty three percent of children in the U.S are living with their father involved in their lives\nUh I I wrote a book and the name of the book is called divorce but still that faith principles of fatherhood for divorce than men\nAre I wrote that book because I didn't want to be one of those statistics it's right I didn't I didn't want to be one of those statistics that said\nUm hey I'm you know I'm getting a divorce and my kids are going to be living without me so that's something that I did not want to do\nA and again we'll talk more about the book we'll talk more about what we're going to do and we'll talk more about exactly what we're going to do but listen uh let me give you once again the phone number where you can call a toll free eight six six five five one nine nine three three eight six six five oh five or eight six six five five\nOne nine nine three three upper right now let's go to break in a let's pick up after
