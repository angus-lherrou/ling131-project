I just thought it was ridiculous it you know taxes are spent to to bail out politicians accused of a a sexual misconduct or whatever that's the crap the taxes are wasted no\nRight men and taking that five hundred million a year and given it seems that you do that\nAnd how much of a difference that can that yeah I mean I don't think people realize that it costs ... million dollars or data operate at hospital only\nWell exactly Planned Parenthood is Planned Parenthood's budget was redirected to strictly just say nothing but St Jude that half of their operating costs for a year right so\nWell and I thought it was it I thought it was laughable that he was trying to basically insinuate I was a hypocrite\nJust because we chose to receive treatment at Saint Jude what's we only did that because children's hospital here in Birmingham had never even treated her type of tumor before and I'm Sorry but I wasn't gonna let my child be a guinea pig in a hospital he didn't know what they were doing with all due respect to them\nWhich is why we chose ... they were one of the very few that had treated her type of tumor I was never a financial situation or or there was never that consideration going into it like how can we get out of having to pay for any of this I Need I Need that her treatment to be free I mean it's so insulting that somebody would assume that that ... that decision when it was ever financial thinking it was and he\nWas insulted that you don't want to\nHealth care act that he thinks that that and to socialize medicine would be free is ridiculous it's not free somebody's paying for it well\nThe people that he thinks that that socialize medicine would be free it's ridiculous it's not free somebody's paying for it\nWell your your your child was treated for free than St Jews say your child was treated because\nPeople were generous that's right and they ... the hell they want to do that\nWell in the playoffs that that that they're ... they're trying to find a cure for cancer I mean that's a huge payoff\nYeah kind of a big deal yeah anyway ... thanks budding women maybe you can watch a Youtube video\nAnd learn how to make sure I get into that in my sleep right I mean let's just do it at the house they were wrong it nice and the only one is allowed to say stuff like that nobody else does either acceptable and gone to the baby body else as well\nOr I'll get you guys to mayor drums of a gasket wearing it out on the Facebook page make sure you\nThey can go to a charity and get that charity\nYeah and they usually they have like a big plaque on the wall that says we are not allowed to let you street land just based on your ability to pay\nYes ... ... ... that is a\nIs a ... point for somebody to say oh well it's everybody's ... everybody has to pry too\nCasual emergency room or an urgent care or wherever and they can't refuse you their medical team they asked it treats\nYeah no man's in other other businesses going in putting that signed up in their business restaurant on whatever yeah ... yeah hey we can't refuse service yeah wherever else do you get that Freeman go downhill real quick aren't Beverly thank you\nAll right Mike ...

Derek hey what's going on guys is this same Derek I got mad at earlier it is but it's okay I'm\nSorry I'm Sorry I was my fault Derek must your that's\nYour Iraq it moved down\nI'm so socialized medicine man one government program that's ever run officially they can't even deliver mail officials and we're going to let them handle\nYou know medical stuff you need a break ... ah you're washing machine there is a little bit sitting on the Saudi or ... make sure it's not cause I my washing machine what I mean and and I had a guy come in and you just replace the I'm thinking of a sudden my thinking it solve our problem if\nYou're talking about on top of the ... mind the faucet by the base of the fall\nI yeah well I don't I don't have one of those um but I Do like the um the radio that uh they they pick that up and clean it out and fixed it but I I don't have one so I mean if you have one somewhere design next year saying\n... more maybe I've been going a little scavenger hunt and one of the work that I ... I\nI usually watch the rovers on my van breaks I mean a YouTube's above mechanic out there\nAnd there really is\nAnd as long as you know all of us don't go to retool you could ever need you don't ever divide tool God\nKnows right you got that right well I became a mechanic just by learning how to do things on like how many clients even you'd get if they'd be like you know where'd you go to school I didn't I just learned anything on ... I mean if you could do a good job you know\nMali even with the radio saying sorry you know I never had any formal training I learned I learned how to conduct myself on air and not seeing them to do with the right way 'cause of don't ah from listening to other people in the radio from listening to the Rush Limbaugh is in the ... and all these other people and I just took a little bit of everything\nThat I'm doing it the wrong way will certainly ... yes learn fairly quickly plenty of time a lot of my\nPersonal Trent Locke social training shows anyway I Love the\nShow or a great ... and I have a\nLong time there buddy for and then they call it that way yes well he's right a woman or do you with him on that front Jeff\nHey hey hey hey now on it a shot at MIT socialize ...\nDown and those who are on I Will Japan are covered or pay for those of us can't\nWrite we'll give you a good example of how badly that go wrong my little brother lived in large part in Mexico for about Eighteen years up until he got three years ago and that we're ... miles from the Mexican or are there but\nIt was a kidney transplant which means he has a regular basis to doctors and they have regular you know medical Adam\nAre there but it was a kidney transplant which means he has a regular basis to doctors and they have regular you know medical out of the need to be in a hospital that he is near lowered our\nBecame so infuriated by illegal is running across the border and getting into the doors you know you can't use or\nJust like you said you and for some care hospitals financially close because the number of paying ... or ... or are those who could not or would not so that hospital close and then from from that day oh\nFor him to go to like not or if you have to drive over two hundred and ... why why so socialized medicine and I will not and will never work like oh\nI'm Sorry but me and you ingest you're nobody else it and pay them what their insurance medical costs can never fight for everybody who walked\nRight I mean it it doesn't work so\nYou know it impacted my brother in law you know you go to the doctor or a month now you're driving a hundred miles round trip to go to our [noise] yeah\nThat's that's the effect of everybody really annoyed by being you know and then recover from those of us just just a little example of how that works out we are all made up by what you know\nAnd no doubt I Jeff thanks money\nYes on on point there in the age old argument in this mentality comes from the rise of Bernie Sanders or you know I haven't really listen to Cory Booker speak out on on health care issues outside of just broad statements but you know he's from\nThe the same cost yeah the same loincloth now and they [laughter] they ah they all feel the same way in and it it's not for them it's not viewing it as free\nBecause they're smarter than that they know that it's not free like your average person were ... would would say universal healthcare free they know that that universal healthcare comes with power\nAnd it comes with control over a certain in a very important part\nOf somebody of of everybody's life very important part of their life so that point you've got control you got a a a a giant percentage of control over these people overall people and then you can use those forces\nFor evil and whatever else you want to do in the future and it's also so important to remember\nDo not give the power to a certain administration or certain senator Congress that you don't want the other side having because the other side will have that power at\nSome ... yeah it's it's very much like the difference between owning your own home and renting because when you rent you can't just go out and changed the color of the walls you can't start making a lot of changes because you don't know in that home at somebody else's house that you're just occupying\nAnd you're paying to live there but they have the final say and what happened to that house if it's your house you can do whatever you want ... very similar to that just because when you're talking about socialized medicine you're talking about the government controlling health care\nWhich takes it out of our hands on end and for people who claim to want small government they sure seemed to believe in policies and platforms that they're going to completely against that they're like government get out of my business you know control everything place it makes no sense\nGovernment get your hands off my body\nHer hands off my reproductive Oregon yes but still tell me what to do with

I'm really doing headlines now and then we'll go to the other night we got emails and then we'll get back to a\nHurricane Michael ... a lot of that in the news today obviously because they're being rolled through the Florida Panhandle we saw the destruction the the worst images we've seen Jessica ... coming out of Mexico beach which is that the town we we concentrate on yesterday\nUh my dad again used to live down there for a few years and had a house right on the beach and I I haven't seen the house in particular but again I imagine it's destroyed he still had some stuff down there and the storage shed I'm sure that's long gone\nAre at this point but absolute destruction I've been down there and vacation a few times and it's very nice quiet family oriented community with not a bunch of the\nCrazy crazy you know it it not not a bunch of the the the night life the flashing lights and all that kind of stuff it's just you want to go somewhere with your family chill out that's the place to do it and it was very sad to see that thing go down Donald Trump on Fox and friends this morning he he gave a he weighed in\nOn um on some of the twenty twenty contenders Democrat twenty twenty contenders they asked him about that that was really funny because I have the ... and the next\n... [noise] no I actually I'll just play it for you you want to hear it yeah it's actually pretty funny here it is Fox and friends this morning\nGreat evangelicals he went after the Tea Party people you know that uh they they just settled the IRS just settle the case uh holder is he's got some problems and I don't see him running and if he didn't run I think he gets gobbled up before he ever gets to the election itself I think the primaries would gobble them up\nIt's interesting that he was head of the Justice Department lets you send you were gonna ride and twenty twenty on some possible Democrat upon it can be Senator Bernie Sanders a senator Cory Booker former vice president Joe Biden Senator Elizabeth Warren former secretary of State John Kerry senator Kamala Harris which one of these what you mean less worried about\nWell so far like every one of them I just selfish they healthy and I hope they fight it out at any one of them I like I just hope that we don't get any star or a good think are coming out of nowhere because she everyone that's talking about do you look at a book or the ...\nThat's good he's like I Hope every one of these people run and I hope they're healthy and I hope they're ready to go 'cause you just listed off a whole handful legit brownies then I could easily beat in twenty twenty\nFive and I mean how about Elizabeth Warren she fixture heritage for years and years that you can't prove anything she said her mother told her she and high cheekbones therefore she's got Cindy in blood you know what I have more Indian blood in me than she does and I have none [laughter]\n[noise]\nThat is so good does this guy who will say anything all the things that that we as regular people talk about we make fun of politicians and whatever he done\nYeah I Will say anything all the things that we as regular people talk about we make fun of politicians and whatever he does it\nIn these people take John pay him all the time so don't say being a bully he just brings up what ... what do you live a he lied about Elizabeth Warren line no she actually she has not proven that she is I'm a native descent\nAnd actual Native Americans have come out and denounced or because they say she's trying to I'm just trying to hang out in their ... and she's not while you get out\nGet out the TPP cars so that was pretty good and there's more of that but I play the whole thing but that was the best part\nAnother thing is the Kanye West meeting with he and Donald Trump earlier today and there was one point where a reporter tried to ask Kanye West a second question in the middle of his rant and he stopped him and he's like no no no no\nYou don't get to ask another question oh it was a bizarre rant about ten minute rant from Kanye West but um\nIt's it's very ... guy but he also made some valid points within all that rambling here is a here's Conyers confrontation with one of the White House reporters here the oval office with Donald\nTrump is that we any given point we say this is this is this is racist racist so we don't have a reparation but we had a searching for open up\nThe whole conversation so and I don't know what are the ones that I Love the liberals tried to do [noise]\n... ... a black person to the concept of racism because they know that we're very proud emotional people what I said I like try to like someone as liberal they'll say oh what is right that you think racism ...\n\nYear I work for us we're going to go to another question I don't ... the questions I sympathize south by us tasting a fire why most people don't feel like in a minority or for\nAnd then they go into some other question to it that was the that was the whole thing is a he was talking about how people attack him for supporting Trump\nAnd he'd like I have none of it I'm a he's in there wearing his make America great again hats and he's sitting right there in the oval office in as he's talking he's like pounding the desk getting passionate in the oval office in Trump's just sitting there you know he's got his arms crossed he's got to look on his face\nSo he didn't really say anything he did a couple of times but he listened intently the entire time usually was uh doing a little rant easy easy uses the best ... time\nThis is this is where people are are missing the mark they're confusing they're they're taking the role of\nBeing a coward and being brave and they're swamp and the name yeah\nThey're they're putting the the cowardly with Kanye West and the grave with\nTaylor Swift when it's the exact opposite if anybody out of those two are the brave ones are are courageous it's Kanye West for coming out in standard for what he believes in even though it is completely unpopular with everybody around him yeah the mainstream media whatever\nThe coward miss Taylor Swift part\nIs the fact that she's gone all this time without being political and amongst the pressure from her peers from the music industry from Hollywood she decided to cave and go ahead and endorse Democrats\nSo you tell me as you watch how Taylor Swift treated as you want to talk on us which would tell me which one of those are the brave ones\nThere's only one choice there it's gone you're anyway I wanted to point that out and I knew if it didn't do it now oh we'll get to it two oh five nine four one one zero one one is the number right now ladies and gentlemen it's time for your ... or email welcome\nNot saying that he now gets out of hand [noise] you go out and it's like [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] ... that was good that you were a

when you let it honey hiccups slide out [laughter]\nYou know ... ... sorry inventor and owner Paul O'Leary has always been proud of the small parties hat and making people's lives easier with his flatulence filtration products\nAnd kitchen designer by trade Paul said it's fulfilling to help customers will be embarrassing side effects of splitting the same and hopes to continue creating innovative products\nHe has since gone on to develop fart resistant genes and pajamas and has sold hundreds of thousands of products so far\nSo I'm curious why he's in the news now because in Georgia ten years before coming\nTo the show today and I had a radio reporter and we gave him that sort of product really I Can't tell you it was by that particular name but he was filthy based\nAnd all sorts of living and the girl on the show the Jessica if you will bought here in case you weren't sure what a girl with these Jessica if you will bought him one of those like cushions and it had charcoal lining okay 'cause yeah and I don't know the name of it but I Will now white similar\nMaybe it was there about what this guy apparently has a whole line though 'cause he's made pants and jeans into ... and and can you on it for years can you imagine that moment where you can just let let one go\nUse the yuan mosque to\nSee is he ... he won Moscow must\n[laughter] name like one [laughter] All right\nWell here's the thing a Russell Pearce this show ever comes to an and we're going to give you permission to take this segment over to the the way home on WB Jersey on that show so\nThere you know what we got gigs and you\nCan even use that song I Know you love it [laughter] doesn't it it really is\nAll right I'm going to try to squeeze in a couple more before we got a break and hopefully these people got funny names because I just want to get Russell reaction on mobile so let's give it a shot while I'm One who do we got\nBelow hey now hey uh now this is no line I Know you're not going to believe this but uh we went to school with this guy on his first name was mocking his last name was hunt\nYeah ... yeah I've done it [laughter] I Can't I Can't I Can't promote that one actually has\nThe money or should they knew that person and they ask for the call him I told them no ... and now here we are back in that same spot one to\nMe it's you know\nMy dad worked for the German fellow when I was a kid and his name was Wendell and soccer\nAnd [laughter] and I had to go ahead of it okay [laughter] you know when I was in graduate\nOr I'm Sorry we we can't continue the call out oh yeah that was the south has begun\nThank you for that here's the thing about that in everybody's mind her that she is giving us an actual German name but sometimes when you're dealing with somebody\nUm of a a a different origin\nA different nationality that's the word I'm looking for a runoff or you deal with\nA a a different origin\n... different nationalities that's the word I'm looking for her into\nA huge deal with names that sound like something really bad in this country that over there would be perfectly normal\nAnd the fact that that last name sounded so much like a really bad word here we had the don't that yeah so uh apologies and I I Want her to know that I wasn't doing it just because uh you know one of the\nRailroad or why I thought well it's an actual name so I can say right um well I go back to our standard here was before you call and ask yourself\nIs it okay if kids here this name that I must have been gift she might not have been listening in a lot of people have just throw out the window that wrestling is left with Russell somebody\nCame in right now I'm Amazed at how many [laughter]\nAnd I had with the outside those last two we've had some really funny well\nNow let me ask you ready for a long time have you ever heard that been dropped on the show the euro's\nI honestly I I heard the first name I heard the window and then I didn't hear the random you don't need to repeat and I'm at work [laughter]\nSo you completely missed the what is funny because in radio and I guess it's in TV too for a live broadcast you do have the dump button where you can you can drop audio of three seconds or eight seconds or twenty seconds seven hours whatever needs to be\nWhere you're working together when I had my dad on the show\nAnd then the first thirty seconds he dropped as I was here and then he did it again and he he meant no harm he just talks that way or and\nI had to give him like the pep talk before he was on the show I my dad You're welcome to voice your opinion it doesn't have to agree with mine it most certainly won't just don't use bad language he's like oh I wouldn't dare do such a thing he's like seven seconds then on the guy's a gym and Jeff\nAnd he said something like a roll my eyes and we hit the dump button you know we don't dropping because if my dad drive you say one thing you get tossed\nBut we were able to salvage and we kept going and then he said one other thing and like [laughter] no\nNo I remember that because I was in my office listening online in here listening on line you don't get the dump it doesn't come through and\nI heard it and I'm like it didn't hit me that I was listening on line yeah and my first thought was they didn't do it [laughter]\nAnd it's still go and neither one of the gift that [laughter] oh that was that was good family and my father please stop [laughter]\nI Would have tried at him\nAnd we make that yes I Do we have to break before we got more phone calls aren't will do it
