buddy\nElvis trying to finish that a man named Seventy drag that out I got it down or wasn't\nPizza of us on our little\nBlack Brad ... you know what you'd asked me every day that you don't know I'm just ... that habit I don't know what it is being him one day you'll you'll do something besides the flat bread managing for\nAn hour now I have a problem and it's like I get in this routine of doing things to certain rights not all that uh once I find something I like I typically stick with it which makes me a ... if you will but um and it comes to like food and stuff I guess I'm just I don't know it's just the thing I find something I like and I just don't want to stray from it\nYou know loyal lover like dirty read no dirty rat and getting cronk night\nMust get some phone calls into a vibe nine four one one zero one one Adam is up first how are you sir\nDonald you know hey hey do you remember when I called in last Monday and I said the closer we get to the election the violence is gonna increase\nUh yeah I Believe so I Do remember that actually\nYeah and then the uh throughout the course of the week or ... you had to talk about the violence ah because it got ramped up and then ah another round of violence in Portland over the weekend now I'm sure you've seen the video Andrew how when you\nSee another round of violence like that how can you continue to refer to them as antifa\nAh well I mean it's like we're referring to I don't know what's what's\nThe matter for Enron referring to abortion as a more than a set of murder [laughter] what people have labeled and\nI Will go like calling abortion\nOr channels carrying yeah childcare\nFamily planning my family planning that\nWell you guys came up with a good term you were talking about you know you really shouldn't call I'm pro choice so they usually call them like you know pro murder or something like that\nAnd high life and I thought it would be\nYeah yeah yeah that that was it but uh anyway well I just think that's all I'm part of the deception I I I'm going to call them what they really are and that is a fascist\nAnd I'm Andrew last week you also gave me a a homework assignment\nOr you told me to come up with a different names uh besides the left because let's let's let's face it these these people they're liars\nRace is a ... it's cetera you know like what Trump has talked about just the most vicious people that's what he learned when he came to Washington DC so calling them progress as they are anything but progressive [laughter] okay so I came up with a three terms\n... ed to describe the left because when I call on the show from now on I'm no longer going to refer to them as the left or leftist perfect ...\nSo I'm going to go from a three to number one you ready ready\nAll right number three George Soros and the destroyers\nOoh that's got like that one that's a good country\nBecause we know the enemy any uh area where Democrats are in control they destroy everything a number two we kind of already talked about it last week but uh as the baby killers you know it's good\nAnd a ... number one it's real simple remember you just quit term what I call in every time the laugh they love to change a terms you know from\nOr you just quit term when I call in every time the laugh they love to change a terms you know from um [noise] a global warming climate change et cetera et cetera but one thing\nOr no matter what the left does they are always going to remain a the same and in in one aspect they are always going to take from the producers\nAnd so that's my favorite term is the takers\nTankers data that's actually the best one it's short sweet and it really ... all in in one nice little package of the tankers now All right Adam ... thanks thanks\nFor your help I'll I'll use that term when I'm calling from now on\nYou know it's like people going there by you remember when you told me this last week and I'm like my mom was a good ... remember that when he was like you gave me a homework assignment and I'm like lord and what what can be a dear because next how are you ...\n... it's just very good at it how\nUh [noise] I don't mean to be reiterated how old are you a ...

I I Love about Trump by when they taught global warming\nIs what he sent earlier when we were bringing you that that live a press or he was doing her talking to the press\nHe said\nNobody left the environment more than I Do a lot of people don't know the son of people don't know this but I Am an environmentalist\nI Want the cleanest they're the cleanest water we've got the cleanest day on the planet right now\nAnd he said\nWe can have clean air and clean water\nWithout having to put businesses out of business having a ... companies out of business we don't have to do that in order to have those things and it's true\nIt's all about regulations that are put in place that helpless in no way shape or form instead of exploring different options on making sure we've got clean air and water\nThe first thing for Democrats is to go regulations blood regulations on businesses mentor a burden to the point that they have to shut their doors because they can handle what the government keeps growing on them re as next hour you right\nOut of hand they're pretty sure that he now I Know I Know that you're a equal rights as tall as I say environment because you live in it or if I were if you took a hundred and twenty two billion trillion dollars that I have it on the line on on the\nEnvironment good what what how do you fix she an environment\nNot thinking all that so I I've often wondered that mine and if you and and the flip side if you want to ... if we all got together and said you know what let's create a group or we destroy the environment what would we do [laughter] you know what I'm saying\nYou know not not recycled not eliminate all Carson carbon emissions area that I Would just go by the stone age we ... we still have to fix environment that's why no one two and a\nLot of you know how to how to fix it right\nI'm with you re that's a good point you got that on the money and you think about the money that they have they have invested in in trying to clean up the environment\nAnd still you got your brownies like California going well I've got a ban plastic straws right well like the the amount we can tribute to a plastic in the ocean\nIs about the same percentage that Elizabeth Warren ...\nWell like the the amount we contribute to a plastic in the ocean is about the same percentage that Elizabeth Warren is Indian\nThat's a good point well I also read that in order to reshape the cop said they didn't need straws vaccines more plastic minister Ahmed\nGenius Jane yes Wayne and up next\nL.

what were the numbers before that did you say one and one thirty seconds and then five twelve and then five twelve those are literally half right they\nBotched the numbers to make it look like she was more Native American than whatever so they had to correct that reporting there the first people to report it the correct that then they also Barry in the article that the people that did the test\nDidn't even use a Native Americans DNA sample in\nUh trying to what could include whether or not and that makes total sense that he dies [noise]\nBut yet you would think according to some of this reporting that Elizabeth Warren has proven herself to be full blown Native American\nLife is good God gifts why God is good\n[noise] we're guarded countries to\nRestrictions on almost nobody

doesn't it yeah yeah and again that does it\nForty million dollars all they investigate\nSounds familiar doesn't it yeah yeah and again that does that doesn't go for for Democrats that's only for the Republicans is that\nRight well the the Democrats are as we know are in the business of wasting money um well in that case it was Republicans were pushing for that but now the Democrats on the other hand are wasting millions and millions of dollars on a phony Russia investigation that's been debunked every way to Sunday\nWith all the information that we have on it and there are still pushing to ramp up efforts and that's a that's another thing that people don't realize how important the midterms are the fact that\nYou will see investigations out the wives zoo if if Democrats having to take the house like we'll be bogged down and hear nothing on the news but twenty four seven investigation is investigation that\nThey will investigate every single thing that they possibly can and that's where all of our time money and resources will be going in Washington DC well I was twenty Robert Mueller's if they take the house\nWell all I can say is get out and\nYou got it Cindy thank you

minute film where she's explaining a lot of that was oral family\nTradition that we didn't have ancestry dot com and the Nineteen seventies and such and give her that but uh you\nKnow she seems to
