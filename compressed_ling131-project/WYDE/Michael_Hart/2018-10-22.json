we tell the story I don't see why not I mean we've got the message about it right um he didn't say to keep it private no\nHe didn't want to I mean it's always good to use discretion before you tell somebody else\nTo do it for him right out in the morning yeah I'm a heart\nIs out at a store hardware store or something like that\nAnd uh he\nIs a ... enough stopped me from telling the story wrong 'cause I'm doing it off memory he has approached by someone who recognizes\nHim I guess by its boy they listen to him a it was the guy behind the counter on the radio right uh and he\nComes in and he's like oh yeah nice to meet you above above ... and then he introduces heart to his other co workers\nAnd he's like yeah this is in many gives the name\nOf um of a\nA competitor competitor yes a competing show if you will\nAnd Michael hard rose let it right in his why not only banks out of the stores that with the man's hand all I Would have probably done the same thing yeah so\nUh then realizing why he had done the guy at the store ended up messaging our Facebook page and the giant ball a job it's really I think there is why I actually\nLove your station I listen every day and I don't know what happened but I just said the wrong name and uh it was just kind of funny\nYeah but he he said to ah to hearts credit\nAnd I don't know what happened but I just said the wrong name and ah it was just kind of funny\nYeah but he he said see or to hearts credit and he just rolled with it they didn't you didn't have some big ego reaction and was like that's not my name I mean he just kind of went with it nice to meet you was gracious and when I left and that that's how you know you're a professional and you can just roll on right to that lemonade benefits things a little that around and say look at it paid off in the end with\nMuch like he treats the callers who just lets them role on\nThanks for making it thanks for making at\nThe ... name thanks for saying it it was funny and we love Michael heart he said there's a message with that story and then we start like cutting up about arriving he'd like\nI should have known this is the last place impassioned in a row member not the message all that ... percent of the stuff I find that [laughter] oh it's so good so good we have fun around here yeah and that's what's important\nWe're when a one big happy family one big habit for him All right two oh five nine\nFour one one zero one one is the number two free eight six six five\nFive one Ninety nine thirty three and pulled you about uh the apartment collapse and Clemson what happened in the NFL or what's move over real quick to Trump pulling out of the nuclear deal with\nRussia now we don't have any confirmation on this but this is just what Trump's telling us\nAnd he or at least the administration says they intend to pull out of that nuclear deal arms treaty which was ain't with Russia during the Cold War and they came back and they said listen\nMoscow is expanding their base of nuclear weapons and that completely violates the treaty so we're going to throw it out if you don't want to make a new one will be more than happy to\nBut if we're going to have this deal in place and your just not going to pay attention to it and continue to do what you want to do why are we have to hold up our end of the deal\nThat arm I haven't been in bed with Russia right this is this story and will not be widely report how's it going to have that was going to be the next question but ah he was talking I guess it was late\nSaturday Night or he was talking to the press and he says he's\nLooking for a new deal with both Russia and China to put a halt to this nuclear armament he says China was not a part of the original deal\nA but he wants China there'll be a part of it he also said ah\nWe're going to terminate the agreement and we're going to pull out\nHe said Russia has violated the agreement they have been violating it for many years and we're not going to let that we're not going to let them violate a nuclear agreement and go out and do weapons and we're not allowed to um\nSo he ... it was funny because he was headed off the taxes and I'm thinking about the Texas rally will later on the show that will be tonight that's going to be one to watch I'm telling you\nHe was handed off the tax is just probably an hour or so ago when he stopped to talk to reporters and one reporter says are you going to contact Russia before you terminate disagreement he says I don't have to do after talking to Russia a terminated the agreement\nWhich had he doesn't need to says he doesn't eat they they they violated where you tear it up\nI mean simple than they are not abiding by what are they agreed to\nIt he said um let me find as other quote because he said something along the lines\nGoing to terminate their ... and we're going to pull out he says that the U.S would pour more money into developing weapons\nWe're going to terminate that agreement and we're going to pull out he says that the U.S would pour more money into developing weapons if that's what the situation requires and that strong arm and you're way across the globe and saying I Russia here's what we're going to you've already screwed up this deal so we're going to wrap it up we'll come back\nWith another one and if you want to play ball\nWon't let you sign on to this one if not we'll just start dumping money into our weapons to make sure you don't get what up on us\nAnd that's the kind of president this country needs is when it needed at the right time and do that than sixteen\nIt couldn't happen at a better time and with a better guy\nTough to get you a headway on the global stage not apology tours [noise]\nNot handing over\nPeople say oh it's from being racist no it's actually ... be in fact I have alerted border patrol and ...\nThat this is a national emergency must change laws he said every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming in\nOr attempting to come into our country illegally think of and blamed the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws remember the mid term so unfair to those who come in legally\nGuatemala Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping\nThe stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S we will now begin cutting off or substantially reducing the massive foreign aid routinely given to them\nNow going back to the second tweet where he said it's unfair to those who come in legally it's also unfair to those who currently\nOr an ... for their whole lives have lived in the U.S and there are some communities that are disproportionately affected by by a legal immigration one of those being the black community or outside of that poor\nCommunities inner cities\nPeople that are are living in places where jobs aren't as available and that's because of\nThe the job market in that area or lack of uh transportation or whatever you know 'cause if if you're limited and having a car or whatever it's harder for you to get a job you're going to get a job you can\nEither want to or take us to take a bus or ride but do workers or whatever bicycle once you start bringing in\nIllegal immigrants especially a big caravan has got eighty percent working age young males are they start taking those jobs why because they will take less money to do the work than the average American will or even the intake\nSo you let these people pour in so for the people living in sanctuary cities for the people living in black communities there having jobs taken away from them all because Democrats say this is the right thing to do\nSo again shows the racism of the Democratic party because they have no problem with this issue\nWith illegal immigrants coming in and taking the jobs from freedom loving Americans that want to do nothing but work provide for their family and pursue happiness\nThat's exactly what this is this is affecting\nThose among us those communities among us that are most vulnerable\nAllowing these people went to take those jobs and put Americans last it's not about compassion it's not about opening our arms and welcoming the people of the world in\nIts about are you going to put your family first or somebody else's family first\nAnd it's not selfish to say I'm going to put my family for\nWe've talked about this before to think about the whole airplane example they tell you to put the mask on yourself before you put it on your children and there's a reason why and it's the same reason why we talked about this you know\nIf your family is struggling or whatever you don't take in a bunch of foster kids if you can't even support the once you have you have to make sure that you can take care of your family first before you bring in more people that she will then have to be responsible for us\nStruggling or whatever you don't take in a bunch of foster kids if you can't even support the once you have you have to make sure that you can take care of your family first before you bring in more people that you will have to be responsible for and take care of if it's going to tax our economy and tax or health care system intact our public school systems that I think we have a problem that we need to be serious about that and have a conversation\nWe all be on the same page if I were to say what do you think about\nThe quarter lady whose houses dilapidated and she's got she's living among Seventy five cats and she's trying to take in more I think we'd all collectively say she's crazy right she can't even take care of herself why she's still bringing in animals\nEspecially the last let's say those poor animals are just looking for home Letterman [laughter] right no matter how much it affects our life are overrun things or causes the the preexisting cats to go through or even more trauma or headache Letterman\nRight no compassion that this compassion for these migrants\nIt's all a sham of course and they know it's a sham by promoting this with political actors to to push this Caribbean towards the U.S to clash with the border\nRight around the election it's all politically motivated with with no remorse\nFor the people that are dying in this caravan for the children that are dying to the people that are being beaten and tortured by human traffickers that that they've had to pay to help them make this journey two thousand miles who who in their right mind\nIs saying any human being\nShould be allowed to walk two thousand miles especially up to ten thousand human beings men women and children should ...\nTwo thousand miles that's the right thing to do according to the Democrats that's the right thing to do because they want to come to the U.S why the Democrats not adding to Mexico and trying to pick these people up in their own cars\nThey've said nothing about the fact that these people are making this journey just the journey itself and how dangerous that journey is the Democrats aren't saying anything about that\nWell why don't they just got to the border and take some of these people into their own homes I mean some of the people that make these claims are actually very wealthy and talk about people and a lot a lot of those people are in Hollywood and they make mega bucks so I mean if you fail so you know I ... towards these people don't want to do something about it personally\nOutside of the innocent people in this caravan that I think we're being politically used also used to buy drug traffickers human traffickers MS Thirteen gang members who were all in the mix of this caravan\nIt's important to note and we brought this up on the show before we were seeing a surge of\nOf Bangladeshis Bangladesh nationals coming across the southern border in taxes we were getting these reports from border patrol and and they're like you know this is kind of bizarre because these are not people from Mexico or Guatemala or Honduras or El Salvador\nPeople for Bangladesh all the way all the other side of the world's okay\nWhat's the deal now we're finding out and and I found this out through a Spanish language reporter and I don't even remember what a what outlet he was with but he was embedded inside the caravan\nAnd he was talking about how shocking it was to see so many Bangladesh nationals in that caravan and to see uh\nBut how shocking it was to see so many Bangladesh nationals in that caravan and to see a people of Middle Eastern Middle Eastern countries in that caravan and this is coming\nFrom a this is coming from\nCountries that that are connected to the U.S okay not countries that are across the pond or anything\nHow is this happening how are you getting we're not dealing with three countries we're not dealing with just four countries we're done with people all over the world that are in this caravan\nAnd nobody said anything about it except for those poor women and children let's just open arms they want something nasty to have because again the compassion thing as a sham they want something nasty to happen on the border\nThey want to clash\nWith these people on the ... they want it to look like the Gaza Strip is what they want\nThey just want the optics of that situation what\nWe see between the Israelis and the Palestinians on the Gaza Strip on a daily basis that's what the Democrats want to see\nOn our southern border because of Donald Trump is pushed he it's in the military to the border and we'll just closed off if we ain't got all all we're just going to make a human wall yeah until we can get this under control but you can't just allow seven to ten thousand people just walk into this country\nWell can we talk about the fact that we've mentioned this in previous discussions that and I don't mean to send any kind of way that we don't know what kind of diseases that bring into this country right I mean at that we have an immunization like you can't even go to a public school here without a blue car without proving that she's been immunized unless you have a religious exemption or something of that sort\nSo I mean you're telling me that it's a wise decision to just unfiltered let these people and I mean for a host of different reasons but for that one we have no idea what they're bringing into this country\nRight in the problem is is the feds are saying hey we're already dealing with an unprecedented amount of migrant families and mainly unaccompanied minors at the border they're pushing on us they're doing what they can to get in here we're putting them in immigration facilities\nThe Democrats know that the the political actors whoever they may be that are involved with getting this caravan started and and getting it up through Mexico into the U.S know that they know that border patrol is overwhelmed\nSo they just want to hit them with one big rush one big flood of illegal immigrants\nRight before the men terms right\nBefore the midterms unfortunately it's not going to help the Democrats case because most of us have the view of\nOur family comes first ... we ourselves ... seconds and then the neighbors can come third we love our neighbor we love we love we love our brothers and sisters in America and we love if we're Christian we love people from all over the world\nAnd if you do there will be repercussions I Would imagine some of the Caribbean banks off I mean if it is the the women and children make up as much of that caravan is the left wants us to think it is a lot of those people will back off a lot of those people that are actually looking for a better life\nWill back off and ascertain drug smugglers all that they might push back a but he just got to do what you got to do I guess thanks Jay [noise] our number

called stop the less violent attacks against Republicans and I want to play it for you it just kind of gives you a rundown of things that we've talked about on this show but it paints a good

the footage I\nBut if that's the case in whether these people are part of the Saudi Government or they are rogue actors or whatever whoever did this went to great lengths to trying to cover their tracks\nIn\nKnocking this guy off but we now have confirmation that he is on fat dad and what have we got not I'm not a story\nNow we're still waiting for a Turkish officials to to release video audio whatever they've got in they claim that they're about to\nDo it at least that's what the reports read\nAnd once we do\nBut it turns out that's actually a really bad idea and exposes you to even more bacteria\nToilet seats are actually designed to repel nasty germs has their shape and smooth surface make it tricky for bacteria to latch onto and facts experts say that a toilet seat as much cleaner than most people's kitchen sink on the other hand toilet paper has a rough texture and it's designed to be absorbent making at the ideal material for bacteria to latch onto\nStudies show that with every flush fecal bacteria flies into the air which sends the feces matter everywhere and often lands on the roll of toilet paper itself so when you layer up the toilet seat with T. P. and sit on it you're actually sitting on loads of other people's microscopic feces\nSo that means when you wipe your wife and was ... I Will say I had the same thought and you're not safe they say it's better to just sit on the toilet seat or when possible just hover what if\nAh what if when you flush the toilet you feel a little bit splash back and they ... sell me you've never been there were widely ... well I'm saying ...\nYou know [laughter] you\nSound like a tiny little bit of that yeah like it's a slight list and you're like where's that coming\nI mean we've all had water fly back out of your time I know that was in response to my face but if it's flying with how how has this stuff why\nI don't know and apparently the microscopic feces can go anywhere I mean they fly throughout the air there landing on who knows what\nAnd even if the toilets been flushed afterwards you know the struggle of\nA ... and the ... gets on the toilet seat and if the myth that girls think we just pee on the toilet seat it's really been ... understand goes in the whole right and then comes back out write letters on the toilet a a simple physics um but\nI think what I was really rising out yeah is there still other matter in there even after it's flushed\nOut to a good question and I'm not sure and uh I don't know if this I mean the thing is if somebody flushes before you and then there's a spray involved than you were walking into contaminated site right and I didn't realize that about the toilet seat they said the ... any bacteria that was on there because of the way it's designed would really only live for a couple of minutes so you're better off just sitting in it you\nThink when somebody takes a booth that a ... and you walk into the bathroom or they spray within males like horrific you think that smell is really just particles who are already here\nWell it probably is have you ever been close to someone who went out and you felt it you\nKnow I'm not about the hot when\nYou've never filled the heat [laughter]\nOne I can do and it ... or ... or something [laughter]\n[laughter] and like you know please you know when he was among the hamburger joint in the earth's been run over\nOne of one ... they turn around to apologize joke because [laughter]\nI'm not saying the wind is that strong and dry [laughter] it's enough to where you can send said you know when your aura no\nNo oh yeah it's it's different if you're both sitting on my ... plastic bench and it ran on the bench yeah was that much different than just catching a blast\nOf hot air I Will tell you that when it happened to me I was on the bleachers okay and someone had lifted up and we we were close because it was raining and lift it up\nIt's a hot air I Will tell you that when it happened to me I was on the bleachers okay and someone had lifted up and we were close because it was raining and lifted up and because of the way they they did the left it was pointed to my direction and I had my arm kinda propped up\nAnd I know [laughter]\nThat is glad to hear some arm I mean I felt like a slight breeze your main was loving every minute was like [noise]\nAnd I don't know I thought that it happened everybody diminish his name [laughter] well I mean I don't know that you do in your spare time I don't know I'm a yeah\nOh we've all felt the rattle of one that didn't belong to us but I don't it's first time I've heard somebody described filling a burst of hot when\nThe heat and the lesson [laughter] I don't let you know what's going on when you feel that he need\nNow there's no hiding it win again you're on a bench a plastic bench or a I'm a I don't know one of the old school church pews you're sitting on one of those new let one rep it's like a machine\nGun yeah know where that guy was really allow like tentative emphasis you got to be careful where he let that slide out for sure I just don't listen to the side if you've got someone beside you and I feel like we need from listeners hot when stories hot when\nI promise you I'm I Can't be the only person that's experience I you it was a heat like no no that's like saying I I Can't imagine nobody else does suck their pinky toe up into a ... less than it was the dice and making this section is incredible in those thing we're things happen\nYou well that's true that don't happen to everybody don't just\nListen if you can take a lighter and they fall on it and create like a you know uh what's it called um flame flame thrower yeah then certainly you can feel that break down your arm you know what I'm saying if it as powerful enough to create a flame thrower\nWas certainly and this is without a wider what if it's singed the hairs on your own ... percent powerful that would be a ... second degree burns what if it sends her nose hairs we've all been there you know it's like it has a life of its own the question would be then why are you lay in your head on the beach\nWell that's not what [laughter] that's not really going on\nThere and I just sent the that's so bad so bad or\nAnyway that is your edition I'm Jessica ...
