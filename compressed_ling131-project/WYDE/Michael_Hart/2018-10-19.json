Eddie and he was going to get her number and he just bugs snot out of her and she finally gave him a fake number but then one day right in front of them she gave me her real number oh\n[laughter] yeah it was funny though is when I go down to Tijuana with some other friends and party in the night clubs in Tijuana she'd be down their party affiliation dance and\nYou know I'm sure if he drinks or whatever and hang out nothing ever happened but it was just funny that this guy thought he was going to be all this and that and what's interesting about that guy was the rumor was a few years back that his ex wife killed them in self defense\nWow what why\nWhy he was abusive well she she never she didn't\nKill them and I think she did a gun on him but yeah they end up getting a divorce and she

they're touching your man right well you know\nFirst of all she should know better than men second of all the Latin wife slapped or that's okay\nLet me ask you a question what was Hooters created for it was not the food because you can go and eat wings anywhere I mean and now they're saying all wings are created equal I'm saying now I'm not saying that because I don't believe that but I'm just saying what is the appeal of tutors and why is it that it's mainly men together I Know some women go there too\nIt's because of the eye candy okay\nAnd my ... well I mean it's true so if you're in a

fine\nHell and some people watch pornography together and their relationship and I would still say that stupid even if it's a mutual decision that men and women are created differently and men are visually stimulated and the more you stimulate that\nI had the more trouble you can get into why do you think there's people who were addicted to things like pornography it all started somewhere and nobody ever got up in the morning and said you know what I think I'm going to be addicted today that happens over a course of the time\nBy the way outside of that and my girlfriend made me aware that

to community service treatment for anger management and find another guy says yeah the gym or the party of violence Trump just applauded and assault on a reporter\nShocked I'm just shocked\nTrump is a psychopath with lots of followers and among generality he praised the congressman for assaulting a reporter what else ... praises the violent assault of a reporter his supporters cheer horrific he's declared open season on old journalists\nHow about\nTrump has a standing timing days after the writer or after the the Saudi reporter was murdered he praises a congressman who physically attacked a
