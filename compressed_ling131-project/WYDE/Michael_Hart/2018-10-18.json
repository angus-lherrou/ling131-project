'cause I'm In Alabama fan but I don't know that I'm like uh all the devastated kind of you know how I Am I like football for the sport the competition I I'm not a big fan of\nA team dominating constantly hunting irritates me so but how are you going to fail anyways if you walk in here Monday morning are you going to have like a little strengthen your stuff\nI Will paint my entire body orange ... I Will call everyone to the conference room including corporate people and I will do the biggest and dance and then I'll walk out now you quit my job and I thought oh my God come on\nThere's at least that chance they could win whatever you say on the air you're going to have to follow through it [laughter] I'd be stressful\nIf they win that game I I don't care I'll do it I don't I really don't even hear it it would I Would cry\nTears wow two years of Tennessee beat Alabama real salty there yep\nWow that's that's big it'd be that big of a deal now says he says a home game for Tennessee okay well well Tennessee\nMan hasn't really been been good at you know at home necessarily went away but if I didn't well we'd be ... an adult ... forgot about that though if we're going by the numbers they do a better way than their own\nUh but you know and is what it is it's not it's probably not going to happen but in the same time\nThink about the emotional a roller coaster that would be if the\nAnd as what it is it's not it's probably not gonna happen but in at the same time you think about the emotional a roller coaster that would be if they did this will be the first time my child named after the famous Peyton Manning quarterback at\nTennessee would have seen us when this game all he knows is the stories I've told him about how big that robbery was that he's never seen it may never seen it happen that guy but\nI mean for your sake and your son I mean I kind of hope that I'll get that W but at the same kind of happy that you're right you know 'cause I guess well\nWe'll we'll have our hopes up way but uh we do have our hopes up\nFor the next three years or so uh are are in the next two or three years that it will be more competitive we just don't I mean like you said it's going to take it back to the house well\nI think well hopefully [laughter] but uh I don't know I mean it's just a matter of we gotta get established\nAnd bring in the younger\nGeneration the new Democrats the problem is I feel like the Democrats downfall has been the fact that they continue to move left further and further west\nSo then the problem becomes well the new people coming in their further left and the people are now so it's like you're not just moving lab you're jumping left\nAnd then you're starting from a position that doesn't wind up with American values doesn't wind up with your average voters or opinions policy wise economic wise whatever [noise]\nIt's it's a lose lose situation for the Democrats if they don't pull this off I was watching\nA a con CEO Cortez Alexandria\nWas that the video here watching in the office today well yeah she was on Jimmy Kimble last night and uh\n[laughter] and then as you watched her that it it talk with with Jimmy Kimmel and durable interview or whatever there were so many times when she was like\nA you know like like yeah yeah like yeah\nShe does sound like a Fifteen year old in high school yes very\nMuch so and so there was a video put together where it just took those clips of her being like\nYeah like like this and like that and like or don't have maps\nRight at the shop\nIt all mash up it was a it was crazy because once you listen to this I just want you to know that what you're hearing is not much different from the an edited version it's just a way to compact it make it shorter but it sounds almost identical to when she was dogging Jimmy Kimble and the first place like\nIt'll be a time incumbent a guy who just assumed that he was gone away and then you came out of nowhere and working as a bartender and decided that it would be a good idea to run for office it's really one of the most remarkable stories I've ever you stop and think about this from time to time ago\nYeah believe this has happened a year ago I just live their life daily out\nIn the party yeah they do their own home town only an\nHour from the Bronx it's like exotic [laughter] you\nMotion what does it mean when somebody says yeah no yeah I don't know yeah oh yeah no wait wait was it seems a little salty I don't know\nIt's tough for me that's like singing singled out actually is [noise] you know and they're tiny you know and you know they they said\nThat's where I Am [noise] I kinda\nUp with me so good you remember the one uh an an you do where it's like the stuttering kid and it's like I've heard that the main tried to explain to my mom why I came home waiter I ever\nYou don't remember that I Do actually I don't know that one so good and there's a lot of people who are old I Want to play that for you because that's this is who she sounds like right here\nHave dreams [noise] here you can tell you when you're when you're ... you can get yourself out there\nHere you can give you ... your ... your ... you can show no you're right you can get Gary I'm like you can do anything to do that age you\nKnow that ... memories [laughter] you know I remember those days that that your kids well I mean do they do you like spit it out um yeah\nWell that's just the you know they do or re makes everything like right so they did a remix to this one and a\nThere's an ad and it's pretty good move here we go [noise]\n[noise]\nYou're you get some rain [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] your shoe\nAnyway that's called the ... the what strap re max I'm going to check that out later\nAnyway back to Alexandria Cortez [noise]\n'cause it is yeah in the mid well you know I think it kind of typing into my phone putting your cellphone under you know\nShe sounds just like they could yeah she does but also it means that you also have [noise]\nA lowered allow man even there's the tone of voice she's got that yeah yeah yeah totally so it's that jazz yeah sure sure sure yeah but\n... easy it is for me to get sidetracked yes I ... I went ... talking about the the democratic candidate right next thing you know when you do point on my favorite video and then play in the ...\nYou didn't play in the ... are also Joe buying he was on CBS this morning this morning and\nHe uh he they were talking about voter fraud and voter fraud the big issue was done about it on the show we talked about how very real it is and how Democrats deny it's a thing they not only do nights a thing but they flip it around and say people are being denied the ability to vote\nAre there things that happen where it's a it's a mix up and somebody gets their and their names not on the\nList or you know this that or the other happens and they're not able to vote yeah we've all heard of somebody that that's gone through that or whatever I end up because guess what governments running this thing but\nThis whole voter voter fraud doesn't exist voter fraud doesn't exist in a large scale is an absolute why and Joe Biden's on CBS this morning and he's pushing that stuff\nAnd talking about how crazy it is that anybody would think that ... that voter fraud is real and that and voter ID laws or any sort of voting laws\nAre racist because they're suppressing African American people keeping them from voting and listen to the\nEarly they were told to get off\nDo you believe that the Russians\nAbsolutely look\nI have the exact numbers but somewhere and order of Seventy seven in the last couple of years piece of legislation to suspect legislatures too strict the right to vote\nTo reduce the up we should we should have automatic registration\nWe should allow everybody to vote\nAll this stuff about oh they can't let felons you can't let it you know people who are in this country illegally like they have to have an idea that well not on they don't have to\nAnd you know all this stuff about oh they can't let felons you can't let it you know people who are in this country legally they have to have an id well not on they don't have to have an idea\nWhere they have to demonstrate that they lived there and who they are they don't have to have a particular id\nThey don't have to have a government issued id they don't have to have that's not true and the truth of the matter is that all the talk about voter fraud did the president find any of it\nAnd this big hole thing that he won the popular vote\nAnd then what what was going to see more now about them but my generic point is there is no no evidence of all the studies time\nOf widespread voter fraud that being the central problem in American electoral\nProcess just not true\nWhich reported more than fifty three thousand voter registration applications are on hold Detroit is Seventy percent of those were African American surprise surprise so do you believe that an effort underway absolutely already positively\nWithout question it continues it's one of the reasons why this museum the ... the people in this museum that are here now being honored started their fight\nIt's still going on\nIs still exist\nAnd it's wrong and look that voter id if my name is Joseph Biden junior\nIf I show up and I don't have a license that says Joseph are Biden or doesn't have junior on it then I Can't vote\nWhen everybody knows who the hell heck I Am in my ... and ... and ... and and the challenger knows that\nThis is designed to suppress the vote\nNot allowed to write\nYou know those those are asking people to show ID at the polling place designed to see black people from voting sure\nSo racist thoughtless saying because I mean not to say black people don't have the ability to get a free government issued id or anything I mean isn't that race or send it\nSo you know and I know this is off the beaten path but just going to the broader theme of of us not recognizing racism for what it is now twisted we've become and I was telling you this earlier I started watching the show called New Amsterdam it's a it's a new medical drama type of thing and and me and my son or watching yesterday 'cause he's sick at home with nothing else to do\nAnd it was actually really good I'd recommend it but anyhow one of the it's like a cardio drastic surgeon and he's he's black and apparently Hammond this white girl had been hooking up or whatever and so she's like well I don't understand why I don't want to seriously date me and he said I don't want to seriously ... because you're not black\nI had a vision in my mind are having black children and you can't produce that for me and a lot holy goodness can you imagine if the roles were reversed in that show had a white person saying that to a black person right and the cries of racism that would quickly common that show would probably be shut\nTo this is an open investigation that the Saudis

seeing it on television when he had a black people\nTalk about ... on television they be much better but what they will want to say is hey you know he\nYou had a black people\nTalk about cutting the old TV they'd be a nice about it but what they will want to say is hey you know he tapped danced and he's a ... um you know he's this leads to you know ... is not in his right now if you had a black person like\nEspecially Will Smith Will Smith one of them you know wouldn't talk to Donald Trump hey that's cool\nHe would he would be called the same thing they might not calling mentally ill ... but he really get that treatment\nYou know it'd be like hey we're supposed to talk to a brother that you know it it it wouldn't be like it is we kinda 'cause they know what kind of try to do\nIt would be if you Will Smith is not the person we thought he was right he's cozying up to white supremacist Donald Trump you know they would do that because and look at look let's go outside the crazy realm\nAnd just talk about you know bad actors mad people whether it's criminals or whatever you look at it to the people that Obama invited to the White House you got a who's one of the envy or well how about

went off during a speech you know a nobody writes about that well people pitch to fit but I'm Talking about the mainstream media here and how their conduct themselves when they kind of things that just\nSimply is simply because what everybody is going nuts is that we know is black the maybe the white people do\nWe know it's like people\nIs that is that he was out of his mind that you know ultimately in a bit different story you had somebody with so called up to talk to you know Okay Jim Jim I wanted to go you know Jim I'm Talking to him that you'll Hitler said about Jim ...\nWell not

let\nMe tell you that what's wrong with the Republican clouded black when you've got Republicans go out and talk about black people talk about let's talk about black people and then turn around and say hey look we want to vote\nWell would only talking about black people though actually if anything Republicans shy away from addressing a a black issues Donald Trump's been overseas they come out and bring up\nBlack issues do you think as a positive way or did you take has been the negative ...\nI I don't I don't see where it would be in a negative way I mean getting me off mic\nBlack issues do you think as a positive way or did you take as in the negative ...\nI I don't I don't see where it would be in a negative way I mean getting me off negative give me an example negative give me just

example\nThey do oh they do what you know\nBlow up but ... you know but go back to what your presidency\nAnd say hey why don't you tell us what you got a little right like this like talking to do like
