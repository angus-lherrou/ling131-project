going to be able to tell you I'll let you know don't worry [laughter] that's the one I'm here for the monetary you why don't you talking into the mind set up saying I'll just take over the so I'm having a stroke\nMan a lotta news going on today as you guys probably know by now bombs\nSent to a a plethora of people a who's who of Democrats if you well nobody's been hurt none of the bombs exploded so it's got everybody kind of scratching their head it's nonetheless a very serious situation so we're we're going to do for you today\nThis afternoon we're going to break it down for you and let you know exactly what's going on just a case you've been out of the loop will also have ... we do every single Wednesday he'll be on it a three three so you get to hear\nSome of that but man lots and lots of a crazy things going down and just a less than two weeks from the mid turns at that caravan still trucking along their uh their moon and shaken as we speak\nSo their stuff on that front but the the the bomb the bomb scares have really taken over the the news headlines of stock markets heading down and I don't really have a have an explanation for that if it's just what's happening in the news is as you got the stock market for\nDown I don't know it's because Trump said he was a nationalist yesterday for probably so probably say I've just when we thought that was going to be the topic of the day because I think Morning Joe was hoping that would really take over the are the headlines today that's pretty much the bulk of what they talked about when I watched anyway he was he\nWas really saying he was white nationalism is what they said on clearly that was the insinuation so\nAnd then all this stuff at the bottom and it seems like we're sitting back in the office and I swear every five minutes you're like another bomb has been sent you and I'm like how is this even as saying I mean it was\nIt was like one after another after another after another\nUm well so let's go ahead and get into it real quick first of all to Ovide nine four one one zero one one is the number who has received a bomb it's probably easier to say you as well and as a Democrat at this point you got to kind of feel left out of Yemen right whatever their buddy El Paso\nThis and\nJust it's bizarre it's bizarre you can't you can't\nBe mad at me for at least questioning it and again if somebody would have been hurt within all this we'd be having a different conversation but we're talking about obvious obvious suspicious packages being sent bunk bombs that don't even work\nBeing sent\nAnd to this group of people\nWell and I ... a local of which I'm looking on Twitter just to kind of get a glimpse of people's reactions and I mean most of these are blue check marks but ... says I'm going to go ahead and say that there's a zero percent chance of these suspicious packages packages for sent out by conservatives are Andy McCarthy\nHas got a story about a National Review it says the pipe bomb story and other examples I no one trusts the media\nAnd on and on and go see your or we're not the only people at at least floating the idea or the possibility that there could be

I Do see four five six seven eight I think don't quote me on that but it's going to be around\nIt and we hadn't had long ago off you're not a one I did some I mean everything\nDon't quote me on that but it's going to be around and eat\nIt and we hadn't had warned go off yet not a one I did some things are designed to go off and told his wife say\nWell a number of the normal procedure is to take these things off to the vacant area or whatever and and blow them up a manually you know use your own ... I don't know exactly how they do it but they usually go blow these things up and and nine times out of ten\nWendy's bomb squads deal with this and this is just to stand I heard earlier there they turn out to not even be real bombs they don't want to blow these up they may have to but they don't want to blow these up because of the amount of evidence that would be there if they can study keep it intact and actually study it\nYeah so well I really believe it's a tactic of the left it to\nMake it look like something that's not\nAnd going back to the ... baseball fill up in a Washington but one that alone and take liberal shot up all I'm gonna try to kill all of them you know you didn't hear him ... jumping up and down you didn't hear well number one democratic come out about that did\nNot well I mean there there were a handful of them but it it it's it's not going to be compared to what we're going to hear them harping on this went oh it's going to be much more over the top\nUm millionaire there should I really believe this or the or the floor of the loyalists trying to force will cry so there's high you know folks and what we might never know the truth the\nYeah well that's how we do who knows girl a good day and Joe yes\nSir I'm here's the thing and this is this is what's promoting this outside of what we've seen to immigrants do with the a comment on and stuff and ... whatever whatever history shows us that would even put them in the category of possibly\nConstructing something like this I look at the situation there and they're getting their brains beat out in the polls they're losing and a lot of important states in early voting\nWhich is bad bad news for a while and the Kavanaugh saying backfired they kept on saying backfired there there there are polls are sagging their their their candidates are getting picked off\nOne by one Trump's backing out a hundred thousand people at rallies it's not looking good for Democrats and then while all that's going on or as a result of\nPeople are not even people Donald Trump has taken center stage for this whole thing this whole ... of violence on the ride violence against conservatives from the laugh\nWeather's changed them at a restaurant or ... or whatever else and the he's branded them with jobs not mumps he's branded the laughter as a mob as a violent group of people and that if they sang in the polls already and now they're branded as violent\nGroup desperate times calls for desperate measures\nThey got to figure out a way to make it look like they're not the violent ones that got to be the victims I was just saying the other side and it's got to be the violent one Conrad our money\nI'm doing good how are you sir\nJust go back say you're a return to sender um it maybe that is where they originated from maybe the bomb that was delivered there was the one he admitted that he was supposed to oversee the news\nWas ...\nThe bomb that was delivered there was blood he admitted that he was us over the news\nWas oh wouldn't that be good [laughter] like why he says the one that if if the one package that went back to Debbie Wasserman Schultz if that was a return to sender\nWhat if it turns out that that was the package that was supposed to go to Andrew Cuomo and that's why he said he had a package Adam West conference but he really didn't that's unfortunate fan fortunate or but it would add a quite a span to this whole thing I wouldn't be surprised just because of how crazy this thing is in the front allies\nAt this point I Would not put as\nWell and I think that the theory the working theory behind the idea that it could possibly be the laugh is that they tend to overdo it you know what I mean all the way they overplay their hand every single time now I guess this would be just another example of that you you can't just send one pipe\nYou can't even take a breath without time Trump ... anything and everything\nAnd I think some of that's off the topic I think these people really believe that Trump is responsible for all this I Know I talked to a couple of guys uh CNN Today that I I Know and they they think it's they they they think it's a\nPlace to be ... I was like ... ... after ... ... in in at his rallies whether that's the truth or not I you know that that remains to be seen if you can if you could realistically tied to what Trump says at a rally that's going to make people do certain\nThings I I think is a little far fetched but they they sincerely believe this narrative so how far do they take it I think more importantly what what is what's going to be the public's reaction to the scissors or a group of people that are they thinking just to see this\nSee this other TV it'd be like you know that's enough I'm not voting for any Republican anymore we need more Democrats in office because there's a more civil party I think that's the that's a bit of a leap in a bit of a stretch and I you know if that's what the hope is I don't\nThink I Would would bet too much money on that\nI I think the real question is is what is Jeff Zucker gonna do when he finds out he's got employees talking to some guy from Breitbart are they going to\n... [laughter] you got to realize the ... is\nBack in the day in D. C. everybody kind of started out at the same time all the same\n... it's it's a lot closer behind the scenes and you think it is it may it may seem like we're at each other's throat but a day to day you're just kind of you you go to the same party's you see the same people you go to the same bars yeah yeah I had to pay people you know it's it's high school to point out\nWell and we we state when stuff like this happens we watch Fox News come together with CNN I mean we've even seen instances of\nOf a Donald Trump attacking verbally attacking Jim Acosta and and people on Fox News come to a defense and all that which I think I you know there's not not a guy more deserving\nThan Jim Acosta get blasted the news conference but that's that's neither here nor there and I I get what you're saying are the big thing and and and what's really contributing to this conversation about these packages\nIs the fact that it's less than two weeks\nFrom the mid turns and it's a way we've talked to me and you've done several times about the October surprise and Everytime something crazy happens whether it's Kavanaugh or it's the caravan or it's it's this\nIt almost seems like it's an October surprise but it's not the traditional October surprise where one party brings it out says here's what I got on this guy it's like ... we're in an alternate universe\nYeah it's like a big big bang but it's not a it's not like\nGeorge W Bush's DUIs are right or or something just to the last minute Access Hollywood tape right it's it's always it's always one of these ground shaking events that you you don't see every day\nBut it's it's not a October quote unquote October surprises just these last minute incidents and I and I you know I I Do think they\nThey do have some sort of impact on the on the election\nWhat are you saying or with the package stop what do you say to people that have that come out immediately look at the situation and say you know what this is a shady the Democrats\nUh people that have that come out immediately look at the situation and say you know what this is shady\nThe Democrats may or are behind that is there for instance mailing bombs to themselves which is a sense nobody got hurt I felt like that conversations okay that we have\nUm what do you say to those people who have such a distrust for the Democrat Party that they're saying I Can't put it past the Democrat Party to do this for their as we see an October surprise\nYeah and I have seen a little of that out there and I\nI you know an easel too soon to have that discussion Reno or of but the fact that it's out\nThere and you see a lot of people talking about it I you know ... there's going to be people believe what they want to believe [noise] ah it will be something if if this does come out and we find out that it's sort of this a reverse Orwellian sort of situation where they're\nThey're they're while waging terrorist attacks\nOn themselves to advance their power right that that would be that would really be something and I I Do think no matter what the you're always going to have a set of people that are going to believe that's the case I you know and then it it it it's probably being discussed right now by Alex Jones or something oh yeah I don't know I've already seen I had a\nGun info wars\nMad if that's the case you know I ... if it is the case that I expect a story to go away and not be on the news at all if we find out that this guy's a Democrat doing this in the media five that's a Democrat or we all about and we got back on Russia gate or something right well think about\nThis though Jessica pointed this out to me we've concentrated a lot and then there you are at Breitbart did you see a lot of these articles as well er about hoax hate crimes we feel like we see 'em all the time and it's it's one right after another and it's usually a hoax hate crime that is\nIntended to hurt either Trump or conservatives or whatever the case it's won't we tend to Z so often I'm\nSo that's where people I think get this theory and and have come out so soon to say you know I don't believe this right off the bat because we see those hoax ground so much\nYeah they poison the well on themselves will\nSay crabs I think and that that's why you were you get a lot of this\nI'll say this I think just the sort of the survivor right now reminds me of post nine eleven with the anthrax scare that they had a really scared public image or they're just they're just bad\nPeople in this world that want to capitalize on sort of things like that I you know I I think it very well could be one of these cases where somebody sitting at home thinking this is how I this is how I make my star eyes on how I get meaning in my life I'll I'll I'll get in the middle of this highly polarized political environment and and do these things\nRight um the Republicans seemed to have a lot of traction and you may disagree with me here I'm just looking at this from a you know a guy that's just a regular dude that watches politics\nI'm I'm watching these huge rallies Donald Trump split non and granted you know everybody far and wide comes to these rallies and that's how he fills up these arenas and even has tons of people on the outside but I'm seeing reports in in swing states where\nEarly voting is actually favoring the Republicans which is something we never see we're watching conservatives across the board just fired up about mid term which is on President\nOr what do you say ... main pretend we're this is twenty four hours ago before all this went down where you see where do you see a U.S ...\n... main pretend we're missing twenty four hours ago before all this went down where do you see where do you see a landing on election night do you think Republicans keep the momentum on November six\nI I Do think the Kevin also Scott aligning ah I think that did wake Republicans up but it's just a matter of maintaining that are maintaining nuts momentum right so that's you know what what is that is it is it this caravan down in Mexico that does the trick I I don't know uh but I think\nHere two weeks out all it is a day less than two weeks\nI keep on the stock market stock market really changed the ... election in ... in two thousand and eight\nWhen he had that big dip with McCain running against Obama McCain kinda lost his cool a bomber was cool and then I think that had a you know that that really add a impact on the outcome of the two thousand eight election you know because if you recall\nSharp payload just got nominated and they were showing some signs of life off the pale and bounce and then all of a sudden you had this this this economic downfall where it'll lead to Morocco bomb iconic coming back up in the polls Obama and Biden and that's what happened you know the rest is history\nI I think the stock market's definitely going to be a factor\nI think that Trump weathered hurricanes cheated pretty well you know obviously the hurricane two weeks ago was was was really you know really bad but\nIt didn't it didn't result in a nuanced type situation so\nI think these are the things that that I think will be more of an have more of an impact on the election then the any of these these so called pseudo October surprises or anything like that I Do wonder though what ... what do you know if the caravan does make it it does sustain itself to be something that gets people out the vote\nRight well we need to talk a little bit of a state raises the governor's race in particular and will do that if you can hang on whether this\nWill

another after another after another Democrat politician received a bomb in the\nMail a poorly put together pipe bomb that did not detonate nor do we know if it was even set up to detonate at the information we do not have a but just to give you guys run down yet again Hillary Clinton received one at their ... home\nThe Obamas receive one ... and nobody ... none of these people that the bombs were sent to ever ... near the bomb this was all it gets screened and all that kind of stuff ah George Soros Matt was from Monday that's when this whole thing started and then the floodgates open today\n[noise] Eric Holder had one cent to him but it actually ended up in Debbie Wasserman Schultz office because Ford of the packages that we're aware of\nAt a return address of her Florida headquarters so the one that was supposed to go to Eric Holder has a bad address on it and so it got sent back and then bomb squad on that when all that kind of stuff you also had reports of Kamala Harris receiving one\nAnd uh they're even reports that the White House received one but those reports turned out to be false and then as I mentioned earlier Andrew Cuomo claimed he got one and that was also a false as well or the FBI is saying that uh they are not ruling out more bombs\n... will be discovered they don't know but we're keeping a close eye on this to see what happens CNN as well received a package with with the least\nOf white powder substance in it with other recent bomb is well I don't know ... or ... that was they were worried about anthrax without\nOkay well in terms of the people who had one cent to their homes and I'm not trying to be naive I'm just asking honest question I mean how public knowledge is that these people's address I can get your hands on okay you know I mean I just don't know if that was difficult\nBrown and now it it's not going to be\nA do you want to hear the broadcast from CNN once they ah they hit the alarm bell it we don't got a nothing

the FBI says that they were functional how significant [noise]\nIt's significant that that wasn't just a hoax then the bombs are capable of exploding they're capable of you know inflicting bodily harm or death on somebody so that's more than just sending a hoax just to get public attention the equivalent of pulling a fire alarm like maybe somebody just did and you're building a but if it sort of both of devices\nAnd little did he know there was actually the very package that they were talking about they went to other people\nAnd is there more than just a a an idle threat or something to try

it's the same people that if I a Muslim guy scream in a ... bar and waving a an ISIS flag took a box truck and ran over twenty people in New York City we'd have to wait until the investigation must complete before going it terrorism\nYeah he because think of all of the ah a chair at ... in the eight years of Obama\nAnd after every single one it was the same thing with even your station would cut to Obama and the first thing you'd say was old enough was don't rush to judgment all Muslims are peaceful we all know that\nThat's been brush with God we don't have to hear that I mean a up that Obama during the campaign trail right now but he's not saying that now is the after this act of tear no and I say active\nTear this is fake fake fake the only thing they were missing more the fake blood and

of them aren't bad and think about him but still moving Roger how are you\nAre you man thanks for taking my call or two\nTwo quick points I wanted to bring up a and they may have already been brought up so apologize or if show but first one is\nYou know to the number of packages that went out and a single back um the reason it I don't believe that it would be somebody on the ride is because they don't go overboard whenever they shop and they're much more pointed this change like this will be attacked the left right it was too many packages chicken like\nYou don't go overboard whenever they do something they're much more pointed distinguished lecture will be attacked the left right there was too many packages secondly I'm at least on all the pictures that are on the Web such today there was something that I saw that was missing the packages which was the\nPostal cancellation mark over the top of the stamp\nRight well yeah I wouldn't even as soon as either well the thing about the ... or did they I Can't remember what was said about it well on anything and\nWe know the one at George Soros his house was hand delivered\nA largely other ones I I'm not the problem is is they're showing a package on the screen but we don't really know\nWho's is who's who's except for the one I think that by the one that went to CNN 'cause it was addressed to John Brennan we've seen that one I've seen images of that one I don't recall if there was the the cancellation post are not right but there are ... that I don't remember one\nWell and you know keep in mind to these were sent a first class mail they had the American flags stamps on them and you would say the poster mark over every one of those 'cause there was about in\nA gym stamps were placed on the package but anyway I'm just my thoughts are I Believe it's a false flag advance to try to uh take some of the focus off the fact that\nThe caravans are being exposed as a you know a terrorist meals right\nWell not only that but I mean who would send all of these through the mail and then randomly hand deliver one unless there was more get along\nWell and and what's weird is that no one was hand delivered happened on Monday the rest of them that were mailed showed up today\n... almost the same time seems really strange why would you take the risk of hand delivering something like that it seems like you're risking exposing yourself\nUnless you know it's not going to explode yeah ... yeah cool\nAren't for taking my call guys\nThanks Roger and ah we're not promoting that theory or anything we're just giving our\nOur uh our theory about what it could be I mean we have we don't have the evidence to say that\nWhat Rogers talking about is true we don't have the evidence to say that it's true that it actually is a an act of terrorism or some crazy I don't know either way we'll know either way but what we do know is we can't seem to wrap our minds around this whole thing\nAnd get any of this to make indie kind of sense Christie is next how are you Christy\nI'm gay and you know good yeah I think that if\nThe one they wait until the end they and it was it turned back ... Phil how did she get the same day everybody else's\nOkay well that one that went back to ...

over his furry friends development\nThe man felt as though something was wrong with the pooch as he was behaving oddly and did not run like a dog ... perplexed by the issues he took the social media to seek advice people were quick to point out that the small black creature with large ears in short legs was actually a bamboo rat\nA rodent commonly found in southern China has their name would reveal the rodents feed on bamboo and can measure up to twenty inches within eight inch tail\nOr they also carry disease causing mold and are sometimes used as a food source in China shocked by the

Providence starve to death and that's not a it's not a puppy that's a koala bears [laughter]\nIt's a rat pack rats and fortunately I didn't spend that much money so it all worked out and it's\nA tree

you on TALK about\nThat we have not found a job you know we had it so that's pretty much been the whole show and really uh the\nThe the the consensus from from listeners are from everybody has been calling the show was exactly what you just proposed not saying that that's what you believe but everybody feels that way it seems like because none of this makes sense\nIn ... with the fact that all of them you know arrived to their destination almost at the same time none of them exploded even the pictures of the the bombs don't look to be consistent with an actual explosive device um even the pictures that we do have we have to ask ourselves\nWho in the world is the suicidal camera man that decided to to get up and close to bomb and take a picture of it well it was still in that\nWell I didn't I don't want to be a horse or anything but I like I said I just got into the truck that kind of struck me as yeah\nWell ... well I find out more about that in the coming days and have no doubt

know that uh they're ... they're only chance of taking power after this mid term is going to be the victim because they're not winning on policy things are going good and the economy people\nIn their only chance of taking power after this mid term is going to be the victim because they're not winning on policy things are going good and the economy people like the way this country's going and when you're the party out of power in the party in power is doing an all the things right\nWell you ain't got nothing to offer that point so you didn't have to put yourself in the victim status but as you said my\nThey've always played the victim and yet it's the other guys that are looking like the victims so they've got to find out and find a way to get the focus back on them being the victim and not the Republicans\nStarted pushing toward underdog story of America loves the underdog always I always Yeah John just wanted to point that\nYou know and that's a that's a very good point Mike I appreciate it it's like ah you you talk about going to the prom for so long you get ... you you have the big lead up to it you're you're all excited about it then you you got to draft son ran and got
