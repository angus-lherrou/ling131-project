are to hear this because Amazon employees a whole lot of people across this country\nA\nTwo hundred and fifty thousand people across this country as a matter of fact a Democrat to one Fifteen dollars an hour minimum wage so badly have or have been largely quite\nAnd that's because that's Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage does not count in their eyes and only counts if it's\nGovernment mandated instead of just building\nWage does not count in their eyes it only counts if it's government mandated\nInstead of just building up the economy to where companies are forced to because of the market to pay Fifteen dollars an hour because they're making money and they want the best employees they want to\nOr they want to invest in as much money as they reasonably can into their employees so they in fact our competitive right in the labor force and they're getting good workers\nWell and I even heard that JC penny had to go out and they're offering there's a bunch of different companies that are offering different incentives whether it's you know a higher base pay or you know whatever I Can't remember the other example they listed\nBut they're having to offer incentives because they're finding out that the economy is doing so good it's harder to get these entry level positions filled to they're having to like you said up the uh the base pay 'em the hourly rate to that\nCan actually get people in those jobs you know ... exactly right and I'm a little bit of a a little bit more\nWinning how about the Dow Jones has jumped more than a hundred points to a new\nAll time high

to five percent well and it uh it's once we get through you know Obama hangs his hand on hidden four percent on a quarterly basis four times in eight years okay that's that's four quarters per year what is four times eight I'm\nThirty two thirty two exactly right\nSo\nOut of thirty two chances he had four percent four types now Donald Trump is looking to maybe hit four percent twenty five to thirty times and I gave it to go in this direction\nDo you think this is why the times has dropped this article about Trump to offset the um the economy does things like we we get the economy news you know quite often so it would seem kind of odd that is the only thing I can figure\nWell the New York times article again it dropped maybe an hour ago at the latest\nIs saying that Donald Trump engaged in tax schemes in the the nineties which resulted in him garnering millions hundreds of millions\nOf dollars they say that he participated in questionable\nTax strategies\nAre they said that Trump and his siblings set up a sham corporation to help disguise otherwise taxable income that came from gifts from their parents\nThey say Trump is also a reported to have helped his father taken property tax deductions would that amounted to millions of dollars according to the\n[noise] the IRS reportedly provided little pushback against the trumps reported tactics during that time according to this report in total they said that Trump perceived the equivalent of\nFour hundred and Thirteen million dollars based on his questionable tax\nDealings at the precise number they also wrote that Trump's

and misdemeanors high crimes and misdemeanors that were fraught obstruction that's another one we\nAre now we've taken this mob crime family and put them in the White House\nIt's nuts though for as in the spotlight as as Trump has been for so long it's crazy that he's avoided prosecution for all of these things for all of these you know\nHe is the most elusive criminal oval\nRun is and I think that's very impressive\nYes it is extremely impressive are the times interviewed former employees\nManned advisors to Trump's father and reviewed more than a hundred thousand pages of documents related to the Trump family business including bank statements financial audit and invoices Trump declined to comment to the times for the story\nShocking he'll take it to Twitter\nOr not talking to the failing New York times I'll tell you what I think on Twitter\nHeavily check Twitter about I mean I literally just picked up my phone to type his name and said because I mean you've got to think he's got to be on this saying\nWell he's a busy man he was speaking in an engagement earlier today and you're going to be in Mississippi tonight another rally but ah no he hasn't posting about this anything you know he says the only reason to vote for a Democrat is if you're tired of winning\nThey're both of them were hours ago guy to retweet that that's a that's good [laughter] yeah\n... oh I Love this president love him anyway take that times story for what it's worth a but it the\nThe only thing that it's done is it's giving the pond and something to talk about the day you can go on and I'll go ahead and predict I have nothing to do with Chris Hayes or Rachel Maddow and how they put their show together but I can already tell you what their show will be from start to finish\nAnd it is this New York times story the fraud I mean from start to finish remember when Rachel man out\nA guide her hands on a tax returns are such a beautiful moment and this guy I don't even remember who it was but he's like\nI don't know who somebody just put his tax returns from from two thousand ten in my mailbox and I don't know I guess with two I Can't remember\nAny comes on there and I it was almost as if Rachel man I had just seen it right before she went on air so she's got this guy on there whether and they'll they're pilfering through this thing trying to have him explain it to her\nAnd she's asking me questions is she ... she can because she's realizing they're getting nowhere yeah and there is nothing criminal involved or anything all they had to hang our hat on was how much money he made that year in there like there's got to be much more than this and the other tax returns\nAre it was a big flop is the best anti climatic moment at news history\nIt was a a a an Al Capone Geraldo Rivera tight\nMay really well now I'm the I'm kinda surprised though that they would drop this story because we're right in the mix of the Kavanaugh south which has been pretty heated and it's gotten very mixed reviews just from you know Americans everyday Americans so I mean to drop this now really and and the throes of what's going on that seems odd I\nI think you may it may be\nCoincidence is your time wants to put on a hit piece but also I think what you may have is the the the media which is an arm an extension of the Democrats right see they are losing the Kavanaugh fight they're seeing people like Joe Manchin saying you know\nI'm an extension of the Democrats right see they are losing the Kavanaugh fight they're seeing people like Joe Manchin saying you know I we we got what my party wanted which was the FBI investigation so once it's over this week we'll we'll go ahead\nAnd you're going to end up getting more votes for Kavanaugh than you realize they're like well there's nothing we can do about that let's just go after Trump will try to change the narrative exactly\nWell I mean it just it maybe it has something to do with that what's her name sweat neck going on NBC yeah I'm really not anybody any favors for that at our view\nI've gone to some audio from that will will play a little later in the show but yeah Michael ... accuser came out he was on a ...\nI mean yeah it's a it's dark yeah that's right he owns her yeah she's an accuser right there the keys are ahead yes um\nShe was on MSNBC last night telling her side of the story\nAnd they had two of them this past Sunday but ah I don't know when the next one as but I'll get with Pamela\nAnd a Russell and see exactly when that is now\nTheir phone number here's here's how you got to get in touch with him I got I got the phone number written over here and I got to go grab a phone number that\nYou don't like stolen you and it just take care of time yeah just to talk about how much you\nPay monologue Pamela Russell because they are very committed to what am I doing good I feel like I'm doing good right now actually I talked to handle all the time partially I Believe that come friends she's a buddy of mine she's fantastic\nThat anything you can just I felt\nThat the strong may well and and that goes to show I got this binder that's got everybody's phone numbers in it and you know then I'll give out the wrong phone number if I don't have it in front of me are allowed to do that but you know I was speaking from heart about handling Russell because I didn't even have more folder look at that\nDo finally six seven six two eighty seven fifty six that's the number two five six seven six two eighty seven fifty six\nThe whole butler tango and I'm On Facebook as well hope butler teams university realty or and or if you can't find them let us know we'll get you hooked up with them no problem at all [noise] All right\nLet's uh\nLet me let me say this real quick is it a little bit of a downer but\nThe suit ... earthquake deal in Indonesia you've seen that I haven't seen it\nWidely reported on and I don't know if it's because it's in the knees or whatever\nBut the death toll is over twelve hundred at this point geez now that place has been absolutely devastated if you haven't seen photos or video from that area or it's bad they're dealing with a lot over there and that death toll is obviously going to rise but\nOver twelve hundred people so far was the last report I saw that's\nA that's a bad bad stuff so that's out\nThere we talked about the New York times article which will probably touch on again but as the\nAnswer the media continues\nTo attack Trump attack cabin on all this other stuff I looked at the stats from\nDonald Trump's rally last night in Tennessee and I like to take these rallies in use it is somewhat of a gauge\nTo get the poles of the American voter [noise]\nWe remember during the two thousand sixteen election Donald Trump was packing up places left and right or even even ones that got shut down I think there was one in Chicago during the campaign where protesters and anti forgot so rally they they weren't even allowed to do the\nThe event I mean just before it was supposed to start and there were tons of people that had to file out there and avoid getting you know mold or attacked by until you for for supporting Trump but\nThe hype was was real during the campaign because the stakes were high it's campaign the it's just an exciting time of of the year it's exciting time every four years that have happened\nDonald Trump is still putting on rallies as we know for random ... random Congress people senators across the country just rallying the GOP and telling people that they got to vote Republican if they want to stay on the track wrong because Trump needs more Republicans in the Senate and in Congress\nIf he's going to get the keep America great agenda done\nNow we're coming up on the midterms and that's why this is so important people are coming in droves they're taken off where they're taking time out of their day they're bringing their kids to the Trump rallies and if we're going to be honest\nDonald Trump\nGets to these rallies and kinda says the same thing he says it all up yet nothing new but there is some good sound clips but it's probably out of the hour he speaks is probably five minutes of the thing is is different than what you heard last\nTime yeah and I'm not I don't have a problem with that I enjoy watching every one of his rallies and all the way through a do it but these people still\nCome and and line up in and fill up these arenas in these these uh you know civic centers and all this stuff\nTo see Donald Trump speak and give the same ... feel that he's doing everywhere else across the country when he was in Tennessee last night Johnson City Tennessee\nThere were twenty thousand people there okay now here's why that's a big deal the venue inside the arena only holds seven thousand people ... and twenty\nThousand people were there than seven thousand inside the arena they had to create an overflow room for people to watch it I guess on the TV or a big screen\nThat had two thousand people in it\nAnd then thousands of people outside that just didn't have the opportunity to get in because you hear Trump saying that some of these rallies do like hey ah we're we're we're working to devise a plan where we can put some big screens outside and for people that come to the rally but\nThey got here too late and there's not enough room for them to get in\nWe can still do or some sort of cause I rally outside and allow people to to even though they're not seeing Donald Trump face to face they're just on the other side of the wall you know yet no\nFunding well and I've heard a guy being interviewed who actually went to it and he said he did not make it into the actual rallies like you said it was so packed out but he said just the the general feel\nOut there people waiting in line and like the the attitude and he said he didn't see any protesters anybody cause and chaos or disruption or anything like that people were holding their American flags and all getting along and talking to each other and yeah I can up friendships and he said it was\nYou know they waited in line for four hours they didn't even make it in there but the reason they states along just because they were enjoying the company of the crowds\nArrives every bodies nice everybody's get along right that's that's what people do that are living in a great country they're in great time for the great\nFor as much as they tried to demonize Trump supporters I think that's a great reflection of what Trump supporters really are\nWell they're just getting along because they're all white supremacy ... suffered out about how much they hate black people while they're getting along there and the rights of ... this is a picture of outside\nNow is this is not Nashville this is not a name name a ... a large city yeah well I'm just\nI don't know what we're doing this is Johnson City Tennessee alright okay down to it I Gotcha\nThis is not this is not Kansas City this is not\nUm you know a a very large city this is Johnson City Tennessee and there's ... those are the people that didn't make it in you know many people are there a lot it's a lot of people that\nInspires me leading up to the midterms because people are fired up the problem that in in convention is out the window first of all everybody tries to compare to\nUp to the midterms because people are fired up the problem that an income mentioned is out the window first of all everybody tries to compare to ... or things that happened in the past as far as election goes and who wins and who doesn't they try to compare it to the past\nAnd that's why they got ... bamboozled one Trump winning the election once Trump announced he was running\nThe rules changed the trends changed you there is no more looking back for a point of reference and this is just strictly in politics when it comes to Trump there's no looking back to a point of reference to say well\nThe Republicans are in power so that means that the midterms Democrats are going to take over the house and it doesn't work anymore ever every thing that we've known to be conventional for politics and what the trend has always been\nIs out the window saying throw the president's house\nThrow the precedence out now this is not say all should get comfortable and say you know Republicans have got it they'll get lazy but it is inspiring for me to see so many people showing up\nTo these rallies and just being overly hyped about Donald Trump and what they're listening to Donald Trump you know when it comes to the people that he's actually there at the rally for the he's endorsing are supporting most of those people there\nCould really care less who that person is right there Republican but they're going to vote for him but the the the reason that has\nSuch value is because Donald Trump gets on that stage and he tells them hey this person that I'm here for you need to vote for him people listen to Trump as long as he's doing the job he's doing right now he continues to do that\nHe continues to win the trade war he continues to win on the economy he continues to troll the the the last in the Democratic control the media\nPeople are gonna do what he says when it comes to who to vote for I'm telling you\nIt's just it's a it's a good ... we always talk about the the depressing stuff and the downturn in the cabinet accusations all that kind of stuff\nJust you know no matter how crazy things seem out there and the craziness coming from the left there is a reason to be excited\nAbout the myth terms and again that's not to tell you to get lazy or not to put forward to your best effort in and making sure not only you get out and vote but your friends and family you're talking to him about it you're making sure they're doing it\nBut it is it is a is a hopeful side it is a of an inspiring sight to see so many people excited and involved in politics\nThat were there at that time\nThat was at least well that was politically motivated targeted GOP members that are less than his pocket\nAdolescence pocket all this comes [noise] and then we see all the ... that the random people average citizens

was watching the the actual interview last night uh\nShe threatened him after they broke up a endless following him around to the point where he wants to get a\nA restraining order and it got so bad that it day even canceled restraining order because it would just bring up attention more and they they just moved to change their phone number ... and he wasn't married at the time he was apparently a they were having a child but at the time it happened she still pregnant\nRight a street so was it that they had a daughter that they don't they hit the woman he was going with a was having a baby and they got married\nThat right in fact yeah because there were some comment about to have you ever want to see your unborn child alive you know some of them some I don't remember exactly what was said\nBut ah yeah he he made a very clear that she was a ... oh yeah I guess we can say bat is crazy a little nutty\nNutty as a peanut bar\n[laughter] that's right or a score altered yeah for for that or\nYou know there was one of the thing I Want to break up um regarding flake or this guy I think he's been playing both sides against the middle a I think he is trying to get your point and if he thinks he's going to make a run for the presidency what she did or didn't parents up in\nVermont recently or your aunt your race it laid off and kind of I guess getting a feel for that if these cruise around any longer than he already has\nHe has he got a chance and\nHe does he better a better way as well go ahead what is a Democrat because there isn't a Republican around little touch\nHim are you talking about Jeff Flake yeah Jeff Flake or well he's not running and that's why he doesn't care that\nWell he said well there's he went up to the answer it made it appears there so there's rumors that he may be making a run in twenty twenty\nOr I don't know I I don't think he can I make\nMy already committed political suicide now\nRight yeah I'm with you on that are dying buddy All right\nUh I don't know I I don't think he can I\nJust I think when it already committed political suicide now right\nYeah I'm with you on that are dying buddy All right let me move over to Steve Steve how are you\nWell just a question a public immigrants [noise] uh\nI think some people are yeah but uh that's going to be people that are in the tank for Democrats already because they have this fear that have been stoked by the Democrats that Brett Kavanaugh is going to do all these things take away rights takeaway abortion whatever\nSo they they are scared that this guy would get confirmed and even though in the back of their minds they they realize that these allegations these accusations it's highly likely that they're not true\nThey're cool and go ahead and playing along with it because it's it it's a you they've got the moral high ground because they want to stop Kavanaugh because Gavin I was going to ruin this country\nSo really they don't care if it's true or if it's not or if a woman it's been a victim or whatever\nHe was released for two weeks in August to prepare the house for cell and apparently use that time to be the trap his house for anyone to try to buy or sell it seemed legit
