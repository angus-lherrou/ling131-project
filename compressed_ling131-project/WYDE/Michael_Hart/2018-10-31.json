old time's sake two oh five nine four one one zero one one again there's lots of news out there but it's just one of those days it's Halloween\nUm you know unfortunately we worried about this being a tank and there's some sort of Halloween prank\nIt is not [laughter] or certainly it's very real you know the only thing they would have been worse if they if they would have decided to to make this call on on um April Fool's day\nYou know when I made it worse oh All right let's let's go to some phone calls and we'll get jumped port on the other side of this next break and bring down some of the ballot for you or versus going to be or be or be how are you buddy\nMan let's go now I'm In a ah\nAll right well I'm not going to get into out beyond irritated I Do this but [noise] All right good is possibly be I Would say about this 'cause I kinda knew what was going on and not what you see all that a lot of people could this be some sort of like legit because all races are so good about what you talk about they're willing to take you off the air ... regardless of how well do\nYou think it's even George Soros is funding is I mean\nYeah or something like ... or ...\nRadio and I I I didn't know that until I got into the industry radio is a brutal industry I mean it and then a lot of people were like Don Crawford doesn't make a reputation for inside it's really not hand\nUm there was a lot of things that went into this but at the end of the day it's just it's an executive decision that was out of our hands obviously and uh some of the higher ups just decided that it was the the right course to go um\nBut radio is like that I mean it's it can be a revolving door and that's not just for this side of the radio that can be for the cells and everything else is just kind of the nature of the industry and MTV's much the same I mean you go in one day and you never know they might not renew your contract for the next year so it's it's just kind of end\nAs well and I I just want to clarify I learned a lot of stuff about the decision today that I had known up until this point which would have been nice to know this month and a half ago but it's just a sign was going to you know I'm All right\nUm it it's it's a decision that was made by a lot of people and from what I understand and I haven't talked to there are recently I'm Don\nCrawford was kind of the the last man standing in trying to any obvious thing like yeah there but when you got to the\nFinancial advisors and ah what our friends in the ... say radio Gibbs yeah uh you have a lot of decisions made that maybe aren't necessarily the best for a particular station\nYou know I I thought yeah I think there's a little I don't know it just seems to you know I think like they're trying to silence all message that you're either way I don't\nKnow how to do that thanks RV and and what the tense times I get it to you know I Know what I'm saying we're seeing you know you just take social media and conservatives being silenced their topic we've talked about a lot\nIt's time to get it to you know what I'm saying we're seeing you know you just take social media\nAnd conservatives being silenced their topic we've talked about a lot where you know one little flip up above a Fox News analyst or anchor and they tried to take this person out right and not because the person messed up in their own forgiving it's because they want to silence these conservative voices\nA that's not the case here although you do in in this on this platform you didn't have some conservative voices being silenced it's just a a different motivation behind it Josh is an accent where are you Josh\nAnd it was of guys and then as you want to\nCall and tell you guys that are you guys will be greatly missed in I called in for faction while ago and um I said it told Andrea and I I've talked to for before and told him was saying that it it hurts my heart to see you guys go because you guys have become a huge part of my life\nEvery day my radio does not change from one at one point one I'll listen to you guys from Vegas or to you guys and um the gene that night\nSo yeah we uh unfortunately and that's that's another point they make this topic because I'm like some radio shows and I'm not calling you name because again judging by his heart but there's a lot of radio shows out there that just you know they just\nTalk to an audience and they they talk and in the audience should I say but here it's almost like we we do so much interacting with you guys over the phone it we consider all you guys family so for how you guys feel about this whole thing we feel the exact same way and it's it's not a fun time\nYou know and I'm like I said earlier I was praying that uh you're fused to all your guys his future endeavors will be as productive and prosperous if not more ah hopefully ... much more you know for you guys\nWell we definitely appreciate that Josh thank you buddy\nGuy with ...\nAnd that's the thing you know there's a lot of ah there's a lot of faith that goes into this a lot of\nTrusting in God that this is this is taking you somewhere else then is it going to be bigger and better it's hard to see the the forest for the trees because there's a lot of trees right now right in our face we can't see past them but\nThat's where the faith comes in and we just got to it's going to hang on time that's really all we got that's the only that's the only weapon in our arsenal at the moment Roger what's up\nBut as for the ... the best out bad list or this radio ... before ... came on it and a great day just about it they just lay\nYeah and I look at how medical ... favorite show over there I made a lock on its plate you guys ever to get that like the the last ... years ago and call him a guide rally\nBut it got a paper out there and I show all the best I hate to say this happened because a lot shorter lived in a while ago is just ... ... ... ... and I'll hear liberal ... job every day all day\nAnd it's good to hear the other side of this has got to get all the king of\nThe other side and you'd be surprised that it's ... it's in the hundreds of people out there that don't set or ... or ... yeah [laughter]\nWhere are you listening to yell you know where you are right on a call ... house and the and they asked to a vote on now\nAre we listening to talk to us a lot and they asked ... what area\nAnd there you go well ed or Roger it's getting people like you and everybody else and listens to show that it's going to keep fighting to uh\nMake sure the the only information out there is not mainstream liberal media and that the the whole country gets indoctrinated I think we're seeing a change in this country where\nPeople are seeing as those outlets in in those new sources for what they are but it's a it's a never ending fights so you keep doing what you're doing Roger and and we're going to be All right\nAll right well I Wish all the best I Wish you both in our next\nNext year where am I right now going on where you Roger would be nice and take a little bit of this thing away\nJust just a tad what he like your last day you win the lottery I'll just come back by the station and I actually really good by their job that means you the boss\nA but for those amendments do you want to I don't know if you've got a bell in front of you do you want to give us a rundown on on more of the controversial amendments that people will be seeing statewide\nYeah well we could talk about each the amendments any kind of what I think their their purposes well let me say this defined as of this I I think the amendments are are more of an effort to cow to drive out the vote so they they get through the legislature\nAnd you want to have a ... something on the ballot that ... that protest abortion you know the protests to reveal a decision and then the second part of that amendment one I think that drives up to vote but the second part is\nWe have a new record now right so what happens if\nThey overturned that court case well this this will lay the groundwork for what the state's reaction would be let's say they overturn it and it but it's only left up to the states to decide what they want to do on the abortion you know on the issue policy wise well then that that would you know this displaced the groundwork for the legislature\nAnd the state of Alabama end of the voters perhaps to determine what that should be and I think that's the intention of it but I Do think it's a get out the vote means I think a lot of people will come out and vote for that reason\nA and the second the second amendment the one that's really kinda got a lot of the ACLU and Southern Poverty Law Center type saw wild up as this\nTake commandments ah\nThe displaced so so what is essentially what this is\nIt's not just to take a mammoth stirs all these other uh documents these founding documents declaration of independence the magna card or are they seize that we based sort of uh our our our jurors permitted to all these things that make up kind of the foundation for American government\nAnd and wants to make it a you know a ... not not a unconstitutional thing to do in Alabama to have these displays up and so the thing that the truly\nKinda kept us from being a reality in the past is that the state didn't want to deal with the law suits\nSo they just kind of have a blanket ban all Ten Commandments displays they didn't want to deal with the freedom from religion types or or whatever it may be that doesn't want any mention of God in any mention of any biblical reference or anything of that variety\nOn the ballot I mean Alan about but a display the public places like ... or whatever so so what they I I think what this does is\nThis changes this let our house for this changes language to make it you know if if you're a high school Decatur high school or whatever does that icicle you want to have\nThis display with all these documents and you can it would be against the Alabama constitution and where they the I think the part of it that that really appealing to some people they are really out there pushing this as\nWell as say the show you've done sue whatever high school decides to uh exercise this new freedom in the state constitution well\nThere there's a provision in there that says are not going to use public money that pop private institutions will come in and defend against these lawsuits and allow that that that would give the that would put the burden I'll take the burden off the taxpayers to laugh at these displaced so I think\nI think a lot of people say why I think having to take amendments posted in public schools are public places is a is a good idea and\n... if it can be displayed at the state capital where it already is being displayed then why not our schools and I think that's good enough to get some people to come out but\nYeah that's a that's a good point and we'll get aggravated when we see a\nGood enough to get some people to come out the\nYeah that's a that's a good point and ... we'll get aggravated when we see are bound to organizations like freedom from religion\nFoundation and and the others go after I mean even to the point of going after local high schools or you know small towns in their Christmas parades and all this kind of stuff\nAh people get fired up when that kind of thing happens so I I agree with you I think that can get some people out there and vote just for that even if they don't care or they think that everything's going to go the Republican's way or they're you know they know okay I was going to win or whatever the case is\nYou know that could get them out and I I never really thought about it like that to for those things to be put out there and not for the purpose a well entirely for the purpose but just to get people out there or to vote because\nThese turnout they're kind of low what what do you think we know the primaries were were pretty low turnout as to be expected but what do you think's going to happen in this general election\nI mean Meryl always says twenty\nPercent Seventeen twenty percent somewhere in there I think he's been pretty accurate with the general election I think he's\nKind of over shot some of the primaries a this has gotten a lot of media attention it's on every channel it'll be the big story on cable news will definitely be it'll be the big story and broadcast TV [noise] I I think that's probably a fair number I don't think you'll be anywhere near a general election but\nThe the the thing that really hurts Alabama's you said there's not a lot of competitive races in some parts of the state I think there's three or four\nSenate races that could be flew a Democrat or Republican there's one in northeast Alabama uh the the the Andrew Williams or correct for battle for US Senate seat up there ah Gadsden and some of your listeners probably were will be participating in that election a\nAlabama red bay a Democrat Johnny Mack Morrow and Larry ... are are going that that seems to be the Democrats think they can flip\nBecause uh it was Roger Bedford who was kind of an institution in Montgomery for years and years and years that's his old seat and he was a Democrat they think they could flip that back to Democrat ah that that's the other one and now one of the people are talking about I don't think it's kind of flip\nBy just the changes in Lake County with the growth of the changes the demographics and especially the growth at Auburn University ah\nThe the the ... seat down there it might be a little closer closer than usual than they expected the county has traditionally been a solid Republican county\nBut just the way things are growing and it's becoming more of a kind of a suburban cosmopolitan place it's getting it's become a lighter shade a ... there's only two three Senate races everyone is talking about the state line about\nI you know I I Can't see Walt Maddox making a charge a governor you know I think ... got that 'cause a lot of people don't even know who's running against it's we're ... you're wandering the one that might be a little interesting is the attorney general's race would just seeing them and seeing them and ask them name id given his dad was governor and\nSteve Marshall ... they're they're trying to create this cloud of controversy over him that he took money from the Republican attorney general's association and supposedly violates the state's packed packed transfer laws I don't think it's enough for ... but I Do think it's ... maybe maybe it may make some people use about that that that\nThat on the ballot blank or or maybe something like ...\nI I watch uh I still scratching my head Everytime I see these people talking about the dons Eagleman and how he was a political prisoner and all this kind of stuff on just like okay but I I I see what you're saying on that front I could see a lot of these people who were outspoken about\nIt was a political prisoner and all this kind of stuff on just like okay but I I I see what you're saying on that front I could see a lot of these people who were outspoken about that issue still voting for voting for Joseph's Eagleman and are trying to beat out Steve Marshall whether that controversy you're talking about contributes to it or not\nAh I can see that wouldn't be in a tight race\nYeah I I don't know about tight but I Do think you know the name id is not to say oh I I kinda know seeing them and as I remember that name uh I I Know Steve Marshall and the sounds of generic made me a marked about for for single men you know that that that's the type of stuff people do and when they go to vote or they don't\nNecessarily always you know really really bone up on the the the intricacies\nOf it now I I think just by virtue of having an R next to his name Steve Marshall to walk away with it but if you're just looking for any reason to care and see if this really matters I think that race the attorney generation the or the chief justice race\nThe chief justice race between Bob Vance that the office refrigerator guy but a ... [laughter]\nAnd uh uh uh Tom Parker who's kind of against Roy Moore\nSome people think that'll dragging down because he has more baggage but the Vance Parker race is interesting because the trial lawyers\nHave really got me high Vance and dumped a bunch of money to his campaign you drive around\nDown and the gum re or Spring Hill immobile and you'll see Bob van signs of peoples' yards I think that's worth a few verbs I instead of winning by twenty points I think maybe Parker wins by ten but\nThat Parker has raised any money but he still got that valuable our next to his name and really that's all you need I mean I think in Alabama in this political climate running as a Democrat is just really really too tough of a hurdle to overcome\nYeah and as far as an attorney general's race go I guess we should all just be grateful that Troy King name isn't on the ballot right [laughter]\nYeah well that's a Detroit king seems to be hitting the he's he's kind of leaning toward a a voting against Steve Marshall or with a ... there is a\nThings going on with the attorney general's office over the last twenty Thirty years just the way gambling is in Alabama and the way gambling walls are enforced interpreted what's a game of chance you know all these things what the poorest Greeks are doing what the porch Greeks want what they don't want all of these people trying to pedal\nIt ... and that's you really determine what kind of gambling is legal through what the attorney general does the governor can say whatever she wants but at the end of the day the attorney general's the one to kind of gets to be the top law enforcement officer and enforce these laws\nNow that the porch Craig now this is only interesting to me that specifically because I remember when I worked with Scott obese and he had a caller\nYeah uh I I think our pass or cross again in the future I'm sure you got that right I just thank you buddy I Try to me I\nMean you go ... you can find his stuff on Breitbart you can find it on yellow hammer news he'll still be pumping out the articles to make sure you show him some love as well our number two coming up next to all five nine four one one zero one one yelling that [noise]\nDo you want to do them Coleman W why do you um Birmingham W two or three Seventy ...

yeah just because the time slots and I was gonna fail you are the producer at that time right so it wasn't like these to seem like they would do good together was which just this is what's here so we'll just put him to get to see what happens and then that don't line was born after that\nAnd we've had a a run that we've had a lot of fun with and I know you guys around a lot of fun as well so it really really sucks that uh this is one of three shows remaining for the line and\nKnow like it so we can actually you know what we could do we could deal with things that my ... when do like a walk back at the ... you have a Facebook never mind was found another way\nI like y'all on Facebook a long time ago\nI told somebody to do it and when you all were trying to get like twenty five hundred or whatever mhm I handed somebody my op ed and I said like them on Facebook\n[laughter] told me out already done it so [laughter] that's pretty good\nAnyway so on the ... thing\nYou know ... ... actually I'm radios great shares this great it is and and the you know the national guys they bring a lot of good stuff frankly I can read the news stories and consume a lot more information than I can get listening to them look better\nBecause number one you all talk about national and local but number two I get to hear ideas from other listeners okay right and a lot of times\nYou know either the things they say will directly impact or it'll trigger made to think about something in a different way okay\nAnd I you know I to me when I have the choice between listening to XM and a serious and\nY'all y'all are on my radio yeah oh I just I get more out of it now to things while I was on hold yesterday you had a gentleman call in while we were doing the word things and pronunciations mhm

guy that\nGave him something to think about for the rest of his life by saying Fifteen of 'em in the poll was monotonous yes I\nThink about the times angry Kerry would be laying at the laying in bed looking at the ceiling if the guy had told them it was monogamous\nOh no that is ... that's a little weird that's much different\nHe'd be trying to figure that one out even more so ...\n... ... and

weighed and all of them were wrongly decided\nAnd I'm a strong supporter of President Trump and his efforts to put more conservatives don't our federal courts the leftist mob doesn't like that\nThey want judges who overturn our laws and look the other way when the leftist mob tries to destroy our side to this is justice Tom Parker\nRepublican for chief justice I'm asking for your vote to keep Alabama's court someplace where the rule of law was respected and not where the mob root for the\nFor chief justice mock celebrity tweet to Montgomery three six one one one [noise]\nHDTVs Eric ... you

together and you know Donald Trump\nWe are your whole tone God and country ... super station one oh one nobody Whitey\n\n[noise] really me\nTo really go to the ...\nAnd [noise]\nAnd they really\nReally well then you can think Samantha for that she requested it oh did you yeah I oh hang on to crank back alright [noise]\nTo go\n[laughter] oh God I got a few others I can plug in their\nKeep that they can get by on let's see my friends a man or a a\nA Jessica put together a little video just to kind of a thank you guys that will post right after the show at six o'clock it's an either or on the Facebook page so outrage posted on my personal page too and I'm sure Jessica will do as well\nUh but yeah just kind of watch it's got some old clips of eyes just being goofy and and having a good time\nUh and just it it's just a simple message to let you guys know how much we appreciate jail\nI or back to the phones to five\nNine four one one zero one one up next is my man\nSomeone that you guys know how much we appreciate you all night or back to the phones to oh five nine four one one zero one one up next to this moment murder murder of how are you\nI'm doing All right yeah it's kind of one of those bitter sweet type things it makes me think of like transferring from one duty station to another and you're leaving behind your buddies you know they're still out there and you know you're still go to Jay Jay that you'll see him again\nBut I I gotta say probably the worst thing is is I'm not going to be able to hear myself anymore\n[laughter] right [laughter] well that's going to be above\nSo this is more personal for you ...\nThe replays of other people's shows where it gets back to my phone call 'cause I call every\nDay and I haven't promos made fun of me me making fun of obese and and yeah just just having a good old time ah\nWell you can contact a Donald Crawford and save hills salesman rose and ... and therefore you went to the station James\nYeah there we go that that is right in the middle of all the which my understanding is it's going to be the uh ... content\nUh yeah and that was a little bit of a few changes I yeah that's that's what\nI understand which I'm not really an informed enough to speak on it but I Believe that they will take this and change it from there'll be why do you eat the W. acts Jaycee up they're changing the call letters yeah\nUh well yeah I follow everybody on Facebook and Twitter and I've got on my Facebook follows what you guys set to see first 'cause you know when you when you follow somebody like somebody's\nIt sets you up to follow them and you can go on follow and ask you if you want to follow them just you know the fault let them slow into your timeline or put on them to see first right so the important stuff I have is the first\nSo I get my actual conservative stuff you know you're up there with Trump on the seat\nFor man's good place to me\n[laughter] but um you know what this election real quick I have I hear all these people complaining oh I don't\nKnow straight party ... ... for this election why not\nThere's nobody exciting doing anything\nYeah unless you want to change up on some of your local stuff because in Alabama you know you've got some local races where there may be somebody running on the Democratic ticket that's just as Republicans are the next guy but as far as the state wide stuff\nUm you know with what's at stake and I've never been the person to say vote straight ticket I'm I'm perfectly happy and comfortable telling people for this election and we'll see what happens next time vote straight straight Republican ticket I'm good with it\nI I just we're at a point in this country where it's too dangerous to vote third party for anything in my opinion so\nBumped out of the basket and anti thieves\nPilfering [laughter] that's a that's a quote from the description certainly in line with the other ones but\nBy far the best item they make is the decorative keys and coat hook that's in the shape of a goat\n[laughter] perfect Christmas gift\nFor Jessica [noise] oh my gosh I Need to figure out the name of that company and that's\nExactly what you need up next is Reese and Reese says Andrew Trump wants to end birthright citizenship\nBut millennia had an anchor baby so we'll her child have to go back to when it came he should be more careful about what he wishes for hell end up with no wife or kids and then what\nWhat I don't think that you know what's weird though it's hard to say that\nCounts for barren when his other parents have been a citizen of this country from the start right I yeah I don't know we're not going to talk about that well in what's been brought up as the fact\nThat uh you know if you come as a a female or a female male duo and you will legally enter this country and then you have a baby after that\nYou're maybe doesn't automatically get citizenship like there'd be a process and I'm just I can break down the constitutionality of it\nOr you know whether it's right or wrong or Donald Trump or be able to do it by executive order is a different story but between right and wrong you're oh you're real warning people breaking the law that's all right now could we put a process in place in our immigration system that's in ...\nYou're oh you're real warning people breaking the law that's all right now could we put a process in place in our\nImmigration system is in shambles to to allow people to gain that US citizenship of course we cut and I think we shot\nBut we shouldn't just automatically give people citizenship because they were born in this land we're only one of two developed\nCountries that do does that and that would be Austin in Canada anyway I'll I'll break that down in a different time we're having a a moment that are having a minute don't ruin it and I want to make sure I get your phone calls in here and I know we're probably ruined a lot of people's Halloween\nSo we apologize for that but we're going to give you guys the stage or during this episode of the line up first is Derek Derek how are you\nA pretty good guys so I got to say I'm going to miss you um what I haven't heard is that why they give you guys are reason why this happening or just they're moving in a different direction\nOr it's um the the reason we've been\nGiven is a financial reasons or a better opportunity to make money for their station ... in a different direction\nUm with the exception of somebody cutting the Seventy five thousand dollar check to a month a month to station yeah uh\nThat was actually said to us for bad unless somebody wants to cut us Seventy five thousand dollar check them on will reverse artist says embattled think that's going to happen\nRight so the the crazy part is I don't know I like to hear my voice on the radio I call radio stations right and other another person that I call in the morning ever had a busy line never once you get right in\nYour putting a cue to go you guys there'll be an half an hour we're all your lines are full yeah I mean and Ford I I Love for brown I Love the show and he's gone ever heard of them are from him in a while so I saw him on Twitter ... to the quiet but uh\nAnyways I just it's really heartbreaking I finally found a show that local that actually cared about yeah yeah you guys are often you know going around but\nNot all the same way I feel the same way it's been rough\nOh bless you guys in ... you know you put up a look forward to see what you do next\nNow he thinks they're settling can't wait to find out what that ah [laughter] yeah and as far as Ford goes\nUm you know he ... he got the word obviously in and got to into a position where I think he might have gotten another job offer outside of radio where\nIt was more beneficial to him and I hope you don't mind me putting his business out there but then he got to let you know why he didn't why he disappeared or he had to take that opportunity so he kind of exit early and that's why you hear Andrea ties and others as of the last week or so\nI'm doing the the foreign faction and they'll finish them out as well but you can follow everybody on a\nSocial media and he is a big day if\nHe uh he tax me and he said I don't\nWant you to know my Twitter handle is at big Dave Rich\nAnd you better tell people about it so you don't do me a favor and this is big Dave's very own shout out\nAt big Dave Rich on Twitter go at him and keep up with a staff he's doing 'cause it just won't be the end for ah for big day even though his fate as a friday is the same as the rest of us a big day will be out there DJ white chocolate making things happen so\nAre still moving on up next is going to\nMarry or we don't have a ... of I don't know if you gave me a five year like I was ...\nUp next is going to marry or\nWe don't have a ... of I don't know if you gave me a five year like I was going on oh Adam\nHey I talked to a for just the other day oh did you yeah he asked me if I wanted fries with that you\nKnow gee well we'll do that I had him [laughter] I'm just\nKidding I think he's got a pretty sweet gang or I'm not gonna give any details on it because it's not my business to put it out there but I think he's got a pretty sweet gig going on\n[noise] well I've been listening to the station and calling in for at least five years and one of my biggest frustrations ah over the course of time is just as soon as you get attached to a host or they're gone and now the whole format is going\nYeah well I I Know I Know that feeling because I'm I'm a I'm I'm really not that far removed from being a listener myself of talk radio and a lot of talk radio and and I felt like I went through the same thing where it was like you finally\nFound after searching searching what's your ... up until that point you just had to listen to whatever there was to offer and and you didn't necessarily love the show but you liked it enough to listen to it then you find the one show you really love\nAnd as soon as you get attached to just go yeah\nWell a career wise or I've been doing fine for years but uh or during the financial crisis ... I found myself in the same exact position that you're in now\nAnd and this could be any professional it could be an IT worker who works for a Disney it could be a radio host\nYour professional one minute and then you're\nScrambling around trying to find a job that pays eight dollars an hour\nRight and one of the biggest issues that I've been calling in about four or five years has been immigration\nBecause when you find yourself in that position you realize first hand you experience you yourself\nHow wages have been driven down and you see exactly you feel it for yourself the decisions they make in D. C. exactly how they affect you you know all these politicians who have sold out America making these are terrible\nTrade agreement agreement NAFTA a [noise] a TPP it cetera\nAnd it forced so many good manufacturing jobs out of this country because when you find yourself in that position oh you think more than willing to uh [noise] go work in a factory for Seventeen dollars an hour right I ... I was fighting to try and make eight dollars\nAn hour well yeah and it's easy to overlook those things and say they don't affect me until something tragic happens in your life and you're in that position then you do like you said you realize firsthand how that stuff of facts American people it's\nWhen you got a job and everything's going good it is easy to just dismiss people that are in the position in that position you're referring to\nBecause you can't really connect with um things are good you got your job you make money but then you get put in that position and you quickly realize hey ah the welcoming people in here with open arms that really does affect the people in a giant enormous way\nYeah absolutely and speaking of jobs I Hope in the next couple of days that you bring on Russell and uh we hear from him or what he's going to be doing in the future\nWell ... ... and then others don't change arousal but I think I Am going to bring him in today maybe next\nNow he's got a pretty sweet gig on our sister station W DJ say\nOkay good deal and Andrew you're always encouraging all of us to ah get on to social media are you ... you know I'm never going to you\nGood deal and er Andrew you're always encouraging all of us to ah get on to social media are you ... you know I'm never going to use any of that stuff now right however I I'd like to encourage you are to sign up for gap\nAh I I think the c._e._o. of that company is absolutely outstanding I I think it's one of the only social media where you truly have free speech so I I Hope to a contact you on there some day\nYeah I'm going to look that up I have a lot of time on my hands so I'm a sign up for four or five accounts that sounds like a jet\nBecause because of a censorship I Believe they are they're currently deep platform to I don't think you can even get on but the c._e._o. has sworn that he's going to bring it back\nYeah and you know that yesterday and an article\nI'll check it out Adam I appreciate a buddy good to hear from a\n... one more thing one more thing okay I've loved your show and I'm going to miss you guys\nKnow brain Mann that means a lot there's a there's Anna Jones monitored by so sweet today show and show in love and appreciation where am I going next but I gotta I gotta take a break here in a minute so let me just keep rolling as far as I can Michael [noise] yes yeah hey now\nAnd my personal personal or something that the effect of one and a half and it was really really\nBad and that that means a lot now because of the kind words but just because you remind us as some of that stuff it out and remember that yeah I Want\nTo end the Bush nine four one one zero one one our number three coming up on the other side don't you go anywhere [noise]\nW.

I Can't share them in my private circles but with you and Jessica I can share them and so I'm saying is you're going to want to block me but don't blocked me let me read well let me call you know and so now I'm starting\nTo think of an idea we could have like moments with Russell ... and it could be like a Facebook Live video maybe where once every so often we get together and you can just get on there with us and right and I mean just talking about ... and you know I think the stories told about\nShaving that this and then send that that they the Yankee Candle and the guy if\nI ask you
