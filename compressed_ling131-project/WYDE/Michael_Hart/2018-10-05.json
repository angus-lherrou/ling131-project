[noise] it's just that is a silent phrase\n\nYou know\n\n\nOf\nHey no ladies and gentlemen welcome to do a very special a friday edition of the line Andrew and jets or go with you\nAnd while what an hour\nIt has been\nAnd are you guys have been listening to some of the stuff transpire while we're on the board\nFaction but while just wow\nI don't even know where to start we just wrapped up watching Susan Collins speak on the Senate floor for about thirty minutes or so or ...\nJust wrapped up watching Susan Collins speak on the Senate floor for about thirty minutes or so I mean do you ever to I'm just guessing it that\nSpeaking for about thirty minutes and she laid out her case for why she is voting yes on Kavanaugh that brings the votes to\nFifty fifty\nThat support Kavanaugh and will be voting yes after that Joe Manchin immediately after that Joe mansion\nReleases a statement says he will in fact be voting for Kavanaugh as well as of right now he is the loan Democrat but that moves pass the tie breaker stage which would go and Republicans favor so there are two points\nThat wall culminate tomorrow in a vote to confirm Kavanaugh but ladies and gentlemen it looks like a done deal and as I told you guys you can expect justice camp at all\nOn the Supreme Court this weekend with the help of water more Democrat votes you have done at least one so far and it's got them sending at fifty one that was\nRiveting although was slow at times and was a little bit along side it really gives you some perspective on how slower government works because we're all just waiting for one word one word to come out of Syria Collins vowed we had to go through all that which is just started reiterating stuff we already know\nAnd I she she just wanted to lay it out there I mean it wasn't a bad speech I I thought it was great I thought it was probably the finest moment to in Susan Collins Senate career if I had the gas\nBut it was thrilling nonetheless and here we go Saturday's the data morals the day it's going down a protesters still continuing to go crazy on Capitol Hill as you could assume\nHave you talked to and stays in college I went to let her yet ah ah no I have not but I I've\nSeen some I've seen some tweets coming across my my timeline and I've been responding to people now my Twitter blowing up because I have commented on a few people sweets so now now my ... notifications stopped\nGoing off all the main theme of what I'm getting is that ... because of what she said I'm went in and sexual assault survivors are now understanding that their voices don't matter that's ... s quote precedent that was set to right\n\n\n\n\nNow the question is being asked and as you said Jessica what bad\nThings can happen over the over the next twenty four hours\nWith their hanging in the balance I mean they've shown that they\nThey ... they they'll pull out all stop their mailing to do anything I don't want to project that anything bad would in fact happened but ... you never know I mean it could be as bad as a a\nCar accident or oh God\nOr\nIt could be as bad as Jeff Flake getting pulled into a room and convinced again to to be a no\nNo you much like all the rest of his locked in a room there in the White House you think they're going to pull him in a room right and just go at it and when he changes his mind\n... by how you remember Seth Rich\nYou just saying oh no well I did hear that the uh the amount of threats that the Republican senators have gotten as above and beyond anything they never seen before oh yeah threats against their family death threats all sorts of stopped and um that's well that'd be a tough thing to be involved in\nThere is no doubt about it so uh again the court or this morning fifty one forty nine that went on to the debate going on in the four senators announcing how they're going to vote tomorrow Collins is a yeah it's\nA man genetic yet that got him at fifty one it could go even higher than that\nSenators announcing how they're going to vote tomorrow Collins is he has\nA mansion at a gas that's got him in fifty one it could go even higher than that now that the pressure is off now this would be the perfect opportunity which I I don't I\nI Hope he doesn't because I don't think he needs I I don't want him to have any political points because of it but it would be the perfect opportunity for Doug Jones to come out and vote yes the outcome is not going to change\nNo matter how he votes so you might as well trying to save your bank side here in Alabama and vote yes I don't think he'll do it I don't\nThink I don't think he will either but you're right he's got an opportunity to kind of safe faced with Alabamians anyways\nYeah he should do it but I don't think you will and I hope it doesn't cause I don't want him to save face he needs to be gone from needs to be who he is right be you bro BU but the thing is that even if he did vote yes it would be disingenuous would see right through it so\nUh so there's that there's also been the talk of a senator Steve Gaines who is an obvious yes vote and has been a supporter of Kavanaugh from the from the beginning\nUh he's got a little bit of an issue because his daughter's wedding is\nTomorrow yeah I heard about that and he can't really miss that well sure she's only getting married ... gets married was you know public service has about sacrifices here we go\nSo you can just bank on the fact that you probably get divorced and then get\nRemarried and you got to do it again last and envious and he said they're going to have a plane on standby at the wedding\nStill why why take a chance I mean this is perfect opportunity for there's way over the plane to go down in the fiery crowd\nMy gosh you know and it just so happens that you know Hillary Clinton was was it the airport before they took off are you know meeting someone on the tarmac\nRight Bill Clinton meeting somebody on the tarmac mundane plane crashes\nLet's hope that don't happen\nUm speak at ... and that happens around here I think it really seems to\nUh anyway so another aspect of this and by the way to oh five nine four one one zero one one coming to you guys here in just a minute or is the protesters\nAnd what we've seen I've got several audio clip don't want to play of people are senators being approached in the first one that comes to mind is Joe mansion\nAnd this woman and I think she's a woman she says she's a woman who really ... when I get\nA question or gender or I don't want to see emerging okay well that's respectful actually it looks like a duck and you know yeah I've heard that before or\nShe approaches Joe mansion in another infamous elevator moments and starts telling him how can you not look in my eyes and tell me that you're not betraying women\nIt's it's pretty good here I'll play it for you this is a Joe mansion in a hallway getting in the elevator [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nSo she goes on demanding him tell her how he's going to vote and he says he doesn't know what I was going to vote at the time but I Wonder if that chick fil stupid now since ... the womb Democrat to vote yes was\nHe does know as going to vote at the time but I Wonder if that chick fil stupid now since ... the moon Democrat to vote yes was the guy she approached in the hallway and got all up in his face\nTrying to get his elevator I placed the blame on her just to drive her crazy or another one\nWord protesters in front of Mitch McConnell's house\nAnd they were all drinking PBR and chanting chug joke joke joke\nIn an effort to maybe ... cabin on or something how beer I got it now they were all chugging beer or drinking beer in front of McConnell's\nSince home I think it was his office there oh it was his house it was his out they were sitting in front of the house getting drunk\nOr ... well it was like eight o'clock in the morning\nAnd I don't know how much alcohol they were consuming but it was all part of their protests here's what it sounded like in front of McConnell's house\n\nOr does sound like a board you know and um or a mile law where\nThey say what do you do with a drunk injustice I think that's what I heard then they started marching down the street and chanting joke joke joke\nAnd you're talking about a wild party how about ... beer in front of Mitch McConnell's\nOut I mean do they really think that's going to have any sort of effect I mean he doesn't care\nI don't know but my my favorite one was at war and hatch\nWho was also approached by women in the hallway\nAnd he was ironically trying to get in an elevator I don't know what it is with these crazy women in elevator\nIt's because they have nowhere to go that's why they do and I guess so anyway they approach Orrin Hatch and he basically tells them to to grow up [noise]\n\nThey keep waving his hand you know why you're handed me out with him I had the euro\nShe must have come from Mitch McConnell's house from the McConnell party\nHe just kept waving wherever it is and that and go back I was like get outta here get grow up get on a man I Love it I Love this\nAnd I'm not saying I Love ... ... ... white men telling women that they don't believe they been sexually assaulted because I'm going to be honest at this point with ... with the way these women are acting I don't care if they'd\nBeen sexually assaulted because that's not what this is about [laughter] wow this is I'm just saying that that's not what this is about ... I mean it in a different instance a different setting maybe I can say I care that you've been sexually assaulted I'm Sorry that happened to you so on and so forth but you are ... harassing people\nThat have done nothing wrong acting like animals really putting their safety in your safety at risk what are you going to do one of these guards pops out of uh\nAnimals really putting their safety and your safety at risk when he goes they one of the guards\nPops out a a a forty five and puts a hole in your huh\nIs it me too movement worth fat is protesting for however however much Soros paycheck was was it worth that come home because come home then or something we talked about yesterday\nAnd that was me saying that\nIt's it's about time and again I appreciate how the Republicans are finally standing up but it's it's way past time for them to stand up and call out these protesters for what they are\nTo say what they are say they are paid protesters by George Soros and others I said that yesterday on the show we pulled audio if we need to\nAnd then my man DJ T o at six am this morning tweets this\nThey're being paid rights and you think about it if they don't get out there and act cronk they probably won't get the ... if\nThey don't ride low in dirty then they're not getting rehired\nAnd they'd probably I mean there there's gotta be some incentives you know the crazier you get or the more in like a bonus than you get a bonus or you get a raise for the next protest or whatever\nI bet the ones that were present in the elevator with flake right before he kind of seem to flip and and change his mind about they got a little bonus\nNo yeah you know they did that and that was a woman that was the Hispanic woman that was the same lady yeah oh okay that was her\nAnd that was the clip that was played over and over and over and it was contributed to it it was attributed to flake going over to say I want to be on\nBut now are you surprised at all that she's admitted this because I'll be honest I'm a little bit shocked that she would out or so I mean is it because there's some paper trail and she knows\nWell yeah there's ... there's articles out there that actually they've looked at the records as far as the play she works for and how much the world's money has gone into that organization it's all over the place but for these protesters\nYou can directly die that stuff to Soros mhm All right let me get to go then to Ovide nine four one one zero one one brandy as first tower you brandy\nI'm doing well how are ya good\nCalling I'm I Am a sexual abuse survivor myself when I was an adolescent I was at the family member um when I told my mom and that they sent me to talk to the district attorney who basically in my face called me a liar said that it never happened I was like non maybe\nI'm not parents had to then go hire a lawyer to have anything done\nI'm ... this whole situation it\nOffends me because the law didn't want to hear what I had to say it's a child it's women like her that like false accusations\nThat make it so much harder for people like late and it really did happen says yeah and it's not fair I mean you just not at all they are and I personally feel like it when that like the falls that you say oh sorry false accusations right should go to jail I mean I really feel like there should be charges brought against us women\nI I agree and I said because it's it's it is a I'm against the law to follow faults police reports so much like that it should be against the law there should be some penalty in place\nYou're at and they just don't realize what they're doing to the real victim\nYou know and it especially kids and you know the age of nine years old I didn't even know what that stuff what yeah and when I sit there and told the district attorney exactly what happened you know he just like my faith in it right in my eyes to call me a both face fire and\nIt it just that destroyed in the end to this day to this very day it bothers me every single day in my law\nYeah I ... in ... and I had\nJust had to fight so hard for someone to hear me and it's because of people like her\nAnd and to see people like her post this whole thing backwards for for women and I mean really bad genders but women in particular um it's the same thing with with people attacking Susan Collins for her ... she says she stands up for me to she stands up for victims but she's ...\nIt's the same thing with with people attacking Susan Collins for her ... she says she stands up for me to she stands up for victims but she's voting yes on ... well yeah because she's got brandy the attitude that she can see that as for what it is and she knows that it's actually hurting the me to move yeah\nTo to ... and allow this political hit job to go through it's hurting the me too movement it's it's literally holding our government hostage and setting precedent for a very ugly future in our government\nSo I'm Glad they put a stop to it Randy I appreciate it thanks for sharing that well yeah that can we can yes ma'am you as well Jim is next week a gym\nWhat me say this to liberal ... feminists should add baby killers\nWe have what each rash Catholic man going on to the Supreme Court that baby killing in our country is going to come to an end and after that\nWhen we get a need I don't know Roman Catholic weren't going to ask do birth control and I'm going to tell you something else\nWas coming back to our country bringing us back to I was in the Nineteen fifties is going to make everybody\nMuch happier much more prosperous and you should just celebrate the fact that we live and what presented is on the Supreme Court sort of the Roman Catholic religion than anybody else may be Catholic\n[noise] All right Jim thank ... Catholic I think that the song by the way they happy the Catholic that one don't worry because they kept saying that it was ... I don't think so it's a way I remember\nA anyway it it just ... those are those are good points and I don't think it can be stressed enough to this Susan Collins votes in the heat that she's getting I haven't looked at tweets to her as you have Jessica\nBut I can I can assure or I can I can be well aware that they're nasty\nThere early yeah they're pretty bad there\nI'd probably plenty of death threats in there because if it's against the conservative Twitter let them fly a but it cannot be stressed enough or how much Susan Collins with this yes vote has helped the me too movement\nYeah and has what how they realize that are annoyed and it has helped\nSave our democracy has helped us to stay away from mob rule and stay away from\nThe government representatives senators being able to call the shots on who can and cannot be on things like the Supreme Court the same thing\nThe same exact scenario\n\nAllowed our government to choose who Alabama had as a senator and coordinated ... job with Democrats across this country with the Washington Post and others\nGave them the power to decide who is going to be the senator from Alabama that's why we have Doug Jones that's also why you've seen such drama ensue over to this Supreme Court pick\nWe could have been well past this you don't think Roy Moore would have been a vote yes\nOver this Supreme Court pick we could have been well past this you don't think Roy Moore would have been a vote yes vote all the way through I mean\nListen I mean especially if he had been um elected after all the allegations oh can you imagine if he had at even any chance to speak on that\nKnowing all gone through the job but now there is he is really more have a Twitter uh no I think so that I don't say that I think I Can't say your music and and again I I like to stress ever\nDone more and more comes up I'm not a Roy Moore supporter really ah I was during the election because it was him versus Doug Jones and even more so because of the political hit job I saw from a mile away\nBut he definitely should have had that seat and not Doug Jones or just thank the good lord above that\nThat didn't happen again in this case could you imagine how we would feel today and my gosh if Trump had to make the announcement that he's polling Kavanaugh's name and having to select somebody else can you imagine\nAnd then think what would have happened to that nominee right that's exactly right of course I probably would've been a woman and then I don't know what they would have done but I'm\nNow with the way the left is losing their mind over this whole thing it is important to note that there will be attempts to uh after confirmed poll Brett Kavanaugh off the Supreme Court trying to impeach him off the Supreme Court\nThey've already stated this\nBrian Fallon has come out they down what who knows if they can pull this off they'll find some they'll find something they'll go back go find twenty more to stop they go after Clarence Thomas again yeah just fire that one backup yeah\nThe Marlboro last today and they will lose tomorrow so the protesters can scream their little hearts out all they want they can have a meltdown melting snow flakes Mike they did the day Trump was not\nRated whatever it is I just hope it's all caught on camera back after this we just saw\nWithin ruined Jessica\nWhen you fear that a storm has damaged your roof your first call should not be to your insurance company it should be the legacy roof contractors you want your roof inspection down for free by certified roof inspector that has an established a relationship with your local insurance adjuster that is how you will get the most for your insurance claims fast\nLegacy roof contractors is here to serve W why the listeners and their families mentioned W why D.

went on W. widely any rain or some other song [noise]\nBut no one ever say someone on W. widely a day or so or the song no as\nA that song is just kind of warm me down over the years over the years over the two years\nOr two oh five nine four one one zero one one Andrew Jessica and a guy you heard just an hour and a half ago the one and only Russell pie the man from down the hall I\nDidn't get to listen to any of your coverage\nAs you filled in on the foreign faction again today um but opinions on what's gone down\nI think Jessica can bounce I predicted it I think it went down just how I said there was no I didn't actually I Do that [laughter]\nAnd tells me that is a lot so in the twelve o'clock hour Alice gig down and excited about how things were going to go it kind of felt like a game day one o'clock I got nervous sing that Susan Collins is holding a press for not press conference but a public announcement\nI was worried that you become crashing down it didn't she laid out the case sick quite well as to why she was voting for him and I was thinking about kind of the contract so it didn't go as I worried it might but it's like Lindsey Graham gave you the emotional coverage to vote for Kavanaugh this is is it an outrage is terrible\nAnd then Susan Collins took her time giving the logical reason that really the only vote is a yes vote that that's the way to go so I got a little\nAntsy 'cause I wanted to get to the point where we are joining the audio and it's like All right all ready to get to get to get to it but I think looking back we will we will think of\nOf Kavanaugh's real bottle of those accusations coupled with Lindsey Graham his emotional response and kind of finger wagging the Democrats and then Susan Collins her kind of a detail to walk through his\nCareer and look at those moments combined as to what helped push it over the hump so I think that uh at this point as schizophrenia give my emotions can be I'm feeling pretty good\nI think a Susan Collins speech was the best thing the best route bottle if you will since Lindsey Graham's outburst again a couple of Chuck Grassley ones\nThat I like to think is a from yesterday or the day before they were doing a press conference and the Republicans in the Senate We're we're speaking to draw reporters\nAnd he just let some of 'em up like he was so far to he was\nFired so here's my thing is I Try to speak to those who disagree or with two my critics I think Chuck Grassley you can if you're not a Republican you can eat at a given angry all white man whereas Susan Collins was not angry she was not so\nPassionate that she seemed on hand she was very logical it wasn't a motive emotional if she was long winded like a book or out of Jersey but she actually had things to say that a values so yeah right I was impressed\nWell uh I'm I'm excited to see where this goes you got one lone Democrats do you predict that they will have more than one Democrat voting to confirm Kavanaugh tomorrow\nYou know I think if I I think you will have Democrats who might want to but won't have the courage to do so\nBecause it it's a situation now and it's really the way Joe Manchin went about it as well he didn't want to be the fifty a vote yeah he wanted to see what Susan Collins had to say because I I feel like he was going to vote yes the whole way through not the whole way but at least after the FBI investigation\nUm he wanted to wait for Susan Collins may have even got confirmation from her that she was voting yes ah and have her now that before he came out with his famous because it was immediately after the speech was over he went ahead\nBeing yes ah and have her mounts that before he came out with his famous because it was immediately after the speech was over he went ahead and put it out there they ... him as the fifty first yes while that fifty first yes\nDoesn't matter if if the vote stay the same as they are today they go and do the same thing tomorrow um it doesn't matter because you've only got to have fifty and then my parents is your tie breaker for fifty one starts and cover it does it change the outcome of the votes\nIf Joe mansion votes yes or a votes no but after hearing from his constituents in in West Virginia he knows he's dead meat if he votes no if he feels he can appease the Democratic party and say I'm only doing this to save my backside and it's not affecting the outcome\nThat could possibly happen with other\nReddish state Democrats but I don't know I I'm not willing to make the production than another Democrat comes over but just because they're ... they're all ... it'll make no difference if that Democrat who thinks that's what their constituents want votes\nOr I mean that's a possibility you think of somebody like Doug Jones was smart he would obviously vote yes now because again it doesn't affect the outcome right and again keep some of the people in Alabama happy I don't think he's going to do it because I think he's an absolute idiot and I really hope he doesn't do it because I don't want him to getting brownie points from anybody [laughter]\nAh but it would be smart for some of these people to do it and I guess that's the question do you see anybody else doing that [noise]\nI think uh my predictions didn't not and I try not to predict I was just kind of had a gut feeling and it didn't play out I'm pleased with the way it played out you're gonna feel hot yeah into Josh and they're saying that there have been it was a forget the friday ... probably have the ... here's a question\nI have every time you fill in on for show and I come in here and you've got food somebody's brought you food and I'm like well yeah it is I I'm over here putting in hard work on his microphone Russell comes from from one day right brain and put it [laughter] what is that I needed and Hungary\nWell and and it was Andrea ties and she made a point of saying she wants to make sure Russell knows this is not something that will continue\n... I'm not going to continue filling in unless they get mad if I'm not mad you know I Am Andrea tight we heard it here you could corroborate it might not do you think Andrea times has got beef with me and that's why she has no for me and he\nHad enough or ... I don't think so I offered me beef but [laughter] I think it's a timing issue you go in there at three and she's probably not anywhere to be seen other benefits because we call or chicken fried ties you know if anything you think that inspired by you say right or at least a reminder\nWhen I think if you Andrea I think the food\nWe did tell her that we thought she can be Dianne Feinstein for Halloween I probably won't be any more time on that but what you said on the ... the easier to that's what you said there are and you're getting food not me I Would never have said that after he eight to ... a\n'cause you know even you know when I was a kid you know you you you had Democrats and yet moderate Democrats and Republicans and they would argue about a ... a few things but\nThere wasn't nothing compared to what like what we have now and which is just extremism on both sides\nOf the norm for a nomination or or confirmation of a Supreme Court justice would be like\nNinety Ninety to Ninety five votes in favor of the justice you know and that lately going now\nIf we could get back to that you know that would that would be great uh but I don't I don't know how to get back to that uh you know Joe Manchin came out and uh he's really not a Democrat at all I I think he just kind of got caught up and being a Democrat there for too long\nYou think they got some dirt on him I you know you know I don't think they've got some dirt on him I just think that he's been a Democrat so long and you just don't realize that he's been the wrong party\nDown the hash tag along the way\nYou know that party um that party that hate belong to a it's kind of like the parties that are Susan Collins belong to originally when she became a Republican that those parties don't exist anymore yeah\nAnd um but you know you know he he came out because he looked at a fax and whatnot and ... which is important when you're thinking about you know putting someone in the highest court the land you need to go off of facts and a judicial a opinions and ruling\nRight well even going to the allegations the accusations\nAnd a judicial a opinion and rulings\nRight well even going to the allegations the accusations are ... you had these guys are looking is facts and they became enraged while looking at the facts because they realized\nThat this wasn't just a matter of mistaken identity or you know Democrats standing up for women 'cause they're so notorious for that\nThey realized in the middle of this ... it was a political hit job yeah and that's why Lindsey Graham started acting the way he did that's why Joe Manchin\nHad to to come to grips with the fact that Kavanaugh's an innocent man and you know the rest of them that the bank bones that we've seen is just from Republicans realizing what that whole thing was and it was a hit job\nWell and there was one thing and the FBI report and I don't know what it was but that that Kennedy got cameras not his first name the Republican senator right from Louisiana yeah he was on um MSNBC this morning and then they reference says some remark he had made about how furious he was over some parts of the FBI investigation the results of that background check\nAnd he wasn't at liberty to expand on that but I've I've kinda heard from other sources to that uh there was something in there that kind of exposed the fact that this was a hit job but I don't know exactly what those details are if we'll ever know but apparently there was something in that report that showed a shed some light on\nThat why Feinstein was crying when honorably Marymount yeah\nLeader Trump does have the power to make that document public which I really wish you would\nWell all in good time yeah you know how Trump and yeah just given given\nWaited without a baby in a bar morning ... up and throughout this whole process you know I I tried to date politicized for a while but this this this cat without hearing was just too much and I had to enjoy it\nAnd it's like a a like a a shot back it just sucks you right back to that really does politics\nI I'm really disappointed in Cory Booker because it the first shift just local career I kind of had some hopes\nAnd it was almost like the same hopes that I had for block Obama when he first started going All right well you know ... you know I we disagree on some key issues but maybe he can you know do some good in ... and he's become a partisan hat just like\nHe's like I'm only like a mini Michael ...\nIs he is he's a dark night yeah\nAnybody disagrees with me about that they can call Robert on his\nPhone on their way will uh will get that number out there for you Jeremy I'm pretty sure the buddy\nI got a job of going Cory Booker is like ...\n[laughter] he's like the black ... All right I'm Still moving Jackson's next Jackson our you\nKnow how\nTo stay in one place so that was actually the Jackson Jackson back the train out body actually can't hear you you're probably going to try to stay in one spot\nOr pull over a ... year less than ... yes\nIslam for thirty seconds to go to break it's like a little on the ...\nI go listen to the accent I go to break when I Want to go [laughter] you just tell me what you need me to know\nAll right Jacqueline thanks well that might have something to do with it [laughter] [laughter]\n...

I'll be out there tomorrow\nSo if you ... people have y'all are you'll see me up and say Hi make me feel important aware my last year just to make sure you'll spot me getting autographs ... yeah\nAnd nobody wants them milder graph or just because I kept coming up next segment just to make a couple of points that we didn't get to yeah there was a a\nSurprise op ed that was released last night from Brent Kavanaugh did you see that I did actually\nYeah he stresses in this thing that a a good judge must be an umpire a neutral impartial arbiter who favors no political party or or policy and who is not swayed by the public swayed by public pressure\nUm he says my hearing testimony was focused while I'm Sorry was forceful and passionate that is because I've forcefully him passionately denied the allegations against me\nAt times and my testimony both of my opening statement end in response to questions reflected in my overwhelming frustration of being wrongly accused without cooperation\nOf horrible conduct completely contrary to my ... my record and my character my statement and answers also reflected my deep distress at the unfairness of how the ... has been handled\nHe said he was more emotional during the hearing that he's ever been in life and that he might have been too emotional at times uh during the testimony due to the ... and violent threats that his wife and daughters and been faced with\nAnd on the past few weeks she said I Do not decide cases based on personal or policy preferences I Am not a ... point of or pro defend that judge I'm not a pro prosecution or pro defense judge I Am pro law\nSo it was his way of coming out and saying you know for the naysayers that saying I'm some sort of political hack\nAnd then I'm part assume that can't be a judge for that reason you got it all wrong and you came at me and try to destroy made me my reputation my\nFamily and anybody else if they actually love their family would conduct themselves in the same way Kavanaugh did if not\nHarsh and I was going to say I think he was fairly restrained I mean he did ...\nActually love their family would conduct themselves in the same way Kavanaugh did if not more harsh\nAnd I was going to say I think he was fairly restrained him and he did cut loose a few times but considering the circumstances and what he was being accused of I mean especially a ... it doesn't matter if you're a man or woman the accusation brings the same but I'm just saying\nFor him and his position and all the years of his reputation can you even imagine what that would feel like well it can't\nWin for losing because remember in his testimony or I'm Sorry not the testimony but that interview he did with whoever it was more of the ... strain and Bream whoever I Can't remember um they said he was too mild to robotic and didn't seem genuine enough\nThough when he first\nResponded to the allegation right so then he comes out swing and Clarence Thomas style and it was like oh it can be a judge look at him as a madman\nTelling a part of the same thing and you can't have it both ways either to robotic ...\nSo that came out also another bomb shell came out or in the wall Street Journal that said that wheeling Kaiser the friend of\nChristine Ford\nTold investigators when the FBI came to investigate this last time\nThat Monica Micheline who is a retired FBI agent and they've personal friend of Christine Ford had urged her to clarify her statement quote unquote clarify yes\nNow we know Kaiser leave when Kaiser is one of the one of the three witnesses in addition to Kavanaugh himself allegedly who um\nFord claimed was there they've also all denied it remember she said leave and Kaiser Health issues and that's why you know she couldn't corroborate\nWell and she said it as though she had mental health is she right implication\nSo apparently this this\nMonica McLean who is a former FBI agent and dear friend of a Christian\nFord went to\nCleveland Kaiser and try to pressure her into saying that\nThe ... that actually happened that that the party happened that the sexual assault happened and that she could wind up with Ford story\nA retired FBI agent you think about all the links we see in this stuff yeah the least of fusion GPS now a former FBI agents or is this FBI agent the one that conducted the or the polygraph\nBecause think about that remember she said it was a retired FBI agent that the polygraph well does that mean this is that person and I made to tell me about that that person who gave you the polygraph them went and pressured and one of the\nAlleged witnesses wow that's deep and that's why I think at this point after\nBrett Kavanaugh gets confirm the FBI must investigate Christine forward\nI think they should investigate it I mean and for good reason I ... that should not be\nThat it should not be said for that you can make these allegations against him to the point where it it got to the level it dead and then she's able to just walk away nothing else happens and you know what not just her but anybody else that was complicit and as we've got to put a stop to that are just gonna keep happening just take that report\nYou can consider wheeling Kaiser being pressured by former FBI agent that was a friend that Dr Ford's to changing her story the fact that Ford says she was given a polygraph by former FBI agent and if I had the gas is probably going to be this McLean like I'm sure it is she's refused to turn over her therapy notes\nShe was given a polygraph by former FBI agent and if I had the gas it's probably going to be this Maclaine like I'm sure does she refused to turn over her therapy notes or any sort of documentation from the polygraph test\nWhich is very questionable it's curious because she was really inserts injustice why wouldn't you turn over every single bit of evidence you have that support in your story\nThere's still a lot of confusion surrounding the way in which these allegations were first reported and then made public\nAnd then the fact that Chuck Grassley last night sent a letter to Ford's attorneys asking for the third time that any relevant documents they had needs to be turned over if they want a fair shake at\nThis thing and guess what they got not a zero zilch\nSo at this point I think we have no other choice then\nTo have the FBI investigate Christine
