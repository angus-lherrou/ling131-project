this point it's really important people in that a lot less than thirty five minutes a problem I was cut short because actually\nWhen that show comes on the line just run commercials off our ... by the way I guess I could go ahead and saying this is Gina Redmond had her final show but if this is what's what's pressures about this whole thing\nGina had her final show\nOn uh last night yes you know the news hour with Gina Redmond so now that she's gone well were taken the first hour hotline process that'll be great but I got the first hour the line and playing it replaying it from six to seven which on any\nWell we're taking the first hours on process that'll be great but they got the first hour the lie to him playing it replaying it from six to seven which on any other normal day would be fantastic some you guys get off work at four or five o'clock and you don't hear the first hour\nSo you didn't get to hear the first hour on the back side of the show but as you see this we're\nGoing to planned well maybe I'll send a little note and see if we can get the first hour yesterday [laughter] playing that\n'cause I don't think it'll be good that's good or play the last hour of yesterday or something like that you know I don't know I don't know what was good yesterday nothing matches this radio I'll tell you that right now\nOr what was that this is this is a radio host worst nightmare because Everytime I okay I'm among the third time talking about the pre maybe it's just about every time you try to bring the story if we go up there in the point to be\nBringing it up he's looks like he's going to be headed back to the U. S. but what caught my eye on this whole thing\nWas coming from MSNBC you know Chris Hayes who's on it like he's I think he's gone from seven to eight or something like that [noise]\nHe sends out a tweet or no I take that back this is not about the Turkish guy the preacher this is about the Saudi reporter from Washington Post and the rumor is and we haven't talked about the ... that he\nWas the uh the the\nThe pilots or whatever they call that thing is and they they killed him I haven't followed this story great well and we don't know for sure\nWe don't know what happened we just we got video him going in and and he never came out right and so\nAnd they had a they have audio of him being killed\nTheir claim in the Saudis killed this guy because he had a beef with them used to be a critic of the government and all this kind of stuff he he used to work directly I think with the uh cram friend ... or so we've got ties but then he went on the backside and criticize him and all that kind of stuff and then ended up giving the Washington Post reporter\nSomebody thought it was an idea to send them over there I guess to do some more reporting and now he's disappeared\nWhat what I heard was he actually was there to get a marriage license because he was about to get married and he's not an American citizen oh he's still a Saudi\nWhatever resident I guess that's what your citizen of Saudi Arabia right so he had to go in there to get his marriage license and apparently they knew about it or something that this is reporting that are hard\nAnd so once he got in there they kind of had it all set up to where they are going to take them down and then they just number down and took his body out in pieces allegedly allegedly nobody knows for sure and of course Trump's getting a lot of criticism for not\nComing out against Saudi Arabia but nothing's been confirmed yet\nGoal in for guys if you remember back in your early twenties when you would get married they would compare that to the government oh rights you know a sort of like the right one of the same ah that's too soon I Apologize I'm Chris Hayes\nFrom MSNBC amid only give you the tweet that he sent out about this issue he said it would be nice to definitively rule out that the Saudis are paying the president massive bribes in exchange for a approval for murdering critics\nSo he is suggesting that it's possible Saudi Arabia is suffering Donald Trump's pockets with money so he will look the other way when they\nMurder of critics of their government wow such as this guy\nDoes is under the guise of well it'd be nice to rule it out but nobody went to this question right or really grow really\nWell and doesn't Trump path I mean there are some ... they played on MSNBC this morning where he had made some comment and this is way back when he was like a love the Saudis they paid me money all the time I got I got hotel there or something right or isn't it deals with okay well that's what he's talking about so he's like of course I Love 'em and so they're taking that from way back when and then throw the\nHe's got a hotel or something right or those deals with okay well that's what he's talking about so he's like of course I Love 'em and so they're taking that from way back when and throwing it into this story and so it's something\nHe sat at like yesterday ... well that's not true and the the the insinuation as what to do anything about it because he's got such a good relationship with these people in a financial mess that ah well in in another\nUh aspect of this thing is the fact\nThat we've been rebuilding our relationship with Saudi Arabia we all remember the footage of Donald Trump dancing with the guys with all the swords yeah as you mentioned Saudi guys dance around with their turbans and that was a nerve racking you know let's say that's our president\nHe's in the middle of all those guys they're swinging sort yeah I Know nobody seemed to care and then he's dancing around and they're all holding the orbit together and it was a\nIt was a coming together and it really well and we ... all of\nFrance and now here we are now I Can't predict whether or not this will strain or put a halt to that relationship I Would hope that the assumptions and the reports that we have about what's happened to this guy or faults\nBecause you would have something like that to to be the\nEnd of the relationship or put our relationship back where it was yeah strain but at the end and not to give these guys a pass on it but when you deal with those kind of governments when you're dealing with the middle east we know that they do this ah yeah it just so happens\nThat this guy was considered an American even though he didn't have ... and ... he was a writer for the for the Washington Post so\nUltimately we consider him one of our guys\nSo that uh it's it's a different ball game when they murder one of our guys opposed to one of their well\nIf the Turks really do have the proof that they claim they have why won't they just released said they should but I mean what's holding them back I mean if there's some kind of political move that they're not are they just hoping that the store and get out and make us look bad and well don't understand\nThere when it comes to turkey there's a lot of different political angles with with a lot of different countries for me to act like I'm educated on the relationship between\nWhere the political relationship between turkey and Saudi Arabia I Can't really speak to it all that much I Know the U.S relationship with Saudi and the U. S. is relationship with turkey\nBut I don't know what the disconnect is there for them either they're talking smack or if they do have it why they're not given that I have no idea but that's something definitely to watch that we'll we'll be keeping our island back\nTo hurricane Michael before we go to break\nA I saw a who was it Bill Nelson on Twitter posed this link in a tweet that was\nUrging people to donate supplies in money for hurricane relief and I I didn't think much of it I'm like OK but Bill Nelson and bill Nelson's an idiot but he's a politician they did is kind of stuff's especially when it's his home state whatever whatever\nI go to the link and it's not a standard donation thing it's actually his campaign page what where you can\nDonate not just to the hurricane relief part that he set up but you could donate to his campaign as well oh yeah a little too far [laughter] it'll move to first so you go on there you think you're going to donate supplies and you end up on bill Nelson's reelection ... can you imagine if Trump that that\nUh right they would lose their lines also another link on that page takes you to\nThat Soros funded website\nAct blue which is an organization put together to is exclusively elected\nWell that Soros funded website act blue which is an organization put together to exclusively elect Democrats across the country so\nHe's gone and this is nothing new for Democrats we all know that they fund raise off of tragedy and whatever else whether I a a a mass shooting and gun control and they campaign off that that that the cabin all stuff they tried to raise money out that they do it anywhere they can\nBut it just seems like these people need to be\nCalled out for this stuff once and for all because I ... if they continue to get by with this stuff [noise]\nLet it slide complain about it but then just forget about it once the tragedies over with the the the the donation\nProcess has done there's got to keep doing it of course there's a real backlash are consequences involved to keep them from all over again and they aren't going to be excited about this but we're going to try and talk will Kanye West side of the only reason I Want to talk about this is because\nWork apologized but were tried it for the first time I ever go\nYeah that's not gonna work that sounds really good on a definite script while I'm gonna try this out the little for yeah All right now we do to show that you just have foreign\nWinging it I can barely hear it but just barely well see if we can get the volume there no that's a trend now that's that's that's again okay well\nDon't know ... we'll figure it out at the brain\nCause I can barely hear yeah I don't think anything else when you're what's your what's your sense that it's not worth it was everything will be a lot of land this is the first time I ever tried this yeah\nYou know and I'll take my headphone Jack up like when you're on the one side just wiggle that court I think we have of course they are good I work out OK\nJak okay let me just tell you what on limits that he goes through any talks about how this is a a circus or see\nIt's not just embarrassing for Americans for the ... for African Americans in particular and even brings up Kanye West dead mother and says his mother wouldn't be so embarrassed and rolling over in her grave\nIf she could see her son at the White House acting the way he did\nThe funniest part I guess as I was listening to Gina show last night and everybody was getting on there and talk about Kanye and whatever else one guy called in and I can't remember who it was like he literally sad\n... F a dear friend up Kanye West mother and she said I'm Sorry he knows somebody that knows calling us his mother Brian and he said he got word that Kanye West mom was completely embarrassed by that I watch Kanye West\n\nI think that and we're back our we have no idea\n\nJay ... your ...\n\n\nRecently on the Michael Moore show drivers or even my ex wife she rose\nRaises a Silver Spring or miles before it often times the Ayatollah Khomeini race and she throwing the dishwasher and\nI'm like I'm ready to throw around homeland breast cancer and like I mean I don't buy milk\nAnd free you know\nLike an hour for me to look in the dishwasher necessarily know that sleep and\nLet me stop you there travesty here why for your ex wife\nSwap hotter OK okay\nYou know much of my house\nFor a\nLong haul\nSuperstition one on one\n\n\nSure\nSure restriction on nobody wanted\n\n\n\n\nAsk you\nWhat are the big time today just yeah\nJust the way it is a great again the promos outcome\nAll all we know uh I haven't figured out if if we don't end it messes up again that\nJessica is breaking out I've got the magic paper right here and we're just going to take all of our equipment yeah and that's going to fix it take all the wires that will draw fixes everything I don't even know what kind of papers and if I\n\n\n\n\nMove forward structurally\nOver the past year the horror factions fought for ... for the\nStraw with what you've asked\nUs what you have in your writing for foreign saw a corrupt log into reality t._v.\nShows like the beginning when you're off the statue of nice soft C given me something I could\nPut my she said I can give me something that I can watch this man has\nGone because over the past two and a half years to watch the economic job develop\nIndustries that true America houses or maybe you should say look what he's getting a job on weekdays new\nHampshire for ... what do you argue\nLaw\nRemains ruined ...\nContractors phone company capital the airports are gone tomorrow hearing stories company you know for your insurance claims contractors insurance\nOn experience they argue first free election by calling five six takes three eighty three next year for free you belong to come along and you were already on line that you see\nReminding everybody to join us on the best\nReminding everybody to join us on Friday nights from nine until midnight on the best in high school football school\nWill have special get coaches interviews and take your calls and get you ready for your college football Saturday\nRight here on your high school football leader in all of Alabama\nRazors to the surging way\nLooking into drag race central never Saturday morning from six to eight slamming locals regularly section and schedule from your local current\nRemember six to eight every Saturday morning right here on superstation one oh one on one\nOn a Sunday that new for insights with Bill Wilson right here on super safe from one oh one W why do the\nHay trust will thanks for listening superstation ...\nHere super station one oh one we're committed to bringing your quality program and that has a formative as well as a matter of paint\nSend us an email to feedback have one on one W why the dot com and let us know when you say thank you for listening to the super station one on one\nNeeds someone to work out where we'll spot you wish you could have lunch with somebody and really cool we'll go to lunch with you and not to do with our bill with the W why super station and you can take with you will have to go\nIn and out of town and we'll go with you ban or you're sitting in your cubicle all alone is not any more we'll sit down with you with a double wide these super station and we are with you all day every day\nIn your bones app store just such good W.

Oh yes we do look ahead and talk about this All right guys there's a Fox News story that I just found this was published and just three hours ago a personal trainer\nUm has gotten his overweight clients intentionally banned from fast food restaurants because he says quote obesity is telling him I'm\nThe trainers name he's trainer and Ohio and\nWe had that whole show about names yesterday this is Mike ... his client is Darren McClintock and uh apparently this guy behind every year every year he takes on one pro bono client he's like a really well known trainer so everybody kind of got together and said hey you need to take on this guy I'm Sorry no\nEvery year he takes on one pro bono client he's like a really well known trainer so everybody kinda got together and said hey you need to take on the sky I'm Sorry no you're not there and the client talk his name is I'm OK yeah it is it's\nJust his nickname is Dixie gypsy did the um and he will not disclose his weight but when I say in large I mean I think if you go to McDonald's and you get a fry will you move up you get a supersized dry right this will be the super side of the super size fry like he is a very large person so\nIt was a guy makes a super size fry with small oh I mean you and your two guests are made on the weight\nUh I watch my six hundred pound life enough to know he ... he he is crowning six hundred\nEasily um he's very large and so in order to help save this guy's alive 'cause I guess he's gotten addiction to food clearly and so he ah he said he's so big it's a book two seats on a plane and he had to order especially socks clothing\nOr he said he struggle with his wife and she was a teenager so and he can't stop eating ... hasty well pay sees Kris friendships hey how you see is like that's what it says bases I don't have to tell people or he likes the highest paid fees craftsmanship\nAdult I used to use it\nIt probably means pastries and they have they have accidentally left out the are and what he did but it game risk of bases route in\nFront of the bases are gone so uh anyways where you from again well it's got to be somewhere in the u._k. I'm guessing because they say when he when they caught him he said seeing my mom's reaction a mom is usually something you've only seen in the u._k. man you that\nMeans that hasty is the u._k. smack\nWell and that that very well could be the cable cars from your ah of course I'm it's that they've been working together for a short period of time you know what you lost some weight but\nHe went around and and made sure that these fast food restaurants wouldn't not serve this guy and he's got these little flyers it says said this to be part of the obesity is killing him and then it simply says at the bottom do not serve this may and now it's got a picture of the trainer and did see together in the flyer\nSo I guess he's put these up on his hind\n\n\nOver totally off the market

when you're stuck in traffic and Iraq as one two three miles ahead it aggravating that you can't see what happened under staying because you really want to know and then by the time you get up there you have to hold up traffic because you're like I just invested in an hour and a half of my life into this traffic jam right I have to see what the cause of it is\nYou know there's nothing more irritating that then when you've been in that situation when you've been backed up and traffic it's bumper to bumper and you're sitting there for\nLike forty five minutes an hour and you finally get to the scene and nothing's there now and it's like them it's like a fender bender yeah if if I'm going to have to wait for an hour I Need there to be at least a car on fire and I don't mean someone in
