like we were doing depressing news site I Wonder if they feel the same way well sure because we still laugh in the middle\n... yeah even extend it for free and we still laugh\nHow about a Fox News was having an amount of stuff going on I think it was a out numbered or whatever\nIn a in the middle of it\nSome where they were cutting up and laughing or whatever and Matt Drudge\nGets on twittering gives them the one for really says oh yeah it's so funny you know is so inappropriate the jar laughing and all this stuff and I was like I\nDidn't get to watch the whole clip and see where the laughing was place where I Know that stuff can be taken out of context and they weren't laughing at that particular story but he wasn't happy about it and he rarely tweets and when he does he believes in like a day later so\nIt's a was bizarre Robert is next hey I'm surprised\nYou haven't mentioned the of armed robbery that was foiled in Birmingham\nSaturday McDonalds yeah I'm going to be talking about it I've been talking about anything you know a ... are\nYou know of of our of you know of a scary for you know armed citizen or took the guy out over the people in jail\nRight at injuries you know that that should be the right up there on the front of the news mhm oh great everything else that's\nWell I got a three hour show rounded up to us to take care of this stuff and the\nThe more they know see the problem is those people were defenseless in the synagogue yeah there was no one there to look there's nothing wrong with have honest people that are are\n... you know I don't know it's All right they're already starting to come to pray mock trial even though he hasn't said this to my knowledge anyway saying well you know he's going to come out and say armed the rabbi and I thought well is that really that crazy you know\nWell it's not an for oil off the oil and we live I live\nA lot of never saw where God set for us to be the fences pray when that when it when Jesus as a disciples came to him when I was coming there getting rough you know what he told them don't arm yourselves you said go by sort they kind of leave that out or you know we gotta remember\nOh we were never supposed to be as a ... mile built rebuilt the wall fed a sword in one hand and and we're and we're building the wall of the other\nRight well and in fact they're\nMere Robert I appreciate it I'm going back to Jessica what you just said\nWith Trump or he he did say in his initial remarks to reporters\nAnd he was getting on a plane to head the Indiana on Saturday or Illinois where every was going\nOr he did say that if there were armed guards in the church than he could have stopped this from happening or minimize the damage that was done right ah but ... that's\n... as far as that comment went and a lot of how do you hear it as much has taken it in and ran with it and the media it's really bothered me watching the medium watching the Democrats act as if they are champions for\nUh the Jewish faith who are Jewish people I'm Talking about the anti is real media the anti Israel Democrats are the ones that really stand against Israel or former\nAdministration was the same way it's just the Democrats him oh they favor the the the\nAnd against Israel or former administration was the same\nWay it's just the Democrats him oh they favor the the the Muslim countries in the middle east more than they favor actual ally in Israel Israel which is the ... the size of New Jersey surrounded by twenty other Muslim countries that are\nA hundred times larger than the state of Israel Israel who's been over backwards to make peace with these people and all these people want to do is get all\nThose people that the media and the Democrats are all of a sudden champions\nFor the Jewish faith\nThen I just find out about ... convert to Judaism yes the cautious Jewish okay that's what I thought so uh yeah ... ... and of course the blame is being placed aren't let me start breaking this down ... going to get mad at me if I don't have my stories in order well you haven't said at the front of the pack 'cause I Know [laughter]\nSo uh let me do this because there's a lot of stuff that there's really not getting attention or when it comes down to it I've only seen one or two things on it but today it was either today or yesterday I don't know because of the time zone different but a\nA A N ended in Egypt in\nFlight has crashed into the ocean killing a hundred and eighty nine people on board or they're assuming that all a hundred and eighty nine are dead right\nWhich chances are that's the case that's crazy right there to um to see that because they're saying that they were experienced pilots fly that plane wasn't a cloud in the sky and and they're just they're befuddled as to why this plane\nWent down well they said something like the uh the pilot like ... minutes after taking off said something about they needed to land yeah and they're not sure if he was trying to turn the plane back around or what happened but it is a little mysterious\nSo you've got that you've also got to the the male bomber that we discussed the line on friday he is obviously in custody and are awaiting trial or or hearing or whatever snacks or there was a news suspicious packages\nAddressed to CNN [noise] that was discovered at the Atlanta post office I guess it was added to the the Atlanta CNN headquarters okay\nUh so that according to authorities is very similar to what they saw what the other packages so it seems as if they are treating it in that fashion that this was not a a copycat or anything like that it's from that that guy same guy\nSo that's out there and another thing ... Google and Amazon and social media is and all these guys\nHave gone out of their way\nTo hide stuff related to guns you experience than trying to sell\nLeather holster on Facebook right and you couldn't do that because of what they had a gun and that's right and then you're going to have problems on the back side of that with no gun in it right but they have gone out of their way to make sure they hide\nPost about guns and they they had posted about promoting Trump anything conservative you even mentioned the word gun control and opposed and nobody's going to see it and all this other stuff\nYet\nYou can Google or you could as a twenty four hours ago Google how to make a pipe bomb and\nIt doesn't just come up in the search it comes up on the front page of the search south ... usually when you Google stuff you find your answer pretty quick you don't have to go to page two and three when I really do that\nOr same thing applies when trying to figure out how to make a pie\nOf you find your age are pretty quick you don't have to go to page two and three when I really do that\nOr same thing applies when trying to figure out how to make a pipe bomb on the front page when you Google that phrase now I don't suggest you guys do it because you might have somebody come knocking at your door\nWhile I was gonna ask rather normal reasons why you would need to know how to I mean I'm a night I'm just asking no I mean I'm Adam ... blowing stuff up okay so there's no real legit reasons why you would need to know that now I mean unless you're just one of the people that he just wants to [laughter] right I don't know well it's like\nYou know you get out and you shoot guns out in the field and you like to blow stuff up right you know it's just a manner boy and\nI mean I can understand how you know wanting to know how to make like a homemade rocket or something like a project to do with your head but you know how to make a heat seeking missile well I mean you wouldn't think you know what I mean I think the project let's do pipe bomb you know [laughter] in the back yard yeah\nThat's a little dangerous also also and and all of this is\nLeading up to to the main story which is what happened on Saturday in Pittsburgh but\nI saw reports today that North Carolina high school student has died this morning after being shot by a classmate\nApparently you had a kid they brought a gun to school\nAnd targeted another kid who they had had a fight or some sort of beef or whatever it wasn't a a you know a school shooting if per se where they're just killing anybody and everybody by this kid apparently brings a gun to school and shoots another kid\nThat um there was something going on backstage or whatever and the kid that was shot has ultimately died so that's a tragic story coming out of a North Carolina high school it's butler highschool about twelve miles southeast of of Charlotte\nAnd about seven AM they place the school on on lockdown and emergency crews came in there and got the student was shot they took the other kid into custody from what I understand but just a tragic tragic situation and then outside of that\nAs we know\nEleven people murdered at a synagogue\nIn Pittsburgh as well as\nSeveral others wounded including for police officers when we get back on the other side I'll break that stuff down\nAnd we'll look at what the aftermath of that has been not just for those that were directly affected but us as a country especially leading up to the midterms which is in fact a week from tomorrow all that more will be back\nRight after this we saw\nWith Andrew and Jessica\nWell break that stuff down as well as take your phone calls to oh five nine four one one zero one one toll free eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three Monday edition Andrew Jessica they'll go anywhere [noise]\n[noise] do you want to do enough I'm Coleman W why do you are you in Birmingham W two or three Seventy ...

about as bad hair day there that was on in\nDelhi to send a message\nTo white nationalist\nSo he he went to baseball tweets to send a message\nTo white nationalist how does that even connect I don't even understand that if you love baseball than you love America I don't I don't know how would you at man listen I'll give them that they're getting at least paid to be creative over there they're not going to take a lot of brain power to come up with some of this crap\nWell I think that it's just very odd I Am a card at all at the store with All right\n[noise] oh it's the most certainly organized there's no doubt about it you know Trump called a bunch of he because he said that it's being funded by somebody whether that ... or whoever and he hits the nail on the head yeah of course we don't have\nA the documentation to show who's actually paying for it but you can guarantee yourself that whether it's a third fourth fifth middle man\nThat money some of the money if not all the money came from George Soros\nWell I must say Mike Pence he said he had talked to somebody the leader of some country and they they told him yes this is being funded politically he sent it to\nBeing funded by a left a length is organizations and in part by Venezuela's government\nWell the last time we got together they are so God they invite\nRight well it's certainly on the ... and\nThat's why\nIt most certainly is and that's why we have decided to put fifty two hundred troops on the border to do a little meet and greet and say hey here's\nOh certainly is and that's why we have decided to put fifty two hundred troops on the border to do a little meet and greet and say hey here's the deal or we're going politely ask you to go back where you came from sorry you you walk four thousand miles but you don't have to go about I'm Sorry\nAnd what's up with them off\nWell and it's in some cases it's not even just letting them come through it's actually given them rides letting them hitchhiked do the providing them whatever age they need\nTo make that journey it's um it's not good and really the the governments of these countries\nShould be ... I mean if they're smart they want to be on the same page as honest when it comes to this stuff\nWe don't expect or we don't expect them to allow people in their borders although that's when it happened\nBut we've only got rules where it's whatever country you come to first that's where you see ... you don't track another four thousand miles to ah to the next country the country that you want if you're really ... bad of a situation\nYou will go to wherever you can and if it gets better which Mexico is better you'll stay there than Honduras or whatever you're going to stay there and we're not going to put up with it so Robert thanks bye\nLet me keep moving animals next and then Henry Adam what's up\nHey uh Jessica to add on to your point earlier uh not only is Donald Trump or one of the most supportive presidents of Israel that I have ever known but I Believe he see we got somebody in his family from Israel I I Want to say that it's a a son in law\nYeah ... yeah so the the uh the takers are just completely ignorant and Andrew is George shores listening to your show today\nOf course he is\nOkay well I just want to tell him that he can totally Kiss My grits this and his son is it even more evil than him and he's the most evil person that I Know this is personal it let's don't forget this as a person who is Jewish\nAnd rounded up his own people to the Nazis to send them to the gas chamber ...\nAnd this is a man to the left the takers look up to ... just something to keep in mind when they blame the whole synagogue shooting on on Trump\nYeah there's no doubt about it\nYeah and ... we've got two different things going on right now we've got we've got\nThe news so fake out there and fake isn't strong enough that sounds like you're talking about imitation crab\nOr something like that out\nIts outright lies and propaganda and and the whys are so bad that George Soros and big tech they've got a sensor people so when you've got somebody like a lewd jobs who works for Fox\nWho who's gas that wasn't even Lou Dobbs but his guest said that it's George Soros funding the caravan and then Lou Dobbs loses the show\nRight that this is why they've got a sensor ... executive from Campbell Soup saying the same thing today and he's a ... fired after that tweet\nYeah they they they watch this kind of stuff like vultures especially when it comes to talking heads or people with shows once they see something or see an opportunity to take these people out they immediately do it and it works more time\nYou talking heads or people with shows once they see something or see an opportunity to take these people out they immediately do it any works more times than not to mean you have people to buy back like\nLaura Ingraham or whoever but when they see an opportunity they do when they killed because they want those voices assignments they don't want them\nTo be a a countering the propaganda any longer\nGay Andrew I'm fighting back to you want to know how down me\nOkay a couple of months ago George Soros became majority owner of pay pal over the weekend I canceled my pay pal account Kiss My grits narrows banks and one more piece of good news or the last few weeks the big tech stocks have been going down five to ten percent a day\nBecause their guidance in the future is down because people see what's going on that is good news\nIs good news thing than I Am I always think Adam's phone call is over in attendance not it's not I mean it's never over Henry\nHey it's good to hear your voice manages a great though things money I'm going to add to it of course Chris I call them [laughter] think Adam Adam\nAdam had a good point and it's one of the criteria I base my red Saddam and young because the fact that\nThe left has done all they can to silence anyone speaking out on the right so you're not going to hear much or even on these polls you're not going to get much truth because a lot of the right understands where they stand where they are in this environment\nAnd uh you know I I I got rejoice called in\nYou were talking about what they were saying uh about Trump and uh [noise]\nSome of the ah point she was try and they were trying to make their flat outliers now they become such liars ... they're going to be irrelevant completely the media is just not going to be a left any ... foot leg to stand on but ah they were on the George ... step on the populist\nOn the ah [noise] ah\nThe more that Sunday Morning show and a ... there was a guy from Trump's administration from homeland security he hasn't worked as there are no more but he he would try to address the fact that\nThey did it at the roundtable uh they said the first thing out of Trump's mouth was there should have had an armed guard there and he came back you know that was a that was a a unplanned news conference when it's coming off the plane and he was answering a a loaded question about uh guns and they jumped on him and ah whether\nIt was unbelievable that guy why wasn't even there except for you know a a punching bag for these these wackos and Matthew died this is really great and I have your dog is a sitting there and he's trying to ... the the same guys tried to bring up the fact that\nUh this guy hated Trump bright ... all those things you were just saying about on his Web page and everything and Matthew Dodd says well it's obvious that he was complaining that Trump was at national national is enough to see the remarks that they make\nA show by as they can you imagine saying that short a Obama was not black enough and that's why he failed the um the the black people do and his administration these people would never say that but you got you bet your but if you have anyone that even has a right leaning posture\nWould have said that they would have been a hang\nWas only a only hearing wax gay fifty percent of the effort [laughter]\nYour would have said that it would have been the heck\nHe was only a only black so gay fifty percent of the effort\n[laughter] you know it was just so obvious that ... and it comes down to know what I Believe all like it was always speaking to their base there trying to keep them angry\nBecause everybody that Bush has a I Know everybody doesn't take much or even much salt and see which which is what they're saying or just all based wise\nBut I even some of the Democrats have got to be seeing that show you're going to have this show with diminishing support from the black people\nAnd the brown people and every divided people that they created and they're going to come to the American side where all the laws of the American and we celebrate you for that well and if you want your want us to have like a normal person with common sense You're welcome in the Republican Party\nI think we're starting to ah and thanks Henry I think we're starting to see a lot of that stuff and you know you talk about the young black leaders\nAre as being at the White House right you hear all this other stuff about the the hash\nTag walk away this than the other people are waking up\nPeople are waking up and they're they're tired of what gives if you watch MSNBC you watch CNN whatever it's the same
