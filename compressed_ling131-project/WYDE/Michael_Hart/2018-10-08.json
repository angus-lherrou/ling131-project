I don't know anyway\nIf the phrase devil's triangle had any sexual meeting in the Nineteen eighties we did not know of it\nSaid several Brett Kavanaugh's friends in their sworn statements\nOne of the letters or or one of the letter writers Bernard McCarthy wrote in his your book that he invented the name devil's triangle which\nIs a proof of its meaning saying it was a drinking game and had nothing to do with relations right now this is six people\nUnder the penalty of felony that said no Kavanaugh's writes we were there the devil's triangle was in fact uh drinking game\nWell and you got to think about it and this one apply to everything but we're taking something from how many years ago Thirty years ago plus yeah and and we're trying to judge it by today's standards in vocabulary which doesn't mean the two are the same so I mean something that we would even say\nFor instance let All right when I was in high school let meant drunk like you showed up to a party led that means you showed up drunk right but this generation lick can mean\nLike it was a ... party like it was off the chains or whatever\n[laughter] we have to say about ... the it was found them chains um\nSo those two things at the same word it doesn't hold the same meaning and different generations and so this is much the same that could be with some of the stuff anyway it's like we're trying to take today's vocabulary the way we you know phrased label things today and apply it to something that happened thirty something years ago this radio show and I'm like oh ...\nListen to the first time I heard it could say that I'm like you went to a lead party you know I'm thinking it was like alcohol every body with what you're saying the entire party was let ... let everyone was literally are there and it was the lead so I've had\nTo relearn some words that meant something when I was a kid that don't mean the same thing today ... ... right now off the ...

going to be a lot of violence and the next uh thirty days or so leading up to the mid ... so I'm as a result I I'm not the only one who's just sick\nTo death of the left controlling our lives and one of the biggest ways they like to control our lives\nIs with language what words we should use\nSo I'm Wondering if your station what if you would consider to be in the first ones just stopped since I think you'll be reporting a lot on this violence\n[noise] uh instead of saying antifa because [laughter] they are the opposite of antifa as you know would you consider um start referring to them as what they really are and that is fascist\nYes okay they're anti pastors and their anti anti fascist when I see the point that we thinking right yeah well they are because they uh\nThey use violence and mob type tactics in order to get their way\nTo silence people or or whatever else and there's no doubt in the irony is in the first thing is for anti fascist ride was in the opposite of what they are and then they get on there and act white fashions yes it's it's gold\nSo yeah 'cause I really don't have that any news organization that refers to them as antifa\nI mean just because they're stupid and can't get the name of their organization correct [laughter] doesn't mean that news organization should report fake news right so you will then consider calling them what they really are fascist\nAnd thinking about calling the booth squad or like that\nHow 'bout that well that leading up now on my own fascists it's fine\n[laughter] I I wanted to get your approval for ... or something else guy or as you know whenever I recall and I refer to or the left as left us\nA but [noise] there's nothing wrong with the the word left um ... what I Want I Want to call them ... can I just tell you what's at the top of my list what I'd really like to refer to them as a you know going forward to every time I found in the show\nOr what do you think of the baby killers\nBaby count as well right now we referred to well maybe not the left is a whole but we referred to some members of the left as baby killers being a baby\nThe baby count as well now we referred to well maybe not the left is a whole but we referred to some members of the left as baby killers you know baby killer Doug Jones baby killer Hillary Clinton and all that are so we'll we'll do that do this and I'm going to let you go but make me a list of words we need to change and we'll get on top of that\nOkay and I'm open to us suggestions by you and the listeners to\nWalk up things man I thought I was watching Donald Trump speak\nTo reporters just now and I think they asked him about Taylor Swift\nAnd you know Taylor Swift and just came out in support of some democratic candidates in Tennessee yeah and if I read the closed captions correctly\nHe says I don't know anything about her\nWhen asked about ... don't quote me on that because I don't know because I was literally reading captions but maybe Jessica can look that up on Twitter and see if we can find that moment he talked to reporters and play it for your real quick aren't still moving up next to Ed Ed and how are you\nI'm a lousy forward lady or anybody else on the left or if you tell a long enough you\nGet to believe in it yourself right so I just wanted to comment that she probably has to own a lot of uh that she really believed in now\nYeah now that's a that's a really good point [noise] All right thanks and let me ask you one more oh go ahead David are you all leaving on November ...\nNah I Can't talk about any of that right now it's just a

concerned about Kavanaugh because of where how he might rule on the next ah you know life begins at whatever stage case a let's\nTake a look back at ... Jane roe of roe v wage do\nAnd I and I can ever remember the lady's name but she actually perjured herself told the Supreme Court she was raped so that she could gain sympathy and approval to have an abortion and as soon as the case was finished\nThey had nothing more to do with or the left abandoned her Planned Parenthood everybody else backed off and she was left alone hat or abortion and when she realized that they basically use her\nYou're saying and see the worst time I'm wearing a holiday in the industry for average she literally never said a word gets\nOut of all the time this is when you want to do that\nSo I don't get it jeeze come own teeth left what are you doing when I saw her fans are not happy about it either ah let's see [noise]\nHere's a tweet says\nMarsha Blackburn believes principles that have bless this country for over two hundred years she believes in principles given to us by God you now align yourself with Hollywood which is a cauldron of God listening is a once liked him respected you so much another one I'm very disappointed in Taylor Swift recent comments about great candy us\nSo for US Senate Marsha Blackburn does every pop store slash actor half to voice their political opinions to the world news flash we don't care never have never will\nAnother one respectfully be quiet and sing [laughter]\nI guess you're more pop than country now anyway your country fans are going to be disappointed now you're on the level of Katy Perry now I thought the whole shut up and sing or shut up and dribble I thought that was racist\nYeah what's going to say I don't remember who it was it said that but I'm I'm pretty sure that was that was a backlash right\nAnd now they're saying that white people so that they'll race\nUh well it's probably something to do with the anti see now\nAnother one I Love ya but you were wrong about ms Blackburn police check her records on the votes compared to all sex scandal the former governor\nAnother one I Love ya but you are wrong about ms Blackburn police check her records on the votes compared to all sex scandal the former governor\nHad a another one which with can use your popularity to sway voters to vote Democrat is sad she must lead the public due to her lack of knowledge of Blackburn she lied she lost my family and friends to board I only I only support\nOnly support she has now is from a socialist she's tired her wagon the baby killers looking at my brought up baby killers again\nAnyway there's a bunch of tweets to her I'm I'm not going to go through but Donald Trump was asked about Taylor Swift and he responded at the uh the White House probably ten minutes ago\nReporters asked him about it and and in Donald Trump fashion\nHe told them exactly ...
