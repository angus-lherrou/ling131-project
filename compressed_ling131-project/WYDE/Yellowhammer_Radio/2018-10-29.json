Scott how are we going\nIt's Donald Trump and his posted about that a lot you don't see that it costs in the in the in the mainstream media but uh so we're talking to Scott how\nAre we going to be talking about the illegal alien caravan that's poised to invite any day now I think there are only five or six hundred miles away from the border so I really want to take your calls on that on the on the mood is in Philadelphia and of course my favorite thing that I Want to talk about today\nOr because of a bit of fun now is the pipe bomber slash my old strip\nSo we'll we'll be will be discussing that shortly and of course the election is just a week away or wait tomorrow or why and we'll take your calls and get your views on that later on in the show very shortly actually in the show we'll be joined by congressman Bradley boon\nUh he's from the first additional district down there too in ... and ah I'm going to put it to him the big rumor is the rumor I'm hearing all of them are all over the mobiles Montgomery here in Birmingham\nOr whether you get through that it's more seriously to the Senate elections when he\nWas gonna say congressman or ... everybody that I've spoken to her that his rise to your participation in the twenty twenty rice or for the Senate or every single person who's been very encouraging a devoted all Iran store to a person that it's a a would be a great idea of you to jump into that rice because\nYou don't have to pretend that that is that is representing Alabama in the Senate right now is just that he's a pretend to and the quick uh\nTwenty twenty rolls around and we can uh put to senator boon in that said uh I think there'll be a lot a lot of happy people in the state of Alabama\nWell I thank you for that um I take it very seriously um I've lived in Alabama my whole life\nAnd I expect my senator to be people who are senators from Alabama who wake up every day thinking\nHow am I going to vote for the people of Alabama and I just don't think we've got that right now is Senator John as I Know Senator John it's partially I have nothing against the first one I ... uh what he's done as a prosecutor but as a senator he's not the way that people of Alabama want him to vote and we have to have somebody in that position\nRun a strong campaign against the wind of race they go on to represent the state of Alabama in the United States Senate which is what I Would want to do\nI agree entirely and you know I think this gets back to Congress men to the point\nThat you know I use the hash tag ... without a car into grade note a unit the hash tag candidates matter and we saw in that Senate rice with a you know Doug Jones and Roy Moore the candidates matter and as a result of that we have a guy in the Senate doesn't support the will\nOf Alabamians and we need to fix that as quickly as possible I go to say I would really disappointed or an upset we held ... he went off to\nI'm ... now justice Kevin uh in that confirmation hearing uh I I thought you know he had he really just became a feel for a Chuck Schumer it seemed to me ... he was he was so so pointed against Kavanaugh it almost seemed to me was applying for a job on MSNBC\n[noise] well you know I don't know whether he's already ... we're in the twenty twenty is set himself up for another career I don't know but I agree with you I mean some of the things he said about judge Kavanaugh I was surprised that none of my wife's projects against these\nBut as a former prosecutor I Would have expected him just like little hey wait a minute let's understand what the actual results of our\nRights are always starts and and you know we there were a lot of problems with the fact that that that's a lot of problems with the facts and out of it as a former prosecutor would at least the knowledge that\nWe are such and stuff out of ...\nRight until we do find it unusual that are all those claims that were made against justice Kevin uh the minute after he was condemned the vote just gone away they've gone to why we haven't who won the bet any of them again\nNo because I'm a I'm not like it in so much about the allegation no but they all those people were ... they were given right because the Democrats wanted anything that's ... that's ...\nAll those people were ... they were you right\nPast the Democrats wanted to do anything that possibly could to block which capping off then when it fails those democratic operatives dropped them like a ... right\nSo they they were just being used for other object altogether will just bought judge Kavanaugh on that was over well other than the\nOther sense yeah just awful now look I'm congressman you or I Know you've been a very active um and very uh outspoken forthright should I say about this illegal illegal alien swarm caravan would end of the um [noise]\nUh mine for me do you call it the headed toward the U.S through Mexico the elections just a week or so we can die away you know from what I read today there's thousands of these guys and now they're only about five hundred miles away from our border you know what do you think needs to be done you know they can't come in what what does the administration do\nWell actually I'm getting those eight hundred active duty troops on the border is good stuff we already have the thousand National Guard troops down there I think it's going to take more I've just got to be honest\nAmber but we need to put whatever resources older and to make sure that you're not across\nNow you say something that I was down in hot or quantum ... months ago straightaway poor countries very violent I mean ... it's a corrupt governments lots of drug trafficking gangs\nSo I understand these people are desperate but it's not the United states take care of every desperate person in the world and we just can't take thousands upon thousands of people that come into this country need liquid it's on\nTo the stability or instability politics in Germany and all of our close probably the most popular chancellor of Germany\nSince the to Germany's reunited sees me basically drummed out of office because she has handled immigrant situation Germany right I think it should be assigned to all of us you cannot let this happen and I don't anticipate that President Trump will\nGood I I really really hard to ride congressman or midterms are just a week away you know I think ah from everything I'm reading the polls I'm looking at the Senate looks like a like a site it will be inside Republican hands moving forward\nWhat is your take on the house can the Republicans keep the majority in the house of representatives\nWell certainly we can um is that the problem is is that we have ... ...\nA retired this year that we've got that many open see some of them are places where Republicans go get like we're not worried about it\nBut in too many of those cases we have um open rice is open to the races and places where it's going to be difficult on states like California and New Jersey ... so we've got some tough races on our hands\nAre we've got strong campaigns are polls I've been holding up there is a week ago as well you know for two years ago you can always pay attention to the [laughter]\n... I think we are conscious\nOf ladies are focused on that can't always focused on the task at hand my prediction is that we're not going to now and election I it controls half of the day I think we're hanging onto our majority so it will be small\nRight how how important in that equation is tune out on next Tuesday\nIt's the most important thing I mean at this point you're not gonna give us a Democrat to vote for Republicans okay mhm\nIt's the most important thing I mean at this point we're not gonna give us\nA Democrat to vote for Republicans ... ... points Democrats to vote for Democrats and Republicans are going to vote for Republicans\nWe've got to go out and turning our Republican was she a person and we have people want Republicans are independent legal so what do you get those people and hung out as well if we hung out to vote what we did two years ago\nWhen they'll be a good not to not go with a sub\nSo what we're saying I think a a representative is we need to encourage all our friends to get out and vote or if we need to drive them down to the polling station we need to do that uh my my worry is that people will be you know the the ... the economy is booming everybody is working uh\nYou know pretty much everybody wants to drop has a job or my worry is that do we apathy at the polling you know polling die from the Republican side\nYeah that was my early on a big worry about it before the Kavanaugh hearings I worry a little less about it but here's what I\nSee the value of how long he's not governor advocate being on a couple of weeks ago\nEveryone of us aid to wake up and I hope everybody I'm Out in my family my circle of people I work with even people who don't necessarily say go out and vote if we enough of us to do it often enough\nThat message off or our base will turn out when the phone that's the focus relatives will turn out and we'll have a good night next next week but if we don't turn out if we don't make it a hospital over the next week we could have a very bad not\n[noise] I'm into that to\nRent a congressman Bradley Byrne from ... uh from the first ... elements posted for dinner and mobile a representative since two thousand ... thing\nAnd ah we wish your very very best for election not in a week so I'm really going to die and then we're going to keep a very close on a new congressman so we can to make sure you get into that Senate seat in just a couple of years\nOr not tell you what over the next few months on what about you know instead of the studio with how's that\nThat'd be fantastic we look forward to it a congressman Bradley Byrne or will take a call now a ball but I think we've got you on the lawn\nShifts pouch still hear hey Bob ... call and I am courier\nAnd a ... for about four years and enjoy it and if states pictures I ... off the actual bombs that were delivered\nIf our given the stretch to pick up\nWasn't comes to mind right away as a the case and most people and they are familiar with this ah it was the young lady that was abducted from the Avondale area and made it into a scapegoat very courageous escape out of a truck\nAll right out and yes mhm right and a manual towels was the person who was charged in that case and has been since convicted\nAnd um you know this was one\nThat are really impacts the community and a powerful way anytime soon was abducted from an area that considers safe home shopping location\nAnd then to have to literally jumped out of a truck in a moving vehicle uh you know to save their lives you know according to a ah believe her own statements that she was in fear for her life and there had been some comments made by this person to what might happen or possibly what happened to her\nUm in in in the way that information came in so fast to us and the good thing about you know how we work this is we're always looking at this you know twenty four seven right or if we're not manning phones we have a call center and that phone is going to be answered that caused by the answered you know whenever you call and um\nDid you get the information and the way that we do it and be able to get that back to the investigating agency and to have such a quick turnaround on an actual charging then to locate him apprehend him in ... you know once the he had been identified as a suspect we turn right around and we posted in on our site on our website or social media sites\nAnd you know the public was extremely helpful in that and not only helping to solve that case but also getting him picked up while they're\nSo effectively a manual towns guy was rolled up because of the ... the time to cross\nTaste but also getting him picked up while they're so effectively a manual towns guy was rolled up because of the time to crunch does\nWell it is not just the tip a and of course what we we have an understanding with a detective you know they've they've got more legwork to do so it it wasn't just the tip itself with a tip provided a vital information at a dentist bought a suspect and from there the detective took that information and worked it in other ways and develop\nProbable cause in charging a fence so that that more or less just jumpstart it gave him you know a direct line where he needed\nTo pop up the red flag kind of deal that that's a that's where Michael Frank how you know ... you know we talk about rewards everybody loves a reward and or a colon number is non for one one zero one one big dive loves rewards\nUh yes I Do and in ... after you ask your question I got a question of what are you ask your questions\nHow small of a chip does it take\nTo be able to get the reward\nLittle I think we actually pay rewards of a as low as a hundred dollars a we have a a a a list of various offenses and we have those stratified by dollar amount of reward that the board of directors has approved\nAnd um you know if it's a a fat person capital murder it's probably going to be five thousand dollars a but if it's a very low class felony and we only deal with\nThat ... that's a very low I over a third of no\nYeah then you know I mean it might be a hundred bucks and it's still a hundred bucks and all you had to do is make a phone call\nRight that's in the ... and correct me if this is wrong is to fought for double seven double seven threat to tip line yes that's right on the gods if folks want to go on line it's crime stop his metro I. L. dot com\nThat's correct yes how's that I write that down because we have a very good So Frank I was going to ask you um\nYou've been involved with ... for you know a number of years or being a champion for quite some time now\n[noise] how do you think you know these are you know we talked about the community site but how do you think crime stuff is does that you know ... do you have any of that sort of thing on and\nI Do um up until the board of directors decided to expand its activities and become more effective\nFive or six years ago we would average about thirty six felony arrest per year and a that would clear about Seventy felony cases per year well a ... and the board felt you know we can do much better if we advertise if we hire an executive director\nOr if we pay rewards weekly instead of monthly and over the last five and a half years\nI tip to the sister in law enforcement and making one thousand and thirty five\nFelony arrests and clearing two thousand two hundred and Seventy four felony cases and that's just in the last five and a half years so it's been very effective\nThat's amazing the police departments and the sheriff the palms law enforcement agencies must see this is a terrific resource\nWell I obviously it is a resource that they started so we're very happy to be able to provide that and we have a board that is composed of some local businessmen and some local and retired law enforcement officers all of whom are interested in and trying to improve our community safety for all of our citizens out there\nSo how does ... raise the money for because it's not there's no government money or is there in this in the Balkans\nGovernments local governments got mature local governments are they give us money uh we have ice cream shop or of the year event every year where we have a speaker and we actually given award to the ... for the year\nUh they give us money uh we have a crime shopper of the year event every year where we have a speaker and we actually given award to the ... for the year\n... I think he was the ... ...\nExactly right and um so we raise money from all facets of the area of public contributions um we'll take money with whoever wins [laughter] that's exactly right I budget used to be about ten thousand dollars a year before the board decided to ramp up or activities I budget has over three hundred thousand dollars a year\nWell that's well how can how can a local\nJust everyday citizen helped go in that aspect\nAnd then they can give us tips if they've got a a step on a felony number one\nWhile I'm Talking about em monetary you know I mean can can local among just everyday Joe make it a nice you'll know donation is stuff how would they do that\nA address I think he's on our website and you just kind of make a checkout to ... metro Alabama and then send it in\nYeah that's a that's a good idea ... do you know my because in my neighborhood I Know I Want my neighborhood to be safe right and if if I can help out by throwing a hundred bucks a year to them and saying thank you for helping my neighborhood based safe you know there might be other people out there that want to do the same thing that would be great\nBig dives big dive as big ideas [laughter] and that's why we that's where we keep them around a John with the uh you know ... so what what's the process so tip comes into you you pick up the phone or what have you stopped pick up the phone what happens in ...\nComes in and we use a ... an electronic software product or that actually\nDocuments are anonymously that tip is registered I can actually view this in the office on my personal computer desktop or I can I view it on the phone when I'm away from the office\nAnd uh I can scroll through read whatever the person has provided information wise\nAnd then I'll be able to determine normally pretty quickly where it needs to go\nA Memphis I wanted person or we we post wanted felons and most of those that are posted or violent when it'll violent crimes mhm uh or if it's a case related to\nUh you know it might wait until the next day if I get it view it late at night or if it's a case related to you and I know that they're looking for leads I'll be able to pass that ride alone\nAnd of course that information can come in through our main number two five four seven seven seven seven it can also come through our website come through our Facebook page\nOr they can go on Twitter they can go on Instagram how well most of all most all of our social media sites a have a way of of of reaching back to our main website and bringing that tip into us so there's a variety of ways that that information can come and we even have an app that you can download on your your personal mobile device\nAnd a year and you can for tips too is that why so anyway we get the tip in in our eyes are on it pretty quickly um and if we need to forward it onto the arresting a warning agency or the investigating agency within that ride along to them and sometimes if it's something I Want to make sure the detective is looking at right away\nOr all generally call that person night is at night and tell\nThem I'd like to get that phone call ... ...
