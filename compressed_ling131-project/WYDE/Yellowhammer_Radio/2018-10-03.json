a lotta kind of stuff like that\nAnd um\nYou know looking\nInto a ... looking into the future of the next three hours I'm I'm very excited for what we have coming up and up big day before just some housekeeping before we get along I think I Will be out friday again and so someone maybe Kevin for me to have you with the\nVessels that need to know know yes I have\nI've covered that I was just letting you know okay thank you so I I didn't mention it today and you say well hold on buddy [laughter] a welcoming it's always a great conversation can work with anybody or good thank you ... and so we get a lot going on but I was watching Tucker Carlson this morning absolutely just tee off\nOn um the ... what is the third accusers name 'cause you Deborah Ramirez who was the second then you had a sweat and accused the third but I just I Can't was Julie sweating like I think it was her name and absolutely just crushed crushed term\nI'm In in his I think it was opening statements from last night but I wanted to go back in and just talk a little bit about cabinet because I really haven't\nHounded on it too much in the past two days\nBut uh as we wait on the the White House press briefing\nOr so the uh to wrap up talking about the wrap up of the FBI investigation that that Kavanaugh approve\n'em 'cause they're good and as soon as today and we get a vote on it as soon as tomorrow or you know do it towards the end of the week I mean there is a potential uh cabin all could be sitting on my court or by next week but\nAnyways I'm watching Kevin I'm\nHearing kind of debate on CNN and and I see Tucker Carlson this morning and I'm pretty sure it was from a show last night and I'm watching his YouTube channel\nAnd it basically just tease off on blaze Lee Ford you know and we saw Trump mocking Boise forward yesterday did you see that big Dave where all she can remember that she had her own beer\nAnd in Trump took a lot of heat for that but in defense of Trump like I don't love when he mocks people but at least he did it this time with you know all she can remember is that she had one beer and he's not like what like that's the truth of the fact that the truth of the matter and\nHe's ten off on a blaze before ... and then he gets to this third or this third\nAccuser but I don't even know if it's an accuser it's more like a witness because she went to ten of these gang rape parties in a row and she like swore an oath like she wrote a statement saying Kavanaugh and his buddies were um\nDrug in the punch we're putting stuff in the punch and they were poor taking in um these actions right now she's gone back and saying well I I'm pretty sure that I saw a cabin all at one of these parties and uh and and and I'm not really positive I I don't I don't really know\nWhat is that not lying under a sworn statements\nAnd you want to talk about Kavanaugh lying under oath\nHow how do you know Kevin O's lying under oath or you know Boise forwards\nAnd you want to talk about cabinet all lying under oath\nHow how do you know Kevin O's lying under oath or you know Boise Ford's being honest under how do you know any just because it's under oath doesn't mean it's the truth\nLike obviously we saw a last Thursday with boys Lee Ford and Kevin I'll just because it's under oath we had two completely different stories we had one side of the story that it was very very like a hazy trying to remember and then we saw another side of the words that never happened\nSo\nIt's almost like being under oath doesn't matter because you're not going to be able to rewind the clock thirty six years and\nGo from door to door and find out what houses was that around the country club so I Am watching Tucker girls in this morning and he is a kind of\nTrying to ah let the water just go through all the cracks in these stories in these allegations and he does a very good job of it but what got me the most is that this under oath or sworn an oath doesn't matter any it it doesn't matter it doesn't matter if you are under oath\nThe perfect hometown door stop we'd love to hear about it go to our website at one oh one W.

Love talk it the way I Do I loved I loved going through conversations getting her son you know because she wasn't really a conservative\nYou know what I mean right gave him much a different opinion and it wasn't because she was a female and it wasn't because she wasn't as ... as I Am it was because she just she would like ingest all this news and she would die just all this stuff and she would go immediately to conspiracy theories\nI'm and she would just look at stuff differently and I I really enjoyed that never enjoyed our arguments on air but it never went off and it was always just on their arguments and then you're not so you're a ... thing you know what I mean or give her if a small ...\nWent off and it was always just on their arguments and then you're not so you're a hung out to the shows are like you know what I mean or give her a ... you can't your body hugs anymore you got to be careful you can't give anybody hugs and yet you better not grabbing the eyes don't do any ice\nJust because Brett Kavanaugh big Dave how's Kevin all thrown ice\nAnd I was giving hugs all weekend in the club and everything they gave you looked like a much\nMore huggable person that I Do though like you look much more like if I was going to give somebody a hug and I was in a room with you or me I Would go to you and give you a hug you like a huggable guy I looked like a guy who's going to like be afraid of germs like I just looked like a weird guy\nI\nI haven't changed because of all this and I'm not going to change but when I was still a lot a\nLot of people do are going to be on the edge about a lot of stuff that\nWell if you call this phone in here and I answered the phone I'm going to say hey soybean how're you doing yeah you know I'm all I hang on a sweaty or you know stuff like that that that's who I Am\nYeah I just\nIn the south I'm like a little different but it's just how these how'd these allegations and\nThings like this it's going to we're going to set a precedent with Kavanaugh and ... it's going to get blown through and it's going to happen if somebody can\nSpeaking of the south I was about gotten a fight over a girls' honor this what you\nReally okay yeah I I did want to go back to that what what happened with that how in the world did you get in a bar and grill five big okay I I we were at\nTheir and football was on a couple of the people that were sitting at the table they had three screens there there was nothing in the middle string\nSo we asked this nice young waitress Hi can you change that middle one to the Kentucky game so we can watch it and she got sure so she goes and gets through most\nShe clicks it well the guy that had been watching the Penn State game over here because he's from Penn State\n... because yelled at her\nAnd that that that made me All right there you know yell at a woman or what the middle one was on the Penn State you know the far left one was on Penn State oh and so she actually she accidentally when she went to change the middle when it changed the one on little s and instead of him going hey we were watching that\nHe literally yelled and started cussing at her\nAnd I I I Would love to say I'm surprised big day but by no means am I surprised that the fact that people can be so rude nowadays especially to cover customer service like whether it be airlines whether it be at a bar and grill server bart's in or whatever\nIt may may oh I I had to she all she does she flipped over she said I'm Sorry to him well\nShe was trying to get the middle one to go\nIt did it again and he literally went off and I got a\n... did he not realize it was a mistake the first time that they did she know he declared goal that she was trying to change the middle TV you know he didn't care\nI'll be there all day and then and I stood up at that point I tell you what big day it's always good if your point doesn't get across the first time cuss word or two in there oh yeah yeah and that really gets you scientists that actually when you use GED yeah oh yeah in the south to that one and just really turns me uh\nYeah you know what if if you can't get the waitress to do what you want to dropping F bomb\nOr ... yeah or or or something or or just start calling people to be worried that'll get people's heads is it that really made a people respect you buddy well I stood\nUp and I said I said she didn't mean to she's just China's trying to change the TV to what we wanted to say sorry\nI was trying to bring us ...\nShe just China's trying to change the TV to what we wanted to say sorry I was trying to bring us You're trying to be nine hours trying to be nice so I stood up was a third time he yelled at her when she accidentally did it I stood up and started walking that way\nAnd then what happened don't stop there\nWell I had two females step in front of me and said it's not worth it one of them was the manager the the one of one of the manager females and another female and I was like he's not going to yell at her like that\nAnd they were like he's not worth it you don't need to go to jail and I'm like if he yells at her one more time y'all better get out of the way the\nOld him over over the um I when I Do not yell at her again\n[laughter] oh my goodness you know somebody is probably listening right now and they were at that same establishment you were at\nI don't care I think oh that was a big Dave yeah oh I Know that I don't care you could have done it a totally different and handled yourself a lot better oh yeah but that Budweiser courage was making him ten foot tall and bulletproof yeah\nWas really making me feel\nWell you know big day when I was a a a server slash bar tender ... whatever I I did and the customer service industry world back in like high school and college and everything\nOr any time that we would have a problem like that and I was very blessed to work in a place where we have like security and like apple pie and we were just ... they would just be escorted to the rooms are kicked out of the hotel right now and it's just the thing like even if I had gotten involved in something like that like the manager was saying it's just not worth your time will so courageous\nMy thing is as I used to be a bouncer yeah okay so I I get it and I know how to take you down\nIn a heartbeat from a sitting position because I went to classes do learn this stuff they have the professional bouncer well and I will tell you even then and especially now that I've gotten older\nI playing yeah I I'm not going to play with this stuff it's almost like as you get older your your limit of how much crap you can put up with it it really just it starts to pick away more and more peace usually when it comes to women and kids are in animals\nI I mean you don't I don't want to see you yelling at him on my way and why did you have to throw animals on there the ... that are working for no because it takes me off when people are making the animals\nOh I Will oh [laughter]\nI Love it they gay but we have to have somebody like you out there standing up but\nWhen it comes to kids animals and women I'm ... but now with guys\nAnd I realized there's apostle impossibility that something somewhere it's true\nBut at some point you have to acknowledge that there is just not enough there's nothing there and there's not enough evidence and you have to go and look at the person being accused and say their reputations speaks for itself\nYou know it it's the um point we have to actually acknowledge people's reputations Roy Moore say what you want to say about him you know not a good candidate but still a good man his reputation forty years was of dedicated public service was thrown right out the window\nYeah and and it was and it was never sure up of actually what happened on all those different allegation cases like what happened to uh to the woman from east Alabama who got up there and cried on ah on national TV and on every live streaming service you can go like whatever happened\nTo them but whatever happened to her\nBut more importantly into somebody's sworn testimony is the fact that a person's wife and reputation means nothing\n... what do ... in tatters oh yeah\nI gather there's there are people saying Kavanaugh's guilty just because he's being accused and that's that's just not the right way to go you've got to have evidence\nThem a new or you are guilty and now you are guilty now until proven innocent\nAnd will give me the same way if it was the other way around though we like it would be the same like if if there was a democratic nominee and he had allegations about them like we would be going\nThe same like if if there was a democratic nominee and he had allegations about them like we would be going crazy but like ... I I Would like to think I Would hope to think that we sat back and saw\nOkay well there there's not enough credible allegations are evidence or facts are I mean you can't even remember your testimony\nYou know what I mean like I Would like to think it would go that way but I I don't know what\nI I Wish I Wish we could say on the right that we wouldn't make up that kinda stuff\nBut yeah I mean wouldn't sorted enhance [laughter] yeah mark thanks for the call but he thinks Conan All right I'll get that without using my carry on with your story\nNo oh yeah so I [laughter] know ... one nine nine thirty three\nWhen I hear from you know I'm ... it's just it's one of those things that I you know I'm very passionate about a ... if you're going to tell a story you know at give me all you get you know and if you're going to go get up there and tell your testimony\nYou're going to pronounce it to the world and every major news station and streaming service that is available I mean every single person last Thursday whether you are at work whether you're in a car whether you at home at a at a sporting event you were watching\nOr at least watching the highlights of that Kavanaugh testimony and Christine Blasey Ford testimony like you were tuned into that\nDoesn't matter who you are no matter where you are the ratings on that were wild the streaming services on that were insane or you had thousands of people watching local news services stream these national news services it was incredible\nBut what I'm getting at is when your story like when you're giving a story like that and and you give me very minimal to work with like like very minimal facts are\nEvidence and it's not really even evidence is just as he said she said\nAnd you'll never figure out\nWhat actually happened and I'm looking up on Fox News right now big did you see this every bit of evidence we have seen so far has supported in has supported Kavanaugh in his case that's what Sarah Sanders has got up there and said the White House press briefing as it goes on right now it's just like it's just another example\nOf you know if you want to come up here give your testimony and and and make your point like make your point that capital is a bad man when he did thirty six years ago still affects you today then give me the records of the counseling where you specifically said Kevin O's name\nWell my thing is is that we give it to me I was kind of [noise] I was kind of deal with the Republicans okay I'm not a Republican I'm not a Democrat I'm an independent but I was kind of ill when they I I Know what they were trying\nTo do they're trying to be sensitive and let the lady asked the questions yeah so it didn't seem like that they were going after\nHer and the more you talk about this big gave the more I agree with you because I think you'd make a great point about that\nI I was ill because our ... you know I wouldn't let her do the ... but when you know ... had to go wait wait wait wait I got to ask some\nQuestions that she's not asking because it didn't feel like she got to the true questions at the senators and we don't get one of my questions there at least the people wanted to ask one of the questions I would've ... had to have I asked is okay you're saying\nBrett Kavanaugh threw you on the bed and put his hand over your email which ... was she when I remember that do you understand why I'm asking that\n... was\nShe when I remember that do you understand why I'm asking that because it wasn't because if she would have said well he put his right hand over my mouth the white genes and men's plants are you can't get to the zipper with your left hand very easily\nTo great facts were in the world did you think of that or find that impresses is\nOne of the things that I thought of while she was being questioned but now she would've said left hand I can understand because you can get to your server and I'm not trying to be graphic or anything but that's just one of the things that I've thought of\nIt is a great point I haven't even thought of that question but there were a lot of questions that I feel like the American people questions like that big Dave that the the senators you have how many senators and the Senate ... there was ...\nThere was a a eleven for the Republicans in the end for the Democrats\nEleven Republican senators who are at the top of their game like top leadership position they'll probably ever be in their entire life they probably could have thought of something like that I mean I think that I'm hiding behind one woman as right\nBecause to cruise used to be a top attorney he did a lot with the second amendment and everything you're going to tell me he couldn't impose tolls Ambien\nYou can be nice but still show that she's an idiot\nDo you think that they were worried about their other comrades like there are other Republican senators going too far or saying something too graphic or asking to asking a\nNew regrets for the Democrats for making statements and then at the very end going thank you I really believe you\nYeah I mean weren't even getting to what the actual point of it was either\nSee it's it's very interesting to think about what you could have done differently there but again those are the cards we retail and that was the TV we we got and that was the interviewer guy that was the testimony we got that was the\nNot prosecution we got but that was the the evidence that supports all those those are the questions that were asked and now we have to figure it out from there so\nWhat do you think eight six six five five one nine nine three three but but seriously what is what what is going to be one of those questions that would have changed that like like\nLike what I don't understand is how it the very last second they address the the other people\nThat claimed this never happened and how they talk about ... and they completely just blown off the very last thing I always she has health issues I'm I'm Glad to see she's dealing with those\nWhat how would the world is that is that a proper excuse to be able to to get out of a question and the Dodger question and for Rachel Mitchell just to let it happen\nLike they played it up like Rachel Mitchell was going to be like cousin Vinny and she was more like\nI don't know who's the Breaking Bad lawyer better call
