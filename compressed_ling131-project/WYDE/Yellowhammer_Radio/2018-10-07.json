C. H. B. to where we were super station one on one there'll be ...\nYou're listening to incite bill Wilson where the discussion focuses [noise]\nA little bit different way she's like oh no and and so you know the principles that I was trying to get a cost the lives of the show idea that he started a newly released over television about ... years old and if you there but that's the way my use their\nOrigin ... are largely actually at heart college too narrow home or let's say ... having driven by the financial on talking about the uh between the NATO led process the ways that we can reduce your out of pocket cost a for assistance and and what's\nThe uh between the NATO led process ways that we can reduce your out of pocket cost a for assistance and and what's out there [noise]\nUm [noise] the biggest point that I wanted to make at least in the ... I made last week and that is the people who received the most aid and pay the least amount for college or not the ones in the greatest need\nThe people who received the most stayed and pay the least amount of money for college or not the ones with the greatest needs they are the ones that understand the process and so what we're going to focus on a continue on today is is the understanding of the process\nAnd and just helping you understand the different rules what goes into determining whether or not a student qualifies for financial aid\nAnd so forth last week we left off talking about the financial aid equation\nAnd so I Want to go back and revisit that a little bit and continue with that discussion but we talked about that a child's financial need is determined by the difference between the cost of the college and something that we call the expected family contribution the FCC [noise]\nSo we determine need for a student by looking at the cost of the college minus the expected family contribution and they expected family contribution was the number\nThat the government to tournaments that we should be able to contribute to college based on our income and our assets and we know this number by going to the website a professor F. A. F. essay or the free application for federal student aid and this is the starting point for all parents\nA faster actually I'm a a website is maintained by the department of education you go to it provides a you provide your child's income assets the outcome is is expected family contribution\nAnd also mentioned is a sign that last week that this process needs to needs to start for parents October the first that's when you can do this uh this is a little bit of a change in the past we used to wait until the end of the year or to do these things for people to have their end of the year income and so forth now they\nFast forward in the process in which you could start so all parents need to look at this uh starting next month actually [noise] um but they expected family contribution talking about that is pretty much where we left off [noise]\nUm I ... I talked about an example last week between all burn and MIT and I was talking about if your child was looking to go to engineering go into an engineering was considering the two different colleges or your new as a parent trying to figure out what you can do what you cannot do what you can afford what she could not afford\nI'm One of the points that I made us there's two different universities were picked for a reason because they have a very different treatment for financial aid some colleges out there you will find are very aggressive\nWhen it comes to financial aid other colleges you'll find or not and so a grass and the situation I ... I mentioned at MIT provides one hundred percent of a child's financial need so the difference between the cost of the college in this government number as expected family contribution\nMIT traditionally provides one hundred percent of that for financial lane Auburn not so much they're only ... they're only known to provide about half of that\nSo you have additional costs associated with that\nAnd when we work through the example I pointed out that the actual cost of MIT was actually less than ...\nSo stay with that and when we work through the example I pointed out that the actual cost of MIT was actually less than ... even though the tuition costs was actually double the cost of the parent was actually house\nIt was fifty percent less now how in the world is that how was that possible\n[noise] how can a school that cost twice as much in tuition actually cost you laugh and that's really where we left off last week\nAnd I started talking about the part of it is because of the resources available with the colleges some colleges have a lot more resources than others\nUm you typically find the smaller ... more expensive schools have a very strong and dominance they have a lot of alumni gaming are very active in that area and they have a lot of people that are making contributions to the university that can be used to provide assistance for the students\nUm some universities have research on maybe hospitals are says associated with them a least provide a lot of resources for the college to use for the student but the biggest reason for this is a supply and demand\nAnd I started talking last week about that the majority of students\nGo to generally the most public the large public universities and state\nNow here in Birmingham probably eighty percent or more of seniors go to Alabama Auburn and that's just pretty much the way it is it was like that when I was in school [noise] um it was probably more than that when I was in school I mean nowadays I'm shopping for colleges has been a little bit more\nUh parents are a lot more than ... than they were when I was in school or we pretty much just pick the school and we went\nUh we didn't go out and visit schools like they do now and so Pete so students have spread out a little bit more on the country looking at a lot of different skills but he still have that same type of situation\nA large majority of students go to one of a a handful of sort of larger public universities that are very visible primarily because they have a football team or something along those lines\nInside the supply and demand factor comes in because these universities do not have to work very hard to attract the students they have more students than what to do with\nA lot of these smaller universities there are more expensive private universities and so forth\nThey have to work a lot harder to attract the student\nAnd that's really when it comes in so when you contrast university like all burnt and then my T MIT is a lot more aggressive in providing financial packages for the students because they have to be [noise] Auburn does not have to be have to do that\nUm they don't have to work as hard but but to for those universities that are more especially the ones that are more expensive\nThe profit out of state universities they need to provide more aid they also have more resources to provide that aid but they really need to work hard to attract the students\nNow colleges or a business just like anything else so the way I think of this financial latest flight more is is is our marketing dollars you know do you have to spend dollars to attract customers\nWell if you don't have to if you don't need any customers then you're not going to spend any money to attract more customers and it really is that simple\nAnd when you look at the different colleges that you're going to notice that not all colleges are created equal when it comes to providing aid and and because of that you can't necessarily Lynn\nIn an equal when it comes to providing aid and and because of that you can't necessarily limit the school choice for a parent based on the standard tuition right because you may find these more expensive schools because of the resources they have\nOr because they need to be more aggressive to attract the students the actual cost of the parents might be less so one of the principles that I mentioned last week is that limiting school choice does not necessarily reduce the parents share of college costs\nNow what's logical for most parents it would be to look at a situation like armor an MIT think about the budget [noise]\nThink about what's going on there and they might they might conclude that they need to steer their children to Auburn\nUm while they may recognize that the MIT is a great engine in fact is probably the most prestigious engineering school in the world ... a good school [noise]\nAnd they just don't see the benefit of the additional tuition dollars but the reason why use that example is because I wanted parents to realize that that isn't just because\nIn that's where it begins to the financial aid offers from the different universities\nBut you have to start out with a cross section of colleges you need to pay multiple colleges but they can't be the same town of colleges they can't just be Alabama Albany New ab they need to be Alabama Auburn south Alabama Vanderbilt and so forth\nThey need to be different colleges some in state out of state some public some private\nUm some some more academic than others are different cost structures and so forth\nBut you need to pick a cross section from that and what I'm trying to lead you to as if you start out with eight to ten colleges\nThey financial out first started coming in then you can start eliminating in colleges that don't provide you get financial package but what I'm wanting parents to do is to create a competitive situation for these colleges Korea competitive situation for these colleges to track their kids\nColleges or a business in the in the best analogy that can give to you is\nThe one that I started before about a car dealership [noise] you know do you want to do you need a new car do you want to pay for pay more for that new car then you should well a sure fire way to do that is to walk into the dealership\nEspresso the salesman how much you love the car and how much you're in love with the car and giving them the idea that you're going to buy a car no matter what so it's it's pretty obvious that the price that they are going to provide for you is not going to be their best ...\nYou have to create a competitive situation if you go into a four day alerted by a truck and they and they offer you a price for that truck\nYou know you gotta start insinuating that you're going to run down the road to the Chevrolet dealer\nThat's what gets you into a better price we all know that it's a competitive situation\nThese guys are not going to offer you the best price for the car ride away they're going to offer you the price that they think that you'll take that you have to create a competitive situation\nThe colleges and the sun the colleges are going to provide you a financial aid package equal to what they think you're going to want to accept that college so when you create a competitive situation by selecting all these different colleges you're going to increase the likelihood\nThat one college is going to be more competitive and provide more aid [noise] very similar to buying a car but it has to be a cross section or colleges that can't be the same kind of colleges because of the things that we talked about before\nSome colleges have a more resources than others some colleges will naturally be more aggressive than others and attracting students\nBut in general the first orange that she received from the schools is not going to be their best offer it's going to be what they think you're going to take [noise] but if you if you create a competitive situation then you increase the likelihood that they will they will provide you a better offer\n[noise] now there's another issue involved with selecting a college that also want to mention so going back we start out with eight to ten colleges cross section of colleges we go through the fence\nThat also want to mention so\nGoing back and we started out with eight to ten colleges cross section of colleges we go through the faster process\nWe initiate those offers we created a competitive situation I'm In weren't going to talk more about next week or a little bit more about this negotiation and how you can you can receive these better offers\nA but another issue that I Want to just close out what today\nIs as you know there's a third criteria for choosing the offer uh choosing the college\nUm if you choose eight to ten colleges you are going to receive a a different a lot of different offers if there are different kinds of colleges that offers are going to be all over the place and you're going to be very surprised by that you're going to find certain colleges are provides you a lot of assistant other colleges do not\nAh but there's also another type of aid that's out there that's called merit may said\nNow all day and that we've been talking about is financial I financial base stayed\nIts aid that's created because of financial need it's created by the government on the premise that our society is better when everybody is educated so they're trying to create incentives in ways that different people with different means\nCan go to college and receive that education so that's why it's an e bay situation because it's based on income and assets obviously the less income or the less assets that you have the more that you don't have they're trying to create an equal playing field for everybody\nBut merit based said is actually based on the merits of the child\nMan they said is actually administered by the missions department it's actually not in minister about in the financial aid office and so what will we generally teach people is that you need to look at colleges that your child is in the top ten percent\nAnd that's ten percent in terms of the incoming freshmen by looking at all the different measurements that we have for colleges or SAT ACT grade point average and so forth\nAnd there's there's all that information is out there and when you're in an average\nUh situation for these different universities you can find out on the Internet it's not very hard to find the colleges provide this information\nBut you want to choose universities that your child is going to be on the top ten percent and what that does is it increases the likelihood that they're going to get the merit aid\nAnd the merit aid is actually not based on need sometimes it is but most of the time it's not it's actually ... based on the value of the student the worthiness the student in the eyes of the colleges now let me give me a quick example um [noise] of how this might work\nUh several years ago I had a a a client that I was planning for their child to go to college their children were very young\nUm and in recent years um their daughter was in high school and they were looking at the different colleges and they were trying to visit trying to figure out where they want to go in and they came in in the office and we were looking at their investments trying to figure out what a what we can do and not do and so forth\nWell and the family was a big armored family and they've been tailgating their whole life\nUm she really didn't want to go anywhere else but often but she was interested in nursing so I suggested just like what I'm suggesting to you that we go through the faster process now in their situation I was not expecting\nAny kind of financial aid and help for them and all it was a husband and wife physicians I'm I expected their ... their family contribution number ...\nIt kind of financial aid and help for them and all it was a husband and wife physicians I'm I expected their ... their family contribution number actually exceed the cost of ... because based on their income and the way that they create that number the government creates that number I did not expect them to have any financial need\nYou can only half an inch will need when you're expected family contribution is less than the cost of college it has to be a positive number I thought with them it wouldn't be a negative number and it was um but that's still the starting place that everybody goes through\nUm now what I also suggested to them as we take a lot of different universities she had no interest whatsoever in anything other than the number but I convinced them you know let's just using a ... a few other universities must look for once\nThat um she might be interested in with what she wanted to study which was nursing and one of those colleges that we chose was trolling she absolutely no interest in Troy but when the financial aid offers came back and just like I expected offer an offer nothing\nTotal cost was going to be on the parent one hundred percent no way whatsoever\nBut when the when the offers came back from Troy she was actually offered a full ride um based on her merit now she was not a Rhodes Scholar she was not um she was not really even in the top part of her class a graduating but she wasn't above average student\nBut she looked very good at Troy and Troy put the dollars for it because they wanted her\nThey knew it wasn't competitive situation we let them know we were looking very strongly in Auburn and I never would have happened had we not started the process by looking at these different universities [noise] if we had just gone into it with the idea that we just want all burn\n'em we're not going to sign a whole lot um that's it that's probably the best selling stretching I have in my career\nI'm helping parents steer their children toward certain colleges because of what the colleges provide so in this situation where I actually am going to get a phone or on the money that way it's safe for college we were able to use for other purposes\nUm again she wasn't married thrilled about going to ... I mean excuse me go into Troy\nBut she warmed up to that when I started when we started talking about how we could buy a car for graduation she liked that idea way can also buy some real estate for her to live and Troy as opposed to living in the dorm and all\nAnd those ideas winter up to them but it never would have happened unless she was not unless she was not in the top ten percent\nOf the university [noise] now not\nPretty much winds up part time today are closed down and we will go into the\nYou've been listening to inflation will will\nUm unfortunately sometimes there's been a loss of life mhm it was very serious serious situations series for that you would think that you know someone that with the experience you have in the tiger you bring to the table you know you say look this was my client or my clients Pham with my the family of of the seat and uh they've been harmed in X way\nWhen you present that information or to a nursing home or to their attorney what is the usual response that you receive\nA they could care less as a matter of delayed deny the thin already so ah they could have a resident\nIn front of us bleeding to death they're going to deny that they did anything wrong or they're going to the late what ever action you attempt to take and they're going to force you to file a lawsuit independent and it's very very troubling because this is the culture of health care whether it be in the hospital and or in a nursing home\nWhen something bad happens rather than trying to apologize fix it and ... and make people whole for they want to cover it up\nAnd hiding behind these very restrictive laws we have an Alabama under the Alabama medical liability at and it's always uphill battle a richer for lawyers like me and you because many of the things are required to prove our case\nWe can't discovered because under the law in Alabama or they're precluded from discovery like pattern and practice\nThey're required to prove our case we can't discovered because under the law in Alabama or they're precluded from discovery like pattern and practice similar occurrences or you're still in a nursing home they just kill twenty people in the twenty proceeding much the same way\nWhen you get discovery in that case and investigate it and go to court to put on your evidence you can't talk about those\nTwenty previous deaths ... twenty previous months which literally sometimes it may be the case\nRight I mean it was the theory behind that I mean it's too prejudicial is that the basis uh I mean it seems like it is extremely relevant and it has this profile of value to say\nWhat the type of policies are in place is there one written policy and then another standard practice in place so it seems like you would have a substantial property value but what's the what's the argument behind are not allowing that information it\nWell like you I Believe it has substantial productive at you but the argument is that a\nOne case has nothing to do with the other in is not relevant and you shouldn't be able to talk about the fact that when we did the same thing twenty times the same year and we did it again in this particular case but ah what it points to is uh the fact that they are correcting\nThey're bad habits and they are increasing the level of care that they are providing to people because they're doing the same thing over and over again but we can't talk about that I mean every nursing home has a bill of rights and has to adhere to\nPolicies procedures and regulations pursuant to the Alabama department of health pursuant to the federal government are they are review by the joint commission on health care credit ... and they have to adhere to their minimum standards in order to get the credit Asian and\nTime and again they just fell in doing it because\nUh going back to money they make a cost benefit cost benefit analysis or if they don't corrected in hey they lose a few people that's okay because they're still going to continue to make a great profits and\nThey'll defend the law suits that uh they have to\nWrite and they know like even if it's a situation where you may lose a one or two lawsuits here they're you know like you said I mean it's already been kind of baked into the business model overall ... and and now there's no there's no real emphasis on changing the policies on increasing the number of\nUm staff or directing more resources\nAbsolutely not a a these corporations do not live by the golden rule by way of example I have a case against a nursing home company that I have tried on four separate occasions is going on since uh two thousand nine I don't know how many years that is now\nAnd rather than looking at the merits of the lawsuit and\nThe harm that was done to the residents in the family and the resident and has actually died now we're going to try that case a fifth time down in the best mark cut off for Jefferson County right ah in April of twenty Nineteen no cost\nUh they've just made a decision that they rather ... case\nOne more time four or five times then compensate a deserving family in my opinion I deserve and family for the injuries that were suffered to their loved one in the south baked in right exactly yeah\nAnd it's one of those things where you said this is a fair trial so when I you know you're going to try to assign that dollar number two the amount of money that's been spent in attorney's fees defending the cyber lawsuit as opposed to actually trying to find a resolution\nList and they had four or five law firms I think this will be a the four ...\nAnd the Chinese be defending his diaper lawsuit as opposed to actually trying to find a resolution\nList and they had four or five law firms I think this will be the ... law firm right when this case goes to trial again and they pay those law firms more money in these then it would have taken\nA to compensate this family and so uh it's the principle of the matter for me I may never make money on it but we're going to do everything within our power to see the family\nGets justice for their loved ones would never walk away\nWith right now and I love that I mean I think that's the mentality you had to have that I have to be a war you are taking on it's like how does and businesses that you take on we're going to talk more about this going to continue this conversation with attorney Barry Walker a Walker law or right after the break this is a results with Richard Rice and we'll be back a couple of minutes\n[noise]\nDoing these things\nCare whether it's time to find a magic city snowball and cool off\nYou know you can find them all over the Jeffersons Shelby and water count as the snowy buses available for party family reunion even public events are still call she was five six to one for us to to avoid tenacious\nNot a city counseling services here to give us a call two oh five to seven six seven to seven [noise]\nIf you want someone to fight for

you in mind car on the floor for\nPublic service commission place one paid for by the committee to like ... or so how life has a new copy\nShop owner so far so good I'm getting new customers each day but I'm not at the point where I can afford to buy insurance coverage for myself\nHave you ever heard of direct primary care it works for me and my pocket health care that's affordable sounds too good to be true\nIt's the real deal it's like a membership to a doctor's office you pay a monthly flat rate the Seventy dollars for unlimited visits and direct access to your doctor okay I made check this out you won't regret it stopped by brownstone total family health care or called two oh five\nTwo to five six five zero for more information\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nThat Mrs was also Richard Rice and our guest today is very Walker Walker law and ah we were having a conversation about nursing home liability and some of the\nThe misconduct that occurs in the industry or we want to continue that conversation and I'm a woman to put a question to to ah to bury about\nWhat it what what are some of the things that that we can do with you if you're someone who is spent time in a nursing home where you have a loved one that they would have some of the things that you would still those individuals that they can do to to going to protect themselves from these type of issues\nA great great question richer and the number one practical uh advice I Would give to anyone is be president be present day the president night\nAnd questioned richer and the number one practical uh advice I Would give to anyone is\nBe present be present day be president night or if the people who worked in a nursing home understand that you love your if you love your the resident there and you sit there and that\nYou're apt to show up to check on them a morning noon and night even in the middle of the night that person is an editor bully going to get better care\nIf someone is in a nursing home and they don't have a loved one coming up there to check on them to make the employees aware that they loved them care about them and demand they get proper treatment then they're more likely to get neglected uh likewise you got to be\nVery proactive in in speaking to the people in the nursing home and letting them know what your expectations are when you get care or you noticed here\nOr to your loved one in the home that is not what you expect in his not reasonable you got to make them aware of it if they're not responsive\nOr to your question to the needs of the resident then you're going to have to consider reporting it to an outside entity and in Alabama that would be the Alabama department of health okay and they have a hotline where when a nursing home residents is are
