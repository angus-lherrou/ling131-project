phrases\nFrom the yeah the history of things because you had to study English yeah before you because you wrote that is what Russian Spies do yes oh here we go\n[laughter] that's just a fact I'm yes All right well does go where they're from\nYeah it's it's it's a stems back to racing days because I go to in the store with a horse used to have a calming effect because there was like their buddies\nAnd if you wanted to ... ... it was a calming effect used before race so that the the horse would perform better but if you wanted to get someone's go get it out of the stall you would cause disruption to the horses mentality so you do get someone's guilt you disrupt the race\nOn this game show I could have been given an infinite number of guesses as to what that meant that would not have been able to produce that never that's\nGoing on I was going with the don't believe everything you read state\nYeah [laughter]\nOh well there you have the correct research team on getting a goat or both had you know there are things if people just said look I've got five more pages in his book somebody give me a phrase and I'll make\nIt sound like what I Would call a wreck con that it it was just a fun founding statement and then someone decided let's give it meaning and maybe never actually had that\nThat that's what I'm going with that and I'm like you know ... and ... usual it outside [laughter]\nGlasses [laughter]\nI can see through the older you are listening or evil made up\nThis phrase and went with a goat as an example of\nOf bothering someone throwing a goat at someone would bother getting there go getting that go I'm just saying like sometimes\nI'll do that with movies like Hollywood is in this whole thing now where they're coming out with prequels of things and it's what happened\nBefore what's the story before the story the problem if no one gave me for thought to that when they came up with the story and I gave me an example we've all heard of Batman right yes okay so he's got a butler named Alfred yeah read today they're coming out with a TV show of Alfred\nWhen he was a young man who was the butler\nBefore he was the butler what made him he was made him the goat before he got his ... you know I don't know I'm not saying it wasn't in your book Robert Watson you're guideline\nButler what made in ... he was\nMade him to go before he got his ... you know I don't know I'm not saying it wasn't in your book Robert Watson you're behind it and I got through\nBecause this website the Hindu dot com agrees with the [laughter]\nThe second one that pops up with just some dictionaries ... v Hindu dot com\nI don't know what to say to that what what's the basis the hint\nWhere I'm at I'm just saying that's where we get our information\nThey're claiming that this all happened as as the average just sort of go would make the horse moody yeah resulted did not perform well in the right there you go wow ... ...\nAmerican Horse racing I could be it could have been Indian or\nSo I Apologize we didn't believe you but we believe it hindered I don't [laughter]\n... right All right I'm ... I'm going to get back into the headlines and you tell me what gets your vote I rent if anything and if not then we're just going to pick something okay so just starting with what happened over the weekend we have\nShe just doesn't really pass the eyeball test and then I feel bad saying that I don't want to say you don't look Indian enough but that's basically where she gets so she's able to produce based on this expert\nThat to some way way way way back there somebody of native Native American ancestry but it doesn't matter the damage to her reputation has been done I feel kinda bad then was she was\nPocahontas before Trump later focus which I thought was the next level\nYeah I think if you can't even ... ... runners as runners route like a two thousand twelve good right up comes along and says we're gonna take it up to fold God [laughter] you're not even a real Pocahontas fake ... out of\nRespect for the real Pocahontas he needed to come out on the New York ... no one can misconstrue and think you know he's trying to lump in the fall into that I still want to ask this\nQuestion to all the Americans out there who were defending her which is not any Native Americans are original people's or whatever we're you know here's the other thing the Native Americans usually aren't the ones out they're changing their name\nOkay some tasty white folks go and that's just a bad name we need to change it to something else on the Indian wasn't good then it went to Native Americans in with the original people in the end of the Indians themselves with Native Americans\nLike wait a minute I Can't even remember what I was because I keep saying I'm going to\nWait a second I'm Sorry I I I totally um did not understand what you just said original Benita while they lived yeah is that a new name and then as\nA kid brought up they're not Native Americans there first nations people\nFirst nations people are you kidding me this has gone too far what's wrong with Native American goes by it's racist it's racist because we actually ...\nUsing it demean Indians and then once you use it enough now it is bad and you got to come up with a new one so you can be offended that no one using\nOkay so just um basically any name that designate someone\nI think we need a database because they have the kind of person who will call you what you want to be called because I don't want to hurt your\nFeelings with disease and she you know if you want to be you just tell me what you want to be Scott babysitting and I'm happy to do and when I open my own they didn't we [laughter] we\nAll need to have a database installed on our phone so you know who we\nNeed to have like a bar code if we could just put like a number on your if your lives are with six I think that it's not going to let me put it on the forehead or hardly even going to notice is that right they don't even have to find on a film and what you want to be called at that I write about\nFacial recognition perfect if we can put cameras up all over society so we could just keep watchful eye that's\nAll I just make or you're out of the line I hear ya\nIf I could you know what I Need is a brother like a pretty big brother big brother\nJust watch out for me everything either\nSo Scott you didn't see the video of that she put out there I don't think I did I Do I watched it with because one leading [laughter] to me is this the one where she was like walking down the road in Oklahoma you know and the chances are\nIf she has family from Oklahoma the chances are likely that she has some sort of Native American\nBlood ... but she put\nThat out there at the beginning when she went to Harvard in all of her claims on the school for them that's the problem and then she didn't back it up with any solid evidence do not I have a ... service\nJob because I'm a woman I Am a\nMinority you know first people yeah\nAnd all that evidence do not I have a ... service job because I'm a woman\nI Am a\nMinority you know first people yeah you got to watch the video was pretty compelling because what she says is a video made by her ... her pretty compelling and I should be based and you've got to watch it propagate okay was in the propaganda what the story she tells is that her sweet daddy\nLoves her sweet mama one was Nineteen the other one I didn't want to get her yet is totally so that you heard it is it's like one of the Olympics\nI don't have a rooting interest into Bob Costas tells me go to root for you know like they do the back story the montage\nBut yeah it given out by their bootstraps hook line and ... hours a week so in the video she says that her\nDad met her mom and it was love at first sight I'm a I'm a romantic kinda felon but dad's family white family didn't want him marrying mom\nOh so she's got some Romeo and Juliet and I know you get this guy you swallowed it I wasn't I couldn't get enough to get\nThis in the process of explaining why they didn't want him to marry into that family runs because there was way way way back some Native American blood flow to Sicily is race [laughter]\nAnd the court and that that [laughter] that is\nThat a family ... was it was a Trump supporter before the Trump [laughter] and then on the left the Native American side they're pro Obama now I understand the generations and generations before I'm just trying to paint the\nUnload how everybody knows everybody generations through three back you have to wait a minute you can't like that great I mean I Know she's ... like you are yeah\nBut three or four generations back there was some native I mean\nI guess I guess people just didn't move around a whole lot because it does seem like why are they who they who they even care who to Vicky how do they keep up to now twenty three amazing right yeah right they just had the oral history just fascinated that you just bought\nThe whole thing\nI Swear to God Bless her own all for me on the payroll that's why negative ever do [laughter]\nI Lived in listening to the lines of ... day waiting to weigh in on this I'm sure they've got something good to say Murphy there or is this Dave\n\nI'm Sorry Dave come on in in a set Russell straight he's falling for the propaganda\nWell it's all\nRight I squishy I Am squishy I Can't help it I just I just want to get along together long I'm gonna buy them\nOver understand\nToday what are you thinking about the whole have you seen the war in video and her claims what do you think\nI heard a highly only lived here all my hearing I Can't hear him\nOkay they'll have or do you like and you know the cabinet bully you know it's like a little personal history of our family long or or or or saw her on the side of the family Washington\nD. C. E. good the\nDay or is it well the lady that grandmother oh my God did not because yeah you\nKnow say now Dave I Want to stop because they had run through my mind I Am not\nConcerned about the racial heritage of anybody my children married but I'm probably draw the line at Yankee [laughter]\nIt was a real literally out together and another war in the family she flew to my mom's mother and\nLiterally you know in the south together and another war in the family she excluded my mom's\nMother and all of them from any family functions well the rumor got out because we have Bones Are my mom's side and I'll cheat bombs that were Indian and then then the rumors started that a background loader was said you off and that was actually in Indian\nWell mom loves Ninety five last year we did the twenty three and they come to find out my dad's family is about forty five percent American indian\nUh my mom's side of the families of high cheekbones comes from the the Europeans are Jewish or side of the family which was the Atkins which is the the German Jews\nAnd they normally have oddity chemo so worn in his talk you know off the top are buying all the time without any real factual evidence\nAnd you know just just saw on a political thing so I I you know I I just to have there is no literally there she needs to lie to you know it's just what I Want [laughter]\nYou finally got through it [laughter]\nThat's why he's in there like in a huge check in the U.S Senate huh\nYes uh oh they have an exclusive little clubs senators you know I'm military a standing committee or the senators or a Foreign Relations to me all of them get big bucks\nIt's I think you should watch propaganda he would feel better than it was the word I think so\nLots of propaganda that's what I Do [laughter] you\nKnow but you know it's just it's it's we've gone such a an ... low it's unbelievable\nYeah I don't think this is going to help her out I really relied on line with they wouldn't know\nHow to able to thread the needle because he says is the difference between DNA evidence and family oral history kind of be quote my truth who doesn't much matter if she has Native American heritage she was led to believe that he did and in some respects I was Steve\nMartin in the jerk I think so [laughter]\nThat's what I have a very poor black child [laughter] ... there's ... there's another story over daily go over\nThe average is so good from the genetic literacy project the average ... European American in North America has point one eight percent Native American DNA\nWe all have rate we all have and how the um yes trace by which is way\nMore than just climbing [laughter] more so the average wave or India which\nHuh well that would be interesting too because it will be coming over the border Murray long long time [laughter]\nSo it comes to you know your ethnicity and how it relates to college admission not just for a live with warm but Harvard admission trials or admissions go on trial as the university claims\nThat um it's All right for them to discriminate against Asian students to get more Hispanics\nOr African American has nearly the Asian kids have wonderful wonderful wonderful scores but they are taking up too many slots\nAt Harvard so Harvard is waiting things differently to include admission I guess that's why the Elizabeth Warren's of the world are judging ... goal or because they are going to lose out to the smarter Asians\nOr the moon wondering Martin Luther king that served as we needed to be judged by what we do Yahoo we our eyes on her care not when you're trying to get into Harvard in Maryland when you're trying to get a freebie yeah uh\nI Murphy thanks for the call appreciate it I don't know if that helped Russell at all but we're still working on him to see if he can see why I'm Warren I Know you feel sorry for her every month that they will ever be one one big doo doo [laughter] if you ask me in fact\nI'm the a a former campaign manager\nFor Barack Obama is already coming out and saying why Liz why or how now would you like to know what\nWould you like to know why because she wants to run against Trump and twenty twenty because she wants to take this off the table she's trying to get out in front of this to be settled the matter so she can run against him as a Democrat nominee\nYou made the right you may be right but when you do that don't you also time it for the sake of your own party and she's not changing parties\nAnd against him as a Democrat\nNominee you made the right you may be right but when you do that don't you also time it for the sake of your own party and she's not changing parties\nLike she's changing raises ill informed um she's not changing the party to hang up [laughter] so how is this helping her ... she didn't count on her party twenty she does not get out from November elections she only makes the whole party look I think\nUm she does not care about the ... tribe she cares about as her\nOwn political apparently everybody wants to be able to watch the video I mean Russell already said he was the video I water even wife there are leftist all across the country wants to be poor and I do have to correct something\nFor re election by the way I couldn't I don't know others are [laughter] I don't think so I haven't heard we've always said that she said\nThat she her high cheekbones what you look at the picture you're like wait where are these are cheekbones no she ... she did not have the quote that she's is in twenty twelve she's talking about her aunt now you tell me up this\nOkay I Know you I Know you always watch those TV okay okay\n'cause I have lived in a family that has talked about Native Americans talked about Dr says I had been a little girl I still have a picture on my mantle and it's a picture my mother had before that a picture of my grandfather and my aunt be has won by that picture at least a thousand dollars [laughter] you got\nI got as you do it in Andy Griffith Alexander so American believable savvy but she was\nNative American and she had an aunt me you can't\nBe more Americans can cross all of she can check all the boxes her uncle\nPaul Paul pop all had high cheekbones like all the Indians do because that is how she saw it and your mother got those same grade ... bones and added okay so maybe I'm trying to figure out if they have been had um she didn't have them\nSo it it sounds like warns bemoaning the fact she doesn't have ... I Can't figure it out from under served mother got the cheekbones but maybe a lizard but she wanted\nShe claimed the heritage and she's like why did a Passover me why don't I look like a Native American\nIf I have the ... ah that see\nIt's just it's it is sad I've been in here with you so long I'm almost ... where are you sure that within the typo that was an aunt pie for ... be ... be her cousin Opie I mean what I Would if we doubt Elizabeth Warren\nBut okay so that's how I promise I don't mean to go as liberal as you're pushing me but you all pushing pushing pushing me we're not draw you in fact\nThat I I don't want your facts about feeling [laughter] okay I Do feel bad you hear about this happening\nI hear about this happening in the African American community among black people that you're not black enough if your skin color is a dark and if you do have people their heritage is black their heritage is African American Scott if they don't quote unquote look black\nThey're not counted in some ways as black and I do feel bad for that kind of person it's like they're getting discriminated against potentially by white people and my black people so it's like you're you don't you feel like you never belong and I cannot feel bad for those kind of people and the guy who feels like he never belong\nAnd you took all of that from the black community and put it over with Elizabeth Warren who's a U.S senator [laughter]\nI work at Harvard I've had like a meat because she's saying she's saying I well\nThat works because it had to do that via with the river was she would have been killed according to her propaganda film which I thought it was ... be told me that oh by the photo debate as it was part of the times then there are genetic heritage I\nIt was her family history she's told yeah your mom's side came from ... from Native American your daddy side is white\nAnd then their genetic heritage I it was her family history she's told yeah your mom's side came from ... from Native American\nYour daddy side is white you are part of this you're all these things and she looks in the mirror and she doesn't see that she only sees the white side of thing which is oppressive and so then you have three Thirty years later three ... three decades later you have the president calling her fake and calling her mom a liar and I just feel bad\nI okay do you feel bad enough that you think President Trump should pay the one million dollars that he no he was\nHe was pretty sad because he said I Can't imagine\nA presidential debate with her in which I Would say let's have a test and so it was it wasn't like in the future ... does she have a million dollars worth of proof\nAh\nYou know what I'm saying I'm sure that up past not pastor preacher pastor preacher no professor\nCarlos Bustamante if I call him up is not doing the DNA tests for me the guy from Stanford\nIs that what do you how do you go to a guy from Stanford that's one of the war you had to watch propaganda video because he says he was chosen because he\nDid work for twenty three and me a good word that he worked for ancestry dot com and they needed someone to come along and say there's a good chance yeah\nThat yeah he said there's a good chance but it was very vague if you ask me he didn't say oh by the way we traced it to your great great great great grandfather on your mother's side whatever\nThe reasons here's what I said this what is he said look now he's not talking to live with when he's talking to the staff does not look or who who would be a staffer for a living with\nA bit [laughter]\nAlmost everybody has some Native American and Beppe said can you say that I Need you to say that it just says are good yeah so you're telling me there is a good chance and he's like skin to get out my office where you just said and so he said there was a good chance\nThat does hurt your business model if you're selling ancestry results to say we all have a little bit of something then all of us because that's not what we're looking for looking for for that definitive answer of where she was not able to produce she was able to defend reproduce generations way back there\nMay not have that right there in meeting this after all that and that that you did I didn't realize that you had to go through all that is what I'm saying you feel badly she ended up a road of the audio do you think she was flown\nOut there to Oklahoma on her own oh after will know what I'm saying that the last six or seven years she's been trashed\nFor her family history she could have put it all to rest if she had one\nProduce proof of why in ... and is convinced that she's got Native American blood pressure on them and say I'm Sorry I I just was speaking out of um a family lore and I really had no business claiming it on all the forms I put it on and and getting the perks\nBut then she would have to give back the money and she's a Democrat by giving them\n... right yeah so she's she was yeah\nI feel the world now I'm trying I'm trying to carry the water for that party I'm try and Republican I don't Republican by profession\nAnd makes her great just called and she's probably got a
