I'll be great I'll be fire a better man than me 'cause you can give me that much notice [laughter] stuff I'm breaking [laughter]\nThe message that the industry the buddy like that's the that's the radio a lot of times you don't get any notice either getting oh notice or you know you you get and\nYou know the least at least they're giving you enough time to say goodbye to you to listen through you know what I'm saying that is a big deal right there\nWhere it's not just hey okay I'm going to see you later swallow that\nI'm about to but I thought now I got to listen to Rush Limbaugh thank\nMs don't do it I guess I promise I'll talk to somebody\n[laughter] oh gospel and now we do\nYeah I mean you're sitting there ... I mean you're ... that was worth basin right there I was a good you know I learned from that well I I don't have to reverse named him when I learned from ... I mean I Would sit there I remember doing my first ... legs\nDidn't matter\nWelcome to the show [laughter]\nI was going to not know what you mean oh ...\n\nOh fudge that will tell\nI'm with you yes a radio station costs X amount of money yes you got wide number of listeners yes if you're listening to talk radio you got a job yes which may have some money I'm with you\nWhat I'm saying is we put our money where our mouth is and we get together you know sell shares I don't care how you split it up Chris Read or write some papers\n[laughter] I don't go together\nAnd will form a corporation you could call it the Phoenix risen from the ...\n[laughter]\n[laughter] oh man\nCork the only thing is and and I you know what that your\nTone right there in your will to like that that kinda\nParagraph right there I'm going to cut that out because I Love that because it explains to me how much our listeners avid this station and this was a decision that was made dine ready to go was the decision not done by anybody here in Birmingham it was that was done by\nMade a decision and corporate job is to make as much money for its investors is it can make for its investors and I respect that I Do I ... at heart I'm an evil capitalistic okay\nAnd if that ... that's what they thought they had to do then that's what they thought they had to do and that's it's literally their business okay what I'm saying is the platform is too important to let go if you're a regular listener you ought to be willing to put\nWhat I'm saying is the platform is too important to let go if you're a regular listener you ought to be willing to put some skin in the game if he basically I mean you know\nWhere are you out on that day and it's not a bad idea where you add on that\nWe don't have come up with a hundred percent of what a radio station costs you know you come up with forty percent of what it costs and I promise you wouldn't find a bike alone this arrest\nOlive Clarke I ... I think you I'm going to cut that up and I'm going to strengthen the high up [laughter] oh\nWell I mean you know if they want and they want and if they don't want to and then you know I understand that's their business but uh you know it is doable we don't have to go to a pod cast or a straight up and out oh now the\nProblem is I see it as I don't know how many states you're going to get with a hundred thousand walk past the not many and uh\nYou know I I Know that there are other talk stations in the Birmingham area I Can't listen to them because I live way up here in the hinterlands and I don't get their second\nOh\nLet's you know I mean the business model is viable\nYou know\nYou all are making money you're just not making as much money as they want to make and I and again that's their business I'm not throwing off on them you know it's their job to run their business the way they think it needs to be run but what I'm saying is we could put something together they could be done\nCar brother things will be call buddy regard to send him\nA one more call let's go to Brian Brian with somebody will come in\nYes sir I just wanted to make a quick comment or in response to a [noise] a low information or Robert called in earlier and he said something about uh the station needs to [noise] um the fire and give other voices or\nA ... well my response to Robert is\nRobert de ... you need to get that message out to all of the extremely biased one sided anti God newspapers and TV networks all across the United states and then I Would agree with you\nBrian and Brian thanks so much with the governor of robberies other great point you're talking about national media you're talking about we are the kind of media here went on superstation that people are afraid of\nThat and and let me put it into this kind of thought bubble for you because I'm not talking about we're not a pitch fork mob we're not going to go to\nBig jazzy Davis bar and grill and all get together and then go out and do something we're the kind of media that people like Doug Jones and people like the Democratic Alabama party think twice about\nBecause look what we did last week we flooded Doug Jones a number we flooded Doug Jones Twitter we flooded are Doug Jones\nAny kind of Google Search you did because it popped up and yellow hammer news and also this or this other article that put it up there my tweet um my pod cast everything that that it may be and what did we do we now look we didn't change anything but but that wasn't the point we wanted to put pressure to see what he would do under pressure\nAnd I think we're the kind of medium that makes it a very like uncomfortable to be against sometimes\nAnd other media or other radio stations or other TV stations will get nervous about what they're doing but I feel like one on one super station we do a good job about doing what we want and standing for what we believe in I think at the end of the day we always stand for when we believe in\nAnd super station we do a good job about doing what we want in standing for what we believe in I think at the end of the day we always stand\nFor what we believe in um it's just one of those things where\nYou know like that's just that that's that's what's going on and I'm kind of showing you how the uh ... what does that saying big Dave how the putting has made or whatever it is\nThe sausage how the sausages made yes well the thing about ...
