shouldn't be watching it a little kid anyway\nBut as a little kid that was like the first scary movie I watched and they'd have haunted me ever since I kinda feel like I Need to face my fear and go

going to see The Exorcist sometimes sometimes I just make really bad decisions now they come from the right place I got I mean well I mean no harm but it just goes the wrong way and I will get the real news here in America but let me tell the story because this is just you\nKnow this kind of sums up my life at times\nI think I'm making one is a really smart decision Lisa but apparently it is wrong so I used to be in ministry at a youth ministry\nAnd then I did campus ministry and it's like college ministry and we would have this thing on Sunday night so that we called movies with a message now it's not meant to be a church services just hey\nStudents are coming back from having gone home or they're getting back\nOn campus getting ready for the new week uh we had our main worship services on Thursday nights but on Sunday nights we would gather together small group of us watch a movie and find the religious themes in there so you can watch a a a sports movie or a drama maybe even a comedy and just find religious themes they're in\nBut there was a time when The Exorcist was re released\nAnd thought it's a scary movie from the Nineteen seventies I'd never seen it how scary could it be\nLike what a great opportunity for us to go basically the college Bible study led load up it'll be me and it turned out to be like a bunch of college girls let's go see The Exorcist and then we'll have like a nice conversation over coffee ... that did not go well [laughter]\nI Wish your story would just you know this that was the end\nOf it didn't go oh no oh no we went we went and

I mean\n... ... to shoot exactly are you going next is the brand name but hey the offspring\nWill work one of the things I enjoy about radio is getting to say things publicly that you ought not say in private you know it's kind of backwards I'm about to tell you about to make a confession so now\nI'm there have been times in my life where I've just use paper towel for everything and I just mean everything um I moved into a new place recently and I didn't have any towels and it was going to be about a week before I can get to the store and so paper towels were available and so it's fine just you know you either get it done\nSo problem they're rather absorbent is one of selling [laughter] lord fraction we'd go to Clark Clark have you ever used a paper towel in the shower [laughter]\nYou know I have never I Know you know self Jane alive buddy it's amazing I have\nUsed them on a case in the hands of the kitchen sink right and then looked at it and go and you know that's just a little well set than ever to decide\nOh job be bad guy oh I'm with the clock I get it I get it done that you are\nOkay can we talk for a second I've got a member of my family and now this is maybe why he owns two homes but he is he is the wealthiest person in my family\nBut he will reuse a paper towel every single time I'm like come on who you're worse than a million dollars so we really have to remove every single paper tablet he'll do that so that's why he's yeah I'm sure that's\nWhy so what you're telling me that the difference between me and a condo on the beach is a use too many bounty dishes\nNoel ways not not okay card what'd you go about my friend go right ahead\nSo well and the first place is kind of like radios super all star team go on there today\nWe're having a good time [laughter] pretty\nCool oh foot the caravans headed our way from down south or I think about that just a minute okay\nNow we have a group of disenfranchised downtrodden people\nWho's living conditions were they were or not acceptable presumably because of a corrupt government is that correct probably sell\nOkay where are the people and the cities in America that are living in equally to horrible conditions where do they go on their caravan get away\nFrom the deplorable conditions are living under because ... with the city government\nThey're going to have to come to the south or go to the heartland I\nSaw a statistic earlier today that sixty\nPercent of the U.S population is governed by Democrats that you think of the the big metropolitan areas by and large they are governed by Democrats mostly on the east coast and the west coast the middle of America\nAnd the south is largely Republican but the majority of citizens in our country and then even those who are here ah you know visiting are governed by Democrats\nWell you know when we look at the uh I have a picture of it on my phone after the two thousand\nBurned by Democrats\nWell you know when we look at the uh I have a picture of it on my phone after the two thousand and six selection of you know the red versus the blue areas\nRight\nAnd when you look at those blue areas I mean think about how many people are water up in a tiny little areas and\nYeah they must I living on top of people I mean part of it you know I can see this is if we will take a minute to to kind of go philosophical here I think in some respects\nYou know we give the Democrats a hard time because what they've done some of these big cities but because you do have people stacked on top of people on top of people on top of people it does feel like you have to have in some respects more government regulation than you might want simply because it's so crowded\nWell I think that's the model that Democrats would happen in our country you know you stop and think about it when you get that many people want to do and to a small area like that\nThe government can provide so much more for those people then when you have people spread out and I can't see one another's houses\nI mean it really is strange to think about living in America how I guess we can vary so greatly in our living conditions so you can live in a big city you're there in the inner city\nCompared to where I'm from you know rural part of Georgia where you really can have acres and acres of land and you you keep to yourself and you want the government to leave you alone because\nYou have your own little bit of paradise if you're living in a rural part of Alabama you compare that to part of a gigantic city where you're on the Seventy fourth floor of a high rise yeah you you you can't be like you need people to call I guess the more regulations but it is frustrating I Would not want to live in that sort of\nInvolved no no neither would I but once you create a situation where the government can provide so many things for people it will provide them and you get the ... the situation that's much more easier to uh control people work together controls everything that they're dependent on\nGood call Clark thank you buddy nine four one one oh one one toll free one eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three big debut ever lived in a big city or no no would you ever want to live in a big no\nWith no Lucia how much you temporarily gambling in Orlando sort of yeah All right so but I had six roommates so that isn't that a lot of people ...\nDid you ever want the government to come in and kind of settled the score when you have like the one dirty roommate of somebody who's eating your groceries\nNo but very quickly I Will tell you that we did have had that discussion thing that happened you have they sent the most attractive person they could find with a basket full of chocolate he's like ladies I think we can all working\nIt is funny because I mean I I applaud people who are so comfortable with themselves that they're happy to be negative here's what's strange to me\nI grew up with an older brother and we shared a room never one time in my life that I see my older brother and they could never one time in his life do you make it yeah\nThat's how it in as a sophomore in college I was in a ... I went from dorm life to apartment life yes with three other guys so I brought one of my buddies and then we met up with an old like childhood friend and he brought one of his buddies but that\nKind of a fourth guy who we didn't know love being naked that he was a military guy and I you know God love them for that so we were all Nineteen Twenty years old had gone to college right out of high school\nOut of high school he went and served in the military right so now he's late twenties coming back on the GI Bill and\nI mean he's seen things he's done things you know people I Know that he was not a problem for him but it was for me because he would be nude not in his bedroom he would be a mood as\nI'm trying to you have a hotdog and watch Jerry Springer between classes so I remember he committed and they'd be like fresh out of the shower he\nPut like one foot up on the lazy Boyd kinda to outlaw we are now allowed to begin to what is that a lot of room [laughter] I'm like I like to think of as lays out of the living room if he wasn't goes on you out of that would be great but\nWhat's strange big day is if you do come home at times to strange roommate and or neighbor behavior and we'll take your calls at dawn for one one on one one but you see straight\nAt times to strange roommate and or neighbor behavior and we'll take your calls at nine four one one on one one but you see strange neighbor or roommate behavior so we had this guy late twenties GI Bill out of the military and we're still buddies we actually communicate it on\nFacebook a week or so ago um but I came home to him\nHe was into the highland games like this is Scott Scott is sort of\nGames like oh you're you're throwing the telephone pole they called the ... on your where the guilt\nHe loved Braveheart more than anything else he loved the Bible which is fantastic Andy Love to be naked so you had to be careful when you're coming home because he'd be in his room\nBy himself without closing clothing Bible\nStudy Braveheart bagpipes playing and you know you may need something from like hey where'd you put this bachelor but you're going to get a life also you've got to be careful ... man a man and so one time\nI came home and was not in the middle of the day it was in the evening and there's like bizarre music playing and I walk in and we're all Christians but all the different kind of various ways and different expressions yeah\nBut I Walk in and two of my roommates one including the naked guy who thanks Lewis wearing clothes at the\nTime is seated at the dinner table the lights down low invites me and the other room mate with the other is also there with them I Would like for us to have communion together\n[laughter] so well and good dude if you have to you and I just got out of class warfare you'd [laughter]\nBut he was such an interesting do it's just wild so um I don't know exactly how we got there from the the conversation about rural versus urban areas no but it is true\nYou know you just you just live on top of people are right next to people is just kind of wild ...\nAnd yo yo to live some interesting lobster in college\nBecause you didn't have as much of that ... know that the reason you don't think you have is because you were that guy you were probably do all these crazy things probably are not want to come to be American right [laughter] you know so are you are not up to no good that's good\nI mean there's guys having communion I mean he didn't mean any harm by the way you all maintenance already but there is a difference between naked and neck you know ways at the same thing now what's the difference naked and you don't have ... okay ah which I'm not really loving this conversation but I'm not going to hear [noise]\nNeck it is when you don't got clothes on and you're up to no good [laughter] okay that is that my parents helped me\nDrugs to know in the ... the second one [laughter] it's the naked or naked truth here\nOn the force I got any
