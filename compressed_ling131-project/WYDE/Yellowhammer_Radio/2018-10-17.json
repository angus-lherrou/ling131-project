four years of Mississippi State and is now a golf pro at a a local predominant golf golf course\nSmokes every day contrary to most beliefs it's not affected his life goals that's pretty impressive\nIt's a pretty solid I Wish I knew what to golf courses I so I could go and a part talk with them that are going to laugh at a bit from a funny though funny the\nAt the Fort faction rooms where it's all at the Ford faction and at the Ford brown my personal account um as well\nAnyways I just I see this and obviously I'm I'm trying to play it off a little bit like I'm trying to um be funny as well but\nThe the these massive lines outside of the Canada marijuana shops and this this uproar about ah Canada is now the second country in the world to legalize recreational marijuana and open stores at midnight Wednesday to serve the\nThe the lines of keen pot smokers\nI think they're the first G. seven or G. six nation when it whatever we are there the first nation to do that but the second country\nOr to record or legalize recreational marijuana Canadian should now in theory be able to buy canvas and cannabis all from license producers at various retail locations\nSo highly doubt you're going to be able to walk into a target right and buy marijuana like you're probably going to have to go through like a real deal like smoke shack or something like that\nHowever it remains illegal to process more than thirty grams of cannabis in public grow more than four plants per household or buy from an unlicensed dealer so there still are some oh there's still some downsides to this hurricane Britain\nProcess more than thirty grams of cannabis in public grow more than four plants per household and buy from an unlicensed dealer\nStores in the countries um\nEastern most province Newfoundland opened at the stroke of midnight to serve the accused of customers hoping to partake in the report token the nation's historic day in the city of St john's hundreds of customers are lined up around the block and all the main commercial drag\n'em as the clock struck midnight you all the pictures and those are actually pretty incredible\nIt's like prohibition on wheat or forty six year old added we just made history I Can't believe we did it all the years of activism paid off\nCannabis is legal in Canada and everyone should be should come to Canada and enjoy our candidates are trying to think of a way to put cannabis in Canada together Canada's Canada's now legal I just I see stuff like this and like I get it\nI I understand that's forty six year old super excited that he can now like smoke we eat on the weekends with ... with I'm I'm sure just his dog a maple you know you know automatic I'm sure he's excited to do that but like at the same time you talk about my years of activism\nLike you're like why would you take ... years of activism to make sure we the legal in Canada like do you even get in trouble and Canada like and I'm not even trying to be funny like other than mount these like what else are in Canada did get you in trouble you know like the ...\nLike and I'm not even trying to be funny like other than ... like what else are in Canada to get you in trouble you know like the ... with um the the maple leaf on their hat and\nAn on their shoulder and and instead of guns they carry maple syrup like you know what I'm Talking to like the ... like do you get in trouble in Canada for literally anything like I don't know maybe that's just me being a dumb southerner\nBut seriously what what goes on in Canada um that the biggest activism\nA counter riot or the or the activism that really paid off is making Canada is legal in Canada like that's pretty incredible and like I'm not even past this whole this was prohibition years of prohibition like can you imagine if we had a country with no I'll go\nLike her Cambridge can you imagine if we had a country with no alcohol\nI guess if we never had it when they said ... I don't know prohibition they'd be sneaking around somewhere somehow high schoolers figure out how to get alcohol so alcohol would\nCome in somehow some way some form eight six six five five one nine nine thirty three oh Jonathan are you on your way to cannabis Canada right now or or what what are you doing how you're going\nI'm Still trying to get back to Alabama [laughter] although buddy\n[noise] no I mean [noise] I don't know I guess you know walking in the store you know asking for a pack of Scott but one hundred and sent us all fat you know I mean that that might make over some folks man but you definitely\nDon't want to show drivers they ever starting on that 'cause I mean we already charred ... I mean look at it so we already tired hungry Munch off in a little bit [laughter]\nI just I see this and I think to myself [noise]\nAnd I lost my job I see this and think to myself\nIf you were going to tell one nation it's okay to wreck or make it recreational like you can smoke pot and your ... like that is going to lead somewhere else like like if you give up on a law that you had in place\nLike it's just going to chip away more chip away at the old block the drugs aren't as bad now give you this\nIf we can get a handle on our on our pharmacy drugs like if we can get a handle on like our pain killers and our opioid crisis I'd legalize we like I Would give that trade off\nI Would rather see a candidate shop um built right next to my apartment then to think that we still have so many people die of opioids every\nEight six six one nine nine thirty three months we got about a minute brother what's up buddy\nI just find it interesting that freedom to get stone but if a man ... straight from the Bible against homosexuality he goes to jail\nAnd if there's anything good about the programs they'll make something bad about it\nBut uh you just because of the states have individual rights to run it the way they want to and I believe that's I'd leave within two months I Believe in January\nOf this next year we're going to see Trump go ahead because the ... and he's going to go ahead and put medical nationwide and then put recreational up to the states because of the world Health Organization or just came out last month and said that marijuana is not a schedule one drug it never has been\nSeventeen what Eighteen countries now that habit nothing's happened then looks at the data\nFor years here see we own the patent on it but we block to American doctors from doing any research we block research and what happened a few years ago was doctors started leaving and going to Israel because Israel is the one that uh\nUh is allowing all this research and they could block American doctors from doing it but they couldn't block the data that came back to us\nFrom American doctors doing it somewhere else that was that even the playing field and so they all of this medical data that we're getting now in the end they'll condemn an oil system Harvard Med and three others are the only ones that are teaching and now it's so advanced it was ... and\nYou know it was like ... ten years ago when we were trying to figure out what to do with the uh\nI'm a bird flu and they'll say well we don't know anything about these viruses all the species collapsing at school and then the ducks now and so forth and well what do we do we better learn up on it so right now we're in the stages\nOf a Mexican doctors they don't know they give you a wink and a nod\nAt but they can't ... there's a chance you can lose your credentials and and become a license to practice\nDoctors they don't know they give you a wink and nod\nAt but they can't ... there's a chance you can lose your credentials and and become a licensed to practice if you advocate for marijuana or discuss it with a ...\nSo that's see that's that's really interesting but I think at the end of the day like if they if they were to go like not ... at least like medical like I I look I get that I understand that anything to get us like kind of away from these\nThis opioid epidemic where where'd you come in and you got a pain will just going to give you a a Viking right we're just going to give us to go down and we're going to put you out of the door I I think\nThat would be helpful and I also think on a state level talking about like recreational or some sort of recreational use like I'm all for states having the rights to do what they want\nYou know what I mean like I'm all for if Alabama doesn't want to do something and they vote no on it fine but if never wants to or a Colorado wants to do it then that's like a bargain so does it won't we eat and they vote sixty five to thirty five no\nRight then okay then they won't do it but in another state can and if you don't like it then go to the other states like I Love the state's rights part I'm about that I just it's such like a gray area like what was the last thing we really made legal again you know like um\nI don't know you can't really compare to net neutrality but like if you go back to like prohibition and like we're alcohol came back like what what what was the big\nKicker from it because you still do everything you can and your power to say hey don't get behind the wheel or hey don't smoke cigarettes but you still sell cigarettes and you still sell alcohol and and people can have eight ten drinks before they get cut off\nAt bars and restaurants and places like that and and I mean just because it's out there doesn't mean that you can't police the way it's used or the way people use it in public as well so I I don't have a huge problem with it\nWhat what I Do have a A N and obviously I open my show in a very I was trying to be funny like I was trying to make a point you know but like\nI Would I Do have a problem is where you know a a if it's illegal on the federal level and the state says yeah we're going to do it anyway\nYou know what I mean I I Do have a problem with that but on the state level states' rights ... letting the state or choose what it wants to do or late in the states to choose where it stands on on either side of the aisle on a position I Do enjoy that\nI agree with you a hundred percent I've lived in Texas before they had dry counties and there was no alcohol sold at all\nAnd I believe something like that with the states do get to decide on say the recreational marijuana thing that it should be not only state that the county should the county should be allowed and even the city you should be allowed and how they wanted them a lot I Believe it goes down to that point where people can\nA controlled that you'd be free but still be able to control your environment to the like minded\nYou know if you've got a bunch of donors over here in this county and you've got a liquor store on every corner of that city that's fine with me and my kids don't want to live there\nWe want to live over here so will gravitate to the\nYou know the like minded people that way and\nUh the opioid thing I'll tell you where I made a mistake to is because I prescribe them before we didn't realize that they work they work really good but everything's spiritually has to be okay with the person if you've got a patient who's angry\nMaybe they've lost a leg and a motorcycle accident or learn acts that were loving them was lost and they're dealing with those issues they take the opioids sometimes when they're not feeling the pain from injury as much as ... feeling the pain from their unsealed\nYou take the opioids sometimes when they're not feeling the pain from their injury as much as they're feeling the pain from their unsealed spirituality\nAnd that's where it takes them mobile it's not the physical a problem you're dealing with its debt spiritual problems that they have because they're hurting and something needs to be fixed and it seems like the opioid provides relief from that one doesn't it's actually sucking Yemen into a very dark so\nMight take so much for the call buddy mix them and good to talk to you thank you\nEight six six five five one nine nine three three
