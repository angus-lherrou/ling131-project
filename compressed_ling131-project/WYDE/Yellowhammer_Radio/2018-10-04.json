career in order\nTo ours yet but I Want to be like\n[laughter] you know you're you're ... you're behaving in a very respectful respectable manner you know I I'm not arguing for being labeled as social

like a game I Need an of apple by the last three hours let's get back to the phones Clark welcome Russell be big day here on board faction\nHey Russell puppy so you've got me completely intrigued bell who do you think the surprise hold\nOut now don't laugh don't laugh because I Know he's offered indication that he's going to vote yes\nBut I think Ben Sasse\nOf Nebraska I think there's a possibility\nHe's voting no on this this weekend now he's already made mention last night on the Senate floor and he urged President Trump all the way back in June when he got wind that Brett Kavanaugh might be his pick\nFor the Supreme Court he said don't do it he said the me too movement is strong we can't handle a male nominee that might have to face accusations and he went on to say not that he knew of any accusations that would come to ward Brett Kavanaugh\nBut he just didn't think this was the right time to pick a man he didn't say didn't give us the name of the woman he would prefer\nBut if he can be believed that he warned the President Trump then he's not particularly happy with the handling of some of the treatment that the accuser a Dr Ford has received\nI wouldn't be surprised if ...\nSaturday afternoon or evening when it comes from the votes if he doesn't do a John McCain with Obamacare or Ted Cruz at the convention and vote no I just want to put that out here two days before the possible but\nI think you could be right you know\nA couple of things one if Donald Trump had nominated and you're telling me Berg from jump\nStreet do you think she's already confirmed or would they assert out another bunch\nAnd you come from jump street do you think she's already confirmed or what they heard out another bunch assertion that against the poll on the amount of time they had\nI think there would still be shenanigans I Do I I don't think that anyone was going to get the um\nThe the easy glide and and the reason for that is because the confirmation of whoever this next justice will be is going to change likely the makeup of the Cornell and when Anthony Anthony Scalia\nPassed away he was a very conservative justice so we knew we were going to get another conservative justices didn't change the balance of things but when my when moderate Kennedy\nIs retiring then if you bring someone more conservative yeah the Democrats are going to put up a bigger fight than they might have a year ago\nWell OK I'm thinking lumber one\nAt this point for whatever the polling is worth and it does not support what the level of like it too so I think it's more than likely accurate but uh we got a lot of following that they have lost women with\nThat may be here's what I Would say I I think that Ben Sasse very well could vote it sounds like he's already indicated that he would I just wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't\nI don't think that President Trump is helping things when he goes out and you know I understand some people don't want to say he was mocking Dr Ford but whatever he was saying wasn't helping there are Republicans who want to confirm Kavanaugh who don't want to be linked\nWith Trump and I'm already I've gone on my paper here in big bold letters post Trump positioning\nNow been fast I think at some point it's probably going to want to run for president and will want to align himself with Trump when necessary but not all the time I wouldn't be surprised if he voted no here and a couple of days\nIt could happen you know I think Donald Trump has to be Donald Trump part of the time\nOh it's just you\nKnow there's only so much constraints that we can expect from him\nYeah and he didn't go crazy eat it and I mean you know you had a moment of fun it's fine but ah I just don't I think in this moment\nOf you know intrigued not quite sure where the babies are going to go I just I'm not convinced that he's helping himself he may be making the base happy\nBut if you're an undecided vote and you've you feel the pressure if you're a Senator Flake from Arizona and you're having women confront you in the elevator do you want Trump out there a day or two before you vote and you that'd be one of the final things you do as a senator do you want to be linked to that my ... my answer would be no\n... yeah I got to agree there although I don't really like march or in any way I think that what she said that's what it is like you\nThat makes sense but then you do have people coming out saying man he was a fall down drunk he was a crazy drink I don't know if the guy was or not and you ... your point a lot of people have done those sorts of things I'm not saying he should not be confirmed based on that\nBut uh those things are\nProblematic let's get back to the phones to oh five nine four one one zero one one toll free one eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three Ryan in a moment but we begin with Jamie here Jamie welcome to the Ford faction Russell being big Dave here\nHey you guys are you doing we're doing well thanks for calling in I'm In ... years in Alabama is just raw and I'm Still in the ... states it's rarely and I and what I was looking for was it was you know the capital and I got a year but\nI mean this this radio so she goes or idle all fall or smoke [noise]\nAnd I have also be able to see a lot well I guess so\nWell we say welcome to the party [laughter] we're happy to have you been offering my views on what I think might happen this weekend I'm not telling you that the cabinet confirmations won't take place but I think there's going to be a Republican or two who might surprise us with a no vote do you have a sense of what you think's going to happen here and a couple of days\nYeah uncle or with your fingers on his part in the crowd of ...\nYou know from the crowd I mean I Hope that we don't have one like that but\n[noise] yep at that site that you know there's there's somebody that you try to do\nAnd I feel like we're in such an interesting time as Ben Sasse was saying with the meat\nIt's a lot of trauma\nAnd I feel like we're in such an interesting time as Ben Sasse was saying with the me too movement with the way the media is portraying those who vote for Kavanaugh\nThe way that people do want to stand out from the crowd and honestly I think I Want to position themselves for their political life after President Trump I just think we might get a vote no from someone who doesn't want to be associated with this mess who doesn't want to be associated\nWith Donald Trump necessarily and some of the things he said or done it's not that they don't like Brett Kavanaugh I think they just for themselves might vote no\nNeed to be careful though you know Booker up like he killed himself as part of this\nMoment [laughter] that was funny now I helped me here because ah his his thing was he was going to defy process and Eve welcome to be thrown off the committee ... censor him as a senator and he's going to release top secret private classified emails which come to find out had already been ... released correct\nCorrect I mean is typical of show ...\n[laughter] they get on my nerves [laughter] hey man I appreciate the call thank you for doing it in and I hope you call back\nTomorrow I'll be filling in for Ford again tomorrow thing or are these abbreviated buddy phone number here two oh five nine four one one zero one one toll free one eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three Russell pie and for a for today let's get to the phones we got Ryan welcome to the show\nHey yo hey Russell hey buddy and they say my favorite and uh\nSo I was looking at a food there's drinking anything and they have a blast failures drinking and about his line I think what they're trying to get I is that they're trying to make it sound like\nIt was lonely because you know people say they say about ... he tried to make yourself look like an angel or something like that and she never NATO yourself like an angel but he said he was never black guy drink or are you going to\nSay and I'm thinking of ... biology he\nSaid he ... he but he has you know a lot of the day they're trying to make history and the ... you know she would be and why don't say that he was actually blackout drunk\nI and I think I think you're a hundred percent right now it's having this conversation with a friend of mine and I do think it's possible but the thing is possible\nThat Brett Kavanaugh in these questions was perhaps less than a hundred percent truthful\nAnd the reason he was doing it not to cover for bad behavior\nBut because he could see the trap that the Democrats were trying to set for him because he asked if he admitted to having one too many drinks and he says what that number is if he admits to maybe being a little fuzzy about something as a junior in college and then they're going to say see if it happened\nIn college it very well could have happened in Nineteen eighty two and we think you did this so it's one of those it's kinda like if you've ever taken one of these personality test\nAnd you know if you answer a certain way you know the conclusion that will be drawn and it's hard not to to jump ahead instead of just answering the question you know that the Democrats on that panel are trying\nTo set a trap for Kavanaugh he's a smart guy he's a lawyer he's a judge he knows how this works and so he could tell I Believe by the questions they were asking\nHim what if I say it this way then they're going to use it against me and I do think he was trying to wiggle out of some things that probably weren't the worst in the world\nBy the questions they were asking him well if I say it this way then they're going to use it against me and I do think he was trying to wiggle out of some things that probably weren't the worst in the world but he may have got caught anyway\nYeah like it's like if you or something if they are partially true so that you are telling the truth you're just went on the ...\nRight right um we shall see and some of the some of the things he\nClaimed or a little more innocent some of these terms devil's triangle and bobbing are moving or whatever you know I don't know what they meant to him but apparently they mean other things do a lot of people so I don't know if you ask the and grow to\nKnow that like for example the word used to ride it you know you know ... ... ... you know at first they practice and it's actually said to me yet they turn actually want to have people in Haiti\nIt could mean anything to a completely different than the adventures different than the ...\nYeah so the question but I'm not whether if it were different ... yeah the question becomes not whether it was different usage but whether he is now\nTelling the truth about what it meant to him in the moment so I can turn yeah we'll say thank you for the call Ron I Do appreciate it recipe big day here in the Ford facts and taking your calls two oh five nine four one one one one or two a free one eight six
