made out of ... we will ah we will have to fact check that we don't want to be fake news about the whale blubber I Do think\nHaving watched the movie fight club years ago where Brad Pitt is making soap and I do feel like they talk about using fat maybe human fat for so which is odd to think about oh I'm not sure that that's true it's true that that was in the movie it's true that that was the claim being made but I don't know well blubber for the uh the ...\nThat is good at Jessica have you seen the video of the Canadian karate kid\nAh don't think so yeah All right let me we're going to kind of take our time with this one okay let me describe him to you in school you don't have to close your eyes but You're welcome to I'm a good nice and slow here okay so we're in Canada they give a guy probably late twenties [noise] pardon me late twenties early thirties\nLips pierced oh wait both of them is bottom lips ... okay a little bit of facial hair he's got glasses kind of a dark room to glasses dude he's wearing a purple hoodie\nAnd he worked for the hair salon okay honey up the no the hook I don't think that he's ... he's got the zip up I got windbreaker purple thing with the smog sarcastic hipster smile on his face\nCanadian the karate kid roundhouse kick a pro life protester he\nSays he's trying to kick the phone out of her hand he missed the phone [laughter] kicked the girl [noise] here's what I don't understand by all accounts it would appear that he's there\nTo support pro choice people right he wants to buy into that he is here a defender of women right how does the show that he gets caught on camera basically dropped kicking in the face [laughter] a pro life support [laughter] [noise] so he's there\nI Would imagine looking for a date he cut fair he's a Canadian karate kid\nHe has a purple hoodie on this look on his face and the woman holding the camera that gets kicked\nIs them she herself is pro life she is filming some pro choice protesters he doesn't take to that he looks at her sticks his tongue out to one side like look how cute I Am and he's so what\nYou're saying is if if a girl gets raped in at this and that and the baby should be\nKept alive and she's like yes it's a baby why would you kill the baby I'm Sorry that this rape habit you know it it was all about twenty five thirty seconds long and then instead of continue with the debate did get this bizarre grin on his face\nSticks his tongue out to one side like he's Michael Jordan preparing to do a slam dunk from the for the free throw line\nAnd then does around the house karate kid kick not kicking the [laughter] the woman's hand but no woman to the ground\nWell okay wait and defense is that he was trying to kick the phone out of her head out and the defense he offered as she's laying on the ground [laughter]\nIf if that's your ultimate goal is to get the phone out why not just like snatch it why not leave it alone is that your phone service and let's just those ... and looked at our sanity address right why why go to the roundhouse kick 'cause he's a karate kid I don't want to know impressed that women are there I don't quite know what to do you think that it worked\nOkay well [laughter] I mean here's the thing I realized with men when they do something stupid it's usually because they've tried it on someone else\nThere were no okay well I mean here's the\nThing I've realized with men when they do something stupid it's usually because they tried it on someone else before and it worked right so if he's in a crowd of one and he's probably thinking well this is work before I'll just do it again I think\nLet me let me adjust that a little bit I think what happens is guys who do things to impress saw someone else do\nIt okay and we're hospitals right so he did actually have a guy who had the skills and you're like wow that was born and bred them fried I Am going to try that he's going to give it a whirl and it failed it didn't go so well\nBecause we have video like right of it he has been identified he's been\nFired from his job and he very well may face criminal charges he's trying to be a hero of women he's a a pro choice kind of Fela but he kicks basically upside the head the pro lifer is all caught on video\nThey didn't find him he loses his job and now face may face criminal charges so wow take that karate kid to the phones we go David welcome to the Ford faction\nHi go ahead or not [laughter] give us a crowd of gifts or eight and ... and I'm Out\nIn its over no good at all I'm not too oh five nine four one one one one toll free one eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three\nAnd I mentioned that with these that cabinet confirmation the Senate voting fifty one forty nine to advance the nomination looks like we'll get a vote\nAs early as tomorrow as a nomination clears a key hurdle and Fox News making the rounds and talking to different senators Jeff Flake voted yes Susan Collins voted yes Democrat Senator Joe Manchin voted yes as well\nLisa Murkowski voted no might be a little bit fun I'm next half hour to take some calls kind of we talked about half as like a game day and offer\nYour predictions which way is it going to go or if it comes down to a fifty fifty tie\nThe vice President Pence would get the the tie breaker of course he would vote to confirm\nI guess the question in her for her was like two things\nOkay well why didn't they ask like like a known the person to say what it and I asked where's the people of the Jewish guy came into all the way you were the one that did they ask ... so where are they okay so like who ... you can't remember who drove you back and forth\nSo you feel like he wasn't question well enough at the hearing there on the Senate floor is that what you're saying\nYeah I it's which I'm hearing that position and why wouldn't they asked ... questions like I've been before\nThey didn't ask her any quite even if you're referring to the Democratic side because they're not interested in the truth I think [laughter] I Know that you know they were interested they would've Vassar and Republicans were afraid to come across as anti woman when ever made and the prosecutor in there and meantime\nIt's the the pro choice karate kid who's kicking the women so they're talking about violence on the left to the phones Adam welcome back to the board of action\nI think yeah I just wanted to see if you are not only on the\nOn the Ford facts and Facebook but again when Jessica comes back at three on the line\nY'all put a yacht but to the office number for old Josie are up there so that we can bombard his office and let him know he's gone and I'll go ahead and stick it up here on the air for all of us who can't wait to get back home and check the check the page [laughter]\nNot a bad idea a negative ad and we appreciate is aboard faction two oh five nine four one one on one one toll free one eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three recipe also just here today Clark go right ahead now\nSo I I don't know if I really want to disagree with what Matt said or just take it a little further you know he said the Democrats were worried about roe versus Wade yeah\nThat's the rallying cry right now but that's not what they're worried about what are they worried about their ideas are so bad that even though they control almost all the media\nK. through twelve schools colleges I can keep going on even though that control all that they cannot get their ideas past sue an actual legislative body\nSo the courts have been their legislative venue for at least the last fifty years right and when you have a conservative majority\nAnd their legislative venue for at least the last ... years right and when you have a conservative majority on the Supreme Court that goes away for them and that's the reason they're so desperate here\nYou know Rosie weight is just that that's what rallying cry that they can get their base fired up about\nBut that's not really what they're about right now\nI think that's a good point because there there is a strong potential that roe v Wade in the future should cabin I'll be confirmed it there's a possibility that they can be overturned but even if it's not even if it's not Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court\nIs still going to be um a major influence on the legality of of how we're governed for decades to come potentially\nYes or no I Do have a question here and it's just right up a question I don't have a clue is Lisa Murkowski going to be primary because of this or she maintained that seat in the state of Alaska if she votes no tomorrow\nYeah I Would think she could probably maintain that seat simply because it is of no surprise she was considered a swing vote\nTo begin with and um you know she ended up voting no\nI don't think that's necessarily going to surprise the people of her state they like or to this point so I don't think she's in grades political danger or I might be wrong on that but I think it's different than let's say if you had another more conservative a\nRepublican who who maybe by surprise voted no\nAnd then one last question she lose all committee appointments and whatnot because of this and she'd be put on for a minute what train detail or something\nWell [laughter] I mean I guess it's possible I Will tell you after her no vote after the Senate vote today even though she voted no her colleagues came and shook her hand they have great respect for her they not surprised by her vote and I think they still believe they can get a confirmation even without her her yes vote so I don't think she'll be ban is just yet\nOkay well just would hope [laughter]\nI'm Maggie Clark game you're next\nOn the Ford faction two oh five nine four one one oh one one toll free one eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three gave go right ahead\nIt James\nOh ... well guarded oh Douglas [laughter] and I still heard games are ... go ahead\nJames [laughter]\nOkay go ahead I'm Sorry Oh yes yes yes yes\nIt's a liberal talk that ... that that girl and the head that\nLive in Toronto so this happened to ... yeah yeah but what a tough guy right I mean what a tough guy with his purple honey\nOut I guess I see somebody like let's sell coming down on it what it would have fallen here\nYeah I think you're right I didn't see him trying to kick a man he kicks a woman holding a phone\nAt a choice pro life rally sort of thing there's a disagreement on the sidewalk if they want to have words fine but he had his tongue sticking out of ... Michael Jordan he had this stupid look on his face he's wearing a goofball\nPurple hoodie and yeah he kicks the woman like he's the karate kid roundhouse kick in the mid to kick the phone out of her hands city kicked through in the shorter knocks into the ground he's been identified he's lost his job now may face criminal charges\nAre helping out at home and I'll I'll domino really fat\nLost his job now may face criminal charges\nI help out at home and I'll tell him and I really don't know how that worked at it I thought I'd gotten it could be down if it happened and the south shore thought started gentleman like myself cutting down on it with a baseball\n[laughter] Maggie name is James James damn baggage where the guy I Do yes and here's what I'd say I mean I'm not condoning violence I Am not I don't want anybody to get beaten down\nBut I worry you here's Jim we'll get to the second well here's what I was going to say you hear about in ... in prison okay now what are you in for [laughter] you don't want to be the kind of person I'm here because I kicked a woman you know they had right yeah I Do not want to be your claim to fame Hi Jim go right ahead buddy\nOh first off I Want to say that when I first heard a young lady on the air that there with you I pictured are just as I saw a picture and attract if a self confident intelligent gal so I mean\nIn in my lifetime is exactly what how I picture that only happens [laughter] well no and then I actually met you I don't recall when when I came into the ... [laughter] anyway yeah and\nAnd and your just basically what I pictured in my mind when I heard you on here but anyway uh I agree with you this guy should not get a beat down\nBut he should definitely do some serious jail time of salt as an assault yeah\nYou know this whole thing to me and\nI Am so glad to finally see I'm an outspoken person I tell it like it is I Know sugar coach stuff and I'm so glad to finally see a lot of the people in power mainly the Republicans are some of the others even some of the commentators are actually telling it like it is about about how evil\nThe Democrats are and and it it's not something that happened overnight this has been this way for years and people have been sugar coating it and give it a kid gloves\nAnd you're making excuses for him and Lisa Murkowski I actually met her and her father her father was governor of Alaska when I was up there and one of the reasons that I think people voted for her 'cause he was pretty conservative fell a but the one of the things that astounded me in Alaska how many liberals or were\nYou would think the last frontier would be kind of like the wild wild west you know and but half the judges up their smoke dope\nOr they turn people lose that they were not top friendly uh it's really a tiger list out name\nEnvironment in Alaska that that would take you by surprise if you're up\nThere you know it's interesting that you and I know the thrust of your call was amount about do but the more we hear about people the more I think probably more people do it then will admit\nTo it sounds ... it it really is crazy people had these strange views is bad\nAnd then you come to find out that they've been ruining the old timers thanking baggage him we appreciate the call it's a Ford faction phone number here nine four one one one one toll free one eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three no sugar coating it the economy is booming give you some headlines about\nThat next the Ford faction making radio great again\nYou want to melt fat get toned and have the body you always wanted then you need to check out science try fitness through high intensity interval training anti Christian education you're trying to get new prince adding gain muscle\nRather currently looking [laughter] forty ... want to participate in a free six we challenge that is guaranteed to get in Brazil with that challenge you hit a new plan more accountability grocery list so much more\nAs long as you read your only challenge is absolutely free contact\nWith that challenge to get accustomed meal plan personal accountability grocery list and so much more as long as you read your only the challenge is absolutely free contact your closest tried today to find out more\nI got this is Thomas talked from ... we're talking about our service milk ... meals which is real prep but you could pick up on Monday afternoon so what we do is we have", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Yellowhammer Radio", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "05"}
