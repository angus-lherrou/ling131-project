red state it's a great theory though I mean you know what I mean Democrats that are and I deserve it remember when it hit the window here hurricane hit Houston now many yeah leaning pundits Renee deserve it\nAnd it's like I was actually there when that had pretty where are you really just by chance of of course you or your ... and the coolest guy in the ... [laughter] regularly folks are met someone was playing\nBig they they ran a song and Brittany and do you ever heard of the folks that men from down under ... sandwich thing yes\nI didn't think there was a very good oh come on I Love I have to order them on a from Amazon now right goodness a and I get them in boxes ... well\nWhat exactly is it it's yeast okay and you know ... and it's like black pipes yes and it smelled it smelled pretty bad nasty\nA but with the with the is not put like people have put it on like peanut butter like clean up OK okay ... you don't do that you have a bit of toast put a bit of a a a butter on there and then the ... of vigilance\nSo why don't you just ... her own and have a piece of butter toast and not with the black nasty mold use this doesn't kind of tastes like beer in the morning that\nThat's why I [laughter] I Know one on\nMe I don't I'm not a big beer than something else and then I get I said I've got to try to my sandwich I don't know anything about it and the songs they roll their eyes they gave me the slab of blackness oh yeah and and I was the nastiest thing ever so y'all goal is\nTo just get a early hint of a well you know if that's everybody's business is it like tore it yeah it is it really all I tell you it's great in a bloody Mary\nLike if you mix it into a bloody Mary understanding and readily boy yeah OK okay what is you'll have extra that somebody said look I'm gonna start selling the martial art in a week what did he used to be before we started eating I think it comes I think originally came out of the beer a manufacturing process it was a leftover yeast and stuff and\nI make this black stuff out of it so it was just an extra\nInstead of throwing it away like Roswell Americans used to throw away chicken wings as the\nChicken ones went to the the dog food plan what a ... says hey we could probably eat the I kinda like now they're now you've got to pay through the nose for them so it's the same thing you all have ... to weigh up chicken wings supposed to be put some farmers on garlic on all sides of chicken wings last night\nFor his ... have you know who they're going to protest about food again while we hang out with them during our mind I keep forgetting that I'm full and yellow hungry you're fat and happy and and it it's just it's absolutely\nCan we first asked about food again while we hang out with them during our law I keep forgetting that I'm full and yellow fat and happy and and it it's just it's absolutely fantastic what do we have over here in America that you don't have an Australian back to the Australian questions because I Love these a\nSuper liberal politicians have those have gun not ... yet in the little gun round up thing that all the rules were like hey look at work wonderfully in Australia I mean you don't really did screw how do they actually work\nAnd also you know he was never had a even before that it was really the only thing that really collecting hunting rifles handguns and everything\nIn Australia will kill you yeah why not in the world to make the argument we need these to shoot the rabid kangaroos anybody a vampire bats are bats as big as the ... ... I mean they're going to your ... how do you not to say we need bar on\nWell if you live in the country you can uh everybody has some shock on hunting you have to hide it and I can ... I used to have this or no you're going to have them secure like in a ... gun guys registered secure\nI Love everybody always talks about secured guns like if I'm getting attacked by kangaroo let me make sure I turn both my safety zone somebody right yeah and you're out I gotta go to walk and safe and and the thumb print then you've got to get it out and load and pull off the trigger guard ... excuse me pardon me burglars are\nI have to make sure I guess the government guideline hold on Rocky Top you hold on and I I Do think it's pretty cool if you have one of those uh like like a fingerprint kind of things by your bed\nWorks out in the puddles and right there yeah kind of like some Star Trek was on the\nFriend of mine who's got little kids has one of those technical it works great it literally has a sitting on his ... yeah\nWell I don't have kids that's what I carry a glock no safe enough to hey I'd say God have you got one of the chamber you are Braves ongoing\nTell you what you see yourself board why or moved on from ... did you watch it rid of him or other side of the blocks where you're at I just I don't you should try your typical for ... so now I'm a I'm On the style is now\nMy my dad had always carried a ... always cared a glock for ah for service and when we lived I think it was back in Alabama or something he was unloading it one night and use now you're loads in a bucket of than he was a moment when I shot through the washing machine\nAnd a couple of weeks later we realize there was a hole in the washer and my mom was like what in the war was our whole this whole never been there and he's like I think a button for ... years years went by and for you can pass and he goes yeah I guess when\nI was there a little get upstairs and it was like three I'm In the morning I guess we didn't know what I I get with all the better is upstairs in shooting down I\nDon't know he said he he played the wall and painted over it and nobody knows about it and they said thank God I had just started I mean seriously thank the lord that it had to start at is good stuff but I was just kind of the thing with the God you got one of the chamber you\nOh yeah you know we watch it yeah no kidding I'm going to be on your hips not amid will get you on the ... that's the so during the shooting one day you're straighter with Greg watching me when you ... to the hottest hang on to shoot straight I've never been around an Australian that makes me feel more American than Greg\nWe as Americans when that yes yes he is but it's not like you got here yesterday had skipped point Fifteen Years yeah it's not like you you hit out on a ship to to come here and all of a sudden I'm of the southern border\nThan they do I get back then it was just hitting the vial Ohio [laughter]\nNo one said or anything so he will not get ... even when you're a doctor was Rob qualify which dream or I went to school for free [laughter]\nRight\nYou're a doctor was Rob qualify which dreamer I went to school for free [laughter]\nRight\nSo what what kind of transition how do you go from the the ... what does the Australian navy called the royal Australian night it sounds so cool\nLow a scribe Paul and your a pot of uh I I don't side here because it sounds very pretentious eligible to your your on her majesty's Australian service so when I got one I I Do have a question about how you all all that stuff if you end up with a keen ... do you all have to change everything to his majesty's yes those are\nGreat but it also but it's still ate so it doesn't matter you can just under ... among those Australia a king queen queen queen of England is you know they they don't catch all kind of consider themselves a little\nWhat are you all I mean we're commonwealth that's kind of a stepchild of the British are like a prison island there for a while we were we were ah Georgia [laughter]\nWe're up populated but prisoners we my my one side of my family were actually on the second fleet\nOf prisoners my mom so [laughter] would you mind this radio we've we've never shaken not off limits to how we made a lot of Australia tough though I mean it was a tough tough it's tough when you had to be pretty bad to get sent to Australia rush nah not really just anybody yeah you just had to be Irish pretty much [laughter]\nI don't know I get that accent and the Brits would\nSend us the Brits would send you out of their Robin fill up the prison ships home this is I\nI could sit there for hours and ask you questions I only about kangaroos but I don't get some facts on next on the ... going on in the world a better hurry you know mental coolest thing in the war all I just think you know like we always talked about other countries are always talking about foreign affairs and and we get caught up and all this nonsense and everything\nBut like to actually live in another country and now you are full blooded American like it just that kind of transition I mean how many years did it take to go from like an Australian mate to an American bro\nAll students I broke [laughter] I don't either [laughter] that's the way I'm Out there that either we knew donor yes I'd rather sometimes that's a military brat yeah\nI'm a student might I Am a little like saying like you can say may I could never see made it doesn't sound right coming from you but when I leave it to the Australian in Britain and I do say thrown out the shrimp on the Bobby I Do say that oh yeah okay uh back oh gosh it must be Twenty years ago I was at a fraternity house\nI don't know what I was doing it but you don't remember yeah I might record for the in the back when we had um answering machines they made me record or guy we kind of answered the phone right now we're putting another shrimp on the Bobby ride an awesome like still haven't produced diets now on a on a you know an audio photos fall and they still have that on\nI uh I just I Love radio like that because I Know it's hard to know it doesn't exist like sometimes there's very few times where you get true like either comedy gold interviewing gold like conversational gold and I think people who can perfect that or or what makes you\nLeaned closer to the radio is what makes you laugh out loud when you're in the car by yourself you're driving to work trucks by yourself you're you're sitting at your office desk and you're listening to the one on one super station out\nBy yourself and you ... like I feel like that is a true gold radio and where I learned a lot of my radio or cut a lot of my teeth above and Rick I'm In the morning\nLike I Know those guys very well but even before I knew those guys that was like I actually knew those guys like I've related to those guys before because they were just some good old boys on the radio so you always got to be related but then you always have to the the the kind of\nNot necessarily off the cuff content but the funny concept the thought provoking ... there's going to make people leaning to the radio closer and and I just\nYou know I'd I'd love to make radio different in Birmingham and obviously we we have some changes coming up here on the show and I think you for letting me do this past year and a couple of months but\nIt's just it's one of those things where if I can have a segment or to like that it makes me appreciate what radio is what radio still is because like on a pod cast you have a ... and her Cambridge stopped me when I'm\nAnd what radio still is because like on a pod cast you have a ... and hurricane Brit stop me when I'm wrong you know what I mean um but like on a on a pod cast you have like a definite goals to the podcast like you have a goal where like\nThis is a a mystery pod cast right this is a a pod cast where you're\nGoing to find out who the murderer was at the very end like s town or or loving mystery like it's a it's almost like an audio book sometimes right\nOr like an interview podcast or like Joe Rogan does or something like that or or maybe I might do or something like that would be um\nTo get to the bottom of this one specific person right to find out what that was\nAnd I guess have very specific\nGoes radio is theater of the mind\nRight radio is live is off the cuff you're on top of things like if something breaking news comes out of this this category storm that sit in Florida right now the panhandle\nUm as I mean it looks to be going straight for Panama City like it could not be going anywhere straighter rentals city\nOr or where I grew up and went to the beach and I was little\nHope some birds okay or opinion piece I don't think they're okay oh goodness anyways but like it's just that thing of broadcasting that all up you know it's it's just what I Love and podcast\nHave a very definite specific goal right and radio is the thing you can turn on any time throughout the day and you you know kind of what the theme is maybe there is a goal and radio but it can always be\nYou know changing and like you relate to the personalities you relate to the people um we're talking on the radio and and you get your favorites and you enjoy those people and and it's it's a different kind of feel is a different vibe and there's nothing like radio\nLike\nLook as they're not going to sugarcoat it everything's going to video everything everything's going to video there there is going to be very few things that are going to be audio only within the next ten years very very few things even if\nThey're all you only you still listen to audio only they will have video a company with them like podcast will be video podcast and another three years\nThere won't be a lot of pod cast out there it'll be video podcast it'll be like a pod casting service um that that will be like you to you'll be able to watch it you better listen to it you can decide but there'll be video along with everything\nI Will not be able to do my show without having a video aspect and the next\nThree or should be this year I should go into it but it's it's another thing\nIt's just the advancement of technology and things change you know I mean look when the printing press came out right did anybody think oh the printing press at the end all be all know it's going to change we're go we're going to get better we're going to print stuff faster I just\nI look at things I'll look at the way technology is changing and and the way that we're going like video is everything\nLike go to Fox News go to the daily mail go to the Daily Caller go to yellow hammer news dot com or put a story about out about mama being the ... to go check that out on my actually talk about that come up next\nBut it's one of those things where everything is going towards video everything\nAnd radio was the last kind of voice crying out for you to not know what somebody looks like\nBut to love them and to love\nWhat they do and to imagine what they look like imagine what's actually going on in the studio and you get to paint the picture somebody's telling you the story\nImagine what they look like imagine what's actually going on in the studio and you get to paint the picture somebody's telling you the story but you get to paint the picture and that's why it's a dying industry it's happening radio was dying\nAnd nobody wants to hear it I don't want to hear like hurricane ... I don't want to say my favorite form of entertainment is radio like I Love listening to the library I Lived a dark room library you\nKnow like I like TV I like I don't like TV broadcast TV but I I thoroughly enjoy like Netflix Hulu like the TV with no commercials I Love them\nAnd like Netflix TV shows are better than every single primetime literally anything and everything on ... report microphone down just a little bit more I'm kind of hard time hearing you what'd you say are you that's much better um you like Netflix what's your favorite shown of like\nOur lab Netflix I'm so many shows I Can't think are you like when the office parks and rec you give me a couple of you it was best is one shall about this suicidal girl and ... ... ah Thirteen reasons yeah and you always want to say Thirteen hours\nBut surging reason other reasons why it was pretty it the first season was good talking to didn't get all of that but like radio is one of those industries where it is just it's it's changing it's changing industry in the end it stinks look it stinks but at the same\nTime uh you got to adapt with the changes and so anytime I can get pure love for radio like I just that I Love it\nAnd I don't know how it just talk for twelve minutes about that it's probably because that is where my actual heart and passion lie and I know it's changing and I just I refuse to believe it but it is our number eight six six five five one\nNine nine three three eight six six five five one nine nine thirty three John and I'll take in one minute but I Do want to um hint at this\nAs well I just think in this ever changing media world\nThere's nothing better than getting in your car\nAnd touching a preset nothing going through your phone nothing you're texting bleep out or Snapchat bleep out or have to turn the music ... nothing is easier than getting your car turning it on and pressing the one priest that button\nTo hear your favorite show at that specific time there's nothing easier like isn't it also when you hear your song and the radio oh yeah\nSo this is the best thing ever first thing ever\nOr we're going to break John package runs around ... and thought oh this is the Ford faction live from the chaos dot com heating and AIR Studios Alabama license number one eleven twenty call Cassidy two oh five three two two nine zero nine zero two oh five three two two nine zero nine zero for all your heating and cooling needs\nOver that this is the ... the Ford faction making radio great again\nFor your whole family al ... the way for the kid the Syrian ... she's from a number of great opposite behind the scenes like guys garage doors free rates are in a race to Salah Degas\nDo you want to melt fat gets counted and have the body you've always wanted to send you need to check out iron try fitness through high intensity interval training and nutrition education and you're trying to get help the trend sat and gain muscle irons rather currently looking for forty locals who want to participate in a free six week challenge that is guaranteed to get you to do\nWith that challenge you'll get accustomed meal plan\nPersonal accountability grocery list is so much more as long as you've reached your home late the challenge is absolutely free contact her closest tries today to find out more guys this is\nThomas ... we're talking about our service milk meals which is milk ... pickup\nClosest tried today to find out more\nHey guys this is Thomas ... we're talking about our service milk meals which is\nMeal prep fits you could pick up on Monday afternoon so what we do is we have meals and we have food about ... pounds which you can take it home and have food off we fall\nOff what this does is it makes your life easier it keeps you out to dry food and seats you also point with what you're trying to ... ... ... farming half half of the tough right that you can order your milk ... meals today\nI live out here that was ... and all this time in the hour the last ... hours they're outcasts rather than you used to buy ... ...\n... ... oh my God Bush paid at all no because we miss y'all all day long all day long bike for males have nobody else we can hear up here\nI live I found area of black people and you are the man we were doing a great job the waiver describing everything out here is that going on you or me why only one out there for the last nine", "show_name": "Yellowhammer Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "10"}
