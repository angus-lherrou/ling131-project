right or anything like that and not to mention\nYeah but for some ... old thing that's out we've found out in the last month or so that that is not American it does not match our new democratic

end of the day um to find out how things have gone in the meantime I\nAm open to your calls I'm going to get to Mitch and Mitch hang on there I see you're there\nAre free to call in nine four one one zero one one eight six six five five one nine nine three three if there's anything you want to bring up as it stands we've got these explosive devices found in\nNew York city at different ... people's homes and uh the suburbs of New York 'cause the Clintons don't live in New York City and\nThat's we're not sure what exactly is going on here and why and how whether they're real bombs are fake bombs or none of them have gone off and we don't know who's at the\n... you know source of this and I guess we're just going to wait and find out we've also got a the governor candidate in Florida caught in a big big lie and people are scrambling there are Jane Fonda said that she's finding it hard to breathe in Trump's America she's finding it hard to breeze and Trump's America\nOr we can talk about that but\nIt's maybe in consequential at this point with Fonda Democrat in West Virginia turns out to be into a ... in a ... which okay\nA Congress postpones they're meeting with Rosenstein which was going to happen today I Do not know what's going on there I don't know if they've delayed because they found out more and they're ...\nThey're waiting before they can get him under oath I it's very interesting thing that that whole issue which I thought was going to be really front and center leading up to the midterms has really kind of faded in the background simply because we've had other things come up for sure but also because uh\nRosenstein has been delaying and\nJust basically not cooperating and then now actually Jim Jordan and I believe\nKevin McCarthy both cold and postponed this meeting that was set for today so I don't know what's going on up there uh we also have Trump agreeing with Obama which was a smart move he did that I'm On Twitter posted Obama's audio on immigration\nAnd I thought it was a smart move and funny too and we're ... we're going to talk more about this\nTwitter posted Obama's audio on immigration and I thought it was a smart move and funny too and we're ... we're going to talk more about this in to the show we're going to talk about Kavanaugh versus caravans because in the space of just a few weeks everything's flip flopped\nAnd I'm going to try and make my argument in and explain what I mean by that but in the meantime I Want to go to Mitch and see what he's got on his mind hey Mitch welcome in\nHey how you doing great okay so now we have multiple let's call them if they are ... none of which detonated\nLeaving behind a wealth of forensic evidence so what we have here is either a despicable act of terrorism on the right or a political ... figure this out as you weigh how much they politicized if on how much they try to find a suspect because if somebody put a bomb on my front door and I had their resources I figure it out\nYes so you are you also suspicious raising your eyebrow the fact that none of these detonated\nWell I mean either it's a they're the most in a terrorist ever and they didn't\nRealize as hard as we're going to be home and they didn't do their homework or this is that robbery that stage where you've broken glass alongside shut yourself only in the leg\nUh-huh [laughter] you know that\nIt does to me it really really does especially when they're coming in a ... I mean they're coming in the series are all being found on one day and yet none of them go off it's like\nIt also takes aside if somebody put a bomb on your doorstep you would want to know who did it in politics I Do what they want a a right poster child to say look see he's evil he's raking\nYes I I agree that they're not going to throw a name out there they're going to just ... just use it all it aside oh we're in danger we're in danger for wheelchair did\nYeah I see what you're saying is the point is how fast do they get to the to the source find the the person in name his name and how much\nForensic evidence was hogwash none of these ... you can't tell me in today's world they can't figure out the origin of these bombs on I Know explosive devices\nAnd they should be able to figure it out pretty pretty fast it seems like\nIf it's about ... and listen to this not who they want it to be you'll never know his name\nOh you know you're right you're absolutely right Mitch because what they want is they want to hijack the publicity\nThat we have for once we have the moral high ground saying oh you guys are mean and violent or chicken that book on that so they're they're just shifted gears and do what they had to do they hope to go out and go outside shot herself my legs were robbed\nYeah no I I agree that's what it smells like to me for sure uh we'll have to wait it out and see what happens but no I agree I think the whole mobs\nOr jobs is ... ... the bear the bottom line issue and it's caught on and I I think they understand that it has massive impact\nAll talk to society I Wonder who did that even if it was somebody on the right he needs to be punished or she or them so if nobody's punished what does that tell you it's gonna be the same thing like Dr for she's going to disappear yeah it's ... like it never happened\nYeah right I appreciate the call Mitch good point good point we've got someone on line one I don't know their name but hello welcome to the Ford faction\nWhat's going on may you know\nHey you haven't heard from you in a while how you doing you hold ...\nFirst thing I thought what are their spouse slack about I mean huh\nDo they the blue wave is disappearing and George Soros I wouldn't doubt this just ma paying though I don't know this but it wouldn't surprise me it would be it if the secret service has not been compromised they will try miss them pretty quick that I mean ... but I just want\nThe beer if the secret service has not been compromised they will track this down pretty quick that I'm ... but I just wonder if we're going to hear anything else about it ... it's been kind of disappeared hasn't not\nIf it ever was there if if it ever was there but yes I agree\nAnd these people will do anything to hold on to power I mean it's been all over the Internet the warning or false flag I mean\nIt just awful suspicious to me I mean I'm just trash and people do not by the official narrative of the government and what's really suspicious of how I relate it's targeted [noise] I mean I met a your last caller made a very good point I never thought about about about none of them going off\nYeah Secret Service or technology like its fate Fager this out pretty quick cause in these places all these bombs were saying you know there's radio surveillance everywhere\nI mean they'll find out I just wonder I just wonder if this was a ... what do you find out I mean I'm very suspicious of it\nOh yeah I mean I I look I Would not put anything past the far left the lunatic fringe left for doing whatever they can to to\nAnd like not even waters at at the very very least muddy the water what\nGives money to accomplish the minority of people that voted for Trump and ocean and we're the crazy ones and I mean most or radical about um most of the violence is coming from them not us arming I just don't get it I just hope and pray to church comes out and they're playing my backfire on them I Hope\nYou will have a they made\nA good enough my humble\nK. R. I. things keep it's good to hear from you haven't heard from you know while you know it wasn't that long ago that there were ... envelopes of rice scene powder or what appeared to be rising I guess it would confirm that it was\nOr at least that it was kind of the base from which ... which is some sort of being I think\nI Can't remember but anyways it wasn't that long ago that there were envelope sent to the White House to the Pentagon and two navy admiral with rice scene in it they were intercepted nobody was contaminated but it was within days\nThat the guy who did it was found and he's been prosecuted he's facing charges and I don't even remember his name but he's certainly faded into obscurity once he was found I Wonder why could it be because he wasn't turned out to be he had a grudge against\nThe navy in particular in the Pentagon and I guess by by default Trump but it didn't turn out to be a a rabid\nRadical Republican\nSo what what are we doing proven that it seems like\nThat whole thing faded away and we never really found out his political motivation other than a grudge", "show_name": "Yellowhammer Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "24"}
