I got some even better video on my camera\nThe ending was so\nAwesome so all these guys last six lapse there were just also there was a restart there was a restart and then as soon as they take turn one and turn one\nAre starting to Jeffrey and he said you had to slow down so fast because if you didn't you would just fly into the wall Robin to the tune so writing yeah it almost darn where what they called a was a number sixty or sixty it was fifty one the Jacob scar who ran I mean that Barrett guy crashed his brakes locked up and he went right into the wall\nI didn't even make it there and that was like one of the first labs\nYeah it was very yeah this is the alien while they are and it was the who crashed all because kids Laskey was in it ah Bush was in it they ...\nDidn't turn okay he went straight he you know they had been running so much there were so much marble yeah on there that\nI mean you could tell he put the brakes phones to kind of a matter it didn't matter he just kept going astray neglected this one and that one and Larsen and I mean I felt so bad for Larson it took ... in Larsen ended\nUp making it into the yes because\nOur heart Jeffery he's bone around right before\nNow how ... how did Larson get in there how did Larson get in because Jeffrey ah got ...\nSo you had to pay us one more caller and he ended up passing Jeffrey before Jeffrey because Jeffrey it's fallen out and that last curve last turn yeah and the cicadas will do well Geoffrey\nGeoffrey got hit so Jeffrey got hit by the number eight card the number eight cart Jeffrey gave him plenty ruined back and watched it do you ever gave him plenty of room and that eight car intentionally\nLike went into ... and he didn't give me any room Jeffrey went wide on that Kurt like you can see and I talk to him right after the race so jeopardy gets the car going back 'cause it throws a signal to the engine the engine won't start back up his Jeffrey could have gotten past\nWars you know what I ...\nAnd he couldn't get the engine started back up and that that is why he just sat there wasn't any stone I Will now like I like it was because it gives me the engine started back so he got the Indian started back up then he finished twenty six\nBut it was funny because Larson comes comes rarely well he's slam he hits the wall and it goes up because they can't turn left yeah at all because his ... is just destroy that first right so he ends up turning it\nHe ... he goes to six cases and right in front of every hits the wall again and his bother you could hear him going just drive\nTo just [laughter]\nSo you end up going over the store finish line and he ends up because the past year forgotten heart yeah and made that one more point he got one point above so he was able to\nTo ... and you know what right after that rat cap and all the cars are just sit there and carnage right and they're all wrecked the owner of the forty two car or or maybe the main or whatever it was came over to Jeffrey and held them by their shoulders and said thank you thank you thank you thank you so much uh we stayed in the playoffs\nBecause Larson lead for a lot of that first part of the race\nIs very very impressive but it was so much fun to watch it at the very end to the number eight car the guy who's going to be in thirty one car there I knew my car next year he's the one who wrecked in to Jeffrey he's the one who had Jeffrey Wright and so that is what's fun Jeffrey out and then Jeffrey couldn't get the cars started back up because\nThere was something with the oil or whatever and so he finally gets the it finally gets the cars started up but all of this\nAh came after we're Martin ... junior had the race\nWhatever and so he finally gets it finally gets the cars started up but all of this came after we're Martin ... junior had the race won the race and Jimmy Johnson runs into the ... D\nMe Johnson did not run into the Saddam Jimmy Johnson spelling out\nAnd then back into him come on let's get it right you're right back\nInto and I thought well you have any big day that was some of the best race in at the very end I was ... I was going through\nThe roof after they went over to the store ... ... jobs and got his pay back yeah goes they threw eggs went up there [laughter]\nAnd you know is it not Jimmy Johnson out of the play offs oh yeah he didn't making incredible I'll Jimmy the first time in what eight years nine years he's made the playoffs ever since they installed the playoffs right\nThat's incredible so I didn't make the first got there but it was a fascinating written big gave I I was on pit row when all the ending happen\nRight so I was on pit row and the we like hurt them coming around the corner so I saw the crash wait a minute watched it on his ... row or is it ... road\nUh uh I don't know I've always said ... road\nNo less controversy I don't know I don't know what it is I was in the ...\nAnd so I'm I'm In the beds and I'm watching over the wall everybody's watching over the wall they come around the corner they crashed we immediately run to the TV everything's going on and then I'm filming Jeffrey as he's coming in and they crashes there too right it was a wild wild\nFinish with one of those things like there was a ... it was a very good rice and I will say you know never been a real big NBC TV but they did all ... they will not rice\nThey're they're very good when it comes to honing in for I think those Sunday wild races in your health so I like afterwards\nThey had ... and a ... yeah doing the wrap up and everything with the the lady I don't know who the lady is\nBut they got it down it he's got it down now\nNBC Sports is is a massive change from what NBC News is\nHe'll just didn't like law and a lot better than ESPN if you ask me\nAnd they get to it fast efficiently they just stick 'em sports they just stay on the ...\nWhat is Tony want to talk about I hear her Cambridge I have no other Tony what's not working at eight six six one nine nine three three Tony how are you doing\nGuys a lesson that sort of the best right of the year I was there was so all the way it went the last time that you all you know they didn't know what a where people were it's forced points were until like five minutes after the checkered flag\nIn saying to me\nIt was it was great and then a sort of the brackets ask you did you hear\nWhat he was Atkins diet house about what happened because uh from what I got a frack case could turn he thought I think they thought they were all on the road and because if you saw it was even a cow Larson they couldn't turn I just went right into the eye\nCar right ... ... let them bumping beat a little bit yeah Robin is rice and\nI I mean Tom Cruise and they said that although the days of thunder days yeah you know ... movie by the way let them let 'em dusted up a little being getting a little ... that makes people want to watch more make the cars a little tougher\nTo cars like the cars barely bumper tap and it just tears up the whole\nThing exactly it's just a little thing and thinks the sheet metal yeah just cares at all to shreds make them soccer's quarter inch steak or something like that so that they're you know hey you can bomb but across town on the front\nYeah yes it so that you can you know bumped draft and like you can actually hit the back of people and like you can you know like I'm not saying go cart bumper you know what I mean but I'm saying like give me a little rabbit I ... a little bit of the ... go cart bumping [laughter] right by\nTalking about a roller derby out there but yeah you know what I mean uh but yesterday's rice was just a sign that show that these tracks have got to change it up you know these tracks we've got to get more interesting or I think it'd be so interesting if you had one NASCAR a race a year that was on dirt straight up\nI think it would be great if they would change Talladega that one of them is the day rice and then put lights up in one of them than I Am right yeah kind of like they do tight Daytona\nNow Daytona under the lights is incredible I Know in ... about Talladega under\nThe lights that'd be wild [noise] it'd be you know what it 'cause I'm so used to Talladega just going out there during the day and just wedding exactly just being in the sun would that not but he also now would be all think of any lights that would say they got the money [laughter]\nExactly just being in the sun would that not but also now would be all think of any lights that would take that got the money [laughter] only two times a year the big day that's why you need about tickets\nNow but it would not there'll be a lot more people buy tickets to that night right yeah especially you know make the first one of the night rice I'm like this one because I Love it when the trucks go the drugs to mayor like the old NASCAR\nYeah or it's a little more parity in there yeah but in in ... the the trucks are such a cheaper alternative to to run and they go they're flying around the track oh they're so good I almost just as fast I watch ... too I think he's finished he's pretty interesting ... or you can see the young drivers yeah I like\nThe young drivers but I'm telling you ain't nothing like that truck race\nYeah ad like like their trucks you know what I mean like the their truck you actually get a sense of like you know\nWhat's like like something other than just the ... but it was fun we had a great time this weekend I'm so much to get to today in the news and I know big David out when it went all NASCAR heavy but ah the ... if you don't know anything about it go look at it the ... the Charlotte motor speedway rebel it was like no other race\nEver I've seen but I mean it was just it was so\nInteresting to have an a road course inside of an oval it was almost kinda like if formula one racing had like a ... car feel to it and they grouped together a little bit more you know if you watch formula one racing and it's like they're so far behind each other\nYou know you imagined\nNASCAR at barbers\nOh my goodness that would be fun to have you ever been out there Oh yes ... but I don't know like once I've been out there ... four or five times yeah I mean that's a bunch so that's a lot\nI mean you're talking about being up close and intimate with the racers yeah and the racing surface I mean they're coming\nBy you they are flying\nI just I just love NASCAR I just I think it's ... it was one of its so American you know it's like how can we take a VA and just\nLike super drives that bad boy into the ground and then how can it goes all as much gas as humanly possible right like how much gas can you guys all and and how can we just make these things fly around the track can be totally impractical\nBecause like you watch formula one look at their steering wheels next time and formula one there's there's probably fifty buttons on it and like a little screen it's so computerized and like everything is computerized and you watch NASCAR and yeah it's all computerized on the inside but it is NASCAR\nI'm having people pay him they were they saying get off and I ask ... why I don't know let's thanks where they want to get on such Kevin Oh I guess they won't\nTalk about judge Kevin ... or you know stuff like that\nYeah what did you watch a lot of that this week into or did\nYou know I was a lot of that\nAlso say in a couple of things that that just blew my mind\nYou know about the judge Kavanaugh stuff you know\nHer testimony was not anywhere close I mean there was holes\nAll in oh yeah you know I haven't gotten to talk about it since Friday big Dave 'cause I wasn't here on friday so I I've been gone and the fact you ought to talk
