people there\nAnd uh she was looking gripe very peppy and she gave an off the\nSpeech and what I thought was interesting was the speech was inspirational she talked about Alabama she talked about we're Alabama's come and the last couple of years where it's going the unemployment rights but it wasn't a stump speech he was just there\nWith all these important people the people do everything for this site or a ... and she was in ... inspirational and that was something and she didn't pull very long which was also inspirational um she didn't give a stump speech she did a\nTerrific I'm a presentation less not to the point where when she went off the side she got a standing ovation really and I've not seen that that's a pretty tough crowd so I've not seen that before and it's really in in in very stark contrast\nCrap so I've not seen that before and it's really in in in very stark contrast I saw her uh\nUh what's his ... medics who whatever I saw him at lunch a couple of days earlier and his speech was all doom and gloom you know he was like I wrote a piece on it the yellow him a news as a matter of fact today in on the website\nAnd he was talking about you know the sky was falling he was like Chicken Little raw Chicken Little rock that's what he should have campaigned on hand you know the bridges of falling down people are gonna die driving under the bridges to work

because as we know the election is only what ten eleven days away Tuesday ironic\nSo and there's a lot riding on it I mean we are you know we'd we found out about all that money George Soros is pouring in for\nYou know his sort of a a ... liberal or campaigning I'm so we'll have a lot to talk to a gym in life than a bath and uh we might even be able to take some questions here on a call ... one one zero one one a little bit lighter\nAnd then on very excited about this cast a we have no but I'm not excited about the other guests but we'll have a share of high oh Mike Hi all the sheriff of Jefferson County you'll be in the studio with us for now\nAh and we're going to tie cold for the for the sheriff or he's been in law enforcement for forty one years believe it or not he started when he was six\nAnd a ... gun when he was six just in Canada and um but we can talk about this pipe bomb business one thing I wanted to talk to share a pile about was how to keep kids safe at Halloween\nYou know they're out candy their area and then you know unfortunately bad people in the world so uh we'll we'll be talking to share of higher ... uh in the uh just off the two o'clock now I Believe a big dive we've got congressmen Rogers on the line\nAre you doing must Rogers on doing wonderfully thank Hi congressman great Keely here um [noise]\nYou remember reputation thanks for joining us I mean you build a reputation in Washington and here of course in Alabama\nOr you know you're you're recognized leader and called on Congress particularly on national security issues you know you sit on the ... a ... a house armed services committee or you know you sit on the homeland security committee and ... and of course importantly here in Alabama\nOn agriculture a you know we'd go to a lot to talk about congressman um you know there's a part bombing is is a a caravan coming up from Mexico or your first impressions of the ... services on what we're seeing on the uh on this race today\nWell I was fully expecting them to have him arrested within a twenty four forty eight hours I've seen the FBI before do this do their thing when it comes to ... for collecting\nEvidence only had of suspects they are really phenomenally good at it and I expected they were catching quickly\nMy guess is they knew who he was yesterday and we're just watching this day if there's anybody else involved like a bring in but I it was impressive the way they got him I'm I'm anxious find out more about uh what was going on with him but my guess is is a mental health issues what usually we find to be the case\nYou know not wanting to give you know give away the a farm here how does the FBI you know this is an extraordinary how does the FBI or mobilize so quickly and roll someone like this up so fast\nThey have just built a a a pattern over the years of of knowing exactly what they're looking for immediately and collecting that evidence I in this case this guy gave so much of it\nBy having these unexploded bombs which is just to give them a abundance of information you know they they demonstrated several years ago um that here in Alabama that was a fellow that\nSent a letter to mouth as to senator uh\nShelby's office and I I think Senator Sessions I Can't remember I Know Shelby and me and one other one uh with some white powder novel loans and when the staff open them in our district office is a pattern came out and there's a letter saying I Hope you're down this road you know the hazmat grooves had to come in and they had to empty the court houses\nAre but bottom line was the the letters had no return address or nothing but if\nLetters had no return address or nothing but a staff an address to the office right it was just that they were able to track the fell down a little longer\nBut they tracked ally can figures DNA from the on below rod while they're standing up or something of that nature I don't again I don't know how how exactly it's like in the same but he's in prison I mean they found him I think he found him in Missouri somewhere like\nThat that is amazing isn't it when you think about it yeah I mean by that because I was so impressed by how they they were able to capture that probably would much less evidence and this guy gave I ... I asked\nA but you know there's a lot of of technology now that we in the homeland since we've stood up the homeland security department that we used to monitor white packages move around the country I knew that would be deployed and in fact it did turn out to be deployed a we have a lot of camera systems now that did not exist Fifteen Years ago\nSo there's a lot of things are able to grow together to be able to isolate somebody like this and find out who they are true the as though we could do a whole lot more and I've been urging that now one of the things they do in a in London is a everywhere they go you've got when you're out in public you know their writers these ... these\nAnd and those things turn out to be in value but when they had the subway poverty\nThey catch all cost ya that within hours\nI think that particularly in our in our major urban areas especially we should have that because when you're out in public you should not have no expectation of privacy right\nAnd comment on that is one of my things people are always jumping up and down and ... my parents to a jumping up and down well its privacy this property that well I'm Sorry uh I don't want to get blown up by some crazy ... almost when I'm coming out of a bus stop or I'm quite have I'm not doing anything bad I don't care if they see me going into the polite\nYeah no I ... I Believe if you're in your whole or in your business is different you do have an showcasing the privacy but once you go out into the public domain there is no expectation of privacy so nobody should have concerns about a closed circuit cameras\nAre particularly in this day and age of of terrorism and again particularly when you're in major metropolitan areas where it's been proven this is where the terrorists are going to go for the major impacts able to get international\nCovered the biggest self the saga and the folks that are jumping up and down to the same ones that post pictures of their kids into vacations and where they are all the time and not at home and the kids doing this and that uh there is no expectation of privacy anymore\nNo not in public shouldn't be a so anyways my hope and that's one of the things we've ... we've been pushing along and we're we're making slow progress on the homeland security committee but I'd like to see us make a lot more progress on that front because whether we like it or not we're going to have more attacks in the future yup uh we've ... we've seen that a\nA ... when it comes to a terrorist attacks domestically around the world the terrorists to have started to move away from just a airlines and they started to lose what we call soft target for use for concerts\nMajor uh games and such stadiums are it's much easier to get a truck close to one of those being used and blow it up than it is to try to get a bomb on a plane so we need to adjust and start recognizing adapt and start recognizing we've got to take better care of soft targets\nRight and then he does it could happen the terrorists don't now they do when the super bowl every time they carry an attack like a nine eleven kind of attack and I just need to inflict pain and Hanks and uh so I'm I'm here in the in in ...\nTwice ... and I just wanted to\nSpain and antiques and uh so I'm I'm here in the in in ...\nTwice Cal terrorism as far as I Know here in our hearts they want to\nChange it and they want to have an economic impact on us they want to get us to stop doing some of the things that we do to keep our economy moving so are we just have to be thinking round the curve about where they're going to be the next ... things that are a responsible to make sure we protect these kind of targets that we anticipate than\nYou know we'll sit down congressman you're also you serve as we mentioned alarm and homeland security committee or\nImmigration illegal immigration that's a ... I don't know it's a bug Barack much the folks listening to the show a\nLet's talk about these invasion caravan or as as NPR away schools at this uh migrants caravan I mean give me a break you know it's thousands of people what can the administration what can the United states do to stop these illegals coming into the country\nWell I think what the president is already started that's moving and National Guard troops down to the border or he this has been a tactic that's been deployed by previous administrations is nothing unique to this president\nRock Obama did it when it was necessary um I think the ... president needs to move as many National Guard troops I'm a down there if he thinks is necessary to prevent them from getting in the country\nAnd to send a signal to the rest of the world don't try this we're not going to let it be successful ... one of the things I'm hopeful that we will see a and and what happens when they send the national guard at\nThe national guard and lose into a support capacity and freeze a border patrol agents from their administrative another responsibility so they can actually moved to the border\nTo keep the illegals out\nRight so a National Guard taek up like some violence and admin and uh so that\nYou be absolutely sta and how many trained border patrol agents are sitting at a desk ... down in Arizona and New Mexico and California these are highly trained highly qualified skilled\nLaw enforcement professionals pushing paper are working on cars that means you're trying to keep them working as it's insane but what will happen is the ... the national guard will relieve them and those responsibilities what it's deep breathing the detainees\nOr just any other ... so that all the border patrol agents can move down to their law enforcement row of protecting the border but what I Want to see us do is\nStop many of these people from being able to get in and are starting to ... and being trained to be able to say the magic word so they get to stay in the country until they're hearing occurs which may never happen\nRight now Congress when we got a couple of coal Cola's that have been waiting to a pro question do I think we've got to totally on the law is that right ... yeah Charlie going hey buddy\nHey they're a congressman Rogers can you hear me I Can't hear\nOkay well go ahead ... will [laughter] overlay them a question\nAll right I Want to say the congressman Rogers punishment I like you I I like how you suggested that Edward Snowden should be put on a kill list I like how you said that when you were carrying the intelligence committee that the NSA can't violate your privacy right if you don't know your ... Raja being violated and I like how when the uh laws proposed\nThat said the government should be able to get all the information from Facebook and Twitter and Google they want to make good on Facebook and Twitter could violate the privacy agreements where they use or without legal recourse you said that people arguing against that the system deal where just fourteen year olds in their basement\nSo I like the way you do that also like what are your wife works for a contract it I didn't see the benefits from all day so I just wanted to say thank you for being on the air today\nWell thanks for the call and unfortunately your caller has me confused with Mike Rogers of Michigan who retired two terms ago\nOh he's still watch you know [laughter]\nAh we do we have another call and they'd be diver by a car goes on the air go ahead you're on the air was Margaret Rogers ... represented my grown\nThank you so representative Rogers my understanding is the number of people that are currently in this caravan is probably about one percent of what we already caught at the border this year\nI mean we're we're somewhere around four hundred thousand that have been caught so\nAlready taught this year I mean we're we're somewhere around four hundred thousand that have been taught so far this year aren't waiting\nI really couldn't tell you the number of ... it's a large number yes\nIs there a way to say you can hear me\nNow he said he he can't tell you what the number is right now ... oh\nOkay so I Want to say maybe a couple of weeks ago I was on that so far have entered on the order of four hundred thousand or this year\nThat was what I Do I've heard that the ... place where the guy I got a question for Mr Rogers how can we\nWith not having the wall and everything and they use this caravan is coming up once they step over here we have to take care of them correct\nOnce we let them in yes that's exactly right here's one of the things that give you an example\nWe have somebody that that we capture that comes across the say they come across the river and in Texas and we capture them we take 'em to do the briefing center and and debriefed them if while we have them at the briefing center they say\nA much yes I've got shift things we have to take them to the hospital and if it turns out they're having a heart attack we have to pay for their heart surgery or whatever has to be done to them and not only pay for all that we have to keep a agent within\nTwenty four hours a day while they're in the hospital we really saying absolutely you you have somebody come across a woman that comes across as nine months pregnant and then while she's over while she's in our detention facility she says I think I'm starting to go into labor\nWe have to take her to the hospital we have to pay for the birth of that baby all this I mean it's you and there's no records and\nWe didn't his own what they call an anchor baby congressman as a ... than it\nIs actually becomes an anchor baby was that babies born here under the way the law is being interpreted even though the baby was here with a new legal mother and the womb of an illegal mother or that becomes the United states citizen and then all of a sudden the entire family can come over and a good at it\nIs and is anchored by it and then is and I know it's insane and saying\nYou know we're the only industrialized country on the planet does that rod is let's say let's say that that my wife and I went to\nA Paris and my wife was eight months pregnant we were over there visiting for for Ninety Days and she delivered a baby while we were there\nFrance would not recognize citizens that would be a United States citizen that just happened to be visiting over there right in our country you're you're a citizen if you're born here even if it's illegal parents can we just change that low\nWe've tried Democrats fight it left and right\nYeah that is that is not so I didn't quite realize that now congressman or do we bring came you know I did something or just have to talk to you about and I was going to get big guy to play the star wars thing but I don't think we've got to you\nYou you you're the sub committee chair of the strategic forces subcommittee on ask if I'm not mistaken\nThat's correct can you talk to me about like I just saw the report coming out this week I think from the Pentagon signed that they've got their path forward for the ... uh can you talk to me about where that stands do I need to get you know ... or or what what are we need to do with you\nThat's funny yeah a lot of people have had fun with this because Trump came out for what it is and all of a sudden people thought were trying to create a star trek kinda\nThat's funny yeah a lot of people have had fun with this because Trump came out or to do and all of a sudden people thought were trying to create a star trek kind of it\nHas nothing to do with that this is all about national security satellites which we have are heavily dependent on to fight and win wars or people think that the GPS system is up there for their ... to be able to tell them how to get to the local hearty restaurant [laughter] you're it's up\nThere it's a military satellites constellation that's up there to guide missiles move troops do a lot of things the timing of but most people don't realize they're using a military satellites Curtis United States government uh but that's up there to fight and win wars we have satellite constellations\nThat look for a ICBM launch is\nOr when we when the President Trump sent over those cruise missiles hit that Syrian airport and take out those warehouses that were store and chemical weapons those missiles were guided by our satellite systems so bottom line is we have become heavily dependent on satellite systems for command and control of nuclear weapons enterprise for a whole host\nMilitary ... uh enterprise rowing we'd have to protect them because both China and Russia have realized how dependent we are and they developed offensive capability that can disable are in some cases destroy our satellites settled and we have fallen behind in in in that endeavor and allow them to\nTo not only catch up with is their own path to surpass us what our armed services committee came out with on a bipartisan completely nonpartisan basis as\nWe have to restructure our military to be able to deal with that threat and the owner or we can do it is to pull those existing space professionals out of the air force army and navy mhm into their separate service where they single mission to be dominant space\nWell this is no different from when you know the air force was created out of the U.S army apples\nThat's exactly right Seventy years ago it was it became obvious that the army which was a terrestrial force would never popular up a properly nurture fund and develop this air mission right so the Congress forced them to just pull it out into separate service\nThe same things happening now the air force is not properly nurturing the space mission so we're forcing them to separate that out into a separate\nOr let no different at all they're playing golf that's why congressman [laughter] well my air force and I'm an ex navy guy and all my air force or colleagues just seem to play golf all the time is what I tell them\nThey have not golf courses that through\nMy lovely golf courses now we're we're almost at a time and I really appreciate your being on a ... eleven dies it's a you know it's the election uh\nThis is probably the most important election certainly since I've been in the U.S was like the last sixteen years you know we've got the lowest unemployment generations you know you guys in in Congress just recently passed tax reform\nHow important is it that people get out to vote\nIf if the conservative and Republican base does not get out and vote with intensity to house we'll flip\nA because the Democratic basis completely animated and ... and energized just like we were eight years ago rock Obama's first midterm and we took away sixty three seats from well 'cause their base was happy they had big government spending big government grow\nOur base was apoplectic over Obamacare Dodd Frank consumer finance protection board the stimulus bill all that stuff\nAre based turned out in huge numbers and we took the majority away the roles were reversed now mhm we have a Republican president Republican House and Senate we've been doing what conservatives due to the court to spending to the tax base to the military and their side apoplectic ...\nDoing what conservatives due to the court to spending the tax base to the military and their side apoplectic right now\nSo if our race will get out and vote in and help the numbers will keep the house not as big a majority but we'll keep it and we'll be able to keep this path toward prosperity that world Barbara but if if our base sits home will lose the house Nancy Pelosi\nMaxine Waters a joke Schumer they will do everything they can to stop the Trump agenda and a ... past\nRepresenting rod ... last question can you do something about the deficit please\nThe only way we're going to be able to deal with the deficit is only growing so we have enough money to close the deficit and hopefully grow enough to start paying down the old and its history demonstrated is you have to grow the economy to get revenue coming in", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Yellowhammer Radio", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "26"}
