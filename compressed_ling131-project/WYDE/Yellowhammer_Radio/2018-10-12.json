wondering\nWhy why we didn't think of this why did I not think of this why did I not\nThink of sushi burritos that seems like a good way to start the day right good way to start the launch\nIt is a hometown chore ads or Saudi wants highway two eighty Russell be here with you until three filling in for Ford on the Ford faction it has a beautiful day we're in the middle of October and only now begins to feel like ... even though we're a month into fall but what a great day it is now I have heard\nAbout what zombie once before heard about the legend\nOf the sushi burritos but never have seen for myself and never have tasted for myself never have enjoyed for myself\nUntil now and let me tell you it is delicious [laughter]\nSomething called the four twenty nachos and I'm not entirely sure what the Ford twenty stands for I had my suspicions\nThey must love that time of afternoon shortly that's what it's about right if you're going to mix to read those and spicy tuna\nAnd avocado and ... and happiness it's a it's a good clean fun recipe here with you we've got a lot to talk about love hope you'll come by and say hello assigned me wants to date I'm here till three Andrew Jessica the line I Will be here a little bit later on and we're going to have some fun with it a couple of headlines here or have you [laughter]\nHave you seen Donald Trump and Kanye West they're ... they had going on in the White House\nOr this week in the oval office um I Love it I have not the biggest fan of Kanye and if you\nHear me on superstation summertime you know not the biggest fan of President Trump either but I appreciate that both men have the\nCourage to speak their minds and uh and they wanted to do that it was it was amazing seeing the the video\nOf a all these [laughter] all these cameras and reporters gathered around taking photos you've got President Trump sitting behind a desk you didn't have um\nWest sitting there he's got his make America great had again on and he is good to go a funny stuff watching coverage on cable news the last twenty four hours or so or the left not real happy with ... but again you know he's talking about alternative universes and\nSpeaking your mind and not being able being afraid to do so so I applaud him for that meantime we've got a Trump junior and Michael ... the a lawyer for Stormy Daniels currently in a cat fight they're challenging one another to an eBay brawl\nSort of thing and the ... um I've never actually paid for a U.S see about I'm not paid for [noise]\nA boxing match since probably the days of Tyson and Evander Holyfield but I think if I could see Michael have an ID and Trump junior square off I Will be willing to pay for that even if a all the more if we knew that some of that money was going to charity\nI Do like Trump junior was not familiar with him really until the\nConvention a couple of years ago but ah yeah I think that would be good we're also going to get this weekend the millennia Trump interview I guess it'll be on ABC they've been promoting that's all week and uh she seems like an immensely likeable person\nTrump interview I guess it'll be on ABC they've been promoting that's all week and uh she seems like an immensely likeable person we don't know much about her she had a recent trip to Africa that's when the interview was\nFilmed the ah the report will be aired later latest today a that we've got that going on\nOther things in the world on Wall street we have a very volatile week or the down down about five percent the last couple of days early this morning reporting that to the Dow was up I heard earlier on\nAnd we've got that we have lots of oil and demand and being pumped out a hundred million barrels a day\nOr so those are some of the things we have going on speaking to money big money being raised by Beto O'Rourke looking to take down Ted Cruz in Texas He's raised thirty eight million dollars\nIn the last three months that is impressive so those are some of the things going on but really the big story that uh is capturing my interest a couple of days actually involve turkey they're different stories\nIn the next few years be buying what will be our last card that will drive because automation will be taking over they predict in the coming years and so I couldn't help but think\nAbout the record or that were on highway two eighty here\nAnd um and just think of the congestion that we have now you remember back a few years ago when they were trying to think about maybe having overpasses and an elevated highway that uh we're just going to get more and more congested but as I think that there's a possibility that our kids or our grandkids may never drive a car is odd for me to think about\nYou have a coworker of course what must children are much older and they're driving now but he is younger children and he is he actually said I Hope my kids never dropped wow never have to draw on what ... what I really hope they never have to bridge that gap between the sixteen\nTo Nineteen year old learning to drive making the mistakes I really hope that technology arrives and they'll never have to to go through that\nI think about that because it's already hard enough now as an adult someone who has years and years of driving experience to navigate the roads with texting and people on their phones and the distracted driving but yeah you think about being a new driver with this congestion\nAnd thankfully cars are safer but yeah my kids Charlie and Sarah ... turned twelve\nSo the next four years they're going to be learning how to drive and then driving so they were worried this past weekend like that\nI don't think I'm ever going to get to drive a car like you will you know we're not going to be changing that rapidly but it is possible that their kids may never there you know my grandkids may never drive a car may never know what that's like there'll be droning to work and that is true it's kind of like the Jetsons right from years ago um\nLike that idea droning road work to work who are kind of your own and you know here it goes like let's say a couple of other the headlines we've got going on here it's the hometown tour Russell filling in for a buddy at Ford the fourth faction today till three Andrew and Jessica are coming we're talking\nAbout the Donald Trump and God yeah west several man that was kind of a wild seeing if I Am working I don't know if you saw the footage of Kanye West hanging out with the president in the oval office this week that's why you got like a rap star\nGot the the celebrity that is Donald Trump and like that is the leader of the free world and I'm not quite sure what to make\nOf all of that does it make you feel better or worse about our country when when China is giving the president if I\nWill I Will say that I didn't see any footage of any of that but uh I'll have to just not comment\nOn that he was talking about alternative universes and it was interesting I was a guy he does speak his mind sometimes\nI don't know what he's talking about but I appreciate his his mind all the same\nAll right mark and I appreciate your coming by your dear friend of mine and I hope that you and Carolyn enjoy your lunch I recommend the nachos I had the ... and um I Know you're just coming by for lunch and maybe a free T shirt for two major radio to you and you've done an\nJob growth I think he bought it All right uh we shall continue on here on a super station wanna one W ... Russell the hometown tour brought to you by progress bank can ... tactical\nAppreciate them making it happen we've got\nCorn home set up ready to go Brittany I don't think realizes that on the world's worst corn hall I don't think in the history of corn home of ...\nBut up ready to go Brittany I don't think realizes that I'm the world's worst Cornel I don't think in the history of corn home I've ever actually been able to defeat a single person um I lose just about every time it is is quite embarrassing we had a Christian concerts on the uh sister station\nOr earlier in the summer and I was absolutely dreadful having to take your calls give us a call check in and say hello nine four one one oh one one say hello as we continue on here at will solve the ones having\nWorked in the food industry for a number of years I've never been around such a innovative menu items I started out at a fast food restaurant I put them out of business I think my brother and I put them out of business\nIt was called mighty Casey Brittany is here with me reading let me tell you that mighty Casey cases like a Burger King it was burgers hotdogs fries on your rang\nI was Fifteen Years old this is my first official job my brother was Seventeen and we were like the two cooks to work there we had a junior burger special three for a dollar that would like every so often\nIs these small little hamburgers are usually about a buck a piece but every now and again maybe three or four dollars a pack the crew after church would come and loaded for their families and we had to make a lot of burgers ahead of time so people could come by\nProblem was they only lasted in the window about six minutes before you had to get rid of him and buy get rid of them I mean you could throw them away\nOr you could eat them so\nThe highest integrity thing in my like my brother and I will purposefully made about a dozen or two dozen extra burgers and then watch the clock I grew up often hey we think is about to get busy for medicine now let's make thirty seven thousand burgers\nAnd then we had like four of them uh started off and we need to throw those away so I was staying in the corner of the mighty Casey in my work Vicky like those type type work pants and I\nJust blew through those work pants and about three months of work in a mighty Casey is because I was eating the product the product not selling the product\nWasting their products going out of business all that to say was that we wanted to probably do well not to hire me to work here because there for twenty nachos\nAre delicious the wreck roll sushi burrito with the steak\nWith the spicy tuna\nChopped up to read those in their rice happiness it is so good sauce uh [noise] it just makes me happy they've got three locations and they've got this new one here on highway two eighty and entering as it is just up the hill from Home Depot kind of adjacent you'll see the flags you'll see us you'll see our friends hanging out here\nOn the patio it is good and you will enjoy the fall time temperatures that we have it's a\nReally it's quite amazing it was good to wake up this morning actually be a little chilly it seemed like summer stretch from April\nAll the way into the middle of October we just completely bypass fall we're going to go right from hundred degree temperatures without like to freezing by the time we get to Christmas but we're just going to go just right past\nFault but the day is fantastic we get temperatures in the seventies we don't have rain fall day we don't have rainfall this weekend we have football it actually feels like the fall and it is nice\nAmazing thing those videos the footage of the hurricane that came through Florida and to the Carolinas hurricane Michael and particularly when\nThe footage of the hurricane that came through Florida the Carolinas hurricane Michael particularly when you're watching and if it's a place that you visited seems storm coverage all the time and it\nIt it it's a different part of the world like we can imagine those wins but when they're showing on television places where you and your family vacation it's like in the world is going on and then when they say that the storm was\nThe strongest up any storm that's made landfall in the last\nFifty years when it was two miles an hour to being a category five it's a just incredibly see parts of the panhandle underwater I did hear President Trump said he was echoing some of the meteorology said that the one good thing if it was it was so strong and strengthen so fast\n\n\nRecently on the muscles hurt your\nCar which I don't want him a lot of my life in the kitchen I Do at least\nI Know somebody say something mind\nYou're on the same page when I'm cooking dream you know\nI mean [noise]\nWhen I married my first wife Richie ... data gathered and I said I don't know if I ... as\nShe should remain I said well you said to sacrifice in front of\nMe [laughter]\nGive are for\nThe most ... most superstitious moon but we want to do\nOn a crisp Cuomo show he had few Kavanaugh classmates a brings them on to assess the character of Brett Kavanaugh\nHe drank Levi forgive the airlines have liked to do there among the like a ... drunk dabbles trying all these actually if he may have some really questioning you believe climate sounds when you're dealing with now and\nI've seen him eat dinner last for a walk around I gave him a medical examinations and what he is definitely not have a week's on account painted a stomach and then he Ralph\nFollowed by a bit of weight I mean you walk around the cutting a little bit from above slept for half the smell that lets you suffer from sergeant\nWas run of the male burger place right near the station but uh I felt so bad coming back to you like big Dave I spent Thirteen dollars and you didn't even get a drink at all so I feel terrible\nIt was all good you know in his logos food when you go back with us we're you know it was worth your while\nWell I appreciate you being so humble and gracious and and and appreciate it because there are other people in the building who would have made me they got a payday loan to pay them back so I don't know if they were good no don't get home certainly know that they were five dollars good\nGood [laughter] well let's see the good thing here about what ... is a is a fellow who runs this particular location has been in this industry for a long a long amount of time and he knows the finest ingredients he knows what it takes to make really delicious sushi and other places\nThere's just the expectation that sushi has to cost a premium it has to come at a premium but he wanted to in his term demystify\nThe sushi experience and so they've got a you know options here in the ten dollar range it's a lot of food is just as good as anywhere else you'll find it's in a creative presentation delicious flavors some\nSome flavors you wouldn't have expected to put together but it's really really good but it's affordable it's ah it's it's not like that five dollar junior burger nonsense and we got stuck\nWith yesterday well you know and I've I've never has who's ... who's going to use it for sure I mean I Love you know other stuff but\nThe way you're talking about it\nI think I might have to try\nWhen you got to track is here's the thing with sushi like ...\nSo you know but\nThe way you're talking about it\nI think I Hope you know\nWe got a track because here's the thing with sushi people hear it and they assume that everything's going to be wrong that you're going to be getting some sketchy stuff\nIt doesn't have to be that they got a whole selection of sushi burritos everything in there is cooked and you may be thinking well I'm not a seafood person you can get one that doesn't even have any seafood if you like rice\nYou like cheese the particular one I had to read those in it had steak is well it's got a sweet sauce it's got some heat to it they have my man we're going to just opens new avenues for you I can just feel as though the scales and your eyes\nAre going to come off and your sushi destiny is before you were you hooked me at the root of\nWhy you know that's something\nMuch like a the cue\nGirl and Jerry Maguire you had me at hello you had me at the root of the ... that is good well we're going to be on here all after name that afternoon big day but I don't know if a are you handling the show later today for Andrew and Jessica are you off at three\nIn the building while\nWell you don't need to be in the building you need to be here or maybe you know I can bring it back some of these uh\nThese delicious things that we have a that is good news All right let's get back to the news here for camp or just a little bit I Want to talk more about this a Donald Trump and Kanye West meeting that they had in the in the oval office and I even as a Google that right now I see that other entertainers are worried\nAbout Kanye West you got one rapper by the name of TI he says his patients for Kenya West is dead and gone\nAfter the Trump meeting I was watching coverage on MSNBC and they were talking about his mental illness and he's bipolar and there needs to be an intervention apparently it's you're not allowed to be an entertainer I guess a black entertainer from the perceived to be from the left trying to make nice with the president\nOn the rights you got another entertain attain are saying he's ashamed to be associated with John yeah west after his bizarre White House the parents and it was\nBizarre I don't want to I don't want to act like it's not I am but I I have to admit that day if I was amused did you have any thoughts on that encounter\nA ... [laughter]\nYou know hey did not do it for you know\nAnd I was doing Scott earlier today the newness Rodman ... [laughter]\nThat's pretty good comparison that is a pretty good but the best of my knowledge\nI have not seen Kanye West dress up in an evening down the way that uh we didn't Rodman dress up like in a wedding dress sometime years back I Would\nBut I have no ... well I've never liked him but he really didn't like him when he went up on stage is mark ... room with\nLittle cute Taylor Swift don't become after Taylor Swift\nYou you know I mean but\nDon't you know you don't go to him from a political\nYeah I'm not necessarily looking for him to a signal which direction I should go but I Do applaud anybody who's willing to speak their mind I don't have to agree with what they say but I at least appreciate that they're willing to go on record and you better believe that he was going on record because they had a whole Oval Office\nStill with journalists who were documenting everything he says or video showing their camera they're writing about their blogging about I mean what's that must be like to just imagine big day something you say something I say becomes national or international news is just hard to imagine what that must be\nMust be like to just imagine big day something you say something I say becomes national or international news is just hard to imagine what that must be like to live that sort of life\nNumber one who should enough because in the oval office\nYeah use some foul language huh\nYeah I mean you know respect all\nRight I'll be going phones Scott peace and just dropping those kinds of um I mean that's just that's just not good at all\nSo show a little risk factor I have a little ah have a little dignity already well\nYou know it just because we're America America had all we've All right Mike me like\nThrow up anymore and the lawyers you know but I'm One of these uh I don't look to other people for my political stuff I'll look at it a researcher at most so yeah\nThat's good to be spoon fed from talk radio myself that's that's what I Want to tune in for Michael art every morning he tells me what I think that's how I start my day [laughter]\nThat's good to have I so he had Trump and Kanye West meeting and the oval office earlier this week you had Michael ... challenging Trump junior to an M M A style battle you know the mixed martial arts I think that needs to happen\nYou think back to our country's history in the past where lawmakers win them and they wanted to find they can have a dual it could be a fight to the death I think that's what we we need to have Republicans and Democrats going at it and just tap out there in the octagon I think that would be good\nIn November instead of us going to the polls perhaps we go to the ... and let's just square off I think that would be great I imagine I Senator Grassley and Senator Feinstein both in their eighties on the Judiciary Committee back during the Kavanaugh hearings I think instead of just\nSquaring off with what they talked about I think if you put them both in like a\nYou know sparring gear and let them go at maybe like American gladiator style you know when they had the jousting that put him up on the pedestal I think that needs to happen big Dave\n... with the jails to knock each other all [laughter]\nWe need to change it instead of having the little solve pi ads for them to loom though yeah district conquered [laughter]\nOh that would be bad that will be bad when or what what is meant to be there for our entertainment goes that did you see this story about the guy saw this at a day or two ago this the specifics of I Can't quite remember but\nHe was like a medieval performer he liked to dress up as though he was from the time of the renaissance and he was doing some sort of\nThing on his horse with his ... and I hate to say this during lunch but he ... pale himself himself big Dave is not good\nI Know right right through the abdomen it was not like people are watching it's like hey let's pretend to do the job is let's do medieval times kind of stuff and something went wrong for this guy and his right there in front of everybody like oh that's going to leave a mark and it was a deadly blow I have one question\nThough is the horse okay\nI think the horse is going to be fine the fella on the horse\nNot as much as recipe feeling for Ford here on the Ford faction hometown to her was that we want highway two eighty brought to you by progress bank and blunt canning tactical hope to come by here till three Andrew Jessica three to six were having fun super station one on one W.
