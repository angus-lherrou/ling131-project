Maynard is the Eighteen year old suspect that the police in snow ville have been looking for [noise] for at least twelve hours now uh he shot and killed\nAnother police officer I'm looking for his name Anton Tony Thirty years old only three years on the police forces has his first job as a police officer he was shot and killed near Shiloh middle school on Saturday\nBecause he was responding to a call about a suspicious vehicles and I and it proved to be right\nMore than suspicious a deadly vehicle this a police officer was shot and killed and his ah accompanying officer had to\nUh take him to safety get him out of the line of fire and shoot back and then the two people went on the run so um as of now the Eighteen year old man was shot and killed by police are today\nAnd there was another ... a suspect they were looking for\nWho drove the getaway car I'm not sure if he is in custody at this point so that's what's developing right now I'm over in Georgia also on the international level of Saudi Arabia I Believe in the Turkish consulates say they're going to release evidence regarding this death of the\nQuote unquote journalist\n... ... what was his name something ... for ... ... maybe I don't know anyways um he is that they're going to release a stuff on on how and why and whatever his death\nOr can I be just completely Frank I don't care I don't care because it it's to me it's like watching some of those videos that circulate on Twitter\nOf a cobra fighting a python and you you're like our ... who am I supposed to root for\nI mean we're talking about Saudi Arabia here this is not a country that that's full of of saints and and and wonderful you know beacons of democracy and and a women's rights\nAnd and so ... who are we exactly are we supposed to be cheering for we've got Saudi Arabia and the Turkish conflict the country of turkey the Saudi Arabian conflict in the country of turkey turkey itself not being a a a bastion of freedom and and certainly Christian faith and so I just\nI just don't care to elaborate on this because it is like trying to kind of sort through a big\nNest of snakes and determine which one's the better snake ... basically I Will say this I'm I'm a I'm Amazed that all of a sudden after I don't know\nA ... let's see forty plus years that journalists are now very much in tune to the concept of December meant\nBecause for the past forty years they've completely ignored it when it comes to abortion and they won't even recognize that happens but all of a sudden or someone implies that the Saudi Arabian guy got dismembered and oh my goodness he was a journalist oh this is terrible President Trump needs to weigh in\nAh someone implies that the Saudi Arabian guy got dismembered and oh my goodness he was a journalist oh this is terrible President Trump needs to weigh in needs to do something never mind the Christians in in in Muslim countries that have been dismembered\nBe headed that's just member men killed in her horrific ways where where they\nWhere were the journalists there and we're have they been for the past forty some years with the dismembered moment of children every day\nUnder the guise of abortion privacy and an implied constitutional rights for women\nSo I Can't wait for them to start you know turning around since ... has really gotten them uh you know up in arms I Can't wait for them to turn around and start talking about oh I don't know how 'bout that God's know movie that's out talking about the butcher of Philadelphia who targeted poor young black women and and\nPut their health at major risk did a was a butcher literally in the in the in that the child suffered and the mother suffered and I I Can't wait for the press to turn on that I mean that's that's classic December met right there but we'll see\nDon't want to be a part of us they want to bring what they know ear and say here you go well we're here now so I'll take care of us will and I just I don't think we have that responsibility\nRight Jason ... and if I'm not speaking that's not the complete phrase the phrase also says longing for liberty\nAll right so that that you've got to have that added on it's not just the characteristics of them being poor it's then being poor and oppressed and understanding why\nAnd understanding that it's because of their government system of tyranny that may be why they're there in the position they're in at least understand why\n... ... at least you some as evaluation of your own country otherwise they're just\nLeaving and reproducing the same situation because they don't have enough sense to devalue it what's caused it\nSo yeah I I I think that's something to be considered you know what it's like Jason is like someone watching their neighbor down the road who has a really great lawn they take care of it they they're out there all the time maintaining their house in their lawn\nAnd the person becomes jealously want that their houses falling apart so their conclusion is I'm going to go break into my neighbor's home and steal his lawn equipment that will help me have\nThe law and I want [laughter] you know and not you know didn't get to the actual neighbors work ethic and desire to have that good lawn [laughter] you know they're not even a tribute mark\nMy suggestion to train them and send them back as military fighters is half a joke and a half serious and it's not without precedent let's consider that John Kennedy's they just foe paws his presidency was the bay of pigs which was pretty much that they took Cuban refugees trade train them to fight\nAnd then sent them to Cuba and then pulled out their support at the last minute so if we wish them down there to fight on the road and say you got to kick them out I bet you Honduras would take note in the Honduran government when we'll head ... before you got to\nCome and ask about that could be something to get them going for short Jason I appreciate

ahead so appreciate your bringing it up\nThanks for the call Dave I'm not going to get it to adjust yet but I'm I Will be getting to it soon it just so people have an idea of of what this all entails should these people get across the border either the ones that are headed now or the ones that are grouping\nAs we speak further south because they're getting inspired by this these people are being\nAllowed to continue on through Mexico and that is only creating more incentive for those behind to ... to join as well they should have been stopped at the Mexico Guatemala border with force if Mexico was willing and able\nTo follow through on what Trump and ask them to do but they clearly don't have the wherewithal to do that they don't have the the guts may be and that's going to be a problem because it's going to be thrown on American soil that the issue has to ... be resolved on American soil and it isn't going to be pretty people\nIt is not going to be pretty 'cause as of now according to the Washington\nPost I Believe it is a of a Twitter followers sent this to me I think you Samantha the Washington Times the members of the illegal immigrant care than has now grown to fourteen\nThousand yes I just said that let that sink in\nThe caravan in Mexico that is already gotten past the border\nIs estimated by the Washington Times and they have no incentive really to to inflate inflate these numbers because they they tend to be liberal so if anything they're downplaying but as of now today they're reporting fourteen thousand and here's the thing they're chanting\nIn Spanish she said why are they seized ... you know what that means yes we can does that sound familiar yes we can\nDoes that bring back memories of two thousand and eight a certain Mr Bush Iraq Obama\nStanding on stage chanting yes we can see say boy they\nThat's what they're saying as they marched through Mexico and they can\n'cause Mexican police aren't stopping them at all I say drop the tear gas whatever knocks them out put 'em in buses drag 'em off unconscious send them back something's got to be done immediately if you ask me\nOh we're already at the bottom of the hour we're going to continue this I'm On a roll I got a lot to say I see David Mitch or on the line you hang with us I'll get to you I promise [noise] you're listening to the Ford faction be back in a flash\nOn the same page just forgot to say to them planned but yes small\nYou know not in the league and we're talking not even in the past couple of weeks that this kind of develop you know you know how things were were developed after the shooting in in Florida with the students there and they did their march on Washington or their CNN yeah all that kind of\nKind of morphed suddenly after a crisis but and so we've seen that happen but this this had to take months to organize when you're talking about\nThousands and thousands of people marching in in in mass with no with a cohesive\nEffort saying see ... yes we can someone planted that thought and here's the really despicable thing about the whole thing is Mitch whoever planted this thought whoever told them ally whoever got it organized that they could do this is going to sit back in an office and be completely untouched\nWhen the hell hits the fan when ever for\nA train wreck yes and that's that's despicable these people are being used as pawns they're being used as bait to cause a problem at the border and it's really a shame\nMe ask you a billionaire Koch brothers organized homeless people to march into a liberal neighborhood how evil that'd be\nSo yes oh we would hear the liberals crying\nOn the side of the terrible thing\nSure yeah same thing well and we we know that a ... he got coverage for her little brouhaha which amounted to nothing compared to what\nSure yeah the same as well and we we know that a ... got coverage for her little brouhaha which amounted to nothing\nCompared to what other Republicans have endured including being shot on you know she got her time in the limelight for just getting old so yeah they will be there they will be running to those neighborhoods for sure hey thanks for the call Mitch I appreciate it Mike on line three welcome to the Ford faction\nThank him now sure oh what if what if we were to say OK all your guys that are coming in from down south alone and what we're going to do is we're going to move you into the sanctuary cities but in order to make room for you to be there or you go to court however many out of that city that we\nJust play by bringing you in how long do you think the people to be sympathetic to them coming down that\nA yes like a a trade off\nYou know yeah swap places you guys are so you know you're you're so far beyond\nThe rest of us and Europe altruism so now we're going to give you a chance to stand up for it\nYeah it's not a bad idea you know uh but you know a little awkward in line for well first of all we know that\nThe ah the sanctuary city leadership is going to cover up and not allow you to get access\nTo not have versus the ones that I have to go they're the ones that have to go that would be nice I mean we know who they are [laughter]\nWhen it wouldn't it be nice ... a trade off let's let's do Nick\nOr an exchange student plan and in this case we exchange our government officials that are part of the sanctuary cities and we send them\nDown south you know maybe they could um it could be a study program they can understand a little bit more about what the people that are coming in oh okay\nYeah and then come back and tell us how to fix the problems down there sure they get it for a bird's eye view of\nThat's right but we won't allow you immediate access to the board you got to cross the the way the illegals do you get if you got a first first hand experience walk across the Rio Grande and do all of that outback stuff [laughter] see see how you really right and\nAnd uh and the uh oh who are you talking about Rosen's thing\nYes he's a result he is\nHe is only useful and should be treated accordingly anybody that is that is a place that position like that and refused to come and answer should be suspended indefinitely without pay until they respond accordingly\nI I agree and there there is that video a couple of months back where he was and he was at some sort of um\nPanel and he had this incredible righteous indignation about how thorough\nThey are when it comes to fight in court documents and when they apply man they have to do their background yeah right Rosenstein you signed off and yet you you won't admit to the fact that you're part of the problem here you're part of the the coup you just\nOh I mean if that's if if what we've seen is their throat and this and all of this garbage when it comes to Trump and everything then we've got serious problems\nOh I Know I Know it's amazing how the Russian whole stuff um has kinda gone by the wayside because it's not turning out in in the\nFavor of the press is they were hoping and so Rosenstein limbs on but it will be a great day for Jeff Sessions actually do his job when he's gone thanks for the call brand and I appreciate
