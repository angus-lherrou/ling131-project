glad to be here will take you through to the end of the week\nAt and after that things will be changing a thanks\nFor taking control of the board pre shit you do in that case I still alcohol and we've got a lot to talk about today if you will be part of the program feel free to call in brittle take your calls nine four one one zero one one or eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three\nSo as we started out I guess we're all supposed to\nPanic we're all supposed to be panicking if you look at the headlines of the news it just broke this morning about\nThis whole uh executive order that\nYou get the headlines of the news it just broke this morning\nAbout this whole uh\nExecutive order that we're all supposed to be panicked about and debating about and I'm I'm just a little reluctant to get into it I Know it's already been discussed on the prior radio programs like Scott be soon and and even before that so I'm I'm I'm just beating on whether to just book that whole\nTendency of a following in in what's prevailing in the headlines and go with something else or one of the other stories I wanted to talk about would be this a minister who felt the need to interrupt Jeff Sessions about border patrol and throw the Bible Adam not in not literally\nMight that might have been better if he had but it's worse when they actually use the Bible and they quote it and they quote it incorrectly\nTrying to [noise] railroad you biblical early into doing something that is not in keeping with the laws of our land or or authority that the authority of of the government and it's just crazy so we can talk about that we can talk about\nHillary and Halloween coming early her flying in faster on her room with the soundbite uh that's been out there with her talking about Eric Holder and and uh Spartacus\nAnd so I'm kind of that a toss up I mean it's like maybe the Halloween wheel of of of topics I'm not sure we're all supposed to be panicked over all of it I guess um the the biggest one being the fact that a Trump is supposedly going to issue an executive order\nThat will do away with birthright citizenship well let me set the record straight on that right now if you are in this\nWithin the listening area and you're listening to my voice and you have a tendency to think oh my goodness why would he do this why why why would he do this now and and will this be a problem with the Supreme Court and and what what's going on well first of all let's get some context here in this whole situation\nFirst of all\nTrump has not I repeat has not issued an executive order\nThat has not happened so regardless of the headlines you might be seeing that is not what the that is not the case when the executive order comes out will read it and we'll go through the details and we'll discuss it but it has not happened\nWhat has happened is what I Would say an October surprise in this act CEOs which is a Web media outlet website Internet media outlet they sat down and did an interview with Trump I don't know when they did it may be a last week\nThat interview the full interview the full context is not going to be released until November fourth two days before the election that will be this Sunday\nBut actually does clearly\nCouldn't wait for that because that's the only leaves you two days to discuss issues and it could be lost over the weekend you know the weekend people are busy things get lost but when you drop something in the middle of the week when people are going to and from work and listening to the radio on a little more in touch\nThan you drop it and it's no coincidence that it happened on Tuesday and not Monday I'm telling you for sure the fact that it dropped on Tuesday not Monday is\nThe first immediate sign that this is all a plan and strategic release because Monday nobody's interested Monday ... people are just coming in from the weekends they might want to get caught up with what happened but they don't want any new news and they're not really paying attention\nPeople are just coming in from the weekends they might want to get caught up with what happened but they don't want any new news and they're not really paying attention to it Tuesdays the premium time to bring something new in and drop a bomb if you want so to speak\nSo that's exactly why it happened this morning it's all strategic media ... a media tactics and uh so what I'm saying is this whole interview with President Trump or you could get the full context of what he's saying\nIs not going to be released until the end of this week so they released a snippet\nOf what he said\nAnd from that we are getting full blown headlines\nAbout what he could possibly make sort of kind of ... might do what he's indicating he wants to do which isn't a surprise people it's not a surprise that he would consider that we're somehow we're supposed to be surprised shocked and panicked about what he did\nThey would have been able to easily get Herman that he did not need ... um\nAsk you a question on that than I Know that the issue of the parole board um doing early releases and you know the governor issuing a kind of a whole to that a stay on that um\nSo we know that where she stands on that have you ... have you found out anything on ... um ... there's something going on in there in that the debate we aren't aware of even though it's\nNot what I was wondering if there's just some of\nThese candidates potentially site Memorial Day more and put forth an exact yes in in with her I guess maybe hopefully she received it was just a gift flight that she gave early release the parolees because in\nMy determination if you're in court and let them to commit the crime there's going to be a if you're found guilty you will stay there many years you type the police because you said that you're going to be paroled out early argue following the story on\nUh-huh yeah OK and in the case of her why pie in that way you were in agreement with that county was that state of Alabama is that your parole date would be a certain time\nAnd now with this was like a ... of a opinion unless it's just something she doesn't she took a wide had nothing to do with making a deal in court [noise] then you have\nYou you you really need to own your\nAgreement are you following me\nSort of I I think that the\nProblem is definitely I have this idea of like give you so many points to see if you're a viable sure up for parole and you want to get it that test determines it and maybe the families of the victims say talking to a parole board and the horses warning the person out\nI think if you're legitimately absolutely had interviews where the person's that especially in the case for North Alabama\nThey would say there is something wrong with this person and I do not need ... back out his society and I think we are the only state might be not like you were the other that\nYou don't see the parole board but you get her out or not\n... well that fact is very alarming there's no doubt about it I think that there's likely to change to come in that it since it's been brought to their attention I mean I'm IV did put a stay on their so obviously there's something that needs to be sorted out here that has caused her to act\nOr I Would like I Would like more statements and I would like to I Would really like the answer to the question will ain't going to be done about absolutely more\nFace to face interrogation a parole board members of the potential parolees even if we have to hire more our safety here is more important than just using a basic tests that someone's guy someone that never takes the individual personalities are middle states into account\nWell I I agree I think that's something you know we need to bring up to a Kay Ivey end as ... attorney general Steve Marshall at some point down the road I don't think it's going to play into whether or not we vote them in this point because it's not become a critical now describe them out\nI was just saying that in a normal for the if the candidates were closer we could have things like this and we're we're not getting it so I wanted to bring in one of 'em up\nOkay All right well I appreciate the call Charles I'm good\nThanks I'm calling in joy ... always enjoyed hearing your ... okay\nThank you Charles I appreciate it All right so there you have it we need to discuss this whole pardons and Paroles process it needs to be reevaluated definitely\nAll right so there you have it we need to discuss this whole pardons and Paroles process it needs to be reevaluated definitely if these people aren't even showing up um I don't know what the reasoning is behind that if they feel they're more impartial\nBecause they're not looking at someone and they're just reading the words and the records a\nDefinitely a you know ... the family members are\nAre not able to get in there and and express their views that's a problem but I don't think that's the case so I'm not a hundred percent up on this on this whole process maybe because it hasn't hit home like it has where Charles is in ... let's go to clerk hey welcome to the fore faction\nHi how are you miss time I'm doing All right now I'm doing great are\nPretty good on a college degree even better\nYeah yeah if I was any greater you know iris would find a way to tax me on it\nYou know as\nYeah as a broadcast professional what\nI think we would be talking about today if Donald Trump had not triggered him on the birthright citizenship\nWell one thing is we're sure we will tell you what we wouldn't be we wouldn't be talking about Hillary and her crass remark or stupid remark we wouldn't be talking about the second caravan that's forming down along the Mexico Guatemala border where they are now have gang members in and and throwing rocks\nAnd and fights breaking out in the second care of all\nWe wouldn't be better we will be talking about that for sure where did you say\nI say the second caravan of sewing Molotov cocktails\nOh it's gotten to bombs now okay\nYeah oh of course you're not going to hear about those bonds that actually just blows so yeah\nI write articles\nToday would probably be the a heinous shooting over the weekend and we still be on the drama bomber\nNow you're probably right right and um you know they tried all ready to pin the synagogues that shooting on on Trump it doesn't really fly considering that his daughter and son in law are Jewish and he'd never ever said anything anti Semitic or as opposed to other people like a fair can um\nAnd even you know some other all issues that come up go ahead\nOf that and he's been the most Israeli friendly president we've had since that's been a country in the past century\nThat Oh yes absolutely moving the embassy to Jerusalem is a big deal and they'd conveniently forgetting that still trying to pin it on him the shooting which isn't flying nobody's buying it except maybe to the hard left\nSo the Donald drop one little comment on may be doing an executive order\nAnd all the talking heads of just about completely swallowed I Would say that on TALK radio there has probably been as much education on the intention for the fourteenth amendment as there's ever been\nAnd we change the news cycle from talking about the drama bomber and do the shooter whose name I'm not even going to mention right as oh I see where the guys are genius all it's just a just like oh\nWell we have on clerk or do you think the Trump organized this release of the snippet because he's not in control of when and how they do it or what snippet for that matter that they pick\nWhere you are correct and that but he knew\nThe release of the snippet because he's not in control of when and how they do it or what snippet for that matter that they pick\nLeader or correct in that but he knew when he threw that out there that that was just too much red meat for them not to go with it\nOkay I hear ya he he knew that ... knowing what they are going to bite at he figured hey I'll put it out there we'll see where it goes if it doesn't count it and I can bring it up on my own\nThere you go it's just like you know when when they got all over him about uh\nWhat did he was was you mean he'd demean Christine Blasey Ford yeah oh it ridiculed or that's what it was ridiculed her and in doing so\nHe got the mainstream media outlets to do what they hear the horror of or had not done which was discuss the fact that she was wishy washy on everything she said\nWrite he basically he imitated her that's all he did but they they pushed it further and made it into ridicule and he just simply imitate what she did which was say I don't know [laughter] and you're right it brought it the whole detailed level of that out that wasn't before\nBeing discussed which is yeah it is pretty brilliant\nOh so you know when you can get people that don't like you or maybe even hey you should do what you want done that's pretty good I mean bronco aren't really didn't have to do anything except sit back and watch them carry his water\nRight and here you've got Trump\nHe's got both sides carrying his water one way or the other all he's got to do something well it's because he's not afraid to bring up the topic he doesn't feel the need to dance around it and you know play foot seas with it and tiptoe through the tulips he he took it on he said it um you know he said what they're\nFrom the beginning he was all about reforming immigration and stopping the influx of illegals who are siphoning off a lot of things from the American taxpayer their money their time their energy and their vote and um\nHave you on TALK of the movie true grit the original\nA long time ago I'm sure I saw it with my father\nWhen Matty raw was looking for a U.S marshal go after the man that killed her that she was asking the local law and in reference to John Wayne character he said well Farah don't enter into his thinking\nYeah and a kind of reminded me of when you're talking about a man of fried bring things up yeah yeah well first of all kind of refreshing to see somebody that uh is willing to make the most\nStop that for a second okay it can definitely don't be done with an act of Congress so he puts that out there and then he puts out let's just say he planned this or he knew it would be thrown out there this whole executive order\nI Can't say that I blame him he's basically signaling what he wants to do how he wants to cut off this loophole and if he really wants to be effective the best thing is obviously legislation\nAnd the only way to get that is for Republicans to come out next Tuesday\nRepublicans and Democrats sensible Democrats Democrats who value their citizenship value their vote value the borders of their country and value the laws of the land need to come out and vote and independence too and they need to put Republicans in Congress\nSo that this legislation can be passed because right now\nThe Democrat Party has been hijacked by extreme socialist leftist who do not want this and they want ice and they won't border patrol to be abolished they don't want any laws to be enforced and they certainly don't want to turn anybody away why because it creates chaos\nAnd allow them more ability to can gain control it\nAlso is but as a secondary benefit if you will a new voter block if they can get them hooked on government programs than making almost guaranteed to get a repeat vote to ensure the government programs continue this is all part of the plan to to um\nYou can almost guarantee they'll get a repeat vote to ensure the government programs continue this is all part of the plan to to um ... basically break up the sovereignty of the U.S as we know it and allow other\nAllow the left to gain more control either by hook or by crook quite honestly\nGet the votes\nAnd if it's illegal no problem we can say in all you know plausible deniability that we just accepted the popular vote\nRemember Hillary Hillary was pushing that and after she lost people were saying well she won the popular vote maybe we need to reevaluate electoral college and all of that well again I we can go go back and revisit that but maybe we ... we won't\nThere's questions is whether or not those were legitimate popular votes considering that a lot of them were from California and we can go into that whole thing and that's a whole\nPack rats quite honestly the whole point is look back to the the executive order I don't want to get to derailed here\nI think it's a brilliant move even if he didn't plan it even if he didn't plan to release it like\nAt this time and actually it was thought oh this will hurt him let's throw it out there I think it's to his benefit because it shows that he's willing to take whatever measures he can to secure the border and to allow for American citizens to be\nBrought into the United states the proper way not through a technical loophole that as being exploited\nAnd when he's showing that when he's doing doing this he's showing to the American people what he's willing to do but he's also signaling that he could do it better and it could be more of a long term effect if the Congress\nCan pass legislation and that is all the more incentive once again to make sure you hook it to the polling places next Tuesday do not let anything get in your way broken glass alligators in most\nSwarming bees don't let it happen don't let anybody stop you from doing this because the Democrats quite honestly they need us they need to shut down they need to shut down fast um\nBecause they think that that\nThey think that Trump's an anomaly and that they can ah regained some ground this time around before uh too much damage is done in their mind and we can't let it happen because it's not damage it's good ed welcome to the Ford faction you're talking to me Andrea dice welcome and I\nI enjoy doing great anyway are you going back to Russia [noise]\nNo no I'm I'm here [laughter] my my I was an anchor baby years and years ago [laughter]\n... Lewis a judge freedom Scott it yes yeah anyway I didn't\nGet to ... radio to Guyana fortunately but I remember when we had this old divided on birthright citizenship I think the argument at that time was whether you needed a constitutional amendment over the federal law suffice to change the situation to deal with the so called anchor baby problem\nAnd I think at that time that it was constitutional or stuff like that would be the best way however should argued for quite for ... for this part court for ... for short is a bit of federal law would work and so I Would like to see it tried\nI don't know that it will prevail if you're gonna have a chance for Kavanaugh's vote we would need at least a federal law but as far as executive to create\nUh I think it's going to have a chance for Kavanaugh's vote we would and made at least a federal law I think but as far as executive to create changing that situation I think that would be a separation of powers under the constitution\nI Do think Trump has every right to enforce their borders they can send troops down there though that's well within as right as commander in chief as well as\nApply ... applying the force of immigration laws is well within his rights to do that\nYet I'm I was trying to while you were talking I was trying to look at the amendment in my little constitution and I'm I'm having a hard time with my um Roman numerals okay here we go\nFishing and the more the more I investigated it at the time I found out that basically the founders did not even address the problem exactly very clearly citizenship but they did have legislation not an amendment that pretty much recognize I think what was somewhat conventional that yet birthright citizenship at that time as well as\nAh by blood as far as your descendents so so so basically and and if you're on a boat show you had a great British flag and you were born on that for two parents that were American you could argue for dual citizenship ordinary pass for dual citizenship is you have a a parent of either country or countries\nListen if the legislation spells out this type of a dual citizenship or birthright citizenship and if it's done in legislation than it can be undone or clarified or redirected\nOr adjusted through legislation because the actual amendment is not it's not very long it's it's you know twenty words and ... and I think\nThere's something to the argument for the I mean I didn't at the time yeah\nAfter after my research I found out well if it's only a federal law that defines censorship is a federal law that can redefine it but as far as an executive ... degree I think they can ... the executive supposed to enforce the law not make the law\n[noise] true but you know what even if he if he doesn't get the legislation that he wants that he's already signal he needs to do this properly\nI say hey go by executive order and let it go up to the U.S Supreme Court so that it can be finally defined it really needs to be defined especially when it comes to the fourteenth amendment because there is context by which that amendment was passed and it hadn't\nNowhere was there any anticipation that this loophole of using it by putting your body on the ground of the U.S to claim citizenship was going to be used by a bunch of the illegal people coming in I'm\nSorry ... as you well know that it could go to the Supreme Court and they could decide the case without ever really defining issue at hand for example life you're going to the conception that decided roe v way but they didn't define what life again\nWell that's a good point and I appreciate that but well you know what I think there is no harm done if he doesn't get to legislate the Congress that he wants to pass legislation and he takes it to the executive order to the Supreme Court with his executive order and it may not go like he wants the whole no harm done at least he tried he tried both ways thanks for the call and I think\nI think you'd have a better chance of getting or reverse with the federal law\nYeah I think that's probably the better way to go and he mentioned it in that interview but nobody really wants to point that out thanks for the call and I appreciate it yeah he mentioned that the legislation is the better way\nTo go but you know obviously right now he stands at a ... not having enough votes to do this if if even if there were all the Republicans I'm well that's assuming that the the middle of the road\nGet on board which you know they aren't so he needs legislation and um he saying I'm willing to take it another way if I don't get what I Want simply because I'm bitter\nWhich you know they are so he needs legislation and um he saying I'm willing to take it another way if I don't get what I Want simply because I'm determined to get this done All right we'll be back in a minute got to go to a break this is Andrea Tice with the ...\nThe Ford faction making radio great again\nDo you want to melt
