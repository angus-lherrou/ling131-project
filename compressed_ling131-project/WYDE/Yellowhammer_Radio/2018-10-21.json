wrap up our discussion of calm [noise]\nWays that we can reduce the cost of college for our children\nWays the parents can save a little bit of money by using the resources are out there for financial aid or in today I'm just kind of want to ramp up with um [noise] a general talk about assets but first I Want to cover\nProbably the most common area of questions that I received in the classes in seminars that I teach on the subject and\nSo I Want to cover probably the most common area of questions that I received in the classes in seminars that I teach on the subject\nAnd that is you know ... the fast applications who falls for these things and generally this is a question that's coming up because there's been a divorce and there's maybe been remarriage so his songs for now\nSo lemon discovered this very quickly um there's a financial aid term that we use ... custodial\nCustodial parent and the custodial parent and the financial aid world is the person that actually fouls the faster than the person that actually\nGoes to the website inputs their information or their assets and so forth and the qualification is done than expected family contribution so this is deporting issue because um this is something that can work against you or for you\nBecause quite often in divorce situation especially when there's when your marriage there's an awful lot of questions about whether or not it should be the stepfather or the ... who is the one that provides that and I could weren't for you and I could work against you\nDepending on their financial situation but so what determines the custodial parent you know what the term in the fall of the paperwork\nWell first of all the weren't custodial does not mean custody\nThere is a relationship and answering this question for parents when it comes to custody but it doesn't mean the same thing it doesn't mean you have legal custody it does not mean he was the depend a lot of people saying whoever files for the depending on their tax return\nI is going to be the one who actually follows the financial aid forms that is not the case\nUm there's one question that's asked in these types of situation\nIf they situations to determine who finals for the application and that is what are the students live the most the last twelve months where did the student live the most the last twelve months now that is what's going to dictate whether or not it's a step parent or a natural parent\nAnd in the last twelve months this is the twelve month period beginning in ending from the application date gee fill out the faster non a calendar year\nSo in the previous twelve months where the child live the most if that child live with the mom in the ... they're the ones that fill out the application now there's a second question that that's involved here and that would be in the situation\nThat a child did not live with more than one parent than the other most of the time\nEven a joint custody situation they are going to live most of the time\nUh with the mom but then the second question answers ... is a support question and this comes back that independent so if you're not able to answer the question of where the student live the most in the last twelve months then you have to go to a top record question\nWhich is who provided the most support in the past what ... and this does relate to how we found for uh how we claim someone isn't dependent on the tax return\nSo we we first go and see where the child's live the most what the most the time the last twelve months if that is more of a fifty fifty situation than we can get who provided the most support in the last twelve months\nWhoever that his answer is who follows the fast [noise] that is probably the most common a question that I received from parents not knowing what to do and it could be something that works for you\nThat is probably the most common a question that I received from parents not knowing what to do and it could be something that works for you could be something that works against you but quite often uh this is going to mean that a stepfather\nAnd a mom or going to report their income and assets not favorable it might not be favorable for you to do that but custodial parent means\nThe parent who is responsible for filing it doesn't mean custody it means who they're responsible who is responsible for filing so it really comes down here where the student lives the most in the last twelve months\nNow just as a side note another question that I received a is also related to the educational credits that are out there\nAre people get confused between the financial aid roles and the IRS rules for filing your taxes and an ... of that before as far as what a dependent um a custodial parent is not the parent in the finals for independent\nUm whether or not and you can or cannot software independent on your tax return has nothing to do with the rule [noise] very similarly whoever files for the educational credit for the child may or may not be in a non testing on custodial parent\nDoesn't have anything to do with that I'm quite often on ... most people are aware of the hub credit and the various um student credits that are out there that you can take off your taxes that has no bearing on the situation of who follows the financial aid application\nSo you might have one parent is claiming independent and falling for credit even though someone else has actually paying for college\nAnd those things might might matter to the Iran is as far as whether you take these credits or not but that doesn't make any difference to the financial aid rules and the faster process so I just want to get that out of the way very quickly\nAnd for their main on the time I Want to focus on really the most important part\nOf the series and that is ways that we can we can read we can increase our financial aid ways that we can receive\nI'm Better situations and we've we've gone through all these different rules as far as a treatment of our income and assets but I Want to go further from now on and talk about ways that we can plan ways that we can rearrange our assets ways that we can reduce\nThe cost of college because we increase the cost of All right\nUm now I teach a class on all this and I called my a lot of different things and one thing I call it by is one way I describe it is by reducing uh tell people that I can help to reduce\nThe cost of college by fifty percent in the way that I can do now is by rearranging their assets\nOr they will allow them to take advantage of the financial aid rules wants types of assets in income or counted\nVersus what types of assets or income that are not counted\nUm in maximize that process it's no different than when we fill out our tax return we want to take full advantage of the tax laws\nWe don't want to pay any more taxes than we illegally obligated to same kind of thing here so let's talk about these different um rules as they relate to specific income and assets\nIn the first thing that we need to talk about it's what we call the base year [noise] and the base here as the financial aid timeline in is the time\nSaying that we need to talk about is what we call the base year [noise] and the base here as the financial aid timeline in is the timeline for when financial events happen it goes into the eligibility for the faster\nIn in past years um the base year began the junior\nOn January first will be a challenge junior year and went through twelve thirty one of the senior year and that was the financial aid time on that was the timeline of any kind of financial event whether it was income\nOr anything that happened during that time period would go into the financial aid a fast so application\nSo now recently they changed now they actually went back two years on the income and I may not have made the statement and one in the previous weeks that you needed to look at the financial aid process starting in October the first and this is where this change comes in\nBecause now they're looking back two years so now the base year involves the sophomore year January January first of a child sophomore year\nBut several there's several things that are going on here one is that there's a there's a crate treatment between a difference in treatment between an asset it's owned by a chow versus an asset that some of my parents\nAnd let me just say almost right suppose that you have a forty thousand are asset that's owned by child typically we see this this is actually a lot of times where the grandparents comes in and they they set up an asthma only call you Jim ... a month in uniform and gift to monitor\nAnd we set up these accounts and there namely mind set up sometimes I say grandparents giving stock to their kids every year for Christmas grandkids every year for Christmas something along those lines but what happens is when you have an asset that's owned by a child\nIt's counted about four times more for the financial aid process than an asset that's owned by a parent\nSo if he had a forty thousand dollar asset in a parent's name for example about two thousand dollars of that would be considered\nFor the expected family contribution so at forty thousand dollars only two thousand over this counted towards your ability to pay for college now if that child is in if the assets in the child's name eight thousand dollars is counted\nIt's four times as much and the thought process is is the government recognizes that an asset that a parent has is it just only going to be used for college they've got other reasons to use those assets other needs so only a portion of those assets are used for college\nWhen in contrast for the student all of that money can be used for college I mean what else are they going to use it for the by gangs so the first planning situation that goes on is by making sure\nThat we remove these assets from the child's name and we can do now by moving those assets to an excluded asset in just hold that thought for a minute and I'll come back\nTo the minute and the other the other problem that I went into\nWith people filling out these applications is as far as what the value of their home is in general the the value of your primary residences excluded as an asset for the financial aid purposes but some colleges won't want to include it\nParticularly prominent and more expensive schools now only applications you have to put down the fair market value of the home\nThat is defined as what you would sell for when you sell it for today not necessarily what you would like to sell it for but when you could sell it for today\nYou know a lot of people overstate the value of their homes on this financial aid applications and render their their themselves in eligible for financial aid because of that\nNow the final thing that I Want to cover as far as assets is one isn't excluded asset or there's basically two different categories three different categories of\nExcluded assets one I just mentioned that was the house the other two are retirement plans in cash value insurance retirement plans and cash value insurance\nAccording to the rules of the fast so um\nCash value insurance retirement plans and cash value insurance according to the rules of the fast so [noise]\nUm the value of a a retirement plans highrise saps and so forth are not included in the process those are excluded assets\nSo the value of those things do not go into the equation about whether or not using contribute money to your child's um to your child's college and so forth\nUm same is true for cash value insurance as well that is says excluded asset so it's not one of the assets that is put on the application\nNow the reason why that's important is because you have an opportunity to move assets from included assets to excluded assets\nBy using and taking advantage of these retirement plans or cash value insurance and let me preface this by saying and I'll close out this um [noise]\nThe section today with us I really need you to listen to me very carefully 'em over the years I've run into an awful lot of people that convince parents that they need to move assets to these excluded assets so they can receive more money\nAnd and that is true if you do have the ability of moving a nice excluded assets\nTo assets that are non included the problem is that that the insurance guys use this as a way to sell their insurance so the type of asset you move it to it needs to have a very specific characteristic\nSo for example if you have a brokerage account with finality\nAnd you might have a hundred thousand dollar brokerage account with finality you can actually move that account to either a cash value insurance policy or an annuity for retirement and have that excluded and by excluding now you will increase the amount of aid\nOr that you receive a on in the Senate faster process the problem is that you need to do this with with the right type of assets\nThis is not a situation that you go to your regular insurance guy and find the right types of products to do this they excluded assets have gone to fit a certain criteria\nAnd in general what that's going to mean is that there is no fees there's no commissions\nI'm moving your assets to something this excluded is a good idea in general but it has to be done with the types of products\nAnd has to be done with the right type of insurance and the new with these they have to have a certain characteristics that cannot be loaded they cannot ... that can not surrender charges\nIn by having those three characteristics is going to mean that about Ninety nine point nine percent\nOf companies out there are not going to be able to provide you with this type of product\nOr it's going to have to be someone like Schwab someone life ... someone like vanguard someone that's that's geared towards this this non loaded no fee lo fi or no surrender charge type situation\nThat is the only example of products that when they decided they won't work\nIf you take your assets in you moved into an excluded asset into insurance into annuities into there's various things ... you mean to be able to do it temporarily you mean to be able to move it back without cost you mean the ... mayoral to move it back\nIt's ... you mean to be able to do it temporarily you mean to be able to move it back without cost you mean the ... be able to live with Matt\nWithout any kind of real penalty and that is not going to exist if you go down the road to your Merrill Lynch a representative\nThis is not the type of product that's going to be there's going to be commissions paid\nIt's not the type of product that you're going to want to see loads you're not going to want to see any kind of fees you're not going to have any surrender charges which are very typical for the different brokers companies you know when you move money to these types of products you're going to have to leave it there\nThat's not ... those are not to situations that I Want you to look out for us it has to be a situation that you can move back and forth freely\nAnd that's going to generally mean I Know loaded situation like you are seeing a mutual fund or know loaded mutual fund um when you can move back and forth is generally not going to have a representative logged\nUm it's going to have to be the only advisory if there is a representative involved this is going to be absolutely something that you deal with them or do it excuse me do it directly what the companies\nBut it's extremely important for you to understand that because over the years I heard an awful lot of insurance guns and brokers are talking about this and talking about moving this moving money away from including assets to a exploited assets and it's a good idea\nThe problem is they do it with the companies\nThere's usually a big commissioned involved there surrender charges involved\nAnd backfires and it has to have these characteristics for you to look at the end is it just does not make any sense otherwise unless they have these characteristics you know one thing that could change is the rules could change\nYou know if you didn't move your assets to an annuity or an insurance um catch my new insurance they may change the rules and you may just want to turn around and um because of that is not really knowing vantage you may want to turn around and move it back\nYou need to be able to do that without any kind of distant manage and the disadvantage is gonna be fees loads charges for moving it\nSo it has to have those characteristics or it's just not it's just a terrible idea and that and then again it's going to include about Ninety nine percent\nOf the company excluded excuse me it's going to exclude about Ninety nine percent of the companies that are out there\nAre so be careful on that if you have further questions feel free to call me at the office you know I'll be happy to answer anything that you have but that's pretty much wraps up this discussion of college ways that you can you can decrease your cost for college it just in a quick summary\nIs the Birmingham police department still going to be taking the lead on these activities or or is that going to be passed over to these other authorities and if so then what does that mean for the civil rights of the citizens here\nIn the city of Birmingham in ah many people don't don't really feel like is necessary to kind of wait and see how it plays out because a lot of these these strategies and tactics have already been tried right these\nAre things that happened in the in the late nineties early nineties and and the eighties as well um you know that really led to mass incarceration and so it's not really something that um that we have to wait and take a wait and see approach because it's something that we've already seen before it's just a different iteration of that\nAnd so we want to continue to have that conversation about\nYou know what if somebody alternatives would've some of the things that we'd like to see our ministry ... uh do instead of a of engaging in some of these um many will call neo liberal policies where's the more radical types of things that we can do uh to began to move forward\nAnd so we're going to have a two gas coming into the studio here uh that are going to join us and we're going to continue this conversation I'm\n... and [noise] they're getting set up now how do you guys doing today good good good\nSo I joined us in Studio now we have air call and I'm Mark ... says files a to a ... he's fine\n[laughter] I I'm so that\nKnow both of you all are are are natives of France city both have done quite a bit of work in a city of Birmingham around are issues that are relevant to the black community in general a but in particular around criminal justice reform and policing and\nUm you know really have been a constant voice about [noise]\nUh but in particular around criminal justice reform and policing\nAnd um you know really have\nBeen a constant voice about what I Would say taking advantage of the demographics of the city to really be more progressive and more radical implement policies that give us an opportunity to break away\nFrom some of the old traditions some of the systemic issues that we've seen 'em about how just being poor is being criminalize on so many different levels and even recently you both uh you you had a Facebook Live event in which a watch earlier today and um you know\nAt its core you were speaking about how to build political power um\nWell we can do um as a bloc voting block to begin to uh have some power within the electoral process\nAnd maybe more importantly you you know what is what does it mean to hold out like a local elected officials accountable but before we really get into that I like to give each one of your opportunity to take two or three minutes and just tell us who you are and um and then after that we'll we'll we'll take a break and then when we come back we'll we'll jump back into the substance a policy debate there\nBut who would like to go first\nGo let me first say thank you attorney rice for inviting me to be on the show sir I'm but to your listening audience my name is Eric call on as far as\nWho I Am I'm I've always liked to identify myself as a serving people um I Do believe in a servant leadership and putting people first\nBut as far as titles er [noise] as far as my titles I Am the name of the president for the central Pratt neighborhood association um which is one of the Ninety nine communities that make up the city of Birmingham addition to that I'm also a co founder for black lives matter\nI'm also a co founder of our revolution the Birmingham chapter and also most recently I was elected to be a fellow for young people for a which is a national organization that that is making a difference\nIn electoral politics across the nation\nOkay that's good and you also have a military background as well you also for several years\nYeah I Do I Am a veteran I was right yeah [noise]\nWell ... thank you for joining us on the show and for all the contributions you you made and\nYou know I'm really\nLooking forward to the conversation we're going to have the day and looking forward to some of the things that we're going to be able to do collectively or to move the city of Fort Worth and it's going to how you doing today\n\nAnd I've been doing a lot of work in the city for the last couple of years\nTeach\nAfrican Americans and the\nI'm also a doctoral student finishing my um she and I've been in Birmingham Ala\nWorking for someone that those issues that you spoke to earlier and I really truly believe I'm In my line of work so I think that's\nRight well great great well um I just want to say a couple of things one is that like I said you both from ... city or you work together or what's the least of which who I should have had on the show as well though but I the reason why I just nobody you do is because of the reason Facebook Live that you did and then after I watched it I saw that she was a part of it as well\nBut um you know we're gonna gonna definitely make up for that [laughter] but um you know I think it's important to each one of your friendly community work within the community but there's this idea traditionally that those who are committed to movement work or who are willing to engage and radical policy you have someone being rejected by mainstream\nSystem or but both of you kind of you know ... ... that doesn't fit you write you know you're very accomplished in your own ways and so you had the abyss\nRejected by mainstream system or but both of you kind of you know ... that doesn't fit you write you know you're very accomplished in your own ways and so you had the ability to do kind of a you could pass if you wanted to write you could go you can make it with the mainstream but you still choose to\nYou know um to to be committed to this type of work so I think that you know that's something that's commendable I really believe that it's kind of a new trend is the more that we see examples like your cells in the community and in other individuals other young professionals or whatnot will be able to see that they can\nThey can do well and do good they can have integrity or to the movement but then also you have success at the same time so I Want to continue that conversation\nAnd they'll give you all a little bit of time to talk about some of the points that you made on your Facebook Live reason station earlier this week but we're going to take a quick break this is results with rich arise and we'll be right back with our guest at the moment\n[noise]\n\nAnd [noise]\nThey don't
