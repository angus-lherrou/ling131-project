twelve o'clock I usually don't listen to the radio at work but when you and the guard and hanging out I Would sit there and gotten a little above speaker on my dad and I would listen to the Fort bachelor because for me it was three hours of hanging out with the guys on the job that\nI mean there were pretty sure the God [laughter] oh\nIt was on a it was hanging out it was it whatever came up to them on and it was a break from the press in politics or whatever's happening up the day and it was three hours of just enjoying life and talked about the good things that was going on and when I think it was a critic who loves to go back\nTo school oh is that is that\nRight when he went to school it broke my heart because I felt like it was coming to an end and then I don't know what happened to the other guy he just disappeared and it was just you enjoy it\nYeah [noise] and ah you'd be kind of broke the band of I tell you what though it was a big day but I Know you didn't think it was as funny as as Derrick and I did but you want to talk about radio that was on hand push the envelope made you laugh made you uncomfortable\nThat was radio that changed the way that I looked at like my my daily routine you know what I mean that was radio that made me think differently and made me just laugh you know like made me let go ... and and being a part of that\nWas so different than any other broadcast or anything else that I've ever done it taught me like how to have fun and anything I'm doing\nAnd it was great and on top of that like your podcast I honestly say that did not like you're\nHow old I have fun and anything I'm doing and it was great and on top of that like your partner I did not like you're part that there was only like a great at it or yes it was I wanted three hours [laughter] so I Want to [laughter] the greatest of keep it up I\nDon't do any work does your talk shows what to look forward to and are now the big days which for a little while to get a little bit gave out on top of it I'm excited\nFor sure well Derrick thanks so much for the kind words but it means a lot\nSeriously talk to somebody\nLike ... I'm just I'm telling you this because I've been doing this show for a little more than a year we've had so much fun we have so many up and downs and uh I just you know yellow camera's always been a has always been great to me but you just you never know what what can happen and obviously I'm trying to grow my my media brand as well but like\nWe have so much fun on here now that's doing a little bit of reminiscent big day and we had a lot going on the show yesterday they got a lot of coverage and I also wanted to say thank you for being a part of always ...\nOh yeah the food segment when it goes that's when I came to me like the top ten foods in the candy remember oh you are kind of sewer about the candy land the nickels the sonic milk shake pickle or the sonics slush she pickle\nYeah that was funny video\nThat gave it a tin tin [laughter] and that gave it to zero I Love\nI I mean I thought it was like six seconds I Can't really remember I had to go back and watch the video it wasn't an overwhelming pickle taste though let's go to Jason Jason what's our brother was men\nWell uh since we seem to be on the subject you're talking about the old show versus the new I just want to say I really watch the new show a million times better than the ... let me just rephrase it I didn't like the old joke but\nIt was one part from the old show that I'd like to bring back and that you guys used to do some pretty funny political ads for yourself yes and those\nAlways cracked me up and they did one first got base and you know I guess Andrew Jessica ... wanted to get it from him out of his little clips and he may that was pretty good stuff and the ones that you had were also pretty good\nIf you let it go down there that was pretty funny Jason you know what we got midterms coming back maybe we need some\nWrite it down to ... have always had and they got the first political ad in the email today did we really that is fixed and they have to be putting in Iowa I'm not a good cuts on this F. new Jason your your wishes my commands or [laughter] I have a good argument ... James we've got about thirty seconds of the body\nA man I was just going to disagree with uh the guy saying we'll show it was great I probably didn't speak to your main audience but it didn't point\nTo the audience that could possibly be the next generation has you know young\nAnd so like I I went to school for PR and broadcasting was just something that fell on my lap because I got forced to go work with Baba and Rick and I realized I loved I loved that mentality I loved that lifestyle love talking on the radio love getting up early though did you\nKnow I didn't but if I had a choice to do a morning show or a mid they tried to a morning show every single time was I I Love the midday but I Love the way you wake up in the morning and not everybody has a lot of energy but I had a lot of energy in the morning\nYou know and so I feel like I could really express that but ah I Love my midday show because I get to you know sleep until seven seven thirty and I'm done by five six o'clock you know\nSo like the sleeping that late early ... early morning show you're up you're at the station by about four thirty five o'clock but like you never look at news stories the morning of you do all your research the night before sleep on it come back and talk about you never really unless like you could do a little breaking news or something like that\nYou're you're like four AM to seven o'clock news is really just all stuff from the day before\nYou know what I mean and now unless you're like in western like times like Kelly or something like that there's a lot of news that's broken the east coast\nOh you know or um or like central we have a little bit of play leeway with that but\nI was doing college sports radio and I did it just like I Do my show now and I was actually game and gaining a little bit of speed just from\nYou know like my friends telling their friends and their friends and like you know gain a little bit of speed and then I came here and to have this big of a signal in this many listeners as many fans it was like life change you know what I mean it was just it's different it's it's totally different now than it was them but it's just something where you have to work your tail off\nThe fans it was like life change you know what I mean it was just it's different it's it's totally different now than it was them but it's just something where you have to work your tail off\nEvery single day and work another job to even have a chance and radio oh yeah oh yeah you know and like you know big or you've been around forever but they need to be a young guy and to be in this kind of\nPosition and to be in this kind of like role you know what I mean like a crucial role it just it's different and like I was brought up um I Lived in Hoover you know what I mean like I had a great like life I had a sophisticated lives there\nUm but I was brought up because my dad for Twenty years worked nights\nYou know what I mean I was able to live that kind of lifestyle because my my mom went in every day to a classroom she didn't want to be at worked her tail off my dad went to a a a company everyday worked his tail offer nights and then finally got you know better jobs and stuff and I always worked in the house\nWith my dad always worked on my car's myself I'm taking a car to the shop and then I don't know when I worked in the yard or you know they worked with my hands it's always been something really important and valuable to me and I just you know like when you say you're from Hoover of a savior amount but you know like one of those are kind of kind of places you know they they think about your shirt tucked in\nYou know and uh and feet up kind of thing it's like one of those things and I I've always been a guy who's you know just ready to work ready to grind like let's go do anything that I can and so you know being on the like the radio this past year it's just been totally different and it's been awesome you know what I mean and like I'm looking forward to continuing\nUm to to just come here bringing the news do everything that I Can't but I feel like a lot of people don't know a lot of my back story\nYou know you know ... is crazy because I told you I I did not go to school for this yeah you know I'm a background was before I came here no other I have an associate's degree in building construction do you really yeah they used to build houses\n'cause that's what a Andrews talking to his background a little bit in a construction as well radio is one of those great things that you don't have to necessarily have a background in radio to do it like look at ... ... jobs is one of the biggest radio host in America these massive is following mass everything\nAnd look at what he has done you know he\nWas he a lawyer and then he came into this bill you started writing um like a sports blog and then he went to ah to make his own company out kicked the coverage and then he went into that so radio is one of those things like big Dave you know you're a former construction guy you get life\nYou know what I mean like you get working with your hands you get hard work laws also truck driver you don't take a lot of people are like you don't you don't take a lot of crap from people stuff like that because you work those hard jobs the keyboard those are positions and like yesterday big Dave and went home and you know what it reminded me of\nBecause I've worked all weekend I got in like three am and I came here work my tail off during the show worked my tail of after the show editing stop putting stuff out and it reminded me of those college radio ...\nOh yeah you know I ended up all night staying up all night time and for test yeah yeah I uh just got Cynthia is a\nSamantha send it to me a breaking nine one one what's up officials in Texas to people have been rushed to the hospital after us of suspicious these are for me to say package was sent to a Senator Ted Cruz is off has had ... has met his own saying\nOh my kid or look what we keep it up with this\nI just got an update from uh from Fox talking about the two packages with ah with rice and but I haven't uh\nWe keep it up with this I just got

under quarantine actors the suspicious rice and was found them\nTo ... you can't talk about what rice in is for just a for just one second I think right before we started they gave us had what what really is rice and you know what I mean you're like yeah it's from a plant and I'm thinking oh my goodness like but I but I still don't know what I just know it's toxic right you know what I mean like I just know it's toxic um but it's produced\nIn the seeds of the uh castor oil plant\nRight it's a highly toxic protein oh my\nGosh this potent toxin a dose of purified rice and powder the size of the few grains of table salt can kill an adult human\nThe median lethal dose of rice and it was around twenty two ... micrograms per kilogram of body weight and exposure from um injections so if you're like a six foot tall two hundred pound guy like think about\nPutting one dash of salt on your mashed potatoes that's going to kill you\nInsane home ... probably less than that actually oral exposure to rice and thus far less toxic as some of the ah poison and I'm In activated in the stomach oh my gosh\nI mean it raised calls risk story or destroy us can you tell read offer of a complete ...\nCalls nostalgia oh sorry missing chest heavy sweating wow fluid\nBuildup and loans so we're talking about this because two pieces of mail were deliver to the Pentagon or or the Pentagon mail facility like you said like it's that off site or have you ever been to the Pentagon big Dave uh no I haven't I've been to Washington a few times but never the Pentagon I would've gone I guess it was\nHow was when I was younger it was when I was in school like middle school high school and we were the Pentagon we saw where uh nine eleven memorial was I don't even think we like went in it or anything like that but we we went there and it's\nJust kind of a a place you see how massive it is you know what I mean I get is a huge place it is massive and so uh I mean this is this is where I
