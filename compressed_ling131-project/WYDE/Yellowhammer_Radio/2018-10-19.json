[laughter]\nSo here we are Russell's waiting on a computer\nTo get a you know up in a runner and uh for me to\nCalm down well it's a while that's happening again I'd take a moment to tell you that I I Want to set your mind at ease a little bit and I did this with Michael heart a little bit\nEarlier today um you know all the the complaining people have had about the new space movie about Neil Armstrong first man the one with Ryan Gosling the Canadian [laughter] I don't believe in America and I don't remember where it began but\nThere is concern that it wasn't nearly patriotic enough that in some way it downplayed American commitment to beating the Russians to the moon\nRight yeah yeah I'm here to tell you that's fake news really saw the movie last night and it's a driving factor in the movie\nThat we've got to beat the Russians their weapon or tails and the space race for the first into space for the first to orbit the earth\nIn the movie that we've got to beat the Russians their weapon or tails and the space race of the first into space for the first to orbit the earth this that and the other we've got to beat the Russians and we're going to do it by being the first one to the moon that is the dialogue\nSo that was heard in the movie\nYeah that layer cut absolutely so the guy from friday night lights I don't know his name but if you saw him on you but another guy yes I Do have these kind of like uh the guy I guess in charge of let's plan out these missions let's figure out what we have to do\nYou've got parts of the JFK speech you were going to do this and we know it's hard but we are going to make it happen right now I'm paraphrasing but um\nYeah it was definitely a space race and we win and it's great there was some concern that there's there's not you don't see them plant the flag but there's a\nThe way they they follow the Neil Armstrong character in the movie Ryan Gosling playing him by the time at the end the movie you finally get there\nWhat you meant by following had one on one superstitious on Twitter or simply go to Facebook dot com and search for super station one on one government while you you\nYou can take us wherever you go through with a super station ... former radio on the Web on your phone rung of what the government at all of us are regular your homes home garden seed superstitions one aunt\nWho left the lights on in the studio\nProbably the folks doing our show on the\nLocal hosts Thirteen hours a day super station one oh one W. I. D. [noise]\n\nYou get\nThem back to the Ford faction Andrea ... sitting in for for round this wonderful friday with Russell the across the way to help me out but first our\nAnd as um as we were coming in off the break I looked up at Fox News they're talking about the ... the murder but someone had someone they put in should shockey [laughter] and I was like well I Hope no one's reading that on air cars that can that can won't go well All right let's go to merge Jason and days on the line and\nLet's have them weigh in on do you have something to say about the first man movie a Murph\nAndrea and the wall um I have not seen the movie I'm not particularly interested in seeing it\nIs that because ... is a Canadian is that it\nNo I don't know I ... I may wait for it to come on TV I don't okay [laughter] but um here's the thing though that the producer of the movie it's some big time left the global as type\nHe's got some French lady working for them then they get a Canadian to play the the hero of the story\nAnd so you have a whole bunch of I'm not going to say anti American folks here but definitely not pro American folks are trying to promote a movie about American exceptionalism\nAnd there's a lot of them do I need money backing it too from what I read\nTime at the movie but what you say that the the movies about American exceptionalism we understand that the landing on the moon was that but that doesn't mean that the movie has to be that specifically I mean it doesn't matter let's not forget they're actors\nThey're paid to pretend to be somewhat I don't need someone to come from the Neil Armstrong bloodline to be qualified to play him it's fine the guy play Superman is also English that he's not from now what I'm saying Russell I like representing what you're saying\nI what I'm saying is that in the promotion of the movie you have people that do not buy into American exceptionalism and and I would\nOf course they do and that's why they live here and work here of course they do they may not say it but they say what their actions yes they do that is why they are here that\nThey're not going to stay with their words now when when they set foot on the moon he said it was a giant leap for mankind and that was certainly the hope in the attention because the book the bullies\nBehind the space race wasn't just American exceptionalism or going into space whole world's gonna be in a spot where do you think Star Trek came\nBehind the space race wasn't just American exceptionalism we're going into space\nWhole world's gonna be unified where do you think Star Trek came\nRight idea that when we get into the space race we're all going to be one big happy peaceful a utopian earth and then we'll be the center point of the galaxy of the universe\nFor all other aliens to come together but let's look at the reality of it is it hasn't happened like that it hasn't United the western world\nIt was a ... point of tried for America\nThat we planted that flag on the moon so regardless of the intention behind it being some world peace effort\nOr you know in a grander scheme of things it hasn't been that it is still a point of American exceptionalism nobody else has ever gone that I Know\nIn the movie it's protected that way in the movie is portrayed as American exceptionalism all I'm saying is when they were making the movie\nThat didn't have to be their only point of storytelling that is woven throughout the movie at no point is it may not to simply be a human accomplishment the dialogue in the movie is we've got to beat the Russians like five times and they keep saying that\nI'm going to assert myself in is a peacemaker here between Russell and murders and just say if you want to see the movie ... based on the plotline eat is pro American yeah I don't want to see the movie based on who's a directing it producing it paying for all that because you don't feel that they're\nBuying into American exceptionalism than exceptionalism then I guess you can with ... hey thanks for for the call appreciate it All right we're going to go over to Jason see what he has to say how are you going to go see first man\n\nOh no it's not it's not a form of protest it's more or less and I just I just really don't\nGo watch a lot of movie yeah but um I hear\nI listen to Russell the talking and saying so many things in a row so I figure the\nI think you're the nicest guy who was a\nCloset liberal I think the biggest hoax ever played on superstation little one is it Russell pay is going to come out of the ...\nWell you know we all even have to have [laughter] you know tearing down to have another opposing opinions so we\nWere not but I did have a Ida I've kind of a funny anecdote about the flag on the moon I used to work in the oil fields and I traveled a lot\nAnd I worked with a lot of uh uh ... nations in different nationalities that during that line of work and one of the things that are caught so much crap about about being from America and how do you guys not use the metric system if they just never it never let up and so I got to the point where would I Would go on these trips\nI Would take things with me to kind of a passive aggressively or women's arguments for instance I bought a shirt that said that about World War champs America\n[laughter]\nWhat are the one of the things that I just got so sick of about the you know what are you what do you what are you guys speaking without using the metric system I used to just say hey whose flag is on the moon\n[laughter] would always just hurt you showed up with a grip [laughter] how do you go to class and now we\nGot there without losing the metric jaded and ... and I don't think I'm a closet liberal but maybe I'm a closet global is because I Do think we should move to the metric system it just makes a lot more about that\nRussell pie uses the metric system I bet your cars set for kilometers\n... Marshall you have to stay the next two hours that you know we we count that way you're going down to ten and then a hundred and ten times and a thousand attempts our brains work that way the fact that we\nDon't use the metric system to me is American arrogance it's a simpler system\nBut it's also not worth that retro activity that would take place too\nAmerican arrogance it say simpler system\nBut it's also not worth the retro activity that would take place to convert over not\nWorried about the rest of the world does this was this was this was absolutely true this is another one racial throwing their trucks and they speak English you can use the metric all you want to but when you buy tires just what you buy those in\nInterest is that right even around the world I didn't know that yes yes another thing a lot not every part of the world but a large part of the world they might use the millimeter socket but they're telling them that sock it with a three inch Dr rhetoric [laughter] go go go straight for taking my\nDays and I appreciate it and you know what I'm okay with is not going to the metric simply because I have a little streak and me that doesn't like to conform when everybody's going that same route and I it's not it doesn't appear all the time but there are certain things and this is a case where people are always\nTrying to persuade you and it makes sense and and even have a little snooty attitude about it and that makes me my me bristle\nAnd I I I haven't lean on the non conformist in okay I don't feel the need to conform but if you were to lay them out which is the simpler one\nOh I agree it makes total sense so why don't I don't know why I don't want to purpose even more difficult route why would I Do because America is coming to the ball game with the ball and they were coming to the ball game with a ball we set the rules and we're not going to metric that we have found that out fairly argue there Dave\n[laughter] gas of a seasonal jobs as was the uh the the head a engineer over the songs for they they were the laws that built the fastest or most stealth aircraft on her\nIn the Nineteen fifties wow you're Seventy years ago that's ...\nYeah and he had a big part in in the space program all these guys you got to remember these guys were were most of them ... through these guys were aircraft all they had the biggest bullets coming at them or war too so that we're tough as nails um there was a a an exercise that\nCame out about ten years ago there was some of the engineers that they fired and and the only real lead up to this\nThe last ... would would lie about stuff that you can't get when you have a totalitarian rule a country like they had\nYeah um and I think that the capitalist now by the way all that it would ah if nobody will work for you know your your dictator man they're trying to get out of work for you and um but that would roll out a shell of an aircraft so this is faster and what you got\nIt wouldn't even have an ... unit right I mean it was authentic and a propaganda\nYeah now there's a way we had projected what was it and I teach a kid I was always the first one was the lander nothing was working a lot and some of the mayor said we're not a lot about this\nBringing her back into the news is you're going to run and twenty twenty is what this guy's salad and it raises my blood pressure just looking at a picture of her but apparently\nHe's just he's saying what so what is the age of saying we don't know that she'll come back and run twenty twenty but it's a shame that nobody's even thinking about\nYes he is he seems a little irritated that no one is mentioning her as a possible oh candidate all he has a girl he saying it's not he doesn't necessarily think she will run but it's not a done deal that she won't run\nAnd they point out that uh you know plenty of other some some of the reasons that she wouldn't run is she's already run she already has um competed twice before in last but so have Joe Biden and a good chance that he's going to run again\nSo simple because she's lost before should not disqualify her according to the ah the eight and then also her\nAge where she is old is she is not as old as Bernie Sanders and she's not as old as Joe Biden's used a year younger than Trump if I remember the story\nYet her record barely and so the thought is hey don't be so quick to dismiss her she did win the popular vote that she did have support two years ago who knows if their support will be there two years from now but a fully I think if the guy says\nPhilippe ... Filippo reign he's saying you know don't rent\nDon't give up on on Hillary just yet so wouldn't that be funny if we get Trump Hillary round two\nOh yeah really you know what again I have to say Philippe Reines along with Elizabeth Warren are completely completely over estimating the situation we've got two weeks to go for um the midterms and you want to throw out the idea of Hillary\nDid you wish and we've got two weeks to go for um the midterms and you want to throw out the idea of Hillary coming back into the scene I don't think any [laughter]\nMore Republicans were riled up an out to the\nPolls to make sure that there is a Republican Congress Senate and house yeah if just to to secure Trump and give him the uh go ahead to continue with his agenda because uh the thought of\nHillary reentering oh my I mean I Know we're two and a half weeks away from the mid term but we're really three weeks away from the next presidential cycle the moment the midterms are over we're going to start hearing from Democrats who are going to run and it's going to be\nA bloodbath trying to win that nomination to be in their minds but Trump killer the Trump's lawyer yeah in twenty twenty\nAnd so I mean we're basically a month away from it all beginning a new\nAnd you may have vitamin you may have burner you may have Hillary you may have\n... Harris and a Cory Booker\nAll that to you know what all that just that just reminds me once again I was going to talk about this after you leave\nHow important it is that we do get out and vote because the only way to to tamp down on these Democrats and their maniacal obsession with power and the fact that they will like you said one week after the election be all claws out all hands on deck um\nThey're going to be motivated because everybody else and the only way to put that down is for them to lose rights are like we need to um I hate to say this this sounds on Christian we need to crush their spirit [laughter]\nDo they need to come up and\nSay New York to be brought down to the lowest level right humbled\nAnd in humbled and defeat because right now they've they keep thinking trumped an anomaly yeah they keep thinking that he's a cork that needs to be corrected and the only way to correct it is for us to us as ... the Democrats to threaten you to that if you don't put him in office\nUm they're going to come they're not going to go way\nSure and I don't think anyone knows exactly how this election is going to play out but we're getting close to and a half weeks ago news additives are still could be another big news story or to between now and then but Democrats they want the house they had hopes on the Senate the likelihood of that is pretty slim I think at this point based on some projections\nBut who knows I guess anything could happen I think\nI think you're right I think that some where the statistics are showing that the Senate is is good because all of a sudden I've noticed in the news all this and they're talking about the house right before it was all about the Senate sure it's like ... what have you just been told\nAll of a sudden you got to shift and pivot and go for the house hey speaking of Hillary and her again or at least for aid tried to throw her name back into the mix apparently the New York times isn't even happy about this so apparently the grey lady is going after the grey lady [laughter]\nThey want her to go away so yup\nApparently the editorial board um has said that the broadly unpopular Hillary Clinton\nMight want to stay out of the crucial midterms because she has the risk of firing up the GOP based see your point yeah yes so they already see that she comes back in she shows or face people get scared\nAnd panicked and concerned you know and they say I Can't let this happen again [laughter]\nSo hey whatever it\nTakes I I mean I I Would hope that people would be voting to continue\nI Can't let this happen again [laughter]\nSo hey whatever it takes I mean I I Would hope that people would be voting to continue that Trump's agenda but if a little fear ways in and get you there faster so be it\nNow what do you make of some on the left will use a Joe Scarborough over a long time was a Republican I guess he had been five now as an independent but he is no fan of Trump he was for a while\nUh but former ... feelings hurt either gotta feeling hers girlfriends and his uh his sweet lady that as well but he he was out he said this on his show on MORNING Joe but he was on Kobe on CBS this week saying that he doesn't think\nThat Trump is going to run for reelection and twenty twenty he thinks he's going to kind of cash in cash out I did my thing I gave you a term I'm Out\nDo you think that's a possibility of Trump not seeking reelection oh no [laughter]\nNo Joe Scarborough is just he wants to remain relevant and somehow so we've got to throw out an oddball theory yeah and see that sticks right just last night Trump all that money in Montana and he's already referring to twenty twenty show a neat talking about what he's going to do and how he's going to you know\nGo back and run for reelection so I don't see\nThat the hat I Want to have or one of the the slogan is make America great again again [laughter] neither have\nI don't know when they're going to switch to this other one keep America great because magma has really caught on and I don't think you can slow it down right I really don't think they're just going to have to keep it up because keg\nThat doesn't want to go to
