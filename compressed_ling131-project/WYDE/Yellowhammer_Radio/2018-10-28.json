Monday pretty bad period of time the dot com bubble comes to ...\nPretty bad various periods of time in my life I started my career right after ... Monday pretty bad period of time the dot com bubble comes to mind pretty bad period period of time but two thousand eight\nReally change things for me it really taught me several lessons related to safety because the bottom line a lot of things that I thought were safe or not so safe\nAnd in particular one of the things that really taught me was a little bit different perspective about Barnes throughout my career I've always been taught that whenever you manage someone's finances manage their investments\nYou find a a mixture of stocks and bonds for them and it typically depends upon their age as far as how much they have in stocks how much they haven't bond says they get older\nAnd they're starting to generate income you need to have a higher compensation of violence\nAnd but once he dies and they told me was the bonds had a lot of risk\nAnd I don't know that any of us really truly understood that um we've always thought of bonds as being a very safe way to cushion\nStock investments with stocks are down you know bonds will cushion those losses they they tend to work in personally that's what I'll always taught but see that as an aid that wasn't the case two thousand eight or we learned a lot of different lessons and the biggest lesson was that ... have a lot of risk\nAnd I just want to set up this discussion about talking a little bit more about that\nUm some people don't quite understand what a bond there so let me just quickly explain the way that I like to describe a bond for my clients\nA bond is basically an aisle you it's an ... between two parties you have one party that are being loaned money and promising to pay that back of the future date\nAnd that would be in the charity day and then you have a second part is receiving interest during the meantime so one party what the receiving a lump sum of money and they ... they would promise to repay that money or the future date and they would pay interest along the way\nNow we've always known that the risk associated with the bond is the risk that the entity will default the entity that the the rest of the entity will not be able to honor its obligation so if that person is borrowing the money with the promise to pay back at a future date\nThe risk becomes whether they be able to if you're looking in a corporate law and you're you're asking the question was that company sound you know will it will be in business and a future date will be in business in ten years or Twenty years I'm probably the most shocking thing for me\nWas what happened in two thousand eight with ... ponds throughout my career we've always thought of municipal bonds as being very safe\nMissile vines are all use that are issued by local governments typically to build bridges improve roads sometimes for special projects are schools\nBut they're basically a way that the county government will will re a municipal government will raise revenue for these different projects so\nWe've always thought of that as being a very safe thing because the municipal government it's very likely to honor its obligations because they can raise tax revenues as\nWell as it turns out or we live and the largest bankruptcy\nAnd it's because they can raise tax revenues as well as it turns out uh we live and the largest bankruptcy in history for him in a small government Jefferson County\nIs the largest municipal bankruptcy in history [noise]\nIn fact I just saw um a Fox News article ... uh last week um I'm Talking about the different ... account and governments municipal governments across the country and there's a lot of them even today even on the economy as a lot better that are really suffering that are an awful lot of debt\nIt's very likely that they could default on their dad obligations and you know that was a big surprise for a lot of people I Know people\nUh fortunately they weren't my clients but I don't want people that purchase things like vision land bonds you know Beijing land was the amusement park that the city of Birmingham wanted to build well it's no longer those it invested in that lost a lot of money\nSo municipal bonds have always been solved a throughout my career is is not really having a lot of risk two thousand eight taught us that they really do have lots of risk\nPretty amazing when you consider that we've been through wars and a depression and so forth and they still made their death and you know\nSo a lot of people purchase these types of stocks or mutual funds to provide that income\nAnd the debonair and it's viewed that even in from the start the from these companies and the stocks are viewed as being almost guaranteed\nBecause of the historical evidence that they're always there however I Would not call that a safe investment because because while the debonair and might be just about guaranteed and you can count on that count on it like it is guarantee the principals not\nWe all know that you can lose a considerable amount of money even in these household names all stocks will lose money in two thousand eight and ... with the kind of companies that I'm Talking about last thirty percent [noise] now I'm not again I'm not saying that that's an inappropriate way to provide income\nYou know a lot of people are very comfortable with that they're comfortable with the principal fluctuations\nAnd and like the dividends associated with that I actually think that they're very good way to provide income but for purposes of this discussion I'm saying safe means guaranteed principle safe means a very\nIt's very unlikely that she would lose principle\n[noise] so I just wanted to point that out because I Want to clarify what my definition is of safety um because it will guide the discussion for the rest of the time that we have today\nNow the first thing that I Would do with the client as far as income\nIs going back to the Social Security discussions um that we've had in previous weeks is make sure that you are that incline is maximizing their guaranteed income make sure that decline as maximizing whatever resources they have available to them which is generally going to be Social Security enemy pension\nMost people don't have pensions that are being phased out of Social Security is really the only source of lifetime income someone has of guaranteed income uh but I Do want to talk about pension is a little bit and just a second but the first step I think before you really get into individual\nUh investments in ways to provide income is to make sure\nThat what you could receive their Social Security or pensions if you have one available that you are maximizing what's available to you\nSo that's the reason why we spent so much time talking about Social Security because it is the largest income source that most people have most people don't have pensions so it really is the only lifetime source of income that people have an ... an income source that you cannot outlive\nAnd then some income source that never runs out [noise]\nBut let's talk very quickly about pensions because some of you may have pensions\nAnd there's a couple of things that you need to do with respect to that before receiving those pensions so we don't want to talk about a little bit just very quickly is how to maximize those pension payments\nAnd most of the euro aware that there's several different choices associated with the pension you can receive a pension or several different ways you can see that on your life you might receive it with survivorship options so it might be on your life but if something were to\nSeveral different ways you can see that on your life you might receive it with survivorship options so it might be on your life but if something were to happen to you would continue for spouse for example\nAnd you might be able to choose the amount that would continue for your spouse you might want all of it to continue some of the ... continue half of it something like that so there's there's a basic choices between pinching on your life in the pension on survivor's\nPensions for survivors and most of you that if elected this before are aware that then the amounts are different [noise] so the more survivorship options that are they're\nGenerally the lower the pension amount so the highest amount of pension that you're going to receive would be based on your life if you have a survivorship option that continues that payment\nFor your spouse it's going to be lower\nSo the planning that I Want people to look at is is what is the difference between the two and let me just give you a quick example or to kinda illustrate this and so forth um suppose that you have a pension payment on your life only for four thousand a month\nSo as long as you're alive and you can receive four thousand dollars\nBut when you pass away that goes away or you have a choice between a pension that's based on your life but a hundred percent of that is going to go to your survivor to your spouse typically and for that you're going to only receive three thousand dollars a month\nSo you could receive four thousand dollars on your on your life\nOr you could receive three thousand dollars on your life with the three thousand dollars continuing for a spouse [noise] so the planning that involves maximizing your pension payments involves asking the question about what is the difference what is the cost difference between the two\nIn this example uh what is the difference between the four thousand and three thousand dollars\nSo one is a thousand dollars lower what is that what are you paying for putting out well what you're actually paying for his life insurance so you're actually buying life insurance through your pension plan that's really what you're doing\nSo the planning that I Want people to look at is what else could they do with the money what else could they do with that thousand dollars couldn't they go out and could they purchase life insurance for less than a thousand dollars that would continue that income for a spouse so then I can take the higher amount and pocket the difference\nSo one of the training things that we live for folks to do is to look at taking the pension on their life only in this case it would be four thousand\nAnd taking that thousand dollar difference and seeing if they can purchase some insurance to continue that income for their survivor\nAnd if they would be able to do that for less than what the difference and you will find some of the times with certain employers that you could do that\nOr did it in a lot of it comes down to your health and and what's out there but ... a lotta times when I look at this with clients I Will find that it's very favorable the pension options are very favorable for the survivor or they're not very favorable\nAnd so I Would encourage folks a lot of times to take the survivorship options\nAnd that generally is when the cost is not dramatically different but a lot of times that the employers that it is dramatically different and it is it better vantage for them to take that money and go on their own shop some insurance on something that will protect us\nAnd it is it better in manage for them to take that money and go on their own shop some insurance on something that will protect their spouse\nAnd I'm suggesting to you this is just the planning technique that we want to look at to maximize your pension before receiving pensions so before you fill out your paperwork to receive your pitch and\nThis is something that you need to do when most people do is they automatically chooses survivorship options for their spouse\nOr that isn't necessarily the best option not elected this along through the years I've seen some lawyers that um that was the best option and I've seen a lot of them than it was not obviously one of the factors involved is whether or not someone is how well they're not they could obtain life insurance whether they could pass the medical\nSo that does have a bearing on as well but I just want to point out the claiming because I Want everybody to look at a before making 'em all decision\nAnd I just want them to understand what they're really doing with these costs differences and buying insurance through their pension plan and how they might be able to do better on their on\nThere's a number of insurance policies out there and that you um it's a very competitive world uh insurance there's a number of different situations are a lot of people and go out\nAnd actually better their situation by doing that\nI'm so that is just the first yeah I like to always go through the clients as far as I'm providing income for the Amish make sure that the guaranteed sources of income that we maximize those amounts that were taken full advantage of Social Security\nSong strategies associating with us the security but they're not one of the casualties\nAssociated with a ... percent not receiving their full benefits are but also want to look at how they can maximize their pension is well\nNow beyond now what else can we do\nAnd this is where I'm just going to have to wrap up and we'll have to cover this next week but the on Social Security and pensions what else can you do what else can you do on Iran or are there are other ways you can find guaranteed income from your savings to fit the criteria of liquid\nA guaranteed right of return you know it's not going to have a higher rate of return on\nA because it is guarantee but what else can we do and will have to pick that discussion up next week and look at those different options as the civic things to suggest to you beyond that and we'll look forward to talking to you\n\n\nOr or mending the Alabama constitution but we also need to consider rewriting an amending the mayor ...\nOr so that that's how this is kind of all tied in it may sound convoluted but it's real simple uh if you understand the intent of how the constitution was the end all be all in the state of Alabama and it supports the mayor ... we need to just rewrite everything\nRight yeah it is it is simple you're right I think it is and um you know it's one of those things which\nUm if you're in a position of power he ran a position of power that time your goal was to continue to concentrate that power for in the hands of the few\nYou know and particularly um you know based on on race in in in in your wealth that you had or land ownership and things of that nature\nAnd today like you said Americans Elect is attached to that\nWith the uh with the constitution specifically limits the ability of local communities that have what's called home rule right many of the most mundane everyday decisions that we make on a local basis we can't really make them\nA unilaterally without the authority of the blessing of of our elected officials in Montgomery um in in that law applies more heavily to larger municipalities right and we've seen uh just over the\nHistory of this country is that uh people of color often um congregate more in an urban areas right right so that that's one way by by taking away that the home rule then you you served the Democratic process right on the local level\nAnd so that's something that we we really should think about it when you look at these four minutes each one of them is kind of symbolic in a way it's kind of um a wink and a nod to the base right [laughter]\nReally should think about it when you look at these four minutes each one of them is kind of symbolic in a way it's kind of um a wink and a nod to the base right [laughter] you know you know we don't know like we understand that these amendments probably are not constitutional however\nWe're still going to put them on the ballot anyway because I Know we're with you right you know way and we want you to come out to the polls\nAnd we we support you you know and so in that kind of the general flavor\nEach one is different in a more specific than that it just to summarize the little\n... in listening to you kind of reminds me a ... which is what they're really saying is a\nIn Birmingham and Jefferson County we can vote whether or not to have a monument of the ten commandments ah in Montgomery a but we can't as citizens in Birmingham vote to increase the minimum wage right I don't know I mean\nThat doesn't make sense I mean it doesn't make a logical sense but this is what they put in front of you because on an understanding that you know most time you we won't take the time to read it as engaged citizens we just going to vote for who we want to vote for and ignore the amendments and so those people who are with that base\nUh with that particular party who would concern is directly they're going to they're going to vote in his normally he's going to get approved a and and move for sale that those are the type of things that we need to be discussing and and moving forward all with a more progressive approach\nRight most definitely and um it looks like we have a caller on the line and let's see if I can put this caller on the air go ahead call you're on the air how you doing today\nI'm doing well in all shapes the show and earlier your guest it said that all talking about the constitution the state constitution and the federal faster and I just like to know\nWhere neither one of the state constitution or the federal constitution that separation of church and state and all I'm hanging up listening to your response\nOkay I'm I'm not sure that I actually fully understand the question that was presented but\nUm I ... you said ... separation of church and state talking about the ten commandments and and I understand of St Louis filing a dead horse and I'm not for putting\nThem back and Roy Moore in that kind of thing but\nYou cite the constitution and then he said there needs to be separation of church and like you have just salt now whereas I stated in either the federal constitution or the state of Alabama not seeing a warning state constitution of a separate\nChurch and state I don't believe it's in the constitutional not be wrong but I don't believe that word separation of church and state that phrases in either of those documents thank\nAlright thanks where you go All right so let me just generally our response to the caller and then I'll give our guest an opportunity we we got to get into a break too but I mean if you understand like the er the origin of the birth of the nation and you understand that\nThose individuals were fleeing from a state that was really control um by by uh by priest in by you know religious leaders in such a way that individuals were being persecuted a lotta times based on their religious beliefs and so\nYou know here would within the United states the conscience constitution itself is set up in a way to allow individuals to have freedom of choice to choose their religion\nAnd that shouldn't take away from their ability to participate in a democracy so I think on a general sense that's that's a fundamental a component I have a law student here too is probably an expert on constitutional law already\nIn her first semester no so you're saying but I don't believe in but I go ahead and Mr ... what is your response and then I'm going to jump into a\nLet me first by make clarify for a second I didn't say that it was stated in\nBut I go ahead and Mr ... what is your response and they're all going to jump into a ... let me first by me clarify for a second I didn't say that it was stated in the constitution\nOr when I'm stating is a there is a separation of church and state\nAnd so whether it's written or whether it's in for there is a separation of church and state one of the issues that we're dealing with in Birmingham right now a is a situation where you have right now he still is still not permissible for her the law\nTo pray in school\nBut yet you have various churches certain churches that are paying make going into contracts in Birmingham City school Birmingham City school officials in principles ought to actually have half the whole church service on public school campuses\nAnd so that could be viewed as a way of uh of getting around uh the law being able to pray in school but that that separation of church and state in there and so\nThe issue of having a monument of the ten commandments or in a state building on public a property is always going to be an issue is and the reason that is issues because there was a separation of church and state and so\nThat's what I'm alluding to I'm I'm not concerned with where where it is written a I'm alluding to the fact that it actually is a it exist and there is a separation of church and state and we need to keep them separate as much as possible humanly possible practically possible uh that's the perspective I'm coming\nFrom right and that's understandable and I mean in the last little point on I don't notice that you know we don't want to identify as a Christian state or Muslim state or any one religion over the other it's you know competition a marketing of ideas and\nAs such you know each each religion should have equal opportunity in this quote marketplace or within a democracy um and so if you're faced guys you in terms of making the decisions I mean that that's probably admirable if that works for you\nBut at the same time it's not something in which just because the majority of people believe in one religion that that that religious belief should take primacy or a superiority over another I think there's another valid point but we're going to head into a break we want you to come right back this was Richard Rice on results with Richard Rice and we'll be right back with Shawn tell you well Susan ...
