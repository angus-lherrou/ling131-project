increased ranging coming up from the south\nWith temperatures in the low eighties and in the rain really starts to pick up by Wednesday night and our southern counties a front moves in by Thursday that's going to clear out all that rain from Michael also cool is down\nWe're talking fifties in the mornings and seventies in the afternoon for the weekend from WB GM Thirteen News I'm meteorologist harmony Mendoza with your forecast on this Crawford Broadcasting station [noise]\nUnder the profanity\nVersion one [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nWhy from Birmingham, Alabama [noise] from those super station on on studio\nYellow hammer radio present Ford factions [noise]\nWell\nWelcome into the Ford faction live on a\nTuesday and we're not going to waste any time it all her Cambridge over there on the on the board\nHelped me out I'm for brown I began usually these next three hours but touting a super speedway German grant Lynch has decided to come in right at the most of the show punches right in the mouth chairman Lynch what is a wall command has been a while since we talk but you're still looking good about six\nMonths ago yeah somewhere here and there were pretty much six months apart or two races\nIt's a nice schedule you know means every six months we have to go to work for a few days and then we just take the five and a half months off and then the second race was always a it's in the playoffs right now we're in the playoffs and uh we're not the elimination race anymore and I think it\nWas just to a nerve nerve wracking for some folks\nAnd so they decided to move is off of the final playoff rice and the deciding one who gets to go forward and but as my daughter actually says it doesn't matter where you are if you're in the playoffs you are the elimination ... so that's the way I look at\nWell I think the NASCAR playoffs are pretty cool and it's it's really fun to watch and eliminate a an elimination race and so maybe they they give it to another track that doesn't have the kind of\nHistory or legacy light Talladega like you can run Talladega in the middle of the winter and it's going to drop some crowds and my eyes a and everything and so we got a schedule planned out for this weekend and I think everybody's watching what does a hurricane Michael\nMhm yeah but if it's going to be going over towards Appalachia cola and Panama City and then going on up through Georgia our forecast for the weekend is fantastic right now we're talking\n... hot forties low fifties in the evenings but campfires will be going and seventies in the in the daytime we don't have that Ninety degree stuff we've been dealing with for two months now\nAnd so I think it's one of the best weekends of the year\nFor the series just because it's going to cool off and we've got all that unlimited free camping at Talladega all you need to do is buy a ticket for Sunday they throw in a camp for free\nWe've had the ads running for I guess a a month or two now ... and if you buy a ticket

the ... are getting their one of the ... getting\nThere and they're supposed to come in friday ... there'll be low nose in and and what we can observe that to our Web to dinner there'll be coming in you know there'll be coming in so we've got some folks will be down there\nIt's always fun to watch the hollers come in 'cause it's just another aspect of everything that goes into watching these cars and rent and they're they're beautiful and they're big and they're colorful and everything and got the wraps on them\nGolf and and then once they get in there was all set you know then that afternoon they'll qualify for the truck rice and then the next day at noon we're going to bust them most of them out there and run\nAnd so friday night seven o'clock you got the big one in the boulevard and I gather never been to okay that I Want to know how big it is on the boulevard it's\nBig and made it is so much fun I mean it when we first started it we just get out there and we we we take up all these things to do and I say this all the time they go better than I say they go\nBut they're truly they truly lose control of it pretty quick I must be about ... what do you plan up what what are you going to lose control over this year we've got a we always have\nFor competitions ... the cool thing about this thing is that it started in two thousand fourteen and it was really the brainchild of Clint boy or\nA Clinton came to me and so many ... and Clint Clint one of our our seasoned veterans and Clinton and have a good time and he loves coming in today he's won a couple of races here but he also just loves being around the fans and\nHe said you know let's let's try to put something together for the fans and this is what we came up we actually grant and I met with him and darling and we did at the year before in the in the fall of two thousand Thirteen\nAnd so we came up with this idea between uh our staff at the racetrack and put something together ran it by hand we had for drivers that first time a Kevin ... Boyer ah richton house in Austin deal\nThis past spring we had a teen drivers were personality oh it's really really cool you know you put the drivers up on the stage it's a role in stage with music lights the guys were up there throwing out swag doll the fans are we have a bartender there for all the the drivers and also how sick and enjoy themselves and\nThen we come to a stop and then we have fan competitions that the drivers actually we had the microphones and they sort of call the action and we have we have eating contest we have a um this time we're going to have a good great hungry hip opposes is a a reader\nRabbit and got hit by the yeah the Rhine giant ... ... yeah\nUm we got me so hungry that's going to be an eating [laughter] ah the the the rubber pull a sort of a tug of war type thing and then we've got a\nUm [noise] the the girl deluxe wash so we've we've got all their car all the luck swat yeah we go beyond them really cool things are but it's all for the fans is all in fun\nAre all girls could go away that I'm not ... it's all\nFun and and the folks who were there and just really have a ...\nIt's all for the fans us all in fun are all girls could go away that I'm not saying it's all clean fun and\nAnd the folks who are there and just really have a nice time with the drivers get into it um we give out prizes for all the different when or if you bring them up on stage and they had their pictures taken with a drivers\nUm but I'll tell you that I've never seen the drivers we actually have drivers now that will call call attract and I want to talk to me about can they be a part of it yeah I'm bubble Wallace is not supposed to be here early on friday but he costs I Want to do it again\nBut would get down in the in the middle of the crowd last I write in the middle of the competitions with a with a microphone\nAnd he called the he he was caught it right in the middle of all that's hilarious but um but that's what I'm saying I Love to see the driver yeah\nThey they showed that list and these are blue collar guys they they love being a part of Talladega they've they love what we're doing here and it's all about the fans and they'd been extremely great with their time to come and be a part of this you know and and we're looking forward to like I say\nClinton has been to the ringleader you know for many many years and we've we've you know\nWe've lost ... often been ... been a lot on\nRicky stand house does it every year ... Larson Ryan blaming the list goes on and all the folks who have who have done it and wanting to continue to I got a phone call yesterday from Korea the joy he wants to do [laughter] I'm Jeffrey Earnhardt always does you know Jeffrey didn't even compete in the spring\nAnd he was obviously this is what I'm comments he said that it cannot be on the big one a little hard said absolutely will put you on the flu and they did it\nYou know because he just he loves it and he loves doing things for ...\nFor your heart is not what NASCAR knees I I don't know what it is I think I just\nReally wish I mean I think we can fit in a boy and a real car sometime I'm really good when I'd like to see\nWhat I mean a lot of that you can say that about so many\nDrive yeah you know I mean you look at that field you got the best drivers in the world out there it's just about what kind of technology can we put me and now it's technology you know what I mean is it is it is all about these advances how these cars have become and computers I it's incredible but I I feel like at the end of the day\nIt's still how much can we ... up how much gas can we go and how fast can we go now I Love Talladega 'cause you got to restrict or played on it that leaves the field open to a lot more drivers\nWhether they're switching to type in space or which is just another type of cutting down on the amount of oxygen you get into next year they'll go to that next year\nWhere they'll go away from currently Talladega they run a plate and type ... correct that's correct and next year they'll just run a type of space or was the end it's going to say well we're going to get more horsepower we don't get about a hundred and fifty more horse because that's what you on the on the ... and well but they're they're gonna put a giant border on the back and what they're trying to do\nIs make the cars so that you can come up on somebody and then pass in with the extra horse power so that's what they're going to try to do really but we've had in my career there and we probably had\nThirty different combination of of aerodynamics versus engine in openings and stricter plates and everything so this is just another way to look at that and and amazingly throughout at all Russell wasn't and I were talking about this coming over here\nWe average right at Thirteen thousand four hundred\nPosition changes uh a race in a hundred and eighty eight laps having somebody passing somebody about every second out there yeah or and so and that and is is that when the average over how many years twenty five years twenty five years old and we hold the record this is the most amazing staff about Talladega\nYou only get one chance for a lead change you get one lap\nBecause you can only have a lead changes start finish line that you have to make that leap\nOne chance for lead change you get one lap because you can only have a lead changes start finish line that you have to make that leap change right then so that's a new leader for that last\nBut we've had eight hate lead changes in a hundred and eighty eight laps twice\nAnd we got the least number of laps for five hundred miles from anybody and we hold the record only changes I mean that's a that's such an amazing stand about Talladega and the competitive nature of the cars at Talladega because everybody's together yeah and so I was just an amazing race track\nSo let's move on a Saturday Saturday we got the uh the monster energy cup practice\nA that's in the morning and then we got qualifying for the cup in the afternoon around like three thirty or something like that but then I'm looking at seven o'clock Saturday Night we have the Saturday Night infield concert are presented thereby wind creek casino hotel okay and that is the one\nThat talked about yeah yeah of course is playing it yeah and it's a good night he's come in and it's ... and he is just red hot fire [laughter] and and just and and and this is one of these things where but when you start trying to booking\nHe may not be like the like we got a Florida Georgia Line back when I think that the wake of our race we we booked him to play\nTheir second song went gold that week and we got up nine thousand but\nYeah you got to go for the week after that it was a hundred and fifty [laughter] stick in the second one hit numbers went way yeah Brian Brian writing\nA works for us are being paid he uh\nHe's done a good job of kind of kind of sorting through all those folks and and we've had various you know ones that throughout the years and it really doesn't matter who we put up there the crowd loves whoever's up there yeah 'cause they're at Talladega and that's where they like to be having a fun time they get to know Iran ... so smoking hot\nWe sold it out for months ago and then we added more based pots and we sold I was at home I mean if it's just smoking hot the infield the place to is the hottest and fail and motor sport in India wants to say there is and it's not bad but it's not like\nThey it's just so massive like you can't talk about the scale of how big it is until you go there and you get on top of the grandstand and you literally see all the campers in the middle seat or people sitting by the fences see people drag their dish TVs out and hang them up on the fence so they can watch the cars go buy a credible\nRoger Pinsky says that those seats at the very top of our tower course which she how in the background and everything I mean it's got it's such a scenic view but he said those are the best seats in motor sports it and those because he he goes everywhere he goes every race track and he tries to sit as high as he can\nWhere he's up there sort of looking at his you know where his car sick of it like as far as I said he's he's one of the greatest men and support to without a doubt\nOh man I I Know I I Can't hear myself in the back of your life on the floor [laughter] if your number\nIs a foreign I Know how do the rest of them right up there hung up no um\nI think it was just somebody that was all there was it just you know I think so because the plane\n... but we're back on now right yeah we're back on land back on where you entertaining me I'm On the lines are blowing up so we got to play by going or I or let's go to Charles Alan hey Charles on head with somebody\nLooks like we lost the job\nBlankenship sits in Studio with me Joe what's up rather for what is up rather happy to be back just for I mean I'm here for like one segment today I'm five more minutes on [laughter] well you know we had a wonderful conversation in there I don't know if anyone hurt it but we we reveal\nThe secrets alive we conquer the world peace yeah I have told everyone had to become multimillionaires literally overnight and I also I ... yeah well absolutely easy is\nIt it's a shame that uh we we were able to react to that in forty five seconds and in the last ... you know unfortunately now none of us can remember what we say that that's going to be forever lost\nThat was one of my moments in radio like like one of the moments like I look back home and I remember that more than I remember like man you had a great segment you know what I mean I don't remember the segments we know mess up on 'cause obviously I was a technical technicality whatever happened\nAnd I went back and remember that just as pure fun I Wish someone had captured I Wish that has been captured on a recording somewhere\nHow how many times that we had that opportunity but uh you know we had fun you know it's kinda like I remember the worthless conversations that we as opposed to ah the\nRecently in the U.S really ...\nFun you know it's kind of like I remember the worthless conversations that we've had as opposed to a it\nWas really solving than us really hash it out like the give it a thorough razors absolutely\nWant or need announces but no man thanks thanks for having me you know just briefly to day in and you know I got to sit through a little bit of that Talladega and of course you know while I'm super excited over extreme concepts because hey man we got Jeffrey Earnhardt baby\nWe got an Earnhardt coming to dig and that's what I'm really excited about and Jeffrey's just sent me a taxi like hey I really want to call in to forge show but uh unfortunately I've got time and the simulator today\nHeck yeah well look he's got to get out there that are on the track and he does great on the simulator he listen\nI Jeffrey Earnhardt dominates the Toyotas simulator a I'm not afraid to say that he has beat and some of the well known guys on there that otherwise would not\nIt's funny when you get these drivers and put them on equal gr into an even playing field and you really see who can drive all and that's why I almost miss the old they used to run a series called Iraq or an in it would literally put drivers on the same court nobody could cheat it nobody can do the best driver was and I thought it was fantastic it took\nYou know NASCAR such a multifaceted sports or in the fact that you've got to have the engineers you've got to have the pit crew you've gotta have the driver all things have to work together and it's really the driver gets a lot of the credit but ultimately the cup series is a team sport you know I Know you've seen that um but it's interesting but as a\nTeam from the tire changer to the jak man to the courage to the driver to the owner you don't realize how much these owners due to the owner to the PR to everything that goes in\nAbsolutely took to the hall or guys are talking about the ... parade earlier you know one of my favorite things is to watch the hollers they literally pack everything they need for the weekend in there\nIn one truck is incredible everything they've got to spare motor in there they've got to spare car they've got the ice cream cones for the crew for when it gets a little high everything they need everything they needed in the hall and I think it's incredible\nAnd you know all these little jobs not just changing the tower the tar specialists to who takes a scrape earn a blow torch slowly are\nAll the worries about that exactly it's incredible and like the whole are guys that the drivers of these hollers it's not like when they get there they just sleep in the back of the truck the whole time that they are given out snacks there cleaning up the hall or they're making sure everything's organized the supplies get to the garage like they're working\nAll weekend long ... and for every thing to be put together like that and to a and they have what forty teams at Degas\nThis we have right now they've got forty one registered and we'll see sometimes a team will drop out between now and then but I mean you know people are going to have to qualify their way into this race as well make somebody is going home that day and that's the way it should be see I I Love\nAnd they have to raise to get in you know what I mean like if you just show up and yeah this happens and and then like even the charters in NASCAR and like a huge fan of that like I Want to see some racing and qualify like I Want to see people going tires to the wall and qualified and let's see how fast when you get these bad boys\nRun an absolute will you and you know we're going to see the next year we'll just see the adjustments to the car a next year they're going to take it down you know take the engine packs a day on changing the restrict or played putting a new spoiler in I mean it's it's going to go crazy again and I'm really looking forward to it and how many of these drivers can do\nAnd like we've gone around I mean Joel what you've been more racist than I have um over this past year but I mean we we've gone to several races and it is a lot that goes into like Jimmy Johnson had you know really great car going into Sunday and he gets out there starts the car up takes one lap around and some ball joint or something breaks\nBreaks and and he's he's going to have you yes Fifteen left them the first Fifteen labs you know using this chance ... broke um you know that some\nAnd he's he's going to have you with us Fifteen lessons on the first Fifteen labs you know using this chance ...\nBroke um you know that some people would say that that's probably karma for the uh\nFor for for the rogue all in for the praying that he pulled on through ex\nThis this past week too but I got to tell you though the one thing I'm just I'm I'm first of all for who'd been so many races number one is I'm excited to be home this week yeah I'm so excited to be home\nBut number two is it's great hosting everyone because we've had these amazing experiences we've been to people's homes leave host we've been hosted\nUm but you know the one thing everyone on the NASCAR circuit talks about is Talladega yeah they all can not wait for Talladega\nAnd it's in the playoffs and it's in the fall like the seasons wrapping up we've what six races left\nSix races left a you know and so this just six more opportunities for Jeffrey Earnhardt win a race to catch is going to happen I I\nI just so excited for it because like we've had Jeffrey on here before for like an hour\nAnd we talked about everything under the sun with him in London racing everything butler I yeah I think we talked about racing for about the first five minutes and we're like okay we got all her and ask her questions out a way like like what do you do in your spare time I would change you brush your teeth with like I Love I Love finding out about people and he was just one of those guys where\nHe was just an open book he was like dude I Want to shoot ducks and I want to drive fast like that's all he wants to\nDo but how much have you also have that relationship I mean I I Know your your other favorite ... your own hurts your favorite driver but under your other favorite drivers damn\nDangerous or as yeah Daniel Schorr as is like if I didn't have the kind of relationship I Do a Jeffery like where he sends me just like ridiculous video ideas and stuff like that\nStory as it would be my favorite driver of all time because he was in the movie cars you leave these cars three and where's the T shirt and yes and also the T shirt around and I had been joking and I tell this or other I joked about cars\nLike the first couple of races I went to and nobody was laughing at him like I I even saw a full life size version of lightning McQueen at them in the summer of Charlotte race\nRight and I'm losing my mind\nOkay nobody gives me anything we're in Poconos than at some lake house which is often by the way it was probably the best place which said absolutely and so uh and and we're staying in pogo Soyuz walks in he's the poll he's he's on top of the ... what is he the poll what's it called\nHe is he on the polling absolutely the pulse it or he wanted his his first ever poll\nNumber one qualify I mean he he is the man to be that this race right he walks in wearing a cars three Disney shirt and I lose my mind because nobody else has been talking about cars all we can all he walks in we're in the cars are everybody all ... like are you kidding\nMe oh that's not how it happened what happened was everyone came in and said Daniel congratulations on the poll good job\nFor ... oh my God I just want to let you know I Love that movie the jaws says oh you know having to Daniel's war has just says I Love cars three I don't really know who he was before that I'm with him and he's a great driver who was on the poll but you know it it's a ... and he's excited for Talladega right he's number Nineteen\nSo if you see that Nineteen orange car that's Daniel ... you say Daniel ...\nAt the racetrack go up to him and tell them how much he loved the movie card yes um\nEvery time he sees me he gets he gets like kinda like okay that's that guy\nYeah he ... recruits him out a little bit though the first time I've been I've been playing it off of them played a cool out more about what I was going to other groups not just sell to the amazing thing about\nThe sport is forward what other sports do you have those interactions what other sport you round the drivers that you have these personal conversation yeah not just Jeffrey ... heart you know Daniels for as knows who you are you at Colorado several times you had these opportunities to be around these ...\nA recession yeah not just Jeffrey on heart you know Daniels for as knows who you are you met Colorado several times you had these opportunities to be around these drivers and interact with them and they know who you are in in their very accessible at the track and I think that's the most amazing thing about the sport\n'cause like how many times do you go to a college football game and you get to hang out with jailing hurts like don't you get to shake hands down and hurt them and let them sign your forehead like you know how many times that actually happened\nAnd up for these professional drivers to come out here and look you know they they make some money I and for them to come out here and spend time with the fans and stuff like that I think it's awesome and you get to watch some of these drivers meetings and and you get to see 'em all in one place it's just so dang cool\nWell it is not just that it's you never know if you're in the infield they're talking about the the big one the big one of the boulevard which is a great event but hey if you're in the infield how many times have we been in the in field at the track on on friday night or Saturday Night and what do you see you see a a a you're having a good party at your RV you're hanging out your camp ground and he pulls up\nJeopardy Earnhardt Gulf car and your T shirt here's
