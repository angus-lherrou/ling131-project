Davis so really wow that was awhile ago even after nine eleven happened oh and you have an old from also\nWell thanks thanks you've made your mental it's all this you know do all these other you know but a lot of people come through there but it's it's been a ... a lot a lot of information from\nYeah Ken that's absolutely right and let me just say this I have entered a a man's world it very much so and at least on this side of the Mike you know back in the\nUh the other offices there's there are more women but here it's been primarily men and ah they have done nothing but help me they've been very welcoming and letting me\nCut my teeth on live radio as opposed to you know recorded news they've ... they've let me barge in and express my thoughts were regardless of how weirder wacky they might come across and I I really have nothing but a high praise for everybody's got ... and Michael heart\nA Joe Lockett a my Andrew maclean all of them are and those that were here before that\nYou were really ... though are you doing\nAll right thanks I appreciate it All right without further ado let us play my first spooky soundbite this is Obama talking in Wisconsin at a rally I'm sure he was there for some Democrat who's trying to ...\nYou know stay in the house and a well just listen at it\nIn the middle of its thought so he's clearly referring to the caravans that are\nMaking their way through Mexico there are now too by the way even though he might refer only to one at this point there's another one forming and those are the ones that are forming a second caravan are much more violent they're throwing rocks I have a story about that we'll talk about throwing rocks\nAnother one forming and those are the ones that are forming a second Caribbean are much more violent they're throwing rocks I have a story about that we'll talk about throwing rocks at as well as Molotov cocktails and and just you know just being all those just crazy little kids you know that are of on their way to a new life and are\nCarrying violence along with them\nBut I'm sure that'll change once they step across on us land because there's something about this hallowed land that just changes everything including giving them citizenship right off the bat or at least if you're born here so let's listen to Obama and see well let's just say\n[noise]\nKnow [noise]\n[noise] and too often don't work [noise]\n[laughter]\nWe got to stop calling on us so [noise]\nWere like Charlie Brown football [noise]\n\nYou don't you\nThem to do that\nOkay there we go\nOh had nice little thirty second now and now we're ready to roll see Obama talking about the care of and saying you know the Republicans are focusing on it and not what really matters which is people going into retirement or do we have that high of a demographic right now in the all of the population of the United states that this is the\nCritical thing people are all one step away from retirement and that's the next thing on everybody's mind\nThat doesn't jive with me a health care no people just people want healthcare but but the insurance is the problem and fortunately Trump has pulled off those regulations so that people aren't strapped with it anymore so I Do not hear people\nI like I did two years ago before the twenty sixteen election talking about all their premiums going up and how they paying so many dollars thousands of dollars a year for their deductible and still unable to get health care uh I'm not hearing that is anybody hearing that that has not been on the\nOn the table here for a lot of Americans out there talking in fact if anything it's it's gone by the wayside because people now have jobs and can least afford to get insurance through their jobs whereas they before they were having forced to go on a bomb and care because they're on unemployment\nSo now and then here's the other thing we've got this care than coming that's basically going to challenge the sovereignty of our nation and if they actually succeed and get into the United states there's five to six thousand people that are going to\nInundate the markets and uh basically undermine the economy and how they go about conducting business illegally\nAnd how they go about putting a drain on our system drain to the taxpayer drain to other people who are trying to get jobs legally but the you know\nDrain to the taxpayer drained to other people who were trying to get jobs illegally\nBut the you know that they're on the black market there they're working under the table and it's under cutting people who are running regular businesses in different areas in different industries so yeah you know that it's all connected and we have reason to be concerned about these caravans because if they actually the first one gets through\nThen it's only going to set a precedent for more to come which means thousands and thousands and thousands of more people\nThinking they've got a chance if they get in the U. S. so I I think it's appropriate to be concerned about what this is because it sets a precedent now these same people\nThe Democrats the hard left the socialist they're busy working down here in Alabama trying to stop\nA the amendment the pro life amendment from gaining any traction because they know it sets a precedent and it will set precedent for roe v Wade should that ever come into a ... the U.S Supreme Court make it up that high they know all about president\nThey know all about the importance of nippy get in the bud if you will that's why they're working so hard to to to knock it out of the park and and stop it from happening here in Alabama so it's funny that he would be\nMocking Republicans for looking at the caravan saying ooh this is not a habit we want to enforce on a daily basis but\nYou know Planned Parenthood is down here saying this is not an amendment we want enforced because it could set a dangerous precedent for all other states who might want to go pro life\nAnd endanger our bottom line so yeah Obama can't have it he doesn't want to have it you can't what am I trying to say he wants to have it both ways I guess that right is that the right use the term and anyways ah\nLet me go into the middle of that soundbite there was something else he said\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] and I don't want\nYeah I'm not buying that in the press is clearly on his side they're the ones that are used the cheap shots in the last minute accusations\nLike Kavanaugh to try and de real things and get people in a panic tried to fear monger\nSee I I I see that on the Democrats' side on them in the media side not not Republicans were going to go through some headlines on that caravan and we're just going to evaluate that you know feel free to disagree with me if you think I'm wrong and how I'm interpreting these headlines but we'll do that on the other side of the break\nWhen we get back you can certainly Colin nine four one one zero one one eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three Andrea ties in for the Ford faction be back in a flash [noise]\nJust wondering what what is Obama reading I mean I went both sides left and right the right is presented facts of what's happening with the Mexican caravans and asking questions about its origin how they're\nHow they're making it through Mexico who's funding it talking about what the president says so I I don't see any fear mongering there and if anything on the left side which I Would assume Obama's reading the New York times\nThey're downplaying it to for different reasons in fact they're pointing the finger at Trump for making it a political issue\nHere's one from New York Times trumping GOP candidates escalate race and fear as a lecture employees I I don't know that's pretty incendiary but that that ... doesn't have anything to do the caravans\nPresident Trump latches onto a migrant caravan as top issue in midterms that's their byline\nOr here's the Washington Post Trump Republican settle on fear and fall foods\nAs a mid term strategy that was the Washington Post\nSo there you have Obama out they're telling us we're scared and that we're falling for fake headlines but I'm reading these headlines\nAnd one set of them is just presenting the facts and asking questions the other one's downplaying the whole issue I don't see any fear mongering going on there so there you go Obama and his spooky little sound bite pretty pathetic oh and speaking of Obama's legacy\nSpooky little sound bite pretty pathetic oh and speaking\nOf Obama's legacy since we're talking about him and then we'll leave this all behind did you realize that five of the ... ... prisoners that were exchanged for one Bowe Bergdahl remember that exchange that little\nGift to Baghdad was given to the Taliban and the middle east these people that were released in exchange for Bowe Bergdahl to come home which we we don't know where he is what he's doing well the five members of the Afghan Taliban were freed with Bowe Bergdahl's exchange and\nNow they have been found to have rejoined the Taliban are we surprised trick or treat we've been tricked that\nIs for sure they were released from Guantanamo Bay and they have ... joined the insurgent groups political office in Qatar and that has been confirmed by their spokesman\nThat there'll be hula ... na ... modular he'd get the idea\nSo they're back a with their old buddies the ... and it didn't take very long really I don't know when\nUh I Can't remember the date that Bergdahl came it was in the middle of his last term it seems like so yeah they're uh they're they're back with their old buddies in ... do we have no idea what he's doing other than the fact that he didn't get court martialed\nLike he should've so that's what's happening there\nThought I bring that spooky sound bite of Obama if you have any suggestions on our Obama should dress up this Halloween you feel free to call me on that um\nWill have fun with it All right we also have some other interesting stories regarding Nancy Pelosi and Hillary\nHillary soundbites coming and ... and ... as well I also want to play a sound bite from Lindsey Graham recently I'm telling you Graham deserves\nThe title ... far more than Booker does only because he's become a gladiator he's become a political gladiator when it comes to out getting out there he is going to multiple rallies ahead of the midterms for Senate candidates he was just in Tennessee\nOr to help Marsha Blackburn\nOh in fact that reminds me\nYou know this whole thing was Marsha Blackburn first of all she had a rally over the weekend Lindsey Graham was there and you're aware I Hope that during this rally she called for a moment of silence in honor of those who were shot at the synagogue the eleven people who died\nIn the synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nShe wanted to do that in light of the fact that she was holding a rally on the day or near to the day that this happened and she didn't want to be\nDisrespectful or insensitive to what the nation has been observing on the news regarding these people it's a tragedy people have lost their lives families are affected forever so she ... wanted to hold a moment of silence\nAnd during that moment of silence all hell broke loose all these protesters that were in their laying in weight to disrupt her rally decided this is a good time let's do it now now we can be heard so let's ... you know\nLaying in weight to disrupt her rally decided this is a good time let's do it now now we can be heard ... ... you know become a noxious screaming idiots\nThis rally and disrupted of course a Senator Graham came on afterwards and he had I mean he's got the jokes man he is a funny guy he came on\nAnd was a downplaying it good for him and went on with the rally and promoted black ... black burn and said she's going to be a rock star senator and I think she will and I hope she just blows away Phil Bredesen\nBut I I just amazing to me now Blackburn has turned around and used the audio that was captured 'cause these people being dragged out screaming profanity is against Blackburn then being dragged out apparently they were kicking and\nHitting the police they were causing massive disruption very disrespectful\nSo this was all caught on on various phones for good reason\nAnd Blackburn and her group or a communications team did a an about face the real turn a real quick turnaround on all of that out of you audio and they used it in an ad and I want to play it for you 'cause I think wow Blackburn is really\nAn island here it is [noise]\nA moment of silence [noise]\nAll right I'm not sure why don't\nWe can get just going the right way [noise]\nOut of style or I'm not sure why that sound bite is playing incorrectly 'cause it goes through more than that she plays a variety of sound but let me try it in the middle [laughter]\nI guess they're happy civility and tell them I'm away right at the moment of silence for people who died [noise]\nGo whoa [noise]\nOkay this is a great ad she\nShe is a rock star for doing that she pulls a soundbite from Fox News the the morning crew where um what's her name uh\nEasily aired heart mentions again this whole rule of incivility that has been put out there by Hillary that you can't be civil now until you get the power that you're seeking by wave election and then then when everybody hand over power with a smile of course then we'll we'll go back to being civil\nWill be real nice our teeth will be clenched 'cause we're you know about the scrutiny over but will be nice so\nBlackburn uses this audio from the protest she couples it up with the comment from easily Earhart and then she tax on the very last comment from Eric Holder about when they go low you kick them and then the final video which is brilliant is of that guy in Canada who kicked\nThe ... the pro life protester\nThe pro life support person ... it was a woman and the guy who's a hairstylist when they turn around and kicked her [laughter]\nIs is really great video on her part of good for her but here's the thing here is the thing about all of that Google has told ... black fern and I've done this in the news this this morning they've told her that this doesn't meet their standards and so therefore they can't play it on their Internet advertising platform\nBlack burn and I've done this in the news this this morning they told her that this doesn't meet their standards and so therefore they can't play it on their Internet advertising platform yeah we'll talk a little bit more about that on the other side of this break but we got to go\nAnd play our ads and I'll be back in just a minute you're listening to the Ford faction\nThe Ford faction making radio great again\nDo you
