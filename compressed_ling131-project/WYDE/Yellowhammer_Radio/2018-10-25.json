things were going to be with him in the health area so glad to hear that glad that you could be part of the program for the next three hours luckily we got lots to talk about it might be all on one subject I don't know ... uh we'll see I tend to uh\nTend to dig in and and stick to one but I'm I'm willing to be convinced to go to another if you want to call in and and do that the number to do so nine four one one zero one one or toll free eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three\nNow I Know that ... and has left and he has focused quite a bit on the bombings and and I'm going to weigh in on that as well because you know we had another issue come up this morning at a Joe Biden's\nHome in Delaware\nBut before we do anything like that I Want to introduce a coat a co host with me for the next I don't know half hour and that what happened to be my own son David who is twenty two years old so we're going to get a millennial viewpoint on all of this heyday\nHello how are you good now I Know have a beer okay All right I Know you'll you'll get into the groove here because this is your first time on the air and it's it's always weird I'm a veteran now yeah OK give it a couple of five minutes and you'll be good to go so\nAnyways you happen to be coming through and I convinced you to come by I wanted you to be in Studio with me and I wanted to talk to you about the\nStories of the day but I wanted to get a millennial viewpoint\nOn what you're observing and you know we only have two more weeks left for the mid term elections and um I happen to believe that things are going to get really ramped up and crazy but we'll see they will you think so too\nYeah well three days before him something Cruz is going to happen All right out of desperation someone's going to do something\nYou think is going to be three days before anything is going to be like you got to have you got to if you're going to do this like beyond the bomb got milk them you got a ... in the media you\nKnow or you can do three days before him so there's not enough time to actually figure things out or something like that kind of annoying yeah yeah we're like if they hadn't taken their time to figure out what was going on\nPeople were just a little differently simply because they heard something about him well yeah especially among the biggest figured after the elections that doesn't matter because you know\nYeah so you're really what you're\nThat's a good point because it's very similar to what happened in Alabama with Roy Moore with the Judiciary Committee in the Senate they could have delayed and they did to lay they just didn't all a very long but in the case of the really more situation election as election it's not changing and so you get things out a certain time than a\nAnd the damage is done people get scared they don't know what to do and that's clearly what happened with Roy Moore people were really ... at the idea oh my gosh what or who are we putting into office if we vote for him my gosh she could be you know this evil pedophile are sort of like\nOn the whole point was a free people out so that they make a rash decision and vote the opposite directions simply because I heard something like but I'm more earlier upstanding human so I wouldn't vote for something like that which they switch their vote even you know that's true or don't even go out even if it is true you just don't you have it hasn't been verified\nLet me ask you about the cabinet because you mentioned ... what is your take as a millennial a young person when you saw this all go down I assume that you even did did you how much of the did you follow it and ...\nWhat is your take as a millennial a young person when you saw this all go down I assume that you even did did you how much did you follow in Wyoming\nBelievable ... I'm not even I wasn't even searching for political stuff but I went on Twitter and I follow like\nBen Shapiro and some people that I find very funny um well I'm sure he had lots of comic yeah but everything was Kevin Kevin Cavanaugh I'm no one really talked about it in real life but\nIt was all over Facebook you know whatever people are making big deal about it I was annoyed to the point of being\nAnnoyed of seeing stuff and not understanding what was going on so I went and looked it up\nAnd then I was even more noise 'cause I was like what this isn't even a conversation\nLike what the heck people are keeping information information got leaked from someone's office\nFeinstein yeah our office leaked it but she's like I call is already Diane yeah she's she's like doing the um like a congressional meeting or the you know when she asked for and they asked her like how did this information get out because only two people knew about it a Ford anew and she's like for it in your office and she says\nShows talked to ... to ... to find out about books coming on what's going on or what do you miss my following at one super ... forcibly go to Facebook dark off answers for super station\nOne on the older you are you going to take us wherever you go through with the super ... is like having your own personal news anchor in part\nThat's not creepy and all your home\nTown got and countries that should be a super station one on one of the [noise]\nThe trust Bill thanks for listening superstition or the other one\n[noise]\n\nHey welcome back in to the forward faction Andrea ties here a little out of breath had to run and do something glad you could be with us I've got my co host David ... my son with us for a little while more before he heads out\nAnd you can be part of the program at nine four one one zero one one or toll free eight six six five five one nine nine three three we're going to go to the lines real quick here and talked to Jennifer Jennifer welcome to the Ford faction [noise]\nHey address so I Want to just hops here than they had then how would you know ... on the radio yet and I want to stay right that moment good do you have to be on the lower and or the other end that money\nIs that when I Do twenty to\nThirty six and I consider it a little any all like ... I think like here in the ... okay and that's such a disparity as\nIntelligent and I don't cook that maturity well if that the college like and Dr needing our children but I find the incredible that you're not necessarily how we get so is that because of you or that because of head\nStraight up my mom [laughter] gr [laughter] well I Will\nLet him answer what he thinks played into it\nI I don't know statistically speaking there's no difference in intelligence between like years we know that but I think what I've noticed is\nYounger ... a bunch of people my age even in a conservative college that I went to ... um there's just a bunch of people who are willing to do the work themselves to look it up um or they're just happy to say like phrase words and\nTake bits and pieces from Twitter and assume all based on the headlines what's going on and instead and just like kind of take it for what it is and\nBasically gather from the piece that they're getting what the moral stances that is good and then they're like well I'm a moral person so I'm going to take that stance or that's the popular opinion so I'm going to take that that opinion and\nI I I've done that plenty of times and then I've actually gotten to like\nLook at an argument and realize the deeper issues and be like okay that's a that might be a fair argument you might have the right and argument um stance but your um your basis\nLike okay that's a I might be a fair argument you might have the right and argument um stance but your um your basis is incorrect and that's a slippery slope\nI've noticed that a lot of arguments that people like love\nTo cling to it's like you're not wrong the end goal is right like you want to stand for that but you're reasoning is wrong like\nYou may if Kavanaugh if he was convicted that's like if if he was like an actual he did the things that they say rise your end goal is yes you should be used to be punished for that but if your\nMeans of making that happen or going against all um trial um are innocent until proven guilty then it's not worth it\nAll the processes that are set in place to ensure that you get to the right conclusion in the correct way that's fair\nYeah and if and if those processes are so important that if Kavanaugh walks free because of an incorrect process that is okay because the process is more important\nFor everybody tell to react to receive justice so\nThe question is do you have any friends that are your age that have a different opinion of you that did the research and thought he was guilty or do you have scientists thought he was guilty and then did the research and it's like you like oh he's not guilty\nI haven't talked to many of my friends about the Kevin okay [noise] um but I've had plenty of friends who don't feel the same way about a lot of things um who say they've done the research but they're just\nRead a couple of vox articles and think they're really educated [noise]\nYeah and that's and and and then I'll I'll just make a comment and then I'll let you go back I feel like in college and maybe this is my let's cut its ... college that you are smoke to college to learn to be intelligent as far as making decisions that are factual\nBut I feel like when you're sending them high ledge your professors or any doctor aiding ill and chill their ideas is that true\nYeah it's I think at one point it was it was like professors were secure and they knew what they're about and they were really intent on teaching students\nHow to think and now it's become a money making thing where if they get the curriculum done people get a certain amount of scores they're good it's like high school I guess\nAnd colleges no longer like the higher education I think higher education is is honestly ... little relies on the business now like I learned the most of my college experience for managing a store that I had\nWhile in college and college taught me how to study for a test of all I didn't say protests I just took testing score\nUm [laughter] and that's how I graduated so I'm more proud of my manager managing experience than I Am with my degree my degree still sit at home in the wrapping that it was sent to me so\nWhat do you feel about that that your son went to college and he got even using it\nWell sometimes you have to go through the the uh the bad things to to come out on the other end learning the good thing so this will you know you know this was a his path to take and learning how to learn\nI think that's a good point that he made you know used to be that you were taught how to to think now it's what to sink\nAnd yet so well I'm I'm excited\nThat I'm hearing how I get it at all because I talked to a source without garbage to college you know just like brother and he went to a college degree no\nMore than I Do who ran life teaches you Laura\nKnow like a college degree and who life teaches you Laura little college they have a good\nYeah thank you Jennifer ... by the way we're eagle I Know she'd appreciate that 'cause she always she always she's a big war eagle fan but I think she's out in Idaho now or Nevada or something but anyways yeah um\nShe uh she mentioned her brother who's her age and just because he has a degree he thinks he is\nSmarter than calling me and I know some people who have PHD's who I Know for a fact\nI'm smarter than but they talk down to me like you know what they're talking about but they're PHD's unlike insect um classification in North American eastern eastern seaboard like super specific stuff which doesn't really do I\nKnow you really do a bunch of insects I'll give you that but like that doesn't mean you know how to you know balance a checkbook at that point or run a business for them and yeah yeah that is true very very good\nPoint yeah we even have some members of in our family that have PHD's out there but I Would not to agree with their reasoning in in of course anything there's other things that factor into that like who you surround yourself with in the in the mentality that you're exposed to on a day to day basis\nAnd if you're on a a a a liberal campus you're going to be inundated with it it's going to be ... hard a stream of up against the current going to be hard swim\nBecause everyone wants to fit in and\nThe people who actually kind of choose the I'm less empathetic route and more like fact based wrote\nPeople don't really like that so they're kind of ostracized and so it's easier to be like no you're right we really should care about people um the the underprivileged and this way\nRight like you know you're right we should care about the underprivileged like obviously you know not in the way that you're you're saying it but I was thinking about it a little more or less on his act on emotion\nWill we have a term here that I Will give credit to Scott ... for coming up with because we talked about the virtues sit virtue signaling we've come up with another term called virtue shaming\nOh yeah 'cause you never jak enough because you know when people tell you what they're doing their virtues signaling but then when they are condemning you for not caring or not doing the thing they want you to do than they've hurt you Shane you how can you turn away all those caravans of people that are trying to escape from poverty\nAnd and violent well like because\nI Can't because there's some other more important things in there and there will be okay they're more important\nThings like the rule of law the constitution and and enforcing the consistent standards of our our nation's\nBorders I also want to say like most people are important so if we can't find a route like if letting in those caravans is a bad idea if you want to care about those people we should find another way to do it and there are other ways to do it doesn't mean that just because you block off out one door that you don't care about those people\nA row what's your thoughts on the whole a Caribbean thing since you are from Mexico\nWell [laughter] my my thoughts are um you know number one I mean I don't I don't like what's happening at all um I think it's the split by um I think it's being spent up by special interests\nSpecial interests liberal type groups professional educators almost\nYeah yeah I really do and um you know I I mean look I hate to be a skeptic and and I'm I'm really you know usually not I like the base anything I say based on facts\nBut there's too many coincidence was going on right now based on this um based on a caravan and also too many cause it is going on with\nAll of a sudden you know these bombs showing up out of nowhere yes uh you know the less that's you know a lot of question marks and go into my mind I'm thinking wow this is just way too convenient for this to all of a sudden come up\nAnd it's also you know a ... you have to be scratching your head how can this be and not only that but how can anybody send out seven or eight bombs and not one go off\n[laughter] you know so you know they're terrible fighters you know or a this is being dressed up to um make it look like it's ... you know and it's funny they you I mean they you start seeing people writing writing op ed you know\nTo um make it look like and it's funny that you I mean that you start seeing people reading writing and you know a day after two days after about this is all Trump fall\nOh I Know it is crazy I mean actually within two hours of this incident yesterday Newsweek came out and was criticizing eat an email phrase that was used by Ron dissent is\nCalling for the kiss of death from Hillary when she came to Florida to campaign for Andrew Gillum\nSo you know they they were it was like someone was absolutely waiting in the wings with it all written up just waiting for the right moment I mean how else can you explain that thanks so much for the whole road I'm going to let you go and I'm going to a new thing All right thanks so much for being a first time caller\nWe're going to move on to Jonathan see what he had to say hey Jonathan welcome to the Ford faction\nHello Andrea first off a large role shots\nAre okay you can do that actually socially I\nI
