Andrea well I'm I Need to either talk up or you need to tone down oh really yeah you're probably cranking it up yeah I just don't talk as loudly as I say that I I Know that you just can't get enough of radio so I figured hey [laughter] have you\nKnow there's more things to talk about that I don't I Can't get it all in and the two hours and I know that you are going to cover all a number of the big interesting things like\n... is he still on the news well I'm looking at his face a on Fox News right now and so yeah he is apparently a\nThe Turkish president came out and said this was a plan go out or to do yeah the guy we can believe\n[laughter] has had asked people killed off and it really hasn't frame to an American pastor named um Brunson right kept him in prison for two years not not that no is this guy says the Saudis did something bad\nWe need to believe taken him to the bank\nWhy why is because I think that the American people are predicted on my program that the American people do not care about 'cause you\nKnow I don't think so journalists\nCare about cars shaggy because they thought they would be able to put President Trump in a box\nAnd making looked like he has a he has no feelings and it doesn't stay full towards journalists mhm I I saw one of the articles\nThat said that could cause shockey murder be because of Donald Trump's bad mouthing journalist and what\nDid you really if he was yeah Oh absolutely an attempt to make that connect you\nTo make the connection that people all over the world don't like journalists because Donald Trump apparently is influencing all these people all over the world\nJust as as much and but I keep asking the same question\n... of Saudi right he's a Saudi Arabian citizen right he has residents in the United states which means we let them hang out here\nHe writes some articles sometimes at the Washington Post put seeing while they're destroying democracy in darkness right right and he\nAlso reports that said he was advocating for the overthrow of the Saudi monarchy hoping to replace it with a radical jihadi is Muslim Brotherhood top of government right you know I Would kill everybody we hate you\nDeath to America those guys if that is true and I don't know that it is that was from a German newspaper if that is true\nIs there anybody in the world who doesn't think the Saudi monarchy would do away with you for advocating the overthrow which would mean the death of the Saudi monarchs\nThat's treason to Saudi Arabia is not ... yes it is stone you for they take more driving if you're a woman no no they have new guys that\nWomen can drive so the world where they stone you if you're a woman in use what speak out attorney they throw you off and bridges if you're having to\nBe gay they battled stoning for adultery as far as I Know who they\nLet him out to be a terrible policy it would keep a lot of people from your chicken each other out at work when I used to be legal to committed nursery in most states in this country\nSo that we we agree on that that's the point is I just want somebody to call in and say Scott you're wrong adultery is you'll be fine\nAnd legal anywhere hoping that their spouse does not listen to the radio\nOkay All right so that is what you're driving for okay I was gonna say Saudi Arabia\nLegal anywhere hoping that their spouse does not listen to the radio\nOkay All right so that's what you're driving for okay I was gonna say Saudi Arabia it only beat him to the punch of what he was planning to do to them or if that's true\nWhat well that's good I'm Out in line with Muslim Brotherhood that's really really advocating the overthrow the crown look here's the but I'm surprised that that they did the guy in here's the\nBottom line Scott the only reason why he's in the press right now is because he has the label journalists it's all about labels and only because he has a label journalist because we had an American Israeli agent get killed in Israel but he was American born okay we heard about\nThat but I I don't even know what you're talking about exactly so he was murdered a couple weeks ago by the Palestinians and I'm a student is murdered it American yes\nIt is true sure sure crickets crickets everywhere but ... ... ah\nOh yeah I go to the polls on the way to work and make sure to get out there that way while I'm at work I can tell my friends and colleagues do also go vote and I'm I'm a I'm a pretty energetic voter when it comes time to get people out and do their thing\nVote early and often brother [laughter] right that's what we want to hear [laughter] that's right so we want to hear thanks for the call appreciate\nIt All right let's go to Damian and see what he has to say hey welcome to the Ford faction\nWho fail or you were doing great of a sudden All right can you hear me All right you're\nRight I called the scrimmage ... oh my goodness okay [laughter]\nUm\nI don't why do you think ill or as a a hack\nWhy do I think ... the hack because I don't believe it takes almost two years to figure out that there was no collusion\nAlso believe in the comes out with a report after the midterm election that says there was no collusion\nThat means he is known for weeks there's no collusion and if he has known for weeks why would you not say before the election so the Democrats cetera can't continue to go and say that Donald Trump as a pawn of the Russians\nI Would think that would make you a hack\nOkay so um who appointed Mueller to be the head investigating robot\nKnowing Rod Rosenstein did\nWrite so Rosenstein answers truck right no\nNo ... not directly ... he would answer to Jeff Sessions in the D. O. J. 'cause he's the assistant attorney general yeah deputy attorney general yes\nSo I don't know if you notice or not but uh I think they take newer because his honor and integrity or ... beyond reproach\nSays that's not really true either ... remember mother is\nOne of the guys who wasn't exactly up front with um the Congress and some of the testimonies while he was FBI Director\nRight where there's a lot of conflict of interest between ... and even Rosenstein if you go back 'cause remember Mohler was in charge of the FBI years and years ago a under second Bush\nI Believe in and further and under Obama yes and um it I'll tell you what you could do they mean as you look up Louie Gohmert report on Muller where he lifts the various conflicts of interest in the things that Muller did in past cases\nThat showed that he is all about getting a conviction but not about getting to the truth or actually having you know getting to justice he has done some really shady shady cases where people have been pursued and hounded and then end up being found not guilty\nBut they they were labs are ruined in the process\nOh I I was reading up on Mueller a couple of weeks ago and I write a story from Vietnam about how he won it cross silver\nStar right right out his purple hearts and everything right I'm\nNot a big I only been bad for you know that they never did anything great I mean it's like he's like a lot of people but if you I think there's a place to go to jail or report just look up what I did was movie ... report on ... and just go just go Peru's that\nAnd uh I think you'll come closer to seeing it as I see it than not\nYou know or as I just heard hack and I was like that do won the silver star [laughter] I'm not going to call screaming [laughter]\nThat's okay I got to take it operates\nOr it's just her and I was like dude won the silver star [laughter] I'm not I'm gonna call screeners [laughter]\nThat's okay I like it operates judge you brother man\nThanks Damien were not not in we're not knocking his past service but you know people change as we know from even John McCain he you know\nWell I mean you can do great things and then come back and government in in in began to start doing ... squarely\nThings I mean there's a difference in battle in combat and ... and then coming back to the political world and kinda ... job and and what can I cover up and what Saddam out politically it's kind of different because it's a clear cut us versus them\nRight in in battle in war and it's a little different when you get to get to politics so uh what happened what caused it I don't know but a mother is in my opinion not not necessarily a boy scout\nAlright on that no we will take a break you're listening to the Ford faction and we'll come back and get David who's on the line and you are welcome to call in as well nine four one one zero one one now is your time to talk to Scott and tell him he shouldn't be calling\nMueller a hack or or just do the reason why is a fun yeah or if he didn't do that All right is Andrea ties in with the ... and we'll be back in a flash\nThe Ford faction with Ford brown the following it does not necessarily reflect the opinions or abuse of Crawford Broadcasting its employees affiliates or advertisers\nGary Palmer understands that America needs a strong military and\nAnd honor our veterans are there so\nHe is acutely aware of veterans the military and helpless in every way that he has done great things for us and he will continue to do great things for a\nCongressman Palmer is committed to meeting the needs of these heroes and their families Palmer for Congress identical leadership Irving Alabama I'm Gary Palmer and I approved this message [noise]\nHey guys forty of 'em the Ford faction stay traditions as the original state inspired apparel companies they offer upscale casual clothing including shirts hats out a way of\nTies shores and accessories was subtle stays civil West I'm guessing you probably want to represent our great yellow Amish day you'll hammer supply company has a great mix of shirts jackets and even work out for the with the subtle yellow birds that we all know and love\nDay tradition can be found at the summit in between movies Pulitzer and Scott [noise]\nCan you sacrifice a day of your life to change someone else's life forever sign up to volunteer with the Cajun Navy at certain points dot com and eat our Q.

tomorrow it's gotta be thin filling in for the hour right gotcha for an hour an hour\nYeah that's how does your son you know it goes by a Democrat ... yeah right you just walk in and they're like oh you're you're isolates my mind when you didn't even know\nBut it automatically transfer to an hour let's go to David and see what he had to say hey welcome in\nI was going on and that was the navy crossers silver star doesn't mean they're not all of them just 'cause somebody's the\nWWF or a war hero not a ... call was busted is a I guess that's journalist selling a says last night but\nUm you know I had no idea that he was affiliated with Osama bin Laden even in his childhood you know that's something I'll have to go back and research myself doesn't start to look at that\nBut there's a ... a media article if I if my memory serves me right PJ Media PJ me definitely Jay the media you don't go to Jay ... because there is one of those also PGA media\nAnd it is it is referencing a German newspaper so if you if you look that up you can read it read it yourself and make up your own mind\nYeah that's that's what I like to listen to everybody else's stuff\nOn my right\nBut then when I was taught about was um you know Saudi Arabia says if they didn't kill them and now all of a sudden the Hispanic you'll do what I Want a knows what nobody else was talking about is what the hell's his body oh it's awful met a barrel that or what that is\nAll they have all sorts of creative ways uh there's reports coming out that they've found remains but then they're backtracking on it as well so it at this point\nDo we do we have the tape yet no we don't have the Turks and kind of their ... the Turks said they had audiotape\nYeah and now we don't have audio tape so we're back to\nWho do we believe and that's why that's why I usually makes me boil it down to like take it as far as it could possibly be which would be the Saudi prince knew about it had the guy killed off jumping up pieces put him in ... he doesn't exist anymore we in America are still left with so\nWhat are we supposed to do about it yeah I I I\nPush it on others so why can't we not just have a amicable\nPart in the ... the national divorced or just at least let us have a couple of ... a couple of states I Know what is wrong with that well I mean looking I don't what we have\nWe we have we have counties where they can't pray at the high school football game before the game even though they have done that for decades and decades and decades and a bunch of leftist point to have to come down and say\nYou must stop we will make you stop no\nThey weren't making any body pray right we're going to be made\nTo stop yeah because they can't leave us alone so ... who who was really the oppressors here\nGood question they always want to be the oppressed ones because they got to be have to buy a victim they got to be victims right yeah I you know personally I don't have\nThe whole answer but I I Will say this I look at liberalism as a para civic political party in it has to leech off us something else because in another ... self\nJust like socialism it can't function on its own it does not count it can stay in itself can sustain itself it does not account for the nature of humans across the globe\nThe the intrinsic nature of humans and what is reality and it cannot account for it cannot so therefore it cannot a function properly because it's not giving people the the uh the ... the area to grow and it's not nurturing human nature as it is or at least factoring\nAll the the the only countries that\n... the area to grow and it's not nurturing human nature as it is or at least factoring\nWill all the the the only countries that are half way successful with socialism the ones that are held up kind of a model if you look at the the sweetest countries\nEven if you go all the way to say China right China has only been successful as they allowed some free market some of the capitalistic effort yeah ... ... people could see the reward of their labors in writing thing\nIn the sweetest countries they have a big Social Security net yes but they even realize hey we can't do this we have to let enough capitalism\nEnough freedom flourish so weaken reap the benefits off of it yes and and that you know maybe that's what people were saying but I Do I still don't know why\nWe can we can't be left alone they can overtake the host body from which they're sucking the life blood from if you kill off the golden goose exactly they got to put the goose in the tightest PIN possible\nPut a a a ring around his neck her neck and keep her clamp down she can't she can't forever wings you can't have prayer to ball games you can't say we want to do things our way all she can do is just keep pumping out those Goldman eggs they keep paying for all the freebies for everybody else who won't bump one out\nIt's a foul theory [laughter] ...
