maximum than living in those Wilson was sort of a Social Security equation strategies outlines what you need to know to get the most from your Social Security [noise]\nWelcome to the show we've been talking about college\nAnd in particular ways to reduce the out of pocket costs for parents\nAnd look at a different assistance comes out there how would take advantage of that\nUm ... primarily in the financial aid process but this um but in particular last week I left off by talking about the college selection process how we go about selecting those colleges how ... how does a child so like that and I want to pick back up there\nThe ... process how we go about selecting those colleges how ... how does a child like that and I want to pick back up there\nBut in general the all wrong goal here is to reduce the out of pocket costs for parents and through the financial assistance that's out there\nAnd we've been talking an awful lot about where that comes from and who decides I'm for that using the expected family contribution Seventy percent of the aid that's out there comes from the federal government most of the rest of the aid comes from the college itself\nBut the big theme of this of the series is that the people that received the most Dane and pay the least amount of money for college or those that are not necessarily in the greatest need\nThe people who received the most stayed and pay the least amount for college or not necessarily those in the greatest name they're the ones that understand the process you have to understand this process that's the last woman talking about\nIn the analogy that I wouldn't use would be an analogy for a hotel or for a plane ticket you know most people are aware that there are some processes and Web sites they can go through and\nI'm not everybody that goes to the hotel is going to pay the same amount any more so than what the college just because of the tuition writer stayed at a certain amount doesn't necessarily mean that is what you're going to pay [noise] so the selection the college is extremely important\nBecause one of the things that you will find is that not all colleges are created equal\nAnd they're actually quite different [noise] so limiting school choice based on what the standard to their tuition rates are doesn't necessarily reduce the parents share of college cost\nLimiting school choice does not necessarily reduce or parents share of college cost now colleges are created equal sometimes the more expensive colleges provide a lot more resources they have a lot more resources\nSo the actual cost and the parent is actually less so we've been talking about all that\nAnd we kind of left off the last time talking about the selection process this process that we go through to pick\nThe college how do we go through a with our children and pick the college\nNow things are a little bit different and then I'm a little bit of a fossil and things are a little bit different today than they used to be when I went to college\nOut when I went to college we didn't have this ... we didn't do a lot of these things they did today\nIt just really was not that big of a deal at that time or some people did go out of state and some people didn't go to other universities um most people in my high school when Taliban were often are those that were academically I'm superior smarter\nOr they might go to one of the um you know Vanderbilt Harvard School or something along those lines but most everybody went to one of those two schools so\nThat was very little thought that was given to this financial aid process the actual cost associated with it and we didn't do college visits or any kind of things\nBut in general how how to children and parents select colleges are much from the time in my experience there's a handful of colleges that have already been picked you know sometimes it's um who you root for the football team who won the iron bowl sometimes that's where your friends are ongoing\nSometime this for your parents went sometimes it's a close to home are not close to home which was my choice when I went to school I didn't want anything close to home\nAnd it's went sometimes it's a close to home are not close to home which was my choice when I went to school I didn't want anything close to home there's a lot of different factors that people come up with that now most of the time they have these handful of colleges that they're interested in and then they go visit\nAnd then once they visit and they start to eliminate and look at the different schools and which one they're interested in the not or not\nAnd then from there generally what most parents do is initiate the financial aid process at that point I'm suggesting strategy and that's a little bit different\nI'm what I'm suggesting is that you go through the financial aid process initially\nIn you allow the results are about to guide the selection of schools you don't go into the situation with just a handful of schools that you've already picked you figure out which one you want and then you figure out okay what financial assistance is there\nFor this one I'm suggesting is that parents need to choose the school based on the financial situation after going through the financial aid process\nIn the analogy that I gave was one of 'em I'm buying a car you know how do you go about buying a car if you want to pay the lowest price for a car and you've got to create a competitive situation\nYou have to go into the dealer you have to let them know that you're not already ... predisposed to that they have to offer you a good deal they have to offer you something that's going to be of interest to you\nIf they offer you something that's not a very good deal then you just let them know that you're going to go down the street to the other dealer those are that's the way that you received the best price if you want to pay the highest price for a car and walk into the dealer and start talking about how much he loved the college excuse me in the car\nAnd let them know that you've already chosen that car so in ... so in their mind it doesn't really matter what the price is there going off or whatever they think you're going to choose they're not going to offer you the best deal\nVery similar to colleges if you go into this college selection process are rated the signing\nThat you want to let you want to go to two or three schools you're not going to get the best deal you have to create a competitive situation go into it with that kind of mindset\nThat you want the colleges to compete with each other and that competitive situation is what will cause them to the university has to be more aggressive or less aggressive\nWhen it comes to the financial aid processes and not all colleges are created equal but not all colleges need to work as hard to try to stay in it it is a business\nThey're going to spend the amount of time in the amount of resources they need to attract the students that they want you've got to create this competitive situation\n... so what we talked about a last week was starting out with eight to ten colleges not one or two you start out with ain't in colleges and it seems like a lot\nA in a way that you do that is that the faster process so the this website that you go to Spain by the department of education that you provide your income and your assets\nAre you also select the colleges that you're interested in [noise] now does that mean you're going to go to them no does that mean you're even going to apply for admissions and does not\nIt just means that you're letting them know that they're on your radar by by selecting eight to ten colleges you negotiate the financial aid process with all these different colleges\nKnow that they're on your radar but by selecting eight to ten colleges you initiate the financial aid process with all these different colleges and create that competitive\nSituation that we're talking about I'm In a nice to be a cross section of colleges they can't be in the same on it needs to be a colleges and different sizes public private a liberal orange different academic\nUm [noise] uh reputations and so forth and you will find too that cross section a wide variety of financial aid offers\nBut in the competitive situation what you're really trying to do is get the colleges to work you're trying to get them to increase the financial aid package to attract or stay in it and this is what really reduces the cost of the college\nNow last week also mention um another type of a that you could receive and that was merit they stayed\nIn may or may say was not necessarily driven my financial need all of the things that we were talking about with financial aid and general aren't based on financial lean they're based on your resources your ability to pay for college there are there to create an equal playing field and opportunity for everyone\n[noise] you know a lotta times that the parents who are running the perception that the that the war and there was given to them by the university and all the rent and they don't and they don't really understand that you can actually in the guess shaped so let me address this initially by saying that if a financial aid office tells you\nThat their hands are tied you know sometimes I've heard\nThem say something along the lines and the government limits them or something along those lines uh that's just simply not true uh yes there are some limitations to the to the aid that's out there and when the government there's only certain amount that you are going to receive based on the rules and so forth\nBut all universities have private funds that were donated by private people it's up to them to use and how they want it\nIf they want to use it for your child they can do it if they don't want to use it for your child they don't have to but just saying that they're limited by the government it's just garbage so this negotiation process is equally important\nIs the selecting these different colleges ones that have a different treatment and the student you know different resources and stuff for\nThe various things that we've been talking about because the biggest mistake that parents make is that when they were seeing these towards they think it's they're they're they're really the only award they're going to get and what they don't understand is the school doesn't generally offer their best deal initially\nJust wanting the analogy and that we talked about a with a car dealer they're going to give me in the price they think you're going to buy the car\nThey're not gonna give me their best offer initially\nAnd this is the same thing when college it as a business so parents being the first being aware that they can accept or the war and they can reject the award they can actually except part of it they can reject part of it so they might accept\nOr the ... part of it reject alone part of it um your honor no obligation whatsoever to accept the award or you're free to accept it reject it\nOr you can do whatever you want to do you can ... you can accept it completely ... not accepted at all or by accepting and it's actually not a commitment to attend that's another thing parents don't really understand um acceptance is not a commitment for your child to attend the college\nYou can accept an award\nOr continue to negotiate it's up to you but it has nothing to do with whether or not your child is going to actually attend now in general most colleges are going to require you to a student to be admitted for them to get an award anyway um but just being in a minute doesn't necessarily commit you\nTo go to that college in fact in this situation I mention um in in our previous time that that we were talking about need based awards and merit based towards well those two times to the orange or actually administered by different elements of the university\nThe financial aid is administered by the financial aid office obviously but merit awards are actually um awarded by the admissions office so you do generally have to go see the admissions process fill out paperwork\n... um awarded by the missions office\nSo you do generally have to go see the admissions process fill out paperwork to actually be eligible for the award so so the process of you you go through this and actually process you let them know the colleges that you're interested in\nThat initiates the process you will probably have to fill out the mission paperwork and then they're going to send you a reward\nYou can accept it you can reject it you can accept part of it you can reject part of it um but the biggest thing you need to understand is is this is a competitive situation\nFor these universities they these financial aid officers are not going to lose a student and then they would like to have because of money then they may offer you what they feel like that you know take because most parents receive those offers they don't ask for anything else\nBut you have to be careful about that because\n... they're going to a lot of these financial and offices are going to expect you to ask for more sometimes so they're going to give you less say then I think you actually wind up taking 'em sometimes some parents will take it because they don't realize that they can negotiate\nSome ... and they're expecting parents to come back\nAnd ask for more so now I actually love all Seventy eight as well but there's only so much money at these universities and they're going to do one out how they see fit if they want your child\nThis kind of goes back to the ten percent and your child looking attracted to the university or they'll put out the money [noise] but probably the most important thing that are involved in this process is what we call special circumstances [noise]\nSpecial circumstances or situations in West the financial aid office can increase the aid so it's a little bit different from the gas station um you can accept these offers you can go back to them you can let them know that your child has narrowed down the university to a couple of different options\nA one child when colleges made me offered something the other one is not you know whether it be something they're willing to match you can create that competitive situation but\nOften overlook hardly special circumstances and the way the federal federal only the federal government works is it the process of financial aid to standardize you know we talked in previous weeks about the expected family contribution\nThe ability or that you go to these Web sites it's very standardized human put the information is computerized and the outcome is this a expected family contribution this number that you could contribute to college\nNow the government gives the financial aid office is the colleges the ability to increase that\nUnder special circumstances so even though I'm you went through this process you went to the website it said that you're expected family contribution was a number\nAnd that's the number that the government should expect you to contribute to college for your child the financial aid office has the discretion to increase that and by increasing or decreasing man they're going to increase the eight associated with that and they do that and what we call special circumstances\nSpecial circumstances are situations that that the student and the student parent must bring to the attention the ... financial aid officer and they must let them know that they fall into one on the circumstances\nMust bring to the attention the ... financial aid officer and they must let them know that they fall into one on the circumstances and then they shouldn't be considered for special treatment\nAnd let me just run through this the list of the special circumstances some of his mind applying to use some of them may not but it's it's pretty obvious why for these different reasons why you would expect\nA financial aid office to increase the award based on that\nOn one of them is a divorce or or a death of a parent you know at the income in the ass and information that's provided a in the financial a process the faster process um might have changed due to divorce due to the death of a parent\nYou need to make these things and where you need to make the financial officer aware of this\nYou also mine have unusual income\nYou know a lot of people because the income is based on um the you might have an unusually high income in the time period that you put your information into the faster so you might have received a bonus\nSomething along those lines I might have been a one time bonus it might have been unusual among us and it wouldn't necessarily reflect what's your income is going to be a that is something that has a special circumstance that something that you need to\nCommunicate with the financial aid office let them know uh and and maybe show them what your previous year's income is and so forth\nLet them make those adjustments now there are several other ones such as unemployment somebody loses their job medical costs unusually high tuition costs for high school\nUm one that's kind of timely right now at the time on this broadcast and that's a natural disaster area we've got a hurricane going on and a lotta people dealing with that that's another special circumstance\nA alumni or children of alumni is another special circumstance these are all situations that you can go to the financial aid office you can ask them to a decrease your expected family contribution\nWhich would therefore increase your financial inane and increase the packages that are available to you and they can do that they can also make the resources and the colleges available to you\nSo back to this uh objection that I hear quite a bit about people saying their hands are tied\nYou know this is the situation in special circumstances that private funds might come into play the different universities might decide to use some of their own resources to help student but special circumstances have to be communicated to the office\nSo this is a situation when you go in the process you received the orange the offers and so forth you got to pick up the phone you've got to set an appointment with the financial aid office or\nWould be two hundred and fifty five units that would put you know be displaced from that particular site and so we wouldn't want to do is mitigate some of the impacts of justification want to get into talking about what your interpretation is and when I say mitigate those impacts\nWe're going to talk about what that would look like as well um and and we would we would want to propose some type of complementary redevelopment that would allow for us to um you know accomplish the aims of the fair housing act and then also to reduce some of those impacts education and so\nThat's kind of the the the way we want to move the discussion as we are going forward and um\nI like for us to talk a little bit about you know what is the impact on the community overall as I mentioned earlier ... even had started the friends of south town I'm On social media gets a little bit about what what the ah the reasoning is behind start in that group and and what the appeal is to this issue outside of those residents I sell town\nRight so obviously you know you don't have to leave that out of town are handling this our towns actually care about what's happening to our neighbors and so\nThat's the first out and then create an energy\nFor the community can now what's taking place\nAnd having a common place to place information I mean you could go to the grassroots coalition paid and find some information on south town but most of the time people are going to be on social media or some type of media platform and so\nMaybe they may not get the information that they need directly from maybe a housing representative but it's a place that they can go and find out what they need to know when they have to press conference when there's a meeting coming up\nBut it also get the chance for those of us outside of south town to actually care about south town to know what's happening and we had a lady that kind of came in the group and said well you know\nThose of us outside of south town it's actually care about south town to know what's happening and we had a lady that kind of came in the group and said well you know in the eighties I planted a tree\nIt's out of town and I go by every now and then a few times a year just to look at the tree that are planning is our town so she obviously cares about that how that community that they air and many people just don't even know what's happening to those residents and what's happening in our town is indicative of what's happening across the nation and across the city of Birmingham\nMost definitely it is and so we all need to have an opportunity to share information or regular platform that we can go to we can plug into and get information about what's going on there and we understand that you know our neighbors that South town like you said even are experiencing\nA maybe more acutely the impacts of of this economic development of justification but it's something that's impacting us all and I really want us to unpack this term gentrification just thrown around so much and and I know that the majority of this is something that you study closely for multiple perspectives so talk to us a little bit about what gentrification means to you\nYeah so um\nSo ... vacation I always kind of started off I tend to start off with it just declaring it as violent is a violent construct mhm to imagine that to be something else is ripostes to us so we need to start there and then we move into the definition\nIt's old old term um and I got this information actually from Susan I'm\nShe looked it up and she found that gentrification actually dates back to the Roman period of expansion has them into the world and if you know anything about the Roman empire they weren't the most kind folk when they move into other areas of the planet right I'm\nIn the LA displacing people but murdering people along the way gentrification in its current form is an economic construct but it does have a sub military on dynamic which is called hyper policing\nAnd we're seeing that happen in Birmingham although there are folks including politicians who are saying they gentrification is not happening in Birmingham I can provide the package to prove that it is and it has right you might be as one of the major factors in that dynamic by gentrification basically\nThe process of um the gym three the ... century which means well the\n... century does not mean wealthy along with poor people working together hand in hand ... singing kumbaya that's ridiculous it is only for the wealthy right\nOkay and currently is the process of preparing a rebuilding homes and businesses in a blighted areas deteriorating area um such as in most most times and not as an urban neighborhood and it's a company by an influx of middle class or a flu and people\nAnd they will result in the displacement of the poor residents there it will always results in the displacement of the residents there right\nAnd a lot of times without displays so this is something that's happened historically throughout the history of this nation in the city in particular and uh it's really been a situation where poor folks and black folks are just kind of been\nMoved around to the least desirable places home with within within the within the city or within whatever you know construct that is that we're speaking about at that moment\nAnd as these areas began to become more valuable then it's like you get a tap on the shoulder and you know what it's time for you to leave again right right and so what we're saying here with this particular instance with south town is that even if we can understand that we want to find a compromise\nSo we can have you know the ... century can grow the community around you may be we can we can develop this property maybe to a higher or better to the highest best use from a marketing standpoint what happens to that edition\nDid he around UAB we can we can develop this property maybe to a higher uh back to the highest best use from a marketing standpoint what happens to that additional valued has created does any of that value that we have any type of restored a justice of interest at all you know and that's kind of where we want to continue to take the conversation\nYou know joining me today yeah we have even melting and Reverend majority Ruthie was speaking about the south than

break we were speaking a little bit about you know what how do we define education what are the negative impacts of it the history of it you know we traced it all the way back to the Roman empire\nSo you know we definitely give me the information to empower you so that you know exactly how to combat these issues and when you hear these terms thrown around in the media um you need to know exactly what it is that you're dealing with and so in addition to the displacement that occurs with interpretation it also leads to\nYeah um you need to know exactly what it is that you're dealing with and so in addition to the displacement that occurs which interpretation it also leads to I'm just\nForgetting for getting the people that were there your history is raised\nThe cultural identity of that
