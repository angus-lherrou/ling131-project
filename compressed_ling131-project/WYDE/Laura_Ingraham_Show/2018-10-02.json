for this morning and were hanging out this morning we got the Twitter live stream up for those of you are a way you can go check it out at\nJ. underscore Baylor coach to siphon Baylor cook I'm the first thing that pops up lit up Twitter live stream excited to be able to do this because we ever really if we have a couple of things to talk about this morning a little here a little there [noise]\nAnd we're really excited to talk to you today also in the second hour we're going to get into a little bit having to do with Kavanaugh and the continued fall out there for what happened we are going to continue to get into some of that news then we\nGet a little bit further we're going to talk about Kanye West thing that we should abolished the thirteenth amendment and what that means and why Kenya was calling for that and if that makes any sense at all which here's a spoiler alert it doesn't uh\nListen Tanya has become this figure a on the right here recently that everybody has said is this thought leader the stop provoke or and it couldn't be further from the truck truth look ... very very smart when it comes to specific\nThis thought leader this stockbroker and it couldn't be farther from the truck a truth look kinda is very very smart when it comes to specifically having to do with music\nBut you take him anywhere outside of music and not so much especially you take them into political arena\nHe says we should abolished the thirteenth amendment somebody says well what do you mean by that and he's like I'm not going to let the media catch me an ally instead I'm going to go and I'm going to study about this well before you made the claim that we should've polish the amendment having to do with slavery\nDon't you think that it might have been smart to researcher point I think that might have been something you should have done before you came out and said that we should abolished thirteenth amendment and abolish the amendment that\nOutlaw slavery in this country that made it constitutionally ah enable that made our government constitutionally unable to um conduct anything having to do with slavery or indentured servitude so we'll get into that a little bit but before we do I do want to talk about\nThis concept that I came across yesterday because uh\nI uh I went to the TV show last night I Do outspoken where the Joe lock it and we were on their last night we ended up talking about this idea of um the way we divide ourselves and these sub groups that we put ourselves and\nAnd so that's the reason I got the Twitter live stream up today is because I Want to talk about this idea of the way that we divide ourselves and specifically what\nHow how that can be detrimental to us to go check out that's what our live stream if you've ever wondered what I look like this early in the morning you can see me it's not great but hey we're working well what we got Baylor cook the first thing that pops up on all forms of social media but before we get into that I got to go over to the man with the plan Dylan how're you\nDoing this morning I'm doing alright would be a lot better if we had a a an adapter in the studio\nWhat do you mean\nSo a regular headphone Jack doesn't fit into the plug in on this board winning the quarter is track\nOkay all those technical terms are going right over my head I'm just\nA guy that comes in and talked about politics man okay you know the size of the ... just typically on headphones yes that's a\nTen millimeter jak I Believe in what is what it's called\nAnd what is plugged into this board and maybe what is on the headphones and you're currently wearing is known as a a quarter inch jak it's much higher so union in ... in a decade ago in between jacek will sometimes Sunday\nSomeone walked out with whoever had the one in here so I've been having to dig the one out of my truck well God Bless you for doing that we appreciate it because without you we can run the show so thank you so much it's a little bit annoying to\nRun off the speakers around here because I was the sprint out and you run out at me run out of the studios are for those of you that are on the live stream we go the studio goes up there they got doors out there there's Dylan right there this morning but he sprinted out of the studio to go find that a jak this morning for the headphones but we appreciate you doing that\nSo that we could get the show up and going this morning\nYour garden country station superstition one oh one Wu windy\nMm Mm [noise] Mm Mm [noise] Mm\nBlame it on on high shown up in the room when you're black is the\nLast one\nOne was the last one you know\nYou see the ...\n... ...\nMaiming\nUnit here I mean [noise]\n[noise]\nWell come back and in the wake up call ladies and gentlemen Dylan bringing this back in with some knock off Garth Brooks more than I don't know where you find this Wal Mart version of Garth Brooks on YouTube but for those we're on the Twitter live stream we just had Garth\nComing back in like I announced we came back in the five Fifteen we're doing it is what her life and and just try it out something a little different um I liked the pod casting platform I like the live video aspect that has to come I really think you can relate more of the audience if you want to go check that out just type in Baylor cook I'm the first thing that pops up um whereabouts share it to Facebook as well hoping to get that\nOr the audience if you want to go check that out just type in Baylor cook on the first thing that pops up um whereabouts share it to Facebook as well hoping to get that all rigged up Dylan is the man with the plan dealings my producer this morning he's helping me run this first time doing it so don't judge there's\nA little bit of some uh [noise] a little bit of some mistakes a little bit of some weird stuff I don't know but we're going to hop right back into what we were talking about before so\nBefore we were talking about this idea of um of motivation right and and this this motivational idea that life is about relationships in that life isn't just about being tunnel vision towards your goal because I I thought this for a long time and I've preached this for a long time is this idea that life is about being tunnel vision\nAnd but there's there's so much more to life than being tunnel vision you also have to really really really understand that there's this part of life this part of you that has to do\nWith living relation ally and if you're not living relation ally then it may not\n... you may not be using your time as well as you can and we we get this idea that at the end of your life right you're on your deathbed what do you want to look back and see right do you want to look at\nYour life and see a bunch of people in it do you want to look at your life in the bunch of success that's one question right and some people are like oh I Want to look back in my life and see a bunch of success perfectly fine but then after you're done looking back of your life when you're on your death bed when you're looking around you in that room\nYou want a bunch of dollars laying on the floor around you or do you want the people that you spent your life with and spend a lifetime growing that relationship with by\nHer side really it's an honest question what do you want\nBecause that's that's the choice that we have to make that's the choice that were left with it's not this by an area where you can choose one or the other but\nIt really has to do with how you allocate your time how you choose to use your time\nMoving forward and if I can recommend anything it'd be this you gotta find the balance\nAnd everyone's saying well thanks genius that's we we know you've got to find the balance I Can't tell you for your life what the balance is everybody has their own individual balances like for example for some some people are a lot smarter than others right so some people don't have to spend as much time focusing on school and so they can spend more time\nWith family or some people don't have to spend as much time focusing on work so they can spend more time focusing on family but there are some people they really have to go in that our early really have to say that our late to be able to stay on par with the competition or become better\nYou'd have to find that balance that works for you and your life but the important thing is that you gotta find it you really got to find\nAnd so that's pretty much what we have to talk about on that front and that really came to me because I realized after talking to my grandparents I was like wow I have not been dedicating the correct time that I should\nHave to them I haven't been relating to them and talking to them as much as I should that's on me it's not on anybody else or you can't put that on anybody else you know\nEspecially if you're a grandfather who you look up to most of the world says you know we haven't heard from you in a while\n\nYou can't blame that on anybody else and everybody will say oh I was busy always doing that are doing that doesn't matter how really how much of the ten minute phone call going to take out of your day how many times do you spend ten minutes scrolling through social media on your phone\nYou got the time it's just are you willing to use it to\nScrolling through social media on your phone\nYou got the time it's just are you willing to use it to build those relationships in his life is busy I mean I'm not going to deny that you've got a lot to do everybody's got a lot to do regardless of your situation but in this having a lot to do\nYou also really really really than have to have to make sure you allocate time for those relationships\nSo we're going to transition a little bit now we told you are going to talk a little bit about Kanye West and\nAbolishing the first amendment before we do I'm going to drop this out on my Facebook come or hang out with me on my live ... came here we go appreciate all the all tuning in on the live stream right now is the first time we're doing this and again something a little different\nSo what we're talking about with this kind of us in this Thirteen to ... I Want to frame um the conversation so Kanye West came out and Kanye West um for some reason has been\nPut up as this thought leader this um this person who's thinking independently thinking freely and this guy that is for some reason this intellectual socialite and he's just this intellectually stimulating person yadda yadda yadda yadda I don't buy any of it\nI think ... in ... county is a very very good musician he's very talented at what he does in every other facet just not seeing it like I I don't see the intelligence that everybody points to they're like wow look at how smart he is and politics look at how big of a free thinker he is I'm just like ... he looks like Twitter deep\nYou ever heard that phrase when when your when your friends and family are social media deep like when they go copy that quote from Abraham Lincoln and put it up on their Facebook or put it up on their Twitter\nAnd you're sitting there and going okay got anything else for me or not just I'm going to tell you what Abraham Lincoln's on great thanks ... it's it's Twitter deep and that's all I hear with Tanya is Tanya is either Twitter deep he's like you gotta love everybody\nAnd then\nThat's in response to somebody saying how do we fix problem a B C D you gotta love everybody that's great ... but it's like how do we balance the budget you gotta love everybody\nWell yeah but loving everybody doesn't provide dollars and cents you've got to give me a little more than that and that's the thing that can yeah you just can't give you more than that he's just like ... is the definition of surface level\nSurface level rhetoric it doesn't get any deeper than exactly what he's saying and a lot of the times it isn't even informed like it was the other day so Kanye West came out and he said we should abolished the thirteenth man\nNow for those of you don't know what the thirteenth amendment as the thirteenth ... is the amendment to the United States Constitution that outlaws the practice of slavery and indentured servitude\nLet that sink in Tanya west said that we should uh polish the thirteenth amendment does that make any sense to anybody whatsoever\nWhen I first saw this yesterday it was on a video of\nCon you a ... a ... sang it or picture of Carnahan unquote playing I didn't end up in the video for sound yeah I I just kind of washed up play and then it immediately cut to scenes from a Trump rally\nWhere ... some of these people are white men who who are at ... or the rallies some white women were in there as well yeah pushing around or just straight up punching\nAnd who who are at a rally some white women were in there as well yeah pushing around or just straight up punching black men in black women yeah\nAnd then that was that there is like one clip of that and then immediately went to a Nineteen sixties era clip of almost the exact same thing and it went back and forth on several yeah\nAnd and I mean that's the idea that really strikes home with this ... thing that's what a lot of people have been saying both on the left in the right ...\n... you're going to be hard pressed to make a case for me that's gonna make any sense whatsoever if you think we should abolished Thirteen to ... it it's just not going to happen and so when ... comes out and he makes these claims like oh we should abolished the thirteenth amendment will substantiate that and that's exactly what reporters asked him\nThey said okay you're wanting to abolish the amendment to the United States Constitution that guarantees that we will not have slavery in indentured servitude you got to tell me why\nAnd he said I'm not going to be pushed into this by the media are you kidding me if I go out here and make a claim\nOn social media on the radio on whatever and somebody comes up and they say hey why did you say that\nI'm not going to say I'm not going to be bullied into answering this question by the media you said it what do you mean bullied into answering this question you know you're you're the one that proposed this if you make a proposal be able to validate it\nI mean it's the same reason that news stations over central or sensationalize things right same thing that CNN goes to the left of the left left his talking points and just rails and those are the same thing that Fox News goes to the right of the right Israel's on those because they give you is right\nAnd I think it's the same thing with Kanye West he's going to this is being a shock jock he's coming out and he's saying oh ah we should abolish the thirteenth amendment and when the thirteenth amendment is what outlaw slavery in this country everybody's going to be talking about Kanye West a black man thing that we should abolished thirteenth amendment\nBecause everybody's like what\nAre you serious ... and that's what he's wanting because when you hear that you're going to see what's going to happen Kanye West Twitter feed is going to become more popular Kanye West shoes these those shoes and close sweaters with holes in them this is just a little bit of a tangent but\nI don't get that done what do you think about that what is the state of modern fashion where we have sweaters with holes in them and that's what's considered like\nInvoke I can show you a sweater with a hole in it right we've got a good well right now and I'll buy a two dollar sweater and I'll take some scissors to it and then I'll Try to resell it for a thousand dollars and call it an easy sweater\nI read that obsessed with brands we're we're going to buy crappy clothes just because they say something there seems to be no sign of intelligent mind anyway\nI don't know it's it it just it makes absolutely no sense to me but I digress so Tanya was looking for attention Kenya got attention um\nBut\nHere's what you have to boil it down to is you have to take his claim rate it's the same thing with what goes on with politicians it's the same thing with what goes on um with what happened when the Brett Kavanaugh situation you have to take all the noise that surrounding all of it and you have to just push that noise away and you got to look directly at the claim\nWhat do you think of the claim right\nWhat do you think when a politician says we should have free healthcare or we should have free college\nYou got to look at that claim how would that be possible well with a lot of circumstances especially with the college it's not possible but you got to look at what they're proposing because it could be proposing something revolutionary but you've got to look at it and then you've got\nYou know what what happened with Brett Kavanaugh and Dr Christine Blasey Ford she comes out and she makes a claim of sexual assault Democrats grandstand on it Republicans start to say we should listen to her\nBut we don't believe it\nAlready both sides made up their mind and they decided to push their political platform based on it\nWe don't do that push push both of those people cite ignore both of them they're just grandstanding for votes and look at the claim\nIs there any corroboration for Christine force claim no there's no witness testimony to corroborate her claim is there anything to substantiate or claim no there's no physical evidence to substantiate or climb in a court of law and she'd be can Brett Kavanaugh will be convicted based off of that can based off of that allegation\nNo we can't\n... it's that simple and we've ... west Kanye West says we should abolished thirteenth amendment well there are people that say yeah ... is free thinker yeah\nIt's just it it's that simple and with Kanye West Kanye West says we should abolished thirteenth amendment\nWell there are people that say yeah ... is a free thinker yeah is is beacon of hope light yadda yadda yadda okay don't agree with that picture and then\nYou've got people on the left and say oh God and it's been terrible and they're using it to grandstand as well\nAnd it's these as these musicians ... I've seen so many musicians like a lotta del Rey and people like that have used this is a chance and like NO NAME actors you know the buzz feed began reporters that have a check mark by their name just because sometimes they tweet something out that's a little bit you know politically adapting by politically adept that's about as\nDeep as Kanye which surface level but nevertheless\nThey tweet something out and they've been using it to raise the profile but\nGot to take both of those scenarios and push the noise and you've got to look directly at communist claim what is kind of anything\nKanye West of saying we should abolish the fourteenth the thirteenth my apologies the thirteenth amendment\nWhat does that mean\nWe should abolished amendment that outlaw slavery and indentured servitude in this country\nWas we can't have that\nLike I mean honestly ... there there is no claim that you can make to me that could substantiate this\nTo say we should abolish the thirteenth amendment is utterly ignorant but I've held that belief and I've said that about Kanye\nSince he became this political mind quote unquote I've said con yang is ignorant and a lot of facets and it shows a lot this is not me having ... any animals towards ... this is not me not liking his music this is me listening to what the man saying in saying\nThat doesn't make any sense whatsoever\nJust part of it I I Can't change it\nBut it did spur an interesting conversation and that's why I brought it up because yesterday again I Do the television show with Joe lock it right and we do it every a Monday Night I'm going to be back on there tonight so Tuesday six to seven pm central time ... charter charter channel oh it's hard to say charter channel eighty\nOr if you don't have charter you can check it out at J. L. E. N. H. D. dot com again that's J. O. E. N. H. D. dot com and\nWe we talked about this idea\nOf why this is so important because Joe was mad at Khan yet and he said because in I'm not trying to speak for Joe I'm trying to paraphrase what Joe said I'm Joseph ... was in essence\nHe he's a pillar of this black community right he's reached the heights of success heights of stardom the heights of what you can do and so when he speaks he doesn't speak specifically for the black community the black community doesn't feel that way but a lot of people in the black community\nAre seen as believing what ... believes because like you know that that's the successful person in the black community and me and Joe got into this conversation specifically about that community aspect like why should one man\nSpeak for a whole group of people that are just in a group together quote unquote based on their pigmentation right you can't look at me and told me that every black man every white man every Latino man thinks the same\nI mean that that'd be under ignorance\nRaul individuals' and so we got into that discussion and I want to break down that that discussion more when we come back from break again\nDoing it's what our live stream even check it out Baylor cooking all forms of social media trying out something a little new today excited we can go forty minutes strong absolutely love it when we come back we will talk\nSocial media trying out something a little new today excited we know forty minutes strong absolutely love it when we come back we will talk\nAbout this topic a little more live from ... studios Alabama license one eleven twenty there's a wakeup call ladies and gentlemen don't go anywhere you are listening to the wake up call\n... raised in Alabama educated at John Carroll Stamford University you a B and Birmingham School of law you've seen my face on thousands of billboards but did you know that over twenty five thousand of your neighbors have trust to me when they needed help the most\nThat's what I'm thankful for I'm Alexander ...\nA man for the people I Want to be your attorney call me Alabama representations\nMaintenance quality legal services before just going to know what's going on yours [noise] spring\nThe whole family out how to proceed way for the kid the Syrian while but now that she was from a number of great options behind the scenes like guy garage tourist pre rape but a lot more [laughter]\nA race Talladega [noise]\nHey guys forty of 'em before faction stay tradition to the original state inspired apparel company they offer upscale casual clothing including shirts hats outer wear\nTies shores and accessories would subtle stage civil West I'm guessing you probably want to represent our great yell at him or stay real hammer supply company has a great mix of shirts in jacket and even workout clothing with a subtle yellow bird\nThat we all know in la [noise]\nStay tradition can be found at the summit in between lowly Pulitzer and ...\nDo you want to melt fat get toned and had the body you always wanted then you need to check out iron tried fitness through high intensity interval training and nutrition education I even tried to help the trend setting gain muscle\nI ever tried to currently looking for forty local to want to participate in a three six weeks challenge that is guaranteed to get your results with that challenge you get accustomed to plant personal accountability grocery list and so much more as long as you reach your goal wait the challenge is absolutely free contact your closest tried today to find out more\nThose super station is coming to your home town go to one oh one W.

goes without saying hey Megan how are you now taking away the normalization of feeling and the last of the more you think the\nType of behavior we walk 'em domestic foods if I Know I take them off in a certain sense it's a giant up yours to Obama and that's why the left the freaking out over it\nJack Kennedy and LBJ\nA double standard for what\nI Love love does nothing but the most bizarre practices are done by the\nTeacher and we will moons [noise]\nMichael heart is I'm a man of the house [noise]\nThem Michael [noise]\n\n\nPay walking back six minutes past the hour their losses are with us today he's the author of good gone bad guy good gun bad guy too\nAnd I understand that a then is working on his third book which will be called good cabin all bad Feinstein we walk gum and the damned waltz into this edition of the Mike art show how are you more for him\nMichael how are you thanks me on your show\nOr we're just getting dressed and listen to\nA job then you know I'm never going to talk about guns and Second Amendment talked maybe a little bit about more what's going on in California and some reason the legislation that ah Jerry Brown has signed but I've got to get you and I haven't talked about a month or so I got to get your thoughts on his own Kavanaugh thing is this beyond ridiculous now\nYeah and I think you know Christine Ford is really\nIt really is a creation by you know she Diane Frankenstein monster and\nI think what's going to happen as as soon as the Democrats are done with her they're going to throw it to the curb and her her the rest of her life is going to be\nThere's gotta be ruined now I'm not saying this to make you feel sorry for because I think she's for you know full of crap on the whole thing if something did happen to her I don't I don't think it was him\nAnd there's just a lot of inconsistencies so we already know all that stuff so I just don't understand you know how they think that they can go on and ruin people's lives um for for for power and it just it without people recognizing it right\nWhere do you think they do not I mean are they just ... and I'm not talking about the politicians we know what their agenda is but what is it with with the people you know the on the Democratic left that just insist on doubling down\nAnd I'm told by the politicians we know what their agenda but what is it with the people you know when the Democrats that just insist on doubling down with isn't just not paying attention to the max\nThis is the most interesting part to me and I always think about the stuff you know 'cause I I think about this stuff\nAs it relates to the gun conversation anti ... and how they're so locked in to their uh you know to their ideology without any ... you know without any evidence of a reason for being there with with with Democrats and I think we're liberal progressive than general I think it's a mass\nBrainwashing they are they're taught to be scared\nOf scared to death of people on the right and they're also taught to hate people on the right so they would never ever come over to the right that option is gone that ship has sailed through them so they have nowhere else to go\nAnd they've been fed all sorts of propaganda and lives and angry rhetoric and all this stuff and there they believe that they're sitting at the popular table and\nI'm at Eighteen\nThey can't but they can't buy a gun for their own personal protection right it's nonsense is that it's not a it's not it doesn't make any sense um v a domestic violence out domestic violence misdemeanors\nNow I don't I don't know how many things that can qualify under a domestic violence misdemeanor but I Would imagine that it could be very minor things you know let's say someone a husband and wife getting an argument over something and then all of a sudden he finds himself\nI'm a you know with a misdemeanor\nYou know that could that could that little misdemeanor who which may or may not be valid could prevent him for the rest of his life\nFor owning gun ownership so having gun ownership so he's he's treated like a fellow at like a felon with respect to gun rights for a misdemeanor\nI'm In the area of what they're called domestic violence but I'd be very scared about that domestic violence definition\nWell you know when when you look at things like what's going on in the cabin or confirmation and how we seem to be completely redefining the meaning of words you know under the current allegations being leveled against Kavanaugh he in the state of California\nCould be prevented from owning a gun for life if charges were brought against him that first of all the statute of limitations had even run out on but as you point out we're not talking felonies here we're talking misdemeanors and we're talking about you know being ... from owning a weapon\nFor a lifetime and typically those misdemeanors are going to be predicated on somebody that has leveled an allegation or an accusation under duress and in a very emotional state it could even go as far as being unproven\n... right exactly that may or may not even be valid so ... so that's just that's just wrong that's wrong you don't we we can't treat people like that and\nYou know I just uh VCA oh in in in New York we have a red flag laws they're trying to pass and um which would which would give or any uh school faculty are certified school faculty the right to accuse someone of being a danger to society [noise]\nUh and then their guns will be taken away now\nAh and then they have a three days to get a lawyer to defend themselves to prove their innocence which is which is again wrong but the certified school faculty\nThat are allowed to to bring on these accusations are\nAnyone from the principal all the way down to a a a student teacher or an assistant teacher or a substitute teacher anyone who certified and that certification goes all the way down to the bottom of lines so now we're in New York what they're trying to do is get give a a a a student teacher the right to tell 'em\nSay that little Johnny is a dangerous so his father's gun should be taken out of the home\nThis is this violates all due process and and this is one of many of these very similar\nRed flag laws that are going on in a lot of different states across the country\nYeah you're exactly right and it it's it's\nAny of these very similar red flag laws that are going on in a lot of different states across the country\nYeah you're exactly right and it it's it's it's such it's eating not with desperation is not\n[noise] yeah ... ... and here's the thing that we talked about the left wing of voters they've been taught\nTo believe that this Kavanaugh ... say eight judge Kavanaugh would would uh be a danger to the roe versus what versus Wade but but it's not true they're more worried about him supporting the second amendment because he is a precedence\nHe would be a precedence judge in other words he he and he said it he would support roe versus Wade because there's precedent there well that also means that he would support Heller or McDonald which are two very important Second Amendment cases and I think the left\nIs that the Democrats in Congress are more scared of him\nSupporting precedents like hell or versus D.C\nThan they are scared of him violating roe versus Wade did that makes sense yeah\nYeah no it absolutely did well it it it just it just goes to show the the ridiculous nature um\nYou know where they're coming down on having all you know the or many of the Democrats out there the ... of the world Cory Booker et cetera you know they're so desperate to California high the the rest of the nation and they're using the exact same type of tactics that are oftentimes misunderstood\nAnd like in the case or brown Simon is this piece of legislation is a Senate bill eleven hundred in the law I don't think a lot of people realize exactly how far that potentially goes in his name was that the aspect of the discussion for just a moment\nYou know taken a look out legal dictionary dot com\nOr the the terminology a misdemeanor a misdemeanor include anything that is a petty theft disturbing the peace simple assault and battery drunk driving\nOr without injury drunkenness in public traffic violations public nuisance is\nAnd some ... some other lesser crimes as well so now in California if you are convicted of drunk driving and you can have your gun rights stripped away from you or your entire lifetime and that just goes to show you the amazing extremes\nThat the left is willing to go to to accomplish whatever misguided goals that they've got\nAnd the strategy isn't related to gun rights ownership and carrying it cetera is the exact same perform up that they are over lane when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh accusation accusation accusation and the maximum amount of punishment for the minimal amount of activity\nWhen it comes to let me let me add this when it comes to American citizens when it comes to people who aren't supposed to be here in the first place well they they get a completely different different set of rules so you're absolutely right everything is said there and [noise] I just I just think that\nUm I I have you know I'm a\nOptimist and I believe that people\nListening to this radio show people listening to radio shows like this across the country or watching TV\nHave a sense of logic and common sense and the majority of people in this country will a pushback against all this stuff I Know I'm Out there fighting the best I can on the second amendment stuff I Know you're out there um you know doing doing your part in a hell of a job you're doing and\nI can on the second amendment stuff I Know you're out there um you know doing doing your part in a hell of a job you're doing and they're so we're not the only two\nThere are other people out there who are fighting for traditional American values the rights of American citizens\nAnd just just the good things in life and we recognize the evil and the sinister behavior that comes from the left and um I think the majority of people in this country would agree with with with me\nNo I I I think you're going with that because I think there's enough people out there that don't realize\nThat as we allow these things the moment as we allow them to become common place that it doesn't just change things for those of us that for example or gun owners or desires to own a weapon for protection but it also has a negative impact on those that are voting for him because of a sudden it's incumbent upon us on the right to protect the kids that are on the left\nAnd people just can't seem to get their heads around the fact that once these things are made in the precedent they don't ever have an impact them how many Democrats you think you're going to come out screaming bloody murder that they've had their gun rights the right to protect their own family stripped away from them because they went to the Christmas Party and had one glass of wine too many\nYeah and when you say precedents and gives a great point because I think that the reason they don't want Kavanaugh is because they want somebody who will um who would\nWho would be more likely to overturn precedents creating new precedents with respect to\nGun laws if they know that he won't he's gonna he's gonna defend the precedents that's already been created um but the problem is they're they're ... believe it or not there are a lot of Democrats gun owners out there and\nThey um they don't necessarily agree with their party on on the second amendment or issues so I think that's what the Democrats in Congress are most scared of\nThey're they're not only fighting against um ... you know traditional American values are fighting against some people that are potential voters\nFor them as well because hey look you know it just because you're a Democrat doesn't mean you don't want a gun to protect yourself I mean they're not all liberal progressive radical Democrats there are some Democrats who actually do own guns and I'm\nProbably have a lot of values that I disagree with but um they're the the Democrats in Congress are fighting against them as well\nNo you're exactly right All right Dan tell us a little bit more about the book because we're getting very tight on time here but would you tell us about what's in a good guy on as well as on where we can pick up a copy of it\nGood gun bad guy talks about all the strategies and tactics and propaganda and all the all the evil sinister things that the that the left wing anti gun owners do to create a fake narrative about guns and scare people I'm\nAs an associate justice on the Supreme Court if so which is not a conversation about what information you need to assist you in making your decision and I look forward to that conversation\nSo in other words Grassley pointed out if you are asking for the information you must still be on the fence but yeah after twenty four hours after the nomination announcement uber denouncing capital so which is\nWhy couldn't have been like this during the committee\nI think they were trying to play fair I think that was the original intent\nYou can't play fair with evil you know you can't you cannot no you cannot\nThis is an interesting quote and I'm going to read it to you\nOver the\nLast many many years many philosophers have spoken about the sometimes folly of taking a violent position violence does not always get a defined as bloodshed but one where you're steadfast where you're in earnest where you're aggressive in Europe positions\nWhat are the most outspoken proponents of non violent social change\nAnd I'm not referring to Martin Luther king was Mahatma Gandhi\nGundy was very anti violent\nHe actually was quoted as saying it is better to be violent if there is violence in our hearts\nBut he actually was quoted as saying it is better to be violent if there is violence in our hearts than to put on the cloak of non violence to cover our impotence\n\nVery strong words and I think a lot of Republicans are waking up to the wisdom of those words\nThat if you're going to respond in a harsh manner respond that way but if you're not able to respond that way you are able to enter flake exactly right\n\nIt is time and it's time to make the stand and that stand needs to happen to day\nNow in this case I Am referring to the vote\nOn judge Kavanaugh\nBut it speaks volumes to the views of many people including this commentator\nThat enough is enough\nAnd then it is time do we stand our ground but our foot down satire aside which can be effective and see this for exactly what it is what it has become and what the Democrats are hoping it will morph into\n\nDan didn't have an opportunity to get into the debate about roe versus Wade which is where you know for the Democrats what their what their postulate\nHim is that the cabin all confirmation rail will be an attack on women's health issues\nThey are so divorced\nFrom the reality of women's issues that even the idiots over Saturday Night live don't understand the relationship between Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sandra Day O'Connor\nAnd it was Reagan that broke the glass ceiling with Sandra Day not to be confused with Sandra Day\nNever mind but the point still remains the same because if this strategy is employed against Kavanaugh successfully and there's another nominee it will be employed again\nAnd we'll be going through the same thing because of the end of the day this was all about stolen out to the red terms and beyond for that matter because of the Democrats do not hold or regain the house and or the Senate there will be a whole other bevy of accusations\nAnd then those accusations won't be fault against Republican senators are currently seated\nThen we'll be talking about mass impeachments\nIt is time to go gundy here as opposed to donning the cloak\nOf non violence to cover our own if attendance\n\nNow you can think of the word potential in this context as\nBeing similar to the word feckless on steroids or\nOr I guess we can take it to an extreme and channel Jim for Marshall County and talk about being man\nBecause enough is in fact enough McConnell\nHas threatened to call for a vote as early as later today the FBI has announced that should wrap up its investigation today\nFour years later today the FBI has announced that should wrap up its investigation today every single person who have been mentioned as a legitimate potential witness has been interviewed the mark\nJudge interview concluded last evening and it is time for this vote up or down to take place\nEven if it's a down vote even if we run that risk\nWe are at least standing our ground and telling those that are in opposition to us that we will not be told\nWhen we are going to vote on a nominate you'd do not have the right as a politician to change the rules mid game\nNow in the Senate and the house of representatives both of those bodies do have the right to change the way they conduct their business they they set their own rules\n\nBut they cannot set the rules for the process under which the rest of us reside only the rules under which they make their own determinations\n\nLast night I was watching the uh the Eighteenth the movie ... Liam Neeson\nLove that movie ... shoot 'em up\nThere is a scene where one of the investigators for the army has a person in custody that supposedly is holding onto these plates that the treasury uses for the printing of money\nThere are CIA operatives that enter the interrogation room and they are going to take this prisoner into custody\nMuch to the chagrin of the army investigators one of the investigators looks at one of the CIA operatives\nAnd says you can't do this we have rules to which the CIA operative response we at the CIA also have rules ours are just much cooler than yours\nAnd away they wet\nIt's time for our rules to be cooler than the other side by many up and making this vote happen as soon as humanly possible allowing the chips fall where ever they may so that we know in the future how to respond in a very non impotent matter we'll be right back\nIt's not right versus left it's us versus them the Michael hurt show\nThey're seeing here glass of water oh you don't drink tap water too much of a chemical taste for you you couldn't what you believe in it but you don't drink it because of that growth Lorraine taste in my writing that bad taste it's caused by a lot more than just scoring\nWhen people jumped prescription drugs down the toilet when pesticides in a hormone deep into groundwater all of these works to make that bad taste you hate so much that you can keep your water is said and chemical free with the Hague water purification\nSystems systems aren't patent customize self cleaning whole house multi stage water filtration systems and all of that\nTo say hey existence or the most effective water filtration you can get giving you clean and healthy water to come in the event and most importantly to dream and it can cost as little as what you may already be spending in bottled water to start getting clean how the water for your guests\nAnd they ... and most importantly to drink and it can cost as little as what you may already be spending in bottled water to start getting clean how the water for your family called that led to a five three seven nine nine four seven eight thirty seven nine nine four seven healthy water starts with hey W Whitey\nWelcomes due to the common October fest October third\nThrough the six join them for live music authentic German cuisine arts and crafts vendors the classic car show in so much more a special live performance by American Idol Brandon now there will be on friday October fifth\nAt the comments that tall come celebrate the German heritage at Komen Alabama and see the crowning at twenty eight teams miss October fest for more information is it common October fest dot com\nThose super station is coming to your home to go to one oh one W.

is two thousand six confirmation hearings here's one more\nFrom a speech judge Kavanaugh gave in twenty Fifteen first and most obviously a judge cannot be a political parties and\nI think most Americans would agree with that I certainly do\nA Lone Star in our consideration of judicial can confirmations should be whether or not many is independent and within the ideological mainstream the judge Kavanaugh we saw last Thursday did not meet the standards laid out in his past statements\nHis prepared statement to the committee prepare\nWagon Alexander or not talking about Christine ...\nUS

person must sweat Nick\nWho's been avoided a bone dumpster foreign portrayed those as a revenge on behalf\nWell I Would agree with that frankly judge Kavanaugh's testimony was better suited for Fox

Starr Bush Gore\nAll the myriad controversies of the Bush era [noise] it would be one thing if judge Kavanaugh discarded as partisan feelings once he donned the black robes of a journalist unfortunately he's been on the bench for many years\nAnd to Thursday's hearing reveal that his fittest bitter partisan resentments still lurk rights not ...\nHis partisan views how many times that we heard that Brett Kavanaugh if confirmed would sway the court to the right and that is true by the white\nBut what does that imply does\nNot apply that there are jurors that mean to the left\nOne would think ... like a Ruthie for example ... okay if that's the case if they're concerned about Kavanaugh leaning to the right and I'm doing the current makeup of the court than having jurors that have\nPartisan views would be the norm would it not\nYou would think and him saying that they should have gone to this confirmation hearing with no partisan views whatsoever that would imply the senators as well and the committee who made it partisan from day one\nYes now let's take this er into a mathematical spectrum shall we are we're using comic or a no okay where'd you as a real real Matt okay why they're nine justices\nIn case there's four ... four four and one to break\nDependent on law not precedent right so if there's nine justices and not eight does that not also imply that there's an aspect of partisan ism as it relates to the court otherwise you'd have an even number\n\nYou would think I mean everything he just said is a load of Schumer\nYes and then there's that\n\nThat is a load of Schumer\nYes and then there's that\nAnd then he's he's challenging Brett Kavanaugh for reading a written statement that Jody ... said just yesterday would not be admissible in court when Christine Ford did it\nI mean how low IQ do you have to be to not be able to see through this and there by the way\nThe lowering of wars real temperate can almost to the point of a apology and despair\nHere's the thing she had over a week over two weeks over three months to write her statement and remember her story with the help of her lawyer well his was written the night prior in a bottle of what she said\nWrite it on top of that\nHe just read the allegation that the timeframe of the FBI\nInvestigation was mandated by the White House the White House gave him how long\nA week\n\nAnd as as desperation becomes more vibrant and palpable the accusations continue to accelerate an increase in their severity all that does is for people such as myself and a lot of you and James and others\nTo double down on our belief that it is a witch hunt\n\nNow McConnell wants to call for the vote because I think he believes he's got the votes\nBut Schumer running around telling us that that they the White House just putting the ... Bosch or an investigation they themselves called for an investigation that from their perspective still has four days to spend\n\nAt this stage of the investigation the FBI is gone all red shirt if they decide to play their hand that's on them the White House can't prevent that from happening\n\nI mean ... and for as feckless as we can sometimes scream that Jeff Sessions is\nThe FBI falls under the purview of the department of justice\n\nIf Trump is not willing to run Jeff Sessions off until at least them in terms of its I personally think I'll go then he's certainly not going to double down on an agency that Sessions is responsible for\n\nI mean it's it's the the hyperbole is maddening\n\nAnd if the Democrats thought they had a legitimate case they be screaming at the top of their lungs let's get this done but they know they don't and the goofy or it gets the more parent it becomes\nAnd I'll tell you something else that concerns me\nNobody wants to back even the tiniest of kittens\nInto a corner\nThe Democrats are at a corner and they painted themselves into that corner\n\nAnd they are coming out with their claws extended\n\nAnd they are absolutely gaining ground whatsoever the only thing they had in their arsenal was Jeff Flake\n\nAnd Schumer is going to come out today he must know that flight has been say she ate it or is it the very least on the fence or an unknown or is not willing to admit where he's going to vote\nSo ask yourself these questions what are they so afraid of\nI mean I Know they were afraid of Brett Kavanaugh another friend of Donald Trump but what they're afraid of is they can't they can't stop this confirmation the only thing they can do is pause it end or postpone it\nDonald Trump but what they're afraid of is they can't they can't stop this confirmation the only thing they can do is pause it and or postpone it\n\nAnd they keep appealing and appealing and appealing and appealing with the most outlandish ... now we've gone from a beer drinking guy that that you know might have touched a woman at a party thirty five years ago to a guy that's a serial gang rapist\nYet there's no evidence of that whatsoever not a single\nCorroborating witness that the accuser\nHas adamantly stated would defend her accusations and yet they don't\n\nHow long do we allow this to go on what does this do to the judicial system\n\nClarence Thomas go to the high tech lynching alright I get that literally the horrors word harkens back to the civil rights days\n\nHow many people on the left particularly our inner cities within the African American community scream at the top of their lungs All right how about black lives matter that the judicial system is weighed against them\nThat a lot of blacks cannot afford the benefit of legal counsel\nOr that they're underrepresented in courts of law or they can't get a fair trial the ... the black community is the one community that she'll be screaming the loudest about this\nBecause the very thing that they have accused people will do into them for the last several decades is being done again right before they're very eyes black or white blue greener gray it doesn't matter\n\nIf the left is going to come out and say that the judicial process is broken\n\nVisa be false witness accusations how many black men have been incarcerated over the years for murders are rapes or burglaries because they were black\nTeenage boys were lynched you're talking about Scott's borough and we can keep that up all day long\nHow many young black men were hung from trees in the deep south over the accusations\nOf a crime perpetrated very frequently all too frequently against a woman where she is the one that is level the accusations but there was no one there or than just stand steadfast in their defense if I was a black person this crap would scare the living hell outta me\nBecause it's exactly what they've talked about exactly what they have complained about\n\nAnd now it's being unemployed against somebody else right and they're very line of sight\n\nWhen the truth ceases to matter when facts and evidence\nCeased to have any credibility or wait it is time to put a fork in the experiment of democracy or written representative republic or liberty or freedom or is that pursuit of happiness it dies on that doorstep\n\nWe are fighting for the future of this country and the ...\nOr is that\nWe are fighting for the future of this country and the judicial process and due process for all\n\nClarence Thomas warned about this he was absolutely correct and here we are these decades wider and it's repeated itself again right before our very eyes and too many people\nAre a pitch you're waiting to this nonsense without realizing that this will be the new standard in the judicial system moving forward in this country\nAnd that from my perspective and it should be yours is the greatest expression of oppression we've seen in this nation's

said it's blocking Scott ...\nOh I Will tell us about it about it a satellite posted a video showing a house that\nBlocks from Ford skill where Chris ... looks quite a lot like Kavanaugh and has a half staircase in his house to get a picture of the inside the house and everything\nAnd you can still look up one that says Kavanaugh look a lot the guy's name is Chris Garrett at Facebook blocked it but I did ... rate because the one that said Kevin I'll look a lot and also to the grocery store that poured named\nUh that particular grocery store was not a bill into Nineteen eighty six\nNow I have heard that multiple times Samantha and some of our other ... researchers have set\nThat information to us and and the big day yesterday looked at some of the court or not court documents but a city hall documents I guess you would say local government documents saying that about the\nBut why here's my thing I have seen Paula this stuff about the look alike and the guy looks close\nAnd if you if you've been able to listen everyday I told the story of one of a couple of my friends where one got in trouble and was charged with some things and and it was I think it might have been solved actually\nSo they went through this whole had to go to trial spin untold amounts of money every body pointed out the guilt\nReally so they went through this whole had to go to trial spin untold amounts of money every body pointed out the guilty party\nAnd then the guilty party ended up being another one of my friends who looked very similar to the first one and that just shows how some of these kids some of these things can can actually happen but why why why is Daily Caller and even Breitbart\nAren't running with these stories about safe way I've been searching for it\nBecause it's exculpatory so I mean they're obstructing justice by hiding evidence\nThat makes him look good and makes her look bad like her horrific pictures that were all over the Internet before they scrub them and ah her her annual all the crap listed in her annual about how they faked blacking out so they did not the things they did the next day\nThat's actually written in her annual\n... that is that some of the stuff that I saw I tell you the thing that I thought was\nOh sorry go\nAhead no I Would just say we are the things that I thought it was interesting in the annual stuff that I looked at was how many things were printed with text you know what I'm saying it was like part of the book\nRight exactly and it was damning\nYes and and I thought wow why are people manage store your books we didn't get to put that goes to\nShe's she's on site man for associate as personality disorder and she was a raging\nAlcoholic I mean how is her evidence credible and plus her father and grandfather worked for the CIA or the FBI and she works at another spill training people on Wall street level like what the hell this is obviously a complete set a\nWell I'm hoping that those things continue to go out we read a statement that I was forwarded yesterday ... if you remember that had some of those allegations about CIA connections I've I have run down some of the stuff with a look alike I have not seen the one about the house I knew what was the other look alikes name again\nChris Garrett Chris Garrett\nRight well we're getting the information out there and we're we're ... shows go buy some ... from ... to what you're going to go back\n[laughter] she looks a lot they started a couple of years later but ah she should have to take another lie detector test from an FBI agent that's not obviously crooked because who knows what she wrote on a piece of paper then he asked car you're written statements correct ... they can just say\nWell blah blah I mean we don't know that she said Kevin ... attack in the state that she gets a lot of tech to test out\nYou've got at baseball appreciate you all very good stuff interesting and we're we're trying to hunt it down it it I Do find it interesting the federalist has an article this week that my wife didn't really think it was a huge huge deal because you know as I say the show never ends here\nBut\nWe're she has she was part of a study they did a report own hypnosis and being able to deal with traumatic events in in ah fabricating you're creating situations in the mind that means nothing\nBut\nThe lady can't be both like we talk about somebody thinks he cannot be this brilliant researcher P. H. D. and then be able to say I don't know I don't remember do not forget in the testimony when asked about her law detector test\nI don't remember do not forget in the testimony when asked about her not at that group that\nShe could not remember if she did that on the day she buried her grandmother\nOr the next day now look if I just buried my grandmother\nI just wanted to Dave funeral and you're like you got to take a day to day and I'm like I just left the funeral\nGo be a funeral if you eat all those by his name was good that was the last one the last ... you just do the Bagian I might have to talk to somebody like during this Michael big David\n... famous Amos cookies I'm On Jerry welcome to the program\nMore Scott how are you doing I'm doing great how are you I'm just on top shelf today\nAh you know why we just keep a happy face were happy warriors we're very happy ...\nOf all gotta do to fight back I guess that's where he's just got a brand new but uh you know if you step back and take a look at just exactly what's going on what the Democrats are trying to to me that it might not ever retain control the house or the Senate and\nThe last bastion of hope that I have is to try to get control of the Supreme Court that's correct and we'll try to do this by producing this gas good people they try to pull that out over our eyes are\nThe people of this country that we didn't get what they want and a judge if we see now if there is it is like a seat to kill and that's been on this planet they tried to pull over ... thunderous tests trying\nTo get their way and you just said that this is all a ploy this that one with every election that they come up to ...\nThis is a new battle between two people\nAll the time you're right and they try to do with this test they do I don't buy any of her story at all or nothing I don't even know what I Try to\nDo just that she hasn't been trying to say it that way too little already I Will try to pull the wool over the American people to get\nTheir aside in favor of this state or is that gets checked the judge or it's just sick and or or they used to you both do these battles will be over and a little bit of what the good lord at that time and that\nThat's something that I really look forward to I'm tired of the stupid and from the shift is going on\nAnd that's what I discovered is that what he was always there was a bad look good and evil going on is going to be that way you thought fair\nNo you're right Jared Diamond we call buddy ... you'll learn it she was a ... must go to coral coral welcome to the program by people with me\nScott what's a brother\nTalk there's there's the flight just drives me insane I'm gonna take these calls an order of us go Joe welcome to the program thank you for listening\nBut I just want to relate a story you got all religions Kevin ... solar okay well that was in\nCollege I had a friend that was I was a better look so it was on campus and he got engaged to this girl that was pretty but not as pretty girl with the ... ... ... ...\nHe got worried about it actually got engaged and started telling us I'll just do was settled down so broken off my last fall short\nIt really upset so badly that she told all of those in a sorority and all that or\nHe's raising it was a guy by the late ... or ... I Believe in what all over campus I bought a quick call it a real mess the law and just because somebody says something about someone like a traitor psyche my brakes over ...\nYou got a job buddy research going on your break that's the way you do it may have people listen to this program do break and call we need a special calling them that says owned bright color so we get to where they have to go back and pay the bills I'm impressed by that nobody welcome to the program thank you for listening\nOr an hour to route where I Know a crime is much back to the garage now is I'm not\nYou know to route where I Know a crime as much as it's back to the garage now but um [noise] is um not Trump trade deal Congress has to approve it they screw it up and they put a poison pill want it can they change it\nI think I think not only that they're only role is whether or not to um [noise] approve it or not I do not believe they get to start monkeying with the details so I think uh I think the deal is probably safe\nOr I don't think you would ever get through a treaty where\nThe Senate had to\n[noise] um\nActually make amendments too and I could be wrong because I'm not I've never had to be a part of voting on a treaty but I Believe it's up or down in the Senate must keep on going Bob welcome to the program\nHello\nHey Bob cat was going on I heard your show friday night where well well\nThank you wait which we try our best that day was amazing he is long [laughter] or like the gremlin you know [laughter] he's got to keep in bed I keep hearing that what's going on now they're saying that that that\nIn in the back of my mind\nDon't understand you know Washington is ... ... yeah every thing is like why haven't they leak the name of the\nAll these congressmen and senators that we've paid off their sexual misconduct the hundreds of Seventeen million dollars that date we spent by asking somebody league that list\nRight here here's my theory by\nSome fault someplace that nobody can get it\nMy guess is is our ears out is the people\nWho leak\nAre the same kind of people who don't want that information to come out the people who are honest\nAnd do leak would not lead even that kind of information because they believe it's wrong to leak it because it's been um classified as a certain way and it would be wrong for them to do so so what you've got is the bad guys league what they won't delete\nThe good guys do leak\nAnd won't leak what we probably deserve to know so we don't have an Adam Schiff that'll give us what we need to know does that make sense\nWell it makes sense but I I think we ought to have one guy up there that sees how much what how much this would do in this fight with ... somebody up there it's a Republican it understands that dirty politics and goes oh well we can play this game to\nWell I just don't understand why we haven't had somebody that\nI agree I Wonder if the\nPresident whether the president might not good\nHe might not have control since there'll be a legislative branch confidential memo but I agree I Would have thought by now someone would have said here's all the people that we settled cases for\nI don't have to know who the victims are but I Do think it would be interesting to know who the victims are if there's a slush fund there how do we even know that the ... was a huge just to pay pay\nGirlfriends or significant others or whatever hey look I got away and gets you fifty\nBucks let's um it doesn't even have to be a confrontational pay off\nYeah I got away and gets you fifty thousand bucks let's um it doesn't even have to be a confrontational pay off it could be a an agreed to pay off\nYeah I mean but it seems to me that it's our tax dollars at least is\nYou you would think but that held another example of things that the government decides that we don't need to know and but we know everything about Brett Kavanaugh\nOh yeah what ... did you happen to I I was so happy to listen to our president yesterday what the Rose Garden speech\nNow did you did you actually speeds Bob or did you like him get known the press\n... votes that was the best one I still J. lo and that's what\nWhen

I have not found that anywhere\nI Will keep looking you know that some ... stuff that is we will keep looking for that let's go to the phones and welcome to the program\nYeah I got a question for you okay there's\nA song that apparently the Alabama marching bands play anymore because of two added lyrics and I think I think vaguely big diagnose a title but I think it's called big sea land delight I think\nNow a dictator and a lot was played by Ole Miss no no no you're right you're right Dixie land all I was in Alabama Song by the group Alabama country music group Alabama and I don't know what the the offensive language was once the offensive language that the university got all whining about\nAnd then the bears the moment to me as an ...\nI I don't know but I they probably they won't play it anymore so I I'm just curious about what that objection with the I ... says I don't know what they're objecting to but\nI I think I think it was not out on it\nI don't think it was things that it actually says in the song I think it was the fans were students had added some words to say that a ... a certain time and so it might have been longer or something\nI'd heard a an added to hold there so I don't I don't write but anyway I I don't know the nature of all that uh but anyway as far as the land shark Ole Miss mascot\nI the only land shark I have any recollection of it was a from a comedy routine on Saturday Night live in the first year of Saturday Night live which are probably too young to remember performed by Chevy Chase it was a comedy routine ...\nAlways come to the door they say candy gram and they'd open up their own it'd be a land ... argument if the person is supposed to be funny [laughter] and I think we got it sounds kinda funny\nWas fighting for the first few times that again it down and out All right anyway anyway but in fact you might have had them under the influence of certain\nUh things medicinal yes\nThere are things got funnier than we're finding when all that stuff\nAnyway ah I think they caught Iraqi Iraqi in some circles [laughter] anyway the but as far as the ah illness mascot the the the thing that they're wearing on their heads it looks more like a\nA blue ... a comic comedic squid than it has anything to do with a shark because I I don't get it I can understand maybe Mississippi bears I imagine they have a few bears in the in the woods right every but I I really can't uh\nI don't know what the weather yet last strike I've kind of ... and I\n... it was from ... ... it was from an accident that one of their players made in the defense was they started calling and calling themselves the land sharks and one of the players who I think may have passed away you know put his hand up on his helmet and like a shark and\nBut it's just it's just you know I just don't understand it may be they understand it may be an ... helped me understand that\nI personally believe it was just hey look we got to get rid of this rebel mascot and we went from the rebel bearing the mayor didn't really catch Jones so we've got this story with land so let's do the ... kind of thing so I Would probably have been two years they change it again\nWhy what other quake that may have gave us a marijuana but I don't know where it's written that he gave it to a surreal it up and smoking\nAnd he gave it to is to make roads so we can make
