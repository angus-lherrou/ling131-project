about what we were intending to talk about yesterday but couldn't get into it because you know we turned into hippies and started talking about the validity of monogamy in a modern society in\nWhich I might just people that were in the sixties and hit refer to LSD and then after that we're like yeah monogamy it's a failed guns or snow we had a good discussion on that yesterday\nWe're going to talk

Power is just it's a better job security better job security\nAnd I know I mean I was in power has always been something interesting to me because they seemingly have what seems like a monopolistic hold on the market and I'm usually out of your Hillary huh exactly at the utility so there's not there's not really that claim from monopoly there but they are the only entity\nIn the state right and so there's not much competition there so they can pretty much set the rate which set their rates which is why I use um the monopoly example but I uh\nI they do seem like a very well run company I'm at the yellow hammer event on the other day I met some of the Alabama Power executives and they seem like very good people to know exactly what they're doing and it's a very uh it ... it appears to be

of hate the specifically fueled after we've had the male bombings synagogue shooting and much more over the past couple of days and over the past couple of months in the past couple of years we see rhetoric intensify and we've seen people come out and say you know\nThis is the fault of politician a good thing something bad oh this was the ... this is the fault of party a is saying something bad and we've really gotten to know conclusion I don't think that rhetoric helps I don't think we've gotten to any conclusion I think what that does is that just separates us more than anything\nAnd we are in a state right now where we can decide whether we're going to continue to condone that rhetoric or ... and it will lead lead it lead to what inevitably is going to come with it or if we're going to step back and say no that's that's not how this works so\nYou know there's always the times where they say you're in the middle of history right now\nThat back and say no that's that's not how this works so\nYou know there's always these times where they say you're in the middle of history right now\nAnd you have the chance to change the course of history forever depending upon how you choose to act we are at a time right now we're polarity in American politics across the board is hitting an all time high\nI mean you see it it's people no longer wanting talked about the issues is people no longer wanting to work together to come to a rational solution it's people going to the opposite sides of the boxing ring I always use that analogy but they go to the opposite sides of a boxing ring and they swing in each other from opposite sides\nThat's what American politics has turned into and right now you're in the middle of history because I'm not just talking about politicians I'm Talking about most of the people on the right and most of the people on the left\nWe're in the middle of history at this point and we have the chance to change it we\nHave the chance to say we're done with this type of rhetoric we're done with this blaming people were done with a coming out and saying just like a CNN commentator did which will play that audio actually have that on your right now let's go to the CNN or radical out or that or a allegedly President Trump radicalized more people than ISIS\nAccording to this a commentator so let's go to Julie off a Julia lost my apologies a correspondent for GQ magazine\nAnd also um ... a somebody who talks frequently on CNN and she was speaking on the other day and she said this specifically this is the type\nOf rhetoric I'm Talking about that we can't allow to condone because not only is it factually inaccurate but also listen to the message it portrays\nI ... I think you know the fact that at one of the things that ... really launched his presidential run on is talking about Islamic radical radicalization and\nThis president has radicalized so many more people than I ever did I mean the way he talks the waste is that just it\nIt's the way the way they say ah allows the way he went on to the\nSo she goes on to say the way he links and not that these people he's basically condoning the behavior blah blah blah and then the male correspondent who I Believe is a Republican steps in and says that's entirely unconscionable that you say that which I agree I Believe it's unconscionable to say that the president of the United states has radicalized more people than ISIS\nWe actually talked about this on the television show that I Do last night\nAnd I don't think the president has done anything close to radicalizing anybody not you can make the stance that when groups come out\nRight white nationalist groups neo Nazi groups quite literally\nNot mean making a scene in ... talking point quite literally people that I'm self proclaimed themselves as neo Nazis when they come out in support of the president and he doesn't condone that are ... and he doesn't I'm not I'm Sorry not condoned he doesn't step out and say something against that behavior\nThen it almost appears as if he's condoning it because he doesn't come out strongly against it or Abraham Lincoln said it best and this is a paraphrase he said those who are those who are silent when they should speak make cowards out of men\nSo it seems that he is being silent in an instance where he should speak but that doesn't mean he's radicalizing people by any stretch of the imagination is he not coming out and saying anything against\nGroups that we can all agree across the board are bad and bigoted yeah he's not coming out and saying things against certain groups but neither of people on the left they're not coming out and saying anything about the radicalization of black lives matter\nThe board are bad and bigoted yeah he's not coming out and saying things against certain groups but neither are people on the left\nThey're not coming out and saying anything about the radicalization of black lives matter they're not coming out and saying anything about the radicalization of antifa\nOr they're not coming out and saying anything I mean this is across the board these politicians are just pandering to exactly what you want to hear and they're not wanting to forsake any vote even at the vote comes from the darkest most bigoted places in society\nAnd that's the point we've reached we're we're going to allow our rhetoric to escalate and then be so passive but we don't condone that we don't come out and immediately say this is wrong so did Donald Trump come out and say that what happened in the synagogue shooting was an unspeakable act of evil yes he did\nBut in that same swoop troop did\nDuring his campaign he failed to come out and say that these neo Nazi groups don't represent him as they were claiming to he did that as well\nSo it makes you think where's this rhetoric taking us not saying that Donald Trump's rhetoric is responsible for what happened not saying that at all I'm saying when we fail to call out bigotry and hatred where we see it it's a very slippery slippery slope on both sides\nAnd when we allow for that rhetoric to happen it's a very very slippery slope on both sides when we come back we're going to show you an example of good rhetoric [noise]\nWe're gonna show you an example of again the Jewish doctor who came out when asked is it your job to care for that man\nNo evidence of that whatsoever there's been no evidence of that whatsoever they found the guy wasn't that\nPeople jumping to conclusions on both sides that are entirely unfounded using divisive rhetoric that has no place in a civilized society\nAnd lobbying just bold and brash accusations that the other side that I have no validation or verification look I I think it's comical that people come out and they say hey don't throw these accusations that Kavanaugh and don't assume him guilty if you have no validity in it\nAnd then they come out and say this was a ploy by the Democrats\nTo help them going into the November elections\nAnd people believed it if\nYou don't find that comical you're looking through a biased lens 'cause they're pretty much the same scenario somebody throws out an accusation with no validity with no factual backing a great number of people perceive it to be true\nAnd then a lot of us are left here questioning why same goes with the story of ... bomber an accusation with no validation just some random coincidence if people believe it and assume it to be true\nHey dealing with two assumptions may get to you and me don't say that on their\nCancer that honor middle said author but assumptions makeup but out of you and me\n\nSo why do we keep making assumptions and letting divisive rhetoric and letting those assumptions drive our rhetoric and letting our rhetoric be that devices I say in every scenario wait for the facts of the situation\nJust like the shooter\nPeople are saying was he motivated by was motivated by this was you motivated by that was motivated by Trump being beliefs was motivated\nBy that and there are plenty of instances on his Facebook page prior to Donald Trump even coming into the public sphere where she talks about specifically\nHis disdain for the Jewish people has nothing to do with Donald Trump yet I'm sure somebody will try to make it about Donald Trump they'll try to make about his rhetoric they'll try to make it about this will try to make it about that but at the end of the day it's just it's not true\n\nStop all the divisive rhetoric eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three we need more people saying my job is into judge my job is to care we had that would be much better society eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three let's go to Mike on line one\nHow you doing this morning of divorce\nAnd we'd be much better society eight six six my my one Ninety nine thirty three let's go to Mike on line one Mike how you doing this when\nThey're born and bred in the morning I'm Joe you had a great show adjusted last not\nThing rather I appreciate appreciate you watching and listening this morning you'll late night an early riser\nYeah man I go back and go oh yeah brother\nOh I've got to push back a little bit you know ...\nIt's hard to know what to believe anymore who in the world and what a style that would have a small ... by the Democrats sit back down the elected president you know I I mean I\nYou know you say is is you know and ... they are saying that who would've ever thought about it in our department\nOf justice and our FBI we've got a group of people trying to take out a sitting president ... ... yeah you know in every it never gets talked about I mean first of it\nYeah I Know I'm with you on them I\nDo watch going ... ... C I F even though ... people and there are still people embedded in there that have been trying to bring him dial\nYeah and I'm not saying that stuff doesn't happen and I'm not saying don't speak about good stuff I'm just saying when the conspiracy like uh if it's a conspiracy theory and its unfounded I Would say don't make that assertion that it's correct you can say well how we thought about this angle\nBut to whether it's on the writer left I mean to come out and say this president has radicalized more people than ISIS lane I just think that rhetoric is absolutely disgusting regardless what size it's coming from\nWhen you might you might have been point and I hate to say but I proudly ... I've been looking for somebody to stand up for a long time yeah where we hadn't had a way and I really don't ...\nYeah he he's not Harvard if\nThings but I really enjoyed what you said last night about a both sides backed into a corner taking taking Hail Mary shots at each other yeah\n... what is the way we've never had anybody to do that on our side we we were just get along you know everybody get along and\nThey were just they just been running over ... okay my I have another okay I have another ... my I have another and a lot of people like me or getting tired of it yeah\nEvery time we do is jeopardized people driving by a prayer in school you know just I\nI'm more of a ... a libertarian than I Am a Republican I'd say late male how old the federal government to keep out roads socket travel freely yup protect our borders and given the bass military in the world\nAnd a man and that's about all I think that the moon for under the constitution ... and every time we do rather that there is a pushback pushback but what I Am I looking back now where I got I got yeah\nYou know that we get run over and over and then not only the ... they were after ... ... ... percent of the media\nAnd I think there's any difference in the way President Trump stands up and I'm curious if you agree with me on this um ... I think there's a way in which he stands up in which he says you know that's fake news where we're not going to believe that that's okay but then I think there's a difference between that I liked it\nA way in which he stands up in which he says you know that's fake news where we're not going to believe that\nThat's okay but then I think there's a difference between that I liked that kind of standing up but then I don't like the times where he doesn't stand up when a ... quite literally a neo Nazi group comes out and says you know we support this guy he is the one that is going to push our beliefs\nAnd he doesn't come out and he doesn't say what the hell you know no I'm not you guys are big it's I I I think for a guy who stands up to the fake news media all the time why can't he stand up to those groups that are pushing such hateful sentiment because when he does and it looks like he's condoning\nAgree that there's a lot about it but\nYeah a lot yeah\nMhm better better better secular oh yeah you know that the whole show\nAnd I I don't know I won't ever body together look at Oregon does jail [noise] try to help\nPeople at work I work at the jails a mentor to jail for a I don't care what color you are yeah what what are you know it only it it just it just wants to\nKnow what can I can I tell you something like I honestly think and mean Joe talked about this yesterday I honestly think that that's how majority of people are but I think the media what they need is they need a story so they're going to push division whether it be racial religious et cetera division\nAt any cost and so I think a lot of this division is driven by the media and not the president or not the other political party I think it's driven by the media and I think all in all the majority of people Republicans and Democrats alike are just good people\nThat want to come together and want the government to operate in a way that it\nGives them the potential for a better life doesn't handed to them but it gives them a central for it\nOr you get there you go hey was it for a you know it was a start yeah\nYeah and I was a while and see and we\nWent into a quiet when the evil you know they would do is I Can't say about it yeah yeah and I think\nThe only distinction there is a they don't want the the the one thing that most people disagreed with was the application for violence but I think when just taking away that statement where he said you know go ahead and knock amount of pay your attorney's fees when you look at that\nLook at how many people were there peacefully and look at how many people were in a piece a Clinton round peace rally peacefully and look at these protesters\nThere a small amount of people that don't understand how the process works\nAnd want to complain about everything they do not make up the majority or even a consequential minority they they are a small group of people is in consequential in the grand scheme of things yet the media elevates them to a level where you would think this country is being rock to its core\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nSo we want to ... do we ... do you do thirty seven each room and the w._b. juicy huge to Birmingham [noise]\nThis is yellow hammer News I'm Andrea ... vice president Mike Pence will be in Alabama today Pence will take part in a Republican fundraiser in Birmingham he will arrive at the Sumpter Smith Air National guard base this afternoon and governor Kay Ivey will be there to meet him\nThe fundraiser as part of the Republican senatorial campaign and we'll be close to the public event was rescheduled for today after first being delayed by hurricane Michael\nA human trafficking bus results in three people being arrested in Tuscaloosa fifty two year old Christopher Fritz thirty one year old ... nail Robertson and twenty three year old Stephanie Williams are facing multiple charges involving promoting prostitution and human trafficking all three are being held in the Tuscaloosa County jail\nFormer youth minister acting bow and who's accused of sex crimes will undergo a mental evaluation Jay hall in but the other hammer news had that story\nWill to youth minister act in bowling Afghan student who is charged with child sex crimes in ...

vows and automatic citizenship for babies born to illegal immigrants as well as visitors it's also kind of important to note that\nIn this country you know all about the the object has always been directed at those that come across the border to our south very frequently the majority are illegal immigrants actually enter this country\nVia our airports and has been a practice three countries that are in the area of the Pacific or him to come in the United states have said baby returned back to their home and then return again when that child becomes of college age\nFor the purposes of

put it there they had a reason to put it there and if they don't want to say hey\nAnd the constitution or the amendments right correct they put it there they had a reason to put it there and if they don't want to say hey if your mommy can be within the geographic confines of the United states you get to be an American citizens they would have said that\nWhat they put subject to the jurisdiction in there and you know if you look at it historically what was it ratified an Eighteen sixty eight\nOnly granted citizenship to the African Americans born here they still denied citizenship to the American Indians born here and their reasoning for that was they were not subject to the jurisdiction in other states they had allegiance is to their various tribes no they change that\nNineteen thirty two oh\nWell it's you know I'm trying to remember Michael and can you remember I Want to say it was Ted Kennedy ... kind of changed is the birthright citizenship and I cannot recall was it in the late seventies early eighties that they started reinterpreted in this this way you recall\nKnown for roles and things like a bay the green mile big heroes six\nA Boardwalk Empire and the American horror story is also a political activist to his words organizations such as peta he's also frequently been arrested for his role and um planned protests that places likes the world and even a nuclear power plant in New York\nSpeaking to variety variety magazine he warned of the term that he sees America taking and caution there'll be blood on the streets of Republicans remain in control\nHe went on to say this that in that sense of fascism we always had a turn ... or ... state we all need and all we needed was an excuse and all the institutions were in place in turn had to turn this into pure fascism if we don't stop President Trump now\nThat we will have a revolution for real and there will be blood in the streets\n\nFor about love I Do not understand how in the world people on the left\nCan so readily point to Donald Trump and the anti Semitism of this murderer and parts burg and yet at the same time have so many people that are in their camp\nMaking such wild accusations and allegations and then the case or people such as Maxine Waters and Hillary Clinton even demands\nAnd we have got to get to a point in this country far it's where the discourse is tamped down significantly\nAnd you know we started out today's broadcast talking about\nThe ah executive order from Donald Trump which is going to attempt to um eliminate the or the muscle behind the or at least change with the uh the the tone of the fourteenth amendment is and we call it and you don't call that into\nTwo exceptions the fact that the president does not have the constitutional authority it would easily end up in the in the Congress or perhaps even the Supreme Court\nAnd if we don't get to a point in this country where we can have open honest discussions without the threat of bloodshed then you know we might as well just put a cork in this puppy and turn the lights out\nBut then again I'm not as much the way that the left roles and that's not to say that it does not get fuel on occasion by the right and it will get fuel today Fox News has been\nA tad bit on the reticent side when it seems to be covering this story and there have been times in the last several months where\nThese stories that seemed to populate CNN and MSNBC don't find a home on Fox and vice versa\nAt the end of the day however I think it's very important to remember and I'm being very serious\nAbout this that journalism in this state I don't mean Alabama I mean in the state that were in in terms of our culture we are in an entertainment industry unfortunately too many people do not understand that entertainment\nBe it as it may does have repercussions\n\nPeople see things in movies and they act I'm Out they hear things in songs and they act them out they adopt\nA political platforms that they're celebrities\nIt's in movies and they act them out they hear things in songs and they act out\nThey adopt a political platforms that they're celebrities those they hold in high esteem they adopt those policies ... clear thought or their own personal due diligence\nAnd this is a clarion call for those in the media as well as those in the music industry these sporting industry and of course Hollywood to tamp down the rhetoric because now we're getting into some very dicey waters\nAnd President Trump I Believe particularly with the recent polling numbers has been quite emboldened\nHere we set one week away from was possibly the most important midterm election in this generation if not the last couple of three and we have gotten to the point now where the possibility\nOf violence and blood in the street is a very real possibility in terms of the calls from so many people in this nation\nNow at my age I barely recollect the Nineteen sixties at least the early years\nBut I Do recollect enough and them enough of a historian and remember that for all of the banks for all the consternation for all of the outrage\nFor all of the violence to the degree that it occurred it was nothing like what we're seeing in this country today and yet\nThat's exactly what we're faced with as we have election after election after election threw out this country that are amazingly tight\nNow I'm not I'm not the type of person\nThat gives me a lot of weight and credibility to polls we have seen them dismantled so many times I personally find them to be antiquated to the degree that they are for the most part\nIrrelevant however with that said although they have not been in recent years great predictors of actual approval or disapproval they definitely have maintained a posture\nAnd inability to predict trends\nAnd the simple fact of the matter is in this country complements to frequently of a media we are seeing people's personal opinions swayed by those who are every bit as emotional as a lot of people on the street\nFor all the people that are worked up on the left over Donald Trump and the executive orders and the fourteenth amendment yeah gotta remember that at least when it comes to rhetoric this is the way this guy rolls\nThere's not a snowball's chance as we sit here today that this executive order what have the force and the power to overwhelm the fourteenth amendment\nHowever it does demonstrate that it's time for us to have legitimate discussions and I mean non violent discussions about immigration in this country to the Democrats use the uh the issue as a way to ... votes yes they do\nBut you can also make the argument on the other side\nThat Republicans defiance is also somewhat of an attempt in that and I said it again and for the time that I have behind this microphone I'll say it again and again and again and again\nIt's not a matter of left versus right but us versus them this is not a debate between Republicans and Democrats it's not one between conservatism and liberalism it is a battle between good\nAnd evil right and wrong\nWe get a little quieter and our discourse we will never come to a resolution\nRight and wrong but until we get a little quieter and our discourse we will never come to a resolution now with that said\nLet's look back and we can go to the Mariana civil rights votes the Supreme Court decisions what Congress just said about it what previous administrations upset about it and I'm reflecting almost exclusively on the fourteenth nothing has been resolved\nTalk radio as as a vehicle or medium\nHas only been around since the last Thirty years or so actually given birth by Rush Limbaugh which is why he is called the godfather by so many people\nBut the issues at debate had been around for at least decades and in some cases centuries guys we have an opportunity here for the first time in the history of this country\n\nTo come to string collisions conclusions are the things that channel and just the most now and almost every emotional debate whether we have it in our homes or churches are communities emotions often get heated that's just human nature\nBut as I've gotten older I have realized that these outlandish and oftentimes vitriolic and for both conversations where we scream each other down are absolutely positively worthless\nI've gotten my beliefs I Know but you've got yours as well\nBut if we can not get to a point where we can come together and put the voting and the power and the influence and the money and I know that's big but it to the side for the best in this country we're never going to become everything that we can become 'cause I Want to tell you something and not being serious about this the whole world's watching us\nThis mid term is going to impact Britain and France in Israel and Japan it's going to impact our relationship with the Chinese and the Russians it impacts our economy\nIt impacts are influence in the world and our ability to stand for what's right and the human rights perspective\nIf we don't get this right the world's suffers we very oftentimes as Americans are quite selfish\nAnd the times we should be for our own best interest but we also have to consider the fact that this is the last wine in the sand when it comes to whether or not you\nWant to refer to it as a democratically elected government or representative republic that the world in a large measure is going to fall into lockstep with what we decide in the next seven days\n... Honduras altogether receive about five hundred million dollars a year\nAnd still to this country Mexico receives almost two hundred million and a ... you mentioned that the majority of the word you used was majority of people who come in this country come into airplanes will remember this usually report in the news I've heard that several times\nIn recent weeks is it forty percent of the illegals here come in and they're playing so it's a little less than the majority but still a huge number I'm and overstay their visas you know in a\nWell it also goes back to what you just said it's the way that you you uh you didn't know whether or not they're they're they're not necessarily coming as illegal or did you say overstaying their visas\nOr their application processes and ... you know that's where the numbers coming from so it's really very difficult for anyone to draw a conclusion as to the total amount of people but no you're you're points vowing dinner a huge portion of them are not coming here under the same status\nBut again overstaying their visas and at that point in time they become by definition of legal\nRight but I think Donald Trump sees this as an as a real opportunity to address you know everybody keeps saying well you got to have a a immigration laws change we've got to modify the loans are totally change the system\nI mean this is such a big hit on our system I think he says that you know he he's thought about this a lot of early and comments this morning a he was a very quiet town it wasn't making any is you know snide remarks like people are criticizing\nI mean this morning a he was a very quiet town he wasn't making any is you know snide remarks like\nPeople are criticizing forty and he does a lot of that's kind of for fun and he didn't but he was very serious this morning and talking about that to a reporter and you could just tell his tone of voice that you know he had thought about this extensively\nAnd uh I think he sees it you know what's the what's the elections coming up that with his popularity almost up to fifty percent\nAnd um I think I think the real candidates are going to win in most cases in in the congressional races I see this is a real opportunity to at least start the process and\nYou know one day in and the people that are countries who support terrorism was seven countries that finally uh you know he won that actually even the Ninth Circuit\nAnd um you know tried to cancel it was a it was approached but uh you know finally you know the a sprinkler or you know agree that that he could ban people from those countries and uh so uh what's your thinking on that you think he sees this is a real opportunity here\nWell you know what's interesting is that you know we always keep we keep using the phrase our G A\nComprehensive immigration reform or just you know reform in the immigration system but we don't have a lot of debate WC about enforcing the existing laws and then there's the laws are enforced and I don't know the immigration reform is necessary\nNow I I Am an advocate I Am a proponent for the idea of streamlining the naturalization process 'cause I find it to be quite cumbersome and obviously very expensive\nAnd we can have you know those kinds of debates but you know the end of the day we have laws in place and it's the enforcement of those laws that I think Trump is referring to because at the end of the day the the executive order that he would be able to put forth he\nCannot constitutionally override the fourteenth amendment but\nWhat he can do is influence how agencies that want to enforce the fourteenth amendment how they actually go about doing their jobs\nThat's the impact the impact that he can have in that regard he does have the authority to force the enforcement of it and I think that's really more what he's speaking to but I think your observations are pretty spot on\nBecause of the end of the day if we can have the conversation as to what this looks like and get away for the need to important voters that maybe we can make some some progress because the prom and I've seen both on the left and the right is that we've got these people that in the states of limbo so to speak\nThat are becoming political pawns in this country and I think that we are we are not realizing the position that we're putting many of them in the uh the ability to attract people to this country for whatever the reason\nIs putting people in jeopardy is they make this journey and so there's a lot of things that need to go into these conversations but I think ultimately where we need to be talking about is the white people seek asylum the way they end of this country and the process to become legal here and the fact of the matter is if we resolve those issues many of the rest of these issues go away\nWe you know the the founding fathers really could not anticipate a problem we're facing right now I think I Would have never imagined that such huge numbers of people would try to come into this country illegally uh so you know the fourteenth amendment was\n... it was written in regard to the slaves and and their children and uh um some say I I don't think it really has an application as as it's written down to the situation we're facing a and ah so I think it needs a little more\nI think it really has an application as as it's written down to the situation we're facing a and uh so I think it needs a little more language like you say modified um you know talking about the it was under the jurisdiction\nWell ... you know you still don't mind the comparison between someone that comes here and commits murder I'm pulling out there under the jurisdiction but that's that's I think comparing apples and oranges to people who come here\nAnd try to become citizens illegal yeah I don't think those are are analogous situations I'm ... you know all the motives of crime anywhere it doesn't matter uh what's your low is I mean that's\nCrime but but you know in the immigration laws vary of course from one country to another and so I I don't believe that a fair comparison well I'll let you go I don't want to take all your time Michael but it's it's really interesting to think about all the possibilities\nYou know and there's a lot of um WC there definitely is\nA you know by said this morning on ... on a around six o'clock I was listening to him he said in regard to the ... you know the bomber and also the\nThe synagogue senior that we should light to all the facts are and I think we have to wait and see a you know all the facts that are into this and what what really Donald Trump is\nGoing to propose something we just have to really uh you know really small employing of what it might be at this point and uh so I don't want to make any judgments about whether he's right or wrong you know um but as I said that the people you know coming from the seven countries\nOr you know it went in his favor everybody guardian lost their you know so\nI I think he's a very a good judge of situations and and people are you know he's faced a lot of different situations in the business world when you think you much\nFor the call I appreciate that very much and and I think the Trump does have a good beat on things in that regard but you know it's so interesting to me is that speaking about the travel ban which has gone from seven nations is six\nIs that that was an idea that was put forth under the Obama administration and then when you start talking about the restrictions on birthright citizenship the Democrat Harry Reid propose that in Nineteen Ninety three\nSo I I find it so interesting that so many of the things that we're talking about in this country today that so many people on the left find abhorrent about Donald Trump were in fact ideas that were put forth probably Democrats originally but\nYou know then again there goes the political discourse in this country because you know I Do frequently\nI Know I'm trying to break a\nYou know one but two frequently we we as the voters the citizens of this country\nRelegate ourselves to spectators without realizing that from a constitutional perspective that if we were to engage in our constitutional responsibilities visa will be voting and participate in the process we would not be dealing with a whole lot of this ... is it not true\nThat leads to a degree that the people that are in office than are elected in office right now are they not a reflection of us\nOf our participation of our willingness to do our due diligence I mean look at some of these people like you know the front of Rica Wilson's and Maxine Waters of the world who have done so little for their districts but yet they're constantly reelected who was that on is this the one Maxine Waters is this on her constituency\nAnd I'm I'm about to believe that a lot of this is on us that our\nI've seen waters is this on her constituency\nAnd I'm I'm about to believe that a lot of this was on us\nThat our politicians too frequently go to DC or Montgomery and they act out in a manner that they feel as though as pleasing to the people they represent if that's the case\nAnd it is they don't seem to me that much of the debate is going on in this country today demonstrates a lack of decisions and caught a viable positions from the the the people that are voting these folks in the office and the first place\n[noise] eight six six five five one nine nine three three that Michael hearts are stick around Rick I'm right back\nIt's not right versus left it's us versus them the Michael hurt show\nGuys

W. I. V. A. [noise] I\nGot a whole watch Fox lined up tomorrow we're really excited about that will get it out perhaps a little bit later on but a ... going to be ... by for a while\nMy uh my brother is also going to pop those kind of a weird weird to interview to have but\nAh something we did last year as tomorrow's Halloween and we did it last year and I got a lot of good feedback and if you didn't hear last year's edition Halloween edition of the program this is just weird stuff I don't even know how you come down on this deal and I'm not sure if you're aware of this or not but I go ahead and just kind of tough\nShouldn't Halloween edition of the program this is just weird stuff and I don't even know how you come down on this deal and I'm not sure if\nYou're aware of this or not but I go ahead and just kind of tell folks was coming up\nThere was a program and I'm going to forget the name of it but it was one of the days where these teams go in to see the house has haunted\nAnd we have some go stories from our family were some very interesting ah what's called E. V. peas or electronic voice phenomena and\nAnd when I was growing up my family also immigrated to the United states\nAnd my ah well my mom's side of the family there was a lot that came out of places like Czechoslovakia is primarily my great grandmother and there was a couple of pictures that were in our home that we're well assumed to be the pictures themselves perhaps I'll just say it\nHaunted these pictures one in particular ended up in my brother's possession and hung in his house\nAnd weird stuff started to happen in a national TV program actually contacted my brother and sister in law they came in and set up this recording equipment and found some very curious and rather eerie and ... of people in the background\nWill just say that weren't there actually talking about my niece and it's just weird eerie\nHalloween kind of stuff so we're going to do that tomorrow again so be prepared you got to look on your face\nI'll be here and a lot of what I've seen on those shows that does you alluded to a lot of it just looks very ... ... ... ... doctored I ... it would be\nThat way to put up all the way out just ah keep an open mind 'cause there's some real weird weird weird stuff and\nSome of this I mean you know what's interesting is my uh my niece my my uh my brother's daughter is on the autism spectrum\nAnd during one of these uh conversations with these supposedly goes to hunters they were talking to her and she made a comment and I'll let my brother elaborate on this to the effect if she had a very special friend visited her quite often\nAnd again all that my brother elaborate on this but they were asking her as a friend had a name and his girlfriend had the name of ...\nWell Otis was my grandfather's name and none of us meadow just because he died before I was born and so just interesting little things like that that it came out of this program that was done many years ago my brother has all these things in his possession but after we did that particular broadcast we got a lot of really\nInteresting interesting traffic on our social media as well as our emails so we'll do that tomorrow and then on Thursday Dan ... by making Bartleby here friday our old friend\nTo use you\nWill not on the news\nSite diary of a second caravans in the neighborhood [noise]\nJust crossed into Mexico overnight at a according to what I saw on Fox earlier [noise]\n\nLet's just listen to Tom jones [noise]\nThat's what I'm Talking or are there [noise]\nDoing the white guy dance [noise]\nEight six six five five one nine nine three three going trick or treating tomorrow\nNo [noise]\nA Halloween party plans no okay right well I got class all day and I got to be up fairly early the next morning a\n\nI'm making money though so I Can't complain too much\n\nYeah I hear yeah\nThere's a move afoot and this guy drink amongst other moves afoot got a lot of folks ... social media about whether or not a Halloween to be moved to the last Saturday in October\n... that I don't necessarily disagree where there's you know you got all those times we got the youngsters and they go out of school and I and then they get the mandatory\nMove that I don't necessarily disagree with 'cause you know you go there's times where you've got the youngsters and they go out of school and I and then they get the mandatory tummy ache the next day\nClass seemed to a class sizes seem to fall off on a\nNovember first so now there's a lot of parents that are up in arms about doing it the old way but you know and it's just so I disagree with having her on that last Saturday just for the purposes of giving everybody the opportunity to trick or treat all night long but you know it is interesting how many there are things from from our past in this country seem to go to the wayside\nAs we I'm On a kind of grow up mature move on whatever the case may be but I'm doing remind everybody to be very careful as you drive around tomorrow evening as there shall be large\nPopulations of goals and goblins and sexy cocktail waitress is\nPandering for sugar\nAlso pay attention to your community 'cause there's a lot of them that I Know of that will shut down any traffic into or out of the community after a certain time\nMm good point good point so if you live in one of those communities plan on getting home early\n[noise] yeah I got to get home early so I can give out candy to the three kids little probably show up on our street known ever comes down our street you know it's so funny because last year we literally had three the year before that we had about forty three\nI don't I don't know I'm trying to get my head around it but you know I live in a community that's populated more by\nUm [noise] would it be fair to say geriatrics I mean I'm including myself in that you know but it's it's a neighborhood has got you know some older folks on the street so yeah we don't get a whole lot of that and it's kind of\nSad one year I just did this great what I thought it was a really great little display I created or graveyard up front but all these all lights out and scary music him I had all these ... and\nThis was the last time I did this one I think one of the headstones you know they say ... rest in peace and I did a couple of them that I did on myself and I think when I'm sitting here lies Auburn football season\nIt was a ... that's funny stuff right there\n\nThat's hilarious actually it was kind of funny I thought it was a new I ... it's even funnier with you being in Auburn fan hey look you know the\nFact that you can a minute yourself just makes it that much money are\nA lot you know I've been an Auburn fan for the better part of fifty years a lot of my Auburn Tigers I Love Arbor in the city you know ... it's not it's not beneath us and it's rare but it's not beneath us to drive down to Auburn just\nTo hang out you know just not even on game day because I you know her daughter's what they're my oldest daughter went there and my sister went there so we had a connection to the town we always enjoyed it's kind of hanging around so beautiful little city and so we just enjoyed going in you know hanging out and doing whatever you know ... part of our our ... and not just our our lives and our our kids curriculum\nBut as part of our hearts as well so you know when things aren't going according to plan\nIs you know just like if we were more honest in this country about things that aren't going according to plan and we could point after the shortcomings just like a lot of Auburn fans can from time to time and then you know maybe we make a little more progress but sometimes it's hard to point the finger at yourself or\nOur case you guys but I digress eight six six five five one nine nine three three but yeah Halloween tier little nip in the air can be warm today though Seventy eight north central Alabama so we still have some unseasonably cold temperatures are in season at all either way I don't care who cares\nBut a ... but um it's gonna be a good evening all the problem\nAnd seasonable temperatures are in season at all either way I don't care who cares but a ... but um it's gonna be a good evening although probably had damp one tomorrow night as well so get out with those youngsters you know back in the day when I was\nI don't know\nTen eleven years old my sisters because my brother was too young to that point in time my sisters went out with me and it's sad that we live in a time where that's really no longer a safe recipe\nBut then again in ... neighborhoods pardon me such as my own you know but you go to a lot as neighborhoods where you see people that are coming in just in busloads\nAnd I went to a buddy of mine's a neighborhood some years ago just for a party and I'm like you all have this many kids on the street 'cause I'm not kidding you're doing there were hundreds of them and apparently got people out there that were export their children into the uh more candy rich vicinity of town\nYeah we've got a one street that's actually just two streets over from the street I live on it's a sunny Dale lame I Believe is a ... the name of it or they knows exactly where it is and what I'm Talking about is it Hoover a Concord OK okay gotcha\nAh and ...\nHow are you er hughie townie and yes I did not know that I don't live lanes a lot\nWell thanks I I don't live within your town or city limits I live in Concord er which so you live in a suburb of Huey town they basically explains even more\nAh but there's a bad enough traffic right\n\nNot only here in town the woman's family is from here in town to just\nSay if she's listening you're going to get in trouble off or you\nWake up in trouble what are you talking about\n[noise]\nBut the traffic is so bad from Sunnyvale that after like five PM you can't get out of my street\n\nAnd I and that's the main road that leads all the way into you each town is a paved yes okay just asking you\nKnow it's a it's a

Rourke DePaul within five points of Ted Cruz and ultimately what this was going to come down to as it always does\nIs voter turnout\nNow according to ... within striking distance but time is running out in a raise the Democrats have hurt would deliver an upset victory that would be a key to a Senate takeover meanwhile in New Jersey Democrat Senator Bob Menendez\nYeah that Bob Menendez\nInvestigation broad malfeasance is only five points ahead of the G O P challenger Bob Hugin according to and Emerson poll released yesterday as a Republican tries to capitalize on the incumbents ethic problems\n\nNow and the case of Mendez here you've got a guy that has been very exploitative for personal\nGain of the system who is still in the race and leading and this goes back to my original comments about you know the the politicians being their representation of our commitment to the system\nHow do you have a politician that's facing numerous\nEthics complaints and not always still in the race but his leading the race\nBut then does was found or broken sent an ethics rules on receiving gifts the federal bribery case against him that resulted any miss trial last year\nHis opponent has also revived allegations that Mendez\n\nFrequented under age\nWorking girls during trips to the Dominican Republic allegations that of course Menendez has adamantly denied\n\nBut most of this you know this is not money from within the state this is outside influence trying to buy outside influence\nAnd Tuesday is going to shape ought to be one of the most fascinating election days in recent memory\nLet's get out of the phones and we'll start with Bob hello Bob how are you\nGood morning I'm doing fine ah I was looking on our sample ballot online last night\nAnd uh in relation to most people vote for it to the advantage to the first in line and ah but I was noticing that every race the Democrat was first\n\nAnd I just want to is that something planned or is that a variable or just what's going on there\nI have not are you you're speaking of the state of Alabama yes okay is it you know the the thing about it is is that [noise]\nAre you you're speaking of the state of Alabama\nYes okay\nIs it you know the the thing about it is is that the\nParties themselves are the ones responsible for bringing a ballot south\nAnd in past years you know the primaries in particular in the west and I broke this down the primaries in particular have often been very curious in that people typically you had a better chance of winning to the tune of Seventy percent plus of the time if they were alphabetically higher up on the ballot\nBut right but you know the the parties ultimately make a determination but I I'll be honest with you I've not looked about I wasn't even that go to and say well tomorrow Bob so I'll write that down and see what I Can't find out about ... that has occurred\nAll right to shake that absolutely Michael ... for the call Bob [noise]\nIn a general election such as this particularly where parties have been so encouraging straight party voting I don't know if it has the impact that it would say during the primary obviously you're you know you're dealing with all one party\nBut the fact the matter is is that voters kind of going back to the average talked about a moment ago deal and they're so far removed from what the politician stand for many many many\nCases that placement on the ... the ... there was just like that or even a couple of years ago about whether or not you're going to put the letter I next door incumbents name which I was not necessarily in opposition to\nBecause there was an argument that you know pointed out and do the incumbent might have given them an an unfair advantage\nBut we're going to break the bow down over the course of the next couple of days we're getting into that a little bit tomorrow but definitely on Thursday and friday is broadcast but to appreciate bringing that up to his Bob 'cause it's certainly something worth looking into because we also have to go through the amendments themselves\nSo anyway eight six six five five one nine nine

[noise]\nWhat about a program for radio crazy McDonald is my guest for a few more moments he's running for certain court judge here in ...\nCounty and and and we've started off the program\nNot about Jefferson County Alabama but just the fact that what circuit judge circuit court judges do district judges a little bit of the different so people were up to speed because that's the same all around the state little background on pricey herself and then um I Want to give her the opportunity to just talk about\nWhy she the better choice I Know you've got to go and they've got all kinds of campaigning to do but just tell me a little bit about the campaign how it's going\nI Believe everybody should run for office at least once because you learn so many lessons you you think it's going to be you know running for no even if you ruined for third grade class president [laughter] it's not easy but everyone he run one time so do you agree with that have you learned a lot running for office\nI have I have learned a lot of things you didn't want to know unfortunately I Am I must agree with that yes yes um [noise] um so okay first of all well what makes me the most qualified candidate and I'm\nIn my experience I think it all comes down to the fact that experience matters um and and my experiences um\nSo you've been in the legal profession and how many years\nI've been practicing all for Fifteen Years ago\nAnd during that Fifteen year my Fifteen year history I have practiced exclusively in civil litigation\nI have with you when you said earlier is what circuit court exist way exactly so I have been in the courtroom representing clients for Fifteen Years both plaintiffs and defendants mhm um and that was a calculated decision on my part\nI knew I wanted to ultimately the judge but of course you have to work long enough in your field to\nTo feel as though you already know and I and ... and I gained ... exactly and so part of that experience that I think\nField to to feel as though you are ready\nAnd I and ... and I gained ... exactly and so part of that experience that I think is important is that I have represented both plant defend defendants I've been on the side so I think that makes me I'm desirable as a candidate now do your opponent\nOr though you're not running them down but your own uh how was their experience different what was your Fifteen Years in circuit court\nBetter well what I I can only speak to my opponent based on what I have read on her\nWeb right right but the sheep or stuff out to the way I look at any one can look at that according to our website\nUm she uh her background I think she went to Birmingham School of law I'm is fine with me and I think she has practiced may maybe um\nFifteen maybe the same amount of time I don't know exactly the number of years maybe ... around the same amount of time as I have to okay here's may maybe more um but her practice has been by and\nLarge working for the Birmingham housing authority okay I'm an according which that's not\nSo more of a deal in the house attorney dealing with a certain set of issues but\nAren't necessarily ... narrow set of the rise according to our court um I Would say more than Ninety percent of the cases that she has had have called unlawful detain ers which is a is an eviction um so that's a very very narrow scope\nOf um of of experiencing a practice and that's not the kind of thing that you would ever have and it's I doubt any of those I've ever gone to trial or or or certainly not jury trial are probably\nVery little judicial experience now I'm just going to tell you I I\nI Do like the fact that it bothers you to even say hey my experience is\nIs better suited to be a judge than my opponents 'cause I Know you're trying to avoid any negativity that that's really not negative is is a comparison between two\nAh I mean you ... we all do that when we're hiring an employee we look at the experience this ... been doing welding for Fifteen Years and that's what they are this person also has a welding certificate but over the last Fifteen Years they've ah\nThey've built houses but I Need a welder mhm so I'm going to get the welder who's been doing welding for Fifteen Years and I I think it's important that we know the difference in experience\nExactly and my experience is really what sets me apart from my opposition\nAbsolutely so as a as a judge how what is your\nJudicial philosophy not asking about any kind of cases a lot of people as you talk about strict construction is versus and maybe it doesn't that doesn't apply so much in civil court 'cause you really ... but maybe it does what what is your view of the law is the is the constitution and living document\nOr is it a set of rules that we don't get to change just like\nIt's easily football rules and we're running out of time\nOkay judges apply the law to the facts they did I should always make decisions always in every case based on the law and the facts\nWill Scott how can that be on poverty mom and dad are both work and they're driving a they're driving a four wheel drive Ford or if two fifty diesel because like Seventy thousand dollars it's like forty fifty thousand dollars knew how can they be poor Scott they just dropped off their child to a local head start\nProgram federal government pre K. and maybe we\nKilled that also don't call me and say yes or no but you know the store\nThey can be poor how would they why are we sending that child attack because according to the government mom and dad aren't making any money remember\nThey're getting paid under the table or they really don't exist so the child is in poverty so we're giving them all the things that the poor child to need and chances are we were giving maternal health care before the child was born that we made into that as\n\nWell that doesn't seem right Scott well I don't think is right either\n\nSay it wasn't necessarily a problem way back when you migrate into the country legally\nAnd\nPopping on vacation you didn't just run across the border yesterday\nYou wanted to be an American you didn't just popping on vacation you didn't just run across the border yesterday\n\nYou were planning to be an American therefore your child was a citizen that was that was almost the ... that was the efficient way to do it we're not if you're trying to be a citizen do so in a couple of years you're taking your citizenship test\nHave a big party after you pass you're a citizen your child was already a citizen great God Bless America singing the national anthem\nDon't take and they\nAll is well now birthright\nCitizenship has been\nExplained away by the fourteenth amendment\nWhich like so many things in the U.S constitution was not does not is not trying to address whether you wandered in the United states the claim of people being under the\nAh\nIt's not the word that using the fourteenth but that you're under the jurisdiction therefore you're a citizen all had to do with so I have read the fourteenth amendment has been twisted so much so even X. CEOs\nI think it was um [noise] there's already been a a somewhat conservative outlet\nAlso say they're not sure here's what ... says no this is vice dot com you can't get more to the left the vice Trump wants to end birthright citizenship by executive order but it's unclear if he can\nNow that's that's the left that's vice if vice\nIs not willing to just go out and say he absolutely cannot that should explain to you when I say I'm not sure he\nCan't if it was a slam dunk absolutely can't do it\nThis would not say but it's unclear if he can I think it's National Review National Review says well I think it's a little less than fifty fifty that he can\n\nThat he can make it happen then you can make it stick\nOh he can he can do it no matter their argument is whether or not he can make it stick in the courts ... going to go to the Supreme Court William\n... and those were Kavanaugh has a right and and\nUh the uh I don't think he can do it I think\nKevin Oh say no that's not what it says in the constitution you really think that ah I really do based on what\n\nMost basic ... basing it on my limited amount of the fourteenth amendment right\nReady to to ... well that's that's the thing that I think is is fascinating\nIs what we believe in him and most of us all do\nWhat most people think the fourteenth amendment\nSays fourteenth amendment section one now remember this was passed by Congress in Eighteenth sixty six ratified an Eighteen sixty eight this is one of the civil\nWar post civil war people call the civil war amendments okay the goal was\nAs state and by the people who passed it uh I Know that it would be shocking to Americans to thing\nThe goal was\nAs stated by the people who passed it I I Know that it would be shocking to Americans to think that the people who actually sponsored and passed it and voted on it would know what it means\nBetter than federal court judges\nI Know it's hard it's hard to believe I've experienced myself I pass legislation\nIn the Alabama Legislature gone to a court proceeding to tell the judge what we intended and the judge did not let me or the house sponsor speak\nYou know I don't know Cho till I was actually the judge literally like\nI don't really care what the guys who sponsored it passed it talked about it where does the media said they wanted to ask 'cause I'm the\nJudge and you wonder why have such high respect for so many people who wear the roads that is why when I find people that I think are days that I like to say hey consider this first that makes me oh you oh you fourteenth amendment we don't have to go very far\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction therefore they're of our citizens of the United states that have the state we're in there that\nThat's what it's all based on ... the one part that gets me is in the state they reside\nAll persons born born or naturalized in the United states was funny because the place about the state we're in they reside is not what is reference for birthright citizenship\nHung up but that that that is a big I I Know it's just a few words right but to me that is the one part of the whole thing\nThat that\nMakes it either he he can or he can't yeah but ... says ... they are citizens of the United states\nAnd of the state where they reside what is saying is we're going to make you a citizen you are a citizen you're a freed slave you are a citizen of the United states\nAnd no matter what the state says you're a citizen of that state\nYou live there\nOkay that was the go ... can I can I throw little LuPone yeah absolute okay\nTed Cruz where it was a bone Canada okay\nThen that makes him a Canadian so um birthright well now they don't have birthright ...

name I'm Sorry that's a bad word for him a but a guy named Bill Clinton I took a U.S citizen name Ellie in ... and he forwarded him to Cuba because his father wanted him\nBack oh had wet foot dry foot so as soon as a Cuban made foot on dry soil that's a nasty car wreck um but as soon as a Cuban made\nFoot on to dry soil they're automatically American citizens Eliot ... his mother braved the waters and everything which Eli on\nIn order to fulfill that wet foot dry foot and Bill Clinton decided that he was going to take the child from his mother and deport him to Cuba\nSo this is everybody's all screaming all in an uproar there's a lot more work ... room here for Trump to work without being sued\nA and and with it holding up in court provided need properly words his executive order or instructions to the bureaucracy of our government\nEspecially if he writes it as illegal entry or temporary and three he can explain a bunch of things in the executive order that makes it much more difficult for people to make the claim\nOh well you know that's supposed to I I I think you make a great point ...\n... does he not also\nPeople to make the claim oh well you know supposed to I I I think you make a great point Murphy\nDoes he not also have control within the state department do a ... some of the policies within the state department keeping within the letter of the law\nWill you would think we thought he was in control of the department of justice true [laughter] but it can drop the has the authority it just doesn't always have the bureaucrats ... is our go to Jennifer Jennifer Utah wrote a welcome to the program\n... so I don't really have to say about ... or that birthright citizenship thing but I did well I Will tell you\nBefore you transfer over the Internet

I just continue to hope that you will help somebody will convince you do it and uh somebody higher than we are\nThank you Jay Jay appreciate you so much\nThat I think this country in Asia Scott I'm you know in theory but uh I agree with everything yeah he said there's precedent for this uh you know and if Trump or puts it in the right frame when he first announced it I think\nThere'll be less says you know how how ... over it um\nAnd I'm just surprised at some other and I don't know the ... you know you haven't given us the details but I Do want to say I'm surprised it some other station here in the Birmingham area has an already grad grad you up and before you know before you get too far away\nWell the ... the wheels works slowly but um [noise] we'll see what happens on on that front line but hopefully we'll have some uh ability to stay afloat and thousands of folks come over will be able to make a go of it\nRight will listen out for it and keep our fingers crossed\nJoined I thank you so you buy buy keep on rolling oh yeah got Paul again Paul welcome to the program thing for giving us a call\nUm I mean do you have to listen to us with time even though Iraq Today because of my work on college because you have to do with the use of the ... that you're going to ... or something and then the other thing I wanted to\nAsk you this I was really good when President Trump said that just because you\nWere battling who you know just if you want a citizen that doesn't mean you children all the medical style that was ridiculous but then she'd be us this moment\nBefore I went to work though said that I'm thirty three other countries are lab that I thought we were learning more in the lab if you if your parents want solutions and we'll guaranteed and you automatically became a citizen\nMaybe you could address that from the ... so some ...\n... All right for the first thing is own the Trump executive order he has not done that yet\nOr how many hours well I've always understood that is either very few or one country does now\nThirty something countries that a B C or CBS or somebody can come up with a you'll probably be hard pressed I don't know for sure but you'd probably be hard pressed to have heard of some of these countries\nAre what is there a hundred and sixty seven or a hundred hundred and eighty something countries around the world um\nSo you can't use that as oh well everybody does I just read you from an article wrote an article earlier that says it is an anomaly\nAnd as far as what's ...\nOh well everybody does it I just read you from an article read an article earlier that says it is an anomaly\nAnd as far as what's going on\nLike we've talked a little bit about yesterday this is our last week on the station for this program and hopefully tomorrow or the next day unless something bad happens we'll have a way to tell you where to go so you can listen to the program and leave for an hour a day live\nAnd then have recorded Burgess for ... for people like Paul who might be able to listen after work so everybody kind of get up to speed on\nWhat you can do on your cell phone what'd you can do on your computer will tell you how to get there but I'm really kind of excited about it because\nThe freedom that that gives you is a is pretty strong and it also gives listeners the ability to have some more flexibility when they listen they just may not be able to call all the time so we're doing our best to make sure you can stay connected with us there's a hundred\nAnd Ninety five countries were up to Ninety five in the world yeah I'll just yeah you're\nGetting some of the names some of them are like a butter bean a stand and you're like what the heck is that while I'm waving\nBig ... I think they do that here in town welcome to the program\n[laughter] this is a little day hey hey what's going on\nYeah um I uh yeah you're talking about a with a hundred and Ninety five countries in the world of socialism and communism does not work\nThat's while they always go back to a capitalistic system\nBut to have a republic like we have is more fair and balanced as far as voting is concerned about needs to get out there in those are but we now are under martial law that happened when the Patriot act was passed that was what two thousand and two\nSo the all the presidents gotta do is is an act of the military\nUm and there are indictments coming down from what I hear or you can go to YouTube and if you're smart enough if you've got an hour to listen to that yes um there's a a new one that I just heard this guy's a Pulitzer Prize winner and he's former CIA any hearing a lot of stuff from the CIA\nHow you got to tell me what you got to tell me what I'm searching for oh though so I can\nRead his his name is Robert David Steel\nAnd uh the programming of a program news ... program his knee most in E.
