individuals was skin deep because they brought them into the fantasies the man who'd been blind and instead of these individuals rejoicing and the men story instead of them saying we've been hoping for a chance to meet you\nThe word is out in the community that you could see and we're so glad that you've chosen to come along and meet with us no there is none of that either tall there's no

you can identify very quickly with this you became a Christian they may have become a Christian just recently came and acknowledge that you are blind and that you that you have things completely wrong that you were lost and that Jesus came seeking to save the last and us Jesus to save you and to be the shepherd of your soul\nAnd what you've discovered now is that\nReligious formal ism has no place for that kind of radical change\nIf you go to the religious formula is whether it is your pass through your priest or rabbi on your next door neighbor or capture mom and dad or your brother or whoever it might be and tell them about this amazing change if they are religious formulas they probably will not give you a wonderful response\nOr they may give you some kind of superficial\nPacify and

come to me to have life\nHe said in one sense you're on the right track you believe that the scriptures leads to return a life in fact the Ferris easiest to attach them to their wrists and little

was something like\nThis\nWhoever does not by ... to watch this is really what he's doing they're doing and seem to intimidate this young man who knows clearly that he was once blind but now they can see but they're giving them a bad time they're back at him again and again and again seeking to intimidate him and robbed them of the reality of what he's convicted\nAnd what they're saying is that whoever does not ... and our knowledge knows nothing\nAnd whoever knows something we don't know is a fool whoever doesn't ... an hour knowledge\nOr you may be here and that's exactly your story with little variations\nOne day your son or your daughter came into your home and said I discovered that Jesus as my savior to my friend and you said you don't need that kind of nonsense we've brought you up and the way that you needed to be brought up we gave you every kind of opportunity for religion\nAnd you did and it was good and it was helpful\nAnd it actually was a foundation that led the youngsters to the point where they said doing all this stuff isn't giving me forgiveness isn't given me peace isn't giving the hole\nAnd then they discovered that it wasn't in the dueling of this stuff but it was in what had been done by Jesus that there was say and there was grace and there was forgiveness and there was freed\nAnd the parents now have the same decision to make as the

people out there today who here that kind of thinking and they begin to think it makes sense maybe you believe that\nMany people out there today who here that kind of thinking and they begin to think it makes sense maybe you believe that can we really know that our New Testament is not missing some books\nWell poll says and first Corinthians Fifteen that what he taught to them is what it was handed down to him\nThat means that true gospel teaching was the line with that hinder don't truth which Jesus talk to his disciples\nHe says that old scripture is God breeds referring to the Old Testament because the New Testament wasn't completed with Peter in second Peter three sixteen tells us the polls letters are scripture\nBut do you estimate speaks for itself\nDoesn't remember what John says at the end of revelation anyone who adds to this is liable to judgment John seems to be saying listen\nThis is the final book there won't be any more after this and historically that's how Christians have thought through the centuries\nBut how did the early Christians discern what should be in the New Testament well take a listen to a segment from this new DVD that addresses this in the documentary the God who speaks\nThere weren't criteria that the church used to recognize these and these criteria are essentially street apple is still a city which means the book is either written by an apostle or in a social or possibly that's the most important criterion\nSecondly is orthodoxy does the book conform to what we know to be true from the other books that we know to be inspired the gospels were the very first one's almost surely to be accepted uh we don't have any any period when there was a time where there is any hint that they will not accept it\nAnd then the third criterion is Kath Felicity doesn't mean Roman Catholic means accepted by the the majority of the church is\nWhen you look at a state of the ... and in the early church there's two important facts to get right about that one is to recognize it very early and there was a core collection of books the church recognize almost out of the gate\nWhat that means is by the second century we've got twenty two maybe twenty three hundred and twenty seven books already there [noise]\nThat's one thing to recognize it as a second thing to recognize not as if there were some books that were disputed\nWe have some books that you know we can call the books around the edges or the ... the smaller books that there was some controversy about and he's with the books like\nSecond Peter and James and Jude and second third John [noise]\nUm and there was some controversy about some of these books there is discussion about them\nThat that the kind of books that typically were disputed were little books\nAnd this is not worthy small books for obvious reasons we're we're not as impactful in the literature of the day they weren't read is often they weren't why as widely known they were cited last so that they weren't a familiar across different geographical regions that would take more time to recognize the books and you can understand why they might be disputed more\nThan others here's what's interesting despite occasional challenges here and there once the church every second census\nOn these twenty seven books that that consensus been wide and long standing and I think that's an encouraging truth for us as Christians we can look at the church through the ages with a great deal of unanimity around these books not\nNot absolute anonymity where there's never an objection from any order but a predominant unity which I think is evidence of the spirits work and the church to receive these twenty seven books and and just these twenty seven books\nI'm Charles Morris we're in a series called is the Bible true this week and that was Dr Dan Wallace from Dallas Seminary and Dr ...\nI'm Charles Morris we're in a series called is the Bible true this week and that was Dr Dan Wallace from Dallas Seminary and Dr Michael Krueger both New Testament scholars speaking in the documentary the God who speaks\nTalking about what makes the New Testament book authentic\nAnd other church came to recognize these isn't that an encouragement to you even if you are a Jesus follow were that even though there have been disputes we've had the same twenty seven books in the New Testament for almost two thousand years\nWhen you read the letter the Romans you join a host of Christians you've read that book and been strengthened in their faith because of\nThe books we have our authentic not only because they bear the marks of authority the books we have our authentic\nBecause as the apostle Paul says they were breathed by God but what about the competing books that aren't in the New Testament again Dan Wallace from Dallas Seminary helping his answer that question\nWhy don't we include some of these other books like the gospel of Thomas or Phillip or marry or third Corinthians or polls letter to the ... or the acts of Paul or the revelation of John there's a second revelation of John besides the one that's in their tests but\nWhere the revelation of Peter why don't we include these books that are tests but\nThere's a fundamental reason why none of those were include that as they are not first century documents so they could not have been written by an apostle or ... that right there excludes all of these documents\nIs even today and once again I'm thankful for this new documentary the God who speaks and I really wish you could see the clips that we're listening to today\nBecause the graphics and the video really help you better understand these ancient menu scripts and why they were or were not accepted into the canon of scripture\nNow back to the question what about the competing texts well the reason they shouldn't be taken seriously is because none of them were written in the first century\nThat's in a forest to agree that they shouldn't be included in the New Testament but it gets worse if you read these ... beating texts in quotation marks and take them as scripture you'll find there are contradictions with our New Testament books\nThe gospel of Thomas tells us that the end goal is for women to become men at the end of the age\nWell the New Testament is clear that men and women will be all around the throne distinctly men and women worshipping the lord we keep our identity when we go to see Jesus\nThat's just one example we don't have time to go through other examples but there's a reason these texts haven't become a part of the church for two thousand years\nThis shows us that God is faithful to preserve his word that's a word of encouragement for us he hasn't left us to figure things out by ourselves he's actually breathe down at his word for us to take and read those\nOld words take up and read change said Augustus life he was living in sin debauchery by\nHis own confession getting her little children singing on the other side of a wall take up and read in Latin of course\nPartially getting her little children singing on the other side of a wall take up and read and lack of course and they began to read and read the lord just to cope with his wife\nTurned him into humble served with the rest of his days on earth and\nThat's what he can do for you through his work take up and read God is big pool his book is trustworthy\nThe main point though is that our New Testament is all about Jesus it's all about Jesus I Can't say that too many times it speaks to ... percent\nIt proclaims his resurrection from the debt it promises his return with life that's a true markup often to sleep because these authors saw Jesus after he died they are trustworthy so I Need to ask you\nDo you believe his work\n\nDo you want to do you implement W why do you are you in Birmingham W two three Seventy ... WDC ... to Birmingham\nAlone welcome to another edition of discoveries in hell I'm your host Chris McKay and I'm really glad you're with me today because they were going to be talking about an issue that affects each and every one of us and\nThat stress and believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about\nAny form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body but don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr Pincus is going to talk about stress and\nGive us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effect the daily stress has on our bodies\nFor those you may not know Dr ... he is a nationally recognized authority on natural an alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional and Olympic athletes and it continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns of Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThanks it's great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nWell you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we called mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the way stress affects the body is this a what a person's under stress the body transpose the stress\nInto tension and your muscles end up contract and everyone feels that in their in their upper back in ... right at a doctor\nI'm more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel such as the month of getting the artery ... up and the muscles the heart is a giant muscle over in the muscles in around your\nDigestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in the heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit on your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress okay now according to research that I've been involved with it it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen\nCounting magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people you know they just don't sleep while you wake up tired your body hurt more pretty soon it starts to wear you down pretty soon he gets sick and you have a condition that people are suffering from pain and\nWe've while you wake up tired your body hurt more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon you get sick and you have a condition of people are suffering from pain and osteoporosis and fibromyalgia and cramps and their legs and weird illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture\nAnd it has to do is not how much calcium someone's taking in their diet or how many calcium supplements or how many in Athens you chew it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress season calcium for building bones\nWell yes okay yeah and it does build your ... but you see one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shuts down actually dies\nWow and so one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one is in the diet you know and to us from the bones themselves\nThe body will ... will up absorb it back from the bones if ...\nThat's right I see and what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of the ball\nNow and it's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the Knight Tricia\nYep okay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you think that would be really easy\nSure just drink milk\nJust drink milk or you know eat a lot of green we seize vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right and second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet\nHas been decreasing in the last fifty years really yeah because things like pastures Asian foods are irradiated um the calcium as leads from the soils and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is not being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy the health food started writer right but these Cal seems don't absorb and the body that's\nUp for a couple of reasons one\nUh when you take a let's say an antacid that has the calcium in like a Tom's first of all calcium does not absorb in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment but see what happens when you take a tub\nWith an antacid oh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself is not being absorbed\nI see because it has to be in a in an as an environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the ... formula\nMy comics formula it's natural\nAnd the differences is that it's\nA powder and what happens is you put it in hot water and you mix it up and you drink it down so it's in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbs into your system\nWow so that's also a problem that well\nYeah because when calcium and museum earn a liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWow that's great matter of fact yes I'm I'm reading the can right now says a fenced absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nIt comes down to absorption one of the ways to tell if you're not observing calcium is take a look at what drugs are you're taking are you on high blood pressure medication do you need something for your kidneys or you want pain medications you need sleeping pills the calcium and especially the easiest being absorbed mhm you're not going to suffer from all these things\nMy comment formula does absorb incredibly in the body the thing is is that when you take my comments formula but not like well well I feel better I have thousands of people are ready to the doctor pain 'cause I Can't believe it thirty minutes after I took the ... the pain in my wrist went away\nNot like well well I feel better I have thousands of

their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles working real relaxed shape\nYou really wouldn't think that a such a small component of near normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed\nAnd the nutrition has greatly changed and add to that the medication so many people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs\nOr heart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium and museum in the system well those are very

smarter to the un either the never Trump crowd you know the the people to\nLook at the Supreme Court justice nominations as the end all be all the court other than for social issues people\nYou know I I just think when you when you when the courts in play that stuff seems to be a wide rallies around you know people rally around Republican side there's one kind of interesting ... with all that if this goes on and just drags on and I and I think it was a gram kinda alluded to it a little bit was\nIf this nomination does it go forward then you re nominate Kavanaugh and you give Republicans rallying cry that sort of energize the base that becomes a you know because a referendum on Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd I don't know if I'm a Democrat is as kind of dangerous territory because suddenly you already having energized based on the Democratic side\nWhat does the energized base in a post in a post presidential election midterm look like for the party in power\nThat's you know Democrats should be walking away with this thing at this point they haven't they haven't really done that yet I think this is Brett Kavanaugh thing makes it makes it really difficult for them because of some headwinds\nWell it's something we we discussed yesterday where you know history tells us that the the party in power the party party that's holding the the White House two years in usually doesn't fare well in the mid term they're after but I\nI Am seeing something first of all when it comes to Trump you're going to throw out the history books as far as what we're used to in in politics and how things play out\nOr the second of all ... and just seeing a an energized Republican base and I think this Kavanaugh stuff is working in their favor but even before that\nThey were even energized and it's because they're seeing the results of of\nWhat they ask for November two thousand sixteen which was\nBring the economy back up yet people jobs you know we understand you're going to be a jerk and you're going to say stuff that makes us cringe but we can look past that if you will just do the job of the president's supposed to do and it's the stark difference between how Republicans and Democrats view of president\nOn the Democratic side its popularity contests on the Republican side they just want to God and it's going to go in there and do a job no matter what his personality is\nYeah I don't disagree with that I I think one thing I Would add to that those ... with Donald Trump it was never it was never about popularity ... well some of it was obviously the name id and all that\nBut for the a lot of the conservatives have stuck with him it was never about him as Donald Trump the person and all all the tweets at all the extra stuff\nIt was just having a guy that was a wasn't going to come in and metal in our day to day lives with Obamacare are are are you know mandated contraception or these like really hot button issues on social issues right\nAnd it was going to be a guy that was kind of kind of protect just ... you know you live and let live way of life and make it you know do I regulations do stuff that the government wasn't going to be involved in your everyday life\nI think people look at Donald Trump in that in that regard they don't really look at him as some kind of like moral authority figure I and ...\nYour everyday life I think people look at Donald Trump in that in that regard they don't really look at him to some kind of like moral authority figure ins were Democrats or Republicans in which we conservatives liberals cut to defer the way we look at our leaders\nYou know I I think it's almost like liberals need a father figure or or something along those lines it could serve it is just needs somebody to make the government\nWork right right right yeah I agree with that uh and I just again I Want to keep the guy's updated on the the breaking news about the FBI report they're saying that that could be done as early as today one copy of that report will go to the White House the other another copy we'll\nGo to the Senate I don't know if it's going to I don't guess we'd go to the Judiciary Committee sincerity done with it but it would go to the Senate\nAnd they would review that stuff another point to make\nIs allegedly according to these reports neither ... nor four have been interviewed and most people would say oh that means it's a shame\nBut my thing is they've already been interviewed the FBI it's got the tapes of the ah the testimony in front of the committee so why would they need to interview yeah unless they're trying to ... and ... and perjury or are they going to be able to transcribe triumph right simple as that but anyway that's going on right now so I just wanted a\nKind of keep an eye on that and if anything changes uh we'll let you know but as far as\nYour production Jeff and I know you're not I mean I I don't know sometimes you don't like to make predictions but I'm going to make you do this one okay Gavin all does he get confirmed friday or and if not does he get confirmed at another time\nI've done Friday Saturday or Sunday I think McConnell keeps US citizen and such that until it gets through and I wasn't expected to be much longer than that\nWhat do you think now more play hypothetical here sang Kavanaugh doesn't get confirmed and they Trump just pull them or whatever and says you know it will just forget it will put somebody else and then\nIn a certain series of events that would obviously be a lot more complicated than my hypothetical here\nUp points him as attorney general to drain the swamp oh come on come on how good would that be 'cause think about how angry discounted I'll have to be at the Democrats right now and and the the people that have perpetrated this uh this smear campaign\nWell I I Would say this I I Know the thing about this the smear campaign we don't have to worry about Kavanaugh will be in a swing vote in the future and in a way Kennedy was\nBut he didn't see I think you want with an attorney general somebody that that is more of an administrator and not as an ideologue I think he needs somebody to go in there cleaning out the bureaucracy that knows how to bureaucracy works you need a mad as type\nAnd I you know I never saw just sessions was going to be that kind of guy I thought it was more of an ideological kind of figure\nBut I I I you know I I don't know that's that's the fifth and I I don't I Can't really tell you if he really be good in that that could kind of bureaucratic\nRoll yeah well and and I think ... I Hope I don't phrase is wrong but and Lindsey Graham proposed if he doesn't get confirmed to to ... if I'm not mistaken re nominate him and force it to be a midterm issue and a ride may write ... basically put it on the ballot\nSo you have a ... which would be interesting because suddenly make these these these Democrats are these vulnerable rich you know that he's one of all Democrats are red states they got they got to defend your decision not to back Kavanaugh you know when when Joe mansion ... ah you know Donnelly in Indiana these these these three red state Democrats\nYou're not tobacco capital you know when when Joe Manchin ... of you know Donnelly in Indiana these\nThese these three red state Democrats are necessarily put to the test and then people don't vote can they can they stopped that can stop the Republican challengers from that a campaign issue and successfully I don't think they can I think you know Democrats at this point really stand it if if it gets to that point\nAnd I I'm not you know I I don't I I think it's a long shot that the Trump would re nominated approaches but\nI did I I think it's interesting just because it does it does make\nThese multiple Democrats really had to play deep and when they need to be kind of on the off chance yeah\nI'm with you on that or here's a little ... you can hold over for one more segment we'll take some phone calls have you guys want to get into all by nine four one one zero one one you've got questions thoughts comments whatever the gate to bring it on the line Andrew jets ... poor yelling that we saw\nWith Andrew and Jessica\nW Whitey welcome to the common October fest October third through the thick join them for a live music authentic German cuisine arts and crafts vendors the classic car show in so much more special live performance\nBy American Idol Brandon now there will be on friday October fit at the comments that tall come to celebrate the German heritage at Komen Alabama and see the crowning at twenty eight ... mid October that for more information is it common October fest dot\nCom and [noise] and on\nOne Dale Johnson here with house does listen joined us every Saturday morning we got a great show is going to be a lot of good information will go talk from roofing to foundation to basements crawl spaces whatever's effect in your home so if you need answers call the show they house dodged them ... or ... every Saturday morning\nPat Toomey I'm right here on superstation one on one W\n[noise]\nReminding everybody to join us on Friday nights from nine until midnight on the best in high school football school\nWill have special get coaches interviews and take your calls and get you ready for your college football Saturday right here on your high school football leader in all of Alabama\n\nMy dream is a place and the time\nWe're America will once again be seen as the last best hope\nAbraham Lincoln where your your home town God and country station [noise]\nSuper station one oh one\n\nOur Jeff we appreciate you coming on as always you can check jump out on Breitbart you could check him out on yellow amber news dot com he's all over the place he's a he's a media traveler\nIf you will the magical media traveling that can be a good theme song through Jeff wars on that first year that buddy good to hear from you as always there you go ... who\nWere going to get him back in Studio soon although it sounds like he's in Studio when a little ... and it was a little I did a little hot is a little bit and it's All right it worked out two oh five nine four one one zero one one thing a more of your calls coming up next\nDo you want to do enough I'm Coleman W why do you are you in Birmingham\nW two three Seventy ...

concluded that the average duck system in a U.S household leaks twenty to twenty five percent of the ear that travels through it\nOkay so there's two different kinds of duck luggage first there's\nSupply leakage that's on the side of your furnace or air conditioner that blows the cold or warm air out at ya\nSo eight twenty to twenty five percent loss means that twenty to twenty five percent of the air that has created at your machine that's blowing toward your bedroom or your kitchen or your family room is lost on the way\nThat's like fives intends and twenties just floating up out of your dog work flipping through the cracks\nThen there's the other kinds of leakage return leakage\nNow this is a little more serious because our returns sometimes go unnoticed because we don't

and put on shoe covers over his shoes or boots we also call them for savers he's going to wear those each time he enters your house they'll show you the inspection and\nCleaning form and he'll say something like each of these represents a part of your heating and cooling system and as I'm going through your system I'm either going to mark okay or if I see anything ah that's going to give you challenges in the future I'm In a market\nIn this column over here and if you want me to take care of something before I leave I usually can now once he has your approval to do the tune up on his own voice he'll ask you to show him the thermostat and with your permission he'll turn it on\nThat is your approval to do the tune up on his own voice he'll ask you to show him the thermostat and with your permission he'll turn it on and make sure that it's working\nNext to ask you to show him the outdoor unit and then the indoor unit at which point he'll say something like I'm going to start your tune up now if you wanna watch that's fine and if not that's okay too and then he'll start the tuna\nNow his very first task is to take the top off of the outdoor air conditioning unit or heat pump\nNext is get the leaves and sticks and mocking debris out of the system because all that stuff holds water and Ross out the bottom of your air conditioner prematurely\nNext thing you know your compressors falling through the bottom of unit and you've got to get in a new one okay so something as simple as getting the debris out of the bottom makes a huge difference\nNow the next step in my opinion is the best we're going to use a semi high pressure nozzle just sprayed down your coils from the inside out because we've got the top off\nNow this is on your outdoor air conditioning unit right and it sucks air in from the sides and along with it\nClippings and dust and whatnot so we're going to back flush it wash\nAll that gunk back out of there and if you've got all that stuff stuck in your air conditioning system it's just like having a sweater on that baby\nNow listeners if you were I we're going to go for a jog hot summer's day with a sweater on and destroying our mouth what would happen right our bodies wouldn't be able to release the heat and we get really really hot\nWell the same thing happens to your outdoor unit your air conditioner your heat pump if it's dirty it's kinda overheat it's going to cause problems you're going to have a compressor fail you're going to have motors fail\nThe number one cause of compressor failure is dirty coils so we're going to get the outdoor coils cleaned up for you\nSometimes we even have to use a foaming cleanser to get all that stuff off and man is that a sight to see you're looking at a good forty five minutes just up to this point so you can see why I say these other maintenance is our drive by maintenance is right if they're there and gone and forty five minutes\nNext we're going to test the electrical components in your system all the connections make sure they're nice in tight makes you you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires because sometimes little things that go wrong with your air conditioning system and furnish\nIt can cause big things to go wrong All right\nYou may have a pending compressor failure because you've got a little started that's about to go bad\nYou may have a pending motor failure because you're filters all plugged up and you're not paying attention to it All right so we're going to check all of those little components every part of your system that don't cost that much at all to repair or replace\nNext we're going to check your indoor heating system or for him is we'll check the burners your pressure switches make sure your exhaust is venting out properly that would be important right we'll check all your hoses your drains your flame sensor and most importantly we're going to check your heat exchange or\nThat's the part that is known to crack and leak carbon monoxide\nThat we all know that carbon monoxide can kill you did you know that the majority of people that survive a one time ...\nNow we all know that carbon monoxide can kill you did you know that the majority of people that survive a one time carbon monoxide poisoning event have life long side effects\nDo you see now why I say that you have to have these two naps and inspections every six months you don't really have a choice\nWe are going to check the temperature difference between the air coming into your machine and the air going out of your machine\nAre going to check the duct pressure check your surge protectors your system sterilize there's if you have them but you know how your filters look and advice you whether or not there's something more time or cost effective\nAt the end of the day\nIt's about making you more comfortable in your home and saving money All right so get it tuned up it doesn't cost you anything it actually pays you to do that

[noise]\n... hill and I'm joined by my\nAmazing wife Sony Sony hello so we got a great show for everybody to Daytona we're going to talk about what to think about what you should be doing or potentially doing if you're between jobs okay we're going to go through and talk about going against the grain\nAnd some rules of some people talk about gang we will take some email questions which by the way if you would like to get your question answered on the air\nJust go to ask freedom financial dot com asked freedom financial dot com and chances are good you can get your a question to answer here on the radio or on our television show so Tony I don't\nKnow if you're aware of this but we've added a TV show\nGlee happiness I'm aware [laughter]\nSo we got one uh Saturdays eleven on CBS and one Sundays at ten thirty on Fox a which follows the Joel hosting the show so we just I've been doing that for a little while now if you want to DVR financial planning shows those are the two to\nTo DVR so let's just jump right in let's talk about or what happens if you're between jobs you know ... you and I talk about this a lot a age discrimination is alive and well ... it's incredibly difficult to to you know do anything about really right it's frustrating yeah\nWe work with a lot of people who get laid off when they weren't expecting it right or\nYou know we had a client recently that just got fed up again and just cutting anymore and just search you know I've done yeah yeah and a ... and so those are all things that we really need to plan for\nAn ... and sometimes they present opportunities\nThat could possibly you know we should probably discuss not just this is a bad thing but\nBut there's some things that they can look around and go okay now what you know what do I need to be doing yeah if if this happens if I got either just flat out fired or laid off or\nJust stepped away on my own right well one of the questions are one of the opportunities you could be asking yourself is maybe is it time for a career change not just worked for a different company or try to find something in my field\nBut sometimes people you know we sat down and talk with folks had in\nMaybe is it time for a career change not just worked for a different company or try to find something in my field\nBut sometimes people you know we sit down and talk with folks had and they've actually been thinking about that for a little while they've been thinking about something that they another\nThing that they're able to do another skill set they have and they'd like to turn that into a career and so sometimes we see people do something completely different and kind of gives them a new I guess new lease on life you know her like hey I can do this for another you know bit of time and\nInstead of just go on a I'm going to go get that same job again for another company\nSo you know I I have a story about that now that I'm I'm working with a couple of right now and uh his company's getting acquired he feels pretty certain that they're going to offer him a severance package\nAnd he um he was we were kind of in the middle of the planning and he said well you know I really want to hold off on the planning\nUntil I Know what the severance packages and so I gently suggested that maybe that was the greatest either yeah because the time to plan\nIs not after something like this has taken place right the time to plan has now right so that we have a plan\nAnd you know I was a I was given some ... I was talking to the painting and her boyfriend or the other night and we were talking about his career and job opportunities and that sort of thing and some of the stuff's stresses him out [laughter] and so Payton was saying you know if you\nIf you have a plan just knowing what the plan is will reduce your stress and\nBy the way in case people have a first outlets there's Payton is one of our daughters that right that's pretty cool that I didn't know that she said good she listens [laughter] having a plan really is I mean not that it's even like if anything if it's your career if it's your finances if that's your health\nI mean just knowing even if you come up against a an obstacle knowing like a path that you can power to through that or maybe go around it or maybe fix it or ... whatever that plan is in place they can just wonderful peace of mind and\nWell and so here's here's what you know the the gentleman that we were doing the planning for not ... but the gentleman were during the planning for he was like I really want to wait until all this settles down to to finish doing the planning and I gave him several examples while thought he was way better off than to go ahead and get a plan in place now\nAnd he paused and he said you know what you're speaking truth he said I was telling my son the exact same thing because he's graduating college\nLight's coming to him fast and it's got to decide do I go to graduate school do I go ahead and get into the workforce and I was counseling him he needed to get a plan together and figure this out so that he was he wasn't reacting he already knew what was going to happen regardless of what passage chose\nCool so he he just drank his own office exactly\nWhat he said he goes he said so you're giving me the same advice I'm giving my son you know that's good advice and so so the point here is life throws a curve balls at a camp in a lot of times we don't expect them and even if we are expecting them\nYou know in the world of retirement planning which is what we do just having a bucket of investments you know\nA portfolio of stocks and bonds or cash in the bank or whatever that's not the same thing as having thought through all of the things that you may face\nIn the differences having control it gives you a control over it and instead of just letting things happen to you\nHaven't thought through all of the things that you may face\nAnd the differences having control it gives you a control over it and instead of just letting things happen to like you said as the guy you're talking to your telling his son you know if you don't have a plan life can happen to you and you're just a victim of that instead of taking control and put a plan together and and working through that plant\nExactly so the offer we would like to make to you our listeners is that if you've been thinking about this and you're wondering\nHey do I really have everything thought through do I know what will happen if I leave my job either through getting laid off or or voluntarily do I know what my plan is exactly do I know how it's going to work if I figured out what I'm going to do about Social Security do you have a pinch and decision that you're trying to make\nYou know these are all questions that good retirement planning your answers\nAnd you know a lot of the people that we work with already have advisors that are helping them manage their money and they come in just to find out hey is there something that I'm missing\nSo effects you if you'd like to take advantage of that we do specialize in helping people with five hundred thousand dollars or more\nSaved for retirement to plan their retirement but if you think you might be a fit and you would like to come in and sit down and get a second opinion and just see am I missing something\nIs there something I haven't thought up we will do that at no cost and no obligation completely free to anybody that calls in the next ten minutes that number is ... triple zero six two oh five nine eight eight zero zero zero six\nGive us a call anytime in the next ten minutes oh we've got operator standing by that'll get time on our calendar or you'll come in and visit with us and we can help you figure this out nine eight triple zero six\nSo there's a couple of other things that could well had wins and opportunities if if you find yourself without a job later in life um one is you know what about health insurance decisions and see that a lot I'm oftentimes and people do separate from work\nLater in their career it's still before they're sixty five and they're going to get Medicare so you know there's some decisions to make their have you thought through how much that's going to cost do you take cobra which is\nI Know it's not cheap but do you take the cobra option do you let your spouse pick you up on their plan I mean there's a lot of different things in options that need to be weighed and it's it's a math equation we need to figure that out\nI'm an insurance is not free and then you know so if your employer their employers been paying for that in the past that needs to be made made a decision for you know what to do if you're leaving money behind in your four O. one K. you know you've separated from the job you've left the job\nSo what's your plan for that if you would like a plan for that one that protects you from that but also benefits when we're having times like we're having now a plan that will benefit when markets are going crazy to the outside but also protect you and your family your income when you're\nDown when the markets are down the markets are crashing if you would like to know how to do that for yourself and your family we will show you how we will do that at no cost to no obligation to you will not cost you a nickel we will sit down with your right here in our office on the corner of Caldwell mill and valley bill\nAbout a mile from oak mountain high school and we will have a lot of fun and we'll get to know each other and we will give you specific feedback on our you exposed to these things and what to do about it\nNine eight triple zero six that's two oh five nine eight zero zero zero six area code two oh five nine eight eight triple zero six\nSo now when they hit a couple of other rules of thumb that people are being exposed to here's a very dangerous one in my opinion a it's the Seventy five percent rule\nWhere it says what she retired sell these calculators that people will see either on just random website they go out there and Google or it can be on their company website or they're saying how much money they're going to need and\nYou know how much income that don't need once they retired so it it says that once you were tired only you only need about Seventy five percent as much income\nAs while you were working and earning money\nNow tad let me ask you a question of how many folks come in here ever on the like\nUrging and earning money now tad let me ask you a question of how many folks come in here ever I mean like you see anyone that said you know I just don't want to do as many things that I'm doing right now\nYeah I I'm we're going to cut out restaurants vacation we're going to cut out twenty five percent of the stuff we're doing today\nI mean I mean the thing I usually two things either\nWe just want to maintain what we're doing now we're not extravagant this is what we want to do this is how we live we like our lifestyle want to see the grand kids want to travel to Sam maybe whatever go to the beach\nThose kinds of things and I also just about as often here we like to do a few more things than we're doing right now we've been working we've been saving and we would like to do some things that we have not had the time to do before and that's going to cost us more money we get that\nBut I've yet to have somebody say I'm only I only want to do yeah I just don't want to do as much I'm going to sit around and watch TV all day\nI Do occasionally meet with people who say no we're not going to spin near as much in retirement as we're spending now because we won't be driving back and forth to work and we won't be buying clothes for work or eating lunch hour eating lunch out\nBut guess what they end up doing they replaced that was with other stuff\nSo so that so the one thing that I Would say that sometimes I have people that are thinking that but in reality that has rarely\nDo that and how ... ... yeah that's true because because even the folks that think that they're usually fearful\nThey're afraid you know they want to think they're going to spend less and they want to you didn't want to imagine that they're going to earn more and they want to hope that the taxes aren't going to be as much I mean they've got this thing in their head is trying to make them feel OK about everything well feelings are one thing in reality and truth to something else\nAnd when folks come in here and really want to plan a real plan put together what they really want to know is hey how will I really the okay I don't want you just a pat me on the head and telling me everything's fine and while the while I'm kind of going backwards over here [noise]\nUm because what they really want and need deep down is the truth and what's really going to happen and how do we really make this work because the whole thing is about confidence you know if\nIf we can put a plan together for folks and they were not going to run out of money the other ... part of it is how can they confidently see that not just as long as we this happens as long as that happens and\nYou know sure hope that happens and then everything's going to be fine I mean you've got to have plans for that\nYou use that term a lot how do you confidently go into retirement how do you confidently spend your money and we work with some people who are scared to spend any of their money ... because they're afraid of running out\nAnd if they get the right plan in place than they can see OK here's exactly how I'm going to generate the income here's here's my income replacement plan yes in an income replacement plan is not\nJust going to pull me I'm going to pull money out and hope I don't live through a decade like the two thousand sites because that is a\nSerious potential recipe for disaster right so if you're\nAbout these things if you're trying to figure out how am I going to replace my income how am I going to replace my paycheck\nWill we be able to spin confidently can we sustain the lifestyle we've got now\nYou've probably got somebody you're already working with\nWho may be given you the platitudes that Tony just talked about pat and you're on the head and telling your everything's going to be fine\nAnd you know what maybe it is but is it worth getting a second opinion from someone that does nothing but do retirement planning all day long because we think there's a big difference between somebody to just managers your money and somebody that knows how to plan for the next twenty Thirty years of your life at all\nSending all day long because we think there's a big difference between somebody to just managers your money and somebody that knows how to plan for the next twenty Thirty years of your life in all the things that surround that if you'd like to take advantage\nOf understanding what that entails what all goes into complete retirement planning\nWe're happy to sit down with you and show you in detail here the things that you're doing now here are the areas where we think you need to pay more attention and you need some fixes and we walk through and show you here's how we go about fixing those things\nYou'd like to take advantage of that it will not cost you a nickel\nIf we decided to work together after that analysis we will make that decision mutually sometimes we work together sometimes we don't but our goal is that you will walk out of here with more clarity\nThan you've ever had around your retirement planning and what needs to happen for you to have their retirement that you want if you'd like to take advantage of that we do specialize in helping people with five hundred thousand dollars or more plan for their retirement if you'd like to take advantage of this offer\nCall now nine eight eight triple zero six that's two oh five nine eight eight triple zero six\nNine eight eight zero zero zero\nSix so one more real and what a tack on and I don't get others but this one's an important one and I'm always shocked that people have never heard this role so we already talked about the Seventy five percent role which means some people think they're only going to need Seventy five percent of what they need while they're working in income [noise]\nThink about it like this to now there's the four percent role and a lot of people haven't heard of that which\nSays that you should be able to take four percent of their money from your portfolio and each year ... without running out of money and so talk about the four percent are all really quick and how that's even change if\nPeople have heard about a withdrawal rate rule they've heard of the four percent rule\nOr many many people that have I ever heard of any any role yeah so the four percent rule was created by a guy named William ... and he did a study back before the turn of the century so like in the late eighties early nineties he looked at every thirty year rolling period in the markets for like a hundred years and\nWhat he what they arrived that was a diversified portfolio stocks and bonds if you pull four percent out you should be able to take that percentage out index for inflation and not have to worry about run out of money\nSo think about this million dollars sounds like a lot of money right four percent of that is forty thousand forty thousand dollars a year\nSo think about it I mean we know you're not going to spend just Seventy five percent of your of your income you're going to need at least a hundred percent of it and then if you've got a million dollars it's forty thousand dollars a year now has ... by that Israel\nNow here's the kicker Vin the two thousands happened and so on the water to stay a lot of killing a lot of\nPeople ... back through\nThis study and said Mm So that four percent rule works as long as you don't live through a decade like the two thousands if you lived through a decade like the two thousands the study that I'm most familiar with or is it was done by fidelity and they said you better only be pulling two point eight\nPercent just twenty eight thousand twenty eight thousand of them down and really right now one of the things that that that\nAre assuming in those things is that you're gonna live through those to market crashes and there's nothing you can do about it that interest rates are low which they are now which is definitely a compounding factor for people in terms of making it challenging and has a plan right so this four percent rule\n... a lot of people don't even know it so so that they'll come in here Tony ... and they're taking five six seven eight percent out and no one yeah no one has told them you\nIt'll come in here Tony ... and they're taking five six seven eight percent out and no one yeah no one has told them you can't be doing\nRight that's too much and well and it's it is it's suicide you're just blowing through too much too fast I mean you just it's it's not a recipe there are ways to make\nThese things work I'm self yes they're really ... I mean we're not ripple still skin we can't spend straw into gold we we ... this is one of those rules where\nWhere we can a massage\nThat depending on what somebody's goals are in my opinion on how soon they come see how soon can that's right that's another big they're already doing it a little tough if you've got ten years before retirement or less\nMhm it's time yeah yeah the city ... ten years that\nThat that's the ... runway we have the better we can manage that four percent and get leverage out and get leverage and do a better you know ... and potentially get you more than that in ways that will protect your income for both lifetime yes\nJust hang in there you know if the yeah the markets will go up they'll go down sure will lift the crashes but just hang in there the markets come back they always do\nThat is true historically but it doesn't matter if you're pulling money out there are a lot of different tools that we can use and the financial services industry we can use cash CDs we can use gold silver we can use stocks we can use\nBonds inside stocks and bonds where there's all kinds of different asset classes and there's large captors domestic there's international bonds there's high yield there's treasuries here's all kinds of stunts we can use a\nAnnuities we can use life insurance we can use you know mutual funds that give us diversification among stocks and bonds are ATS which are usually lower cost versions of mutual funds there are a lot of different\nTools out there here's what I don't understand I don't understand how some people say that some tools are good and other tools are bad\nTool is just a tool and cameras a hammer it's only good or bad through the lens of what are we trying to do and we're trying to drive a nail it's great if we're trying to cut aboard not so much\nSo you hear all this stuff about annuities right so this is a retirement planning show mhm and we teach people how to plan their retirements\nAnnuities are one of the only tools that were actually created for retirement planning mhm right yeah stocks and bonds were not created for retirement plan they were created\nFor ways to company for companies to raise cash and ... you can profit in the meantime if you help um raise their cash bite or buying into their company are loaning the money that's a ... stock or a bond\nSo you hear all this stuff about annuities all these opinions you know I'd rather die and go to hell and sell somebody an annuity or you know don't put money in annuities they're bad awful so let's let's just talk about that for a second okay okay 'cause this is one of the probably the biggest areas where we go against the grain\n[noise] here's the bad stuff you hear about annuities are don't put money in a new itty because if you die the money disappears that is a myth there are some annuities where\nIf you just get a single life payout with no what's called a period certain that will happen I've never met anybody that wanted that so as a consequence we've never done that [laughter]\nBut are they do exist that that kind of a new leaf like people's pensions at work a lot of times if they rise to that is like a pension that worry that\nPeople don't want that the reason they take the lump sum on their pension is because they don't want to die and have no money left for their kids right they don't want something happened early in their retirement and no money to be ... left that's why they take the lump sum usually try\nOr they don't trust the company that's giving them the pension us I hear that sometimes but that that thing about dying and the money not being left your kids is a myth as long as you're using the right kind of annuity\nUh what's your ... you want to use the right kind of deferred annuities or the other one is you put your money and you can't ever get it back out again that's a myth there are that same kind of annuity where the money disappears that's the case with those but with the vast majority of annuities\nYeah that's a myth there are that same kind of annuity where the money disappears that's the case with those but with the vast majority of annuities particularly deferred annuities you can get your money back out you you can turn on income stream and get your money out you can usually take\nTen percent a year out without any penalty\nOr you can take all your money out but there will be a penalty if you do it early in the contract mhm so a lot of times these contracts will last for seven ten even twelve years so you can get money out during the mean time\nBut you can only get a certain percentage every year but if you've got a bucket of money and you're taking more than ten percent of your out you're taking too much out and retirement anyway he has to hide withdrawal rang so that's a math\nUm the other thing that are chuckle about is people say oh a don't ever buy an annuity because the person you get it from\nEarns money when you get it [laughter]\nIt always jak all of that because the people telling you that work for free right\nAround [laughter] now they do that so if I owe the only reason somebody wants you to buy an annuity is because they get paid a commissioned by the insurance company okay well the same people say and that stuff the only reason they want you to put your money in their\nMutual funds or their portfolios is because they get paid a percentage yeah when you put your money and it's like that's a that's a silly yeah silly\nThing in my opinion I there are people that disagree with the stuff I'm misses the going against the grain thing right yeah so now let's talk about what a knew what he can do for people came right now\nThere are annuities that will go up when the stock market goes up but they will not go down when the stock market goes down so for people that are risk averse how attractive as that yep we're trading off some of the upside of the stock market\nAnd people need to understand that but for a lot of people they're fine with that yeah if\nI Know I can gain when the market goes up but I'm not a lose when the market goes down I'll take\nA not having the same upside potential right some people don't want that in that case it's not a good thing there are a new and he's where you can put an income provision on them for every year you wait that income will go up I\nPending on how old you are when you start we'll call at eight percent a year fixed mhm\nSo it's like Social Security you can start taking Social Security sixty two but every year you wait it's going to go up by eight percent of that you can have annuities that will do the same thing so you can put money and now in target an income stream in the future\nAnd you know exactly how much income that's going to get you you don't have to worry about what the markets are going to do in the next five or ten years or what interest rates are going to do you know exactly what it's gonna do right right right so from a planning perspective that brings a lot of certainty to the table and it helps it that four percent role than it helped the foresight role\nIn it enables people to spin confidently\nBecause that income stream will last for how long\nFor lifetime for both lifetime caps as long as either a person is still living and if you if something happens to you and there's money left in the contract even if you started the income\nIf something happens to you and there's money lots of the contract it goes to your family right so so these myths that you would hear right or just that I mean again yeah you'll get there's there's a very small percentage of annuities that have those drawbacks and but most of them don't and if you know what you're talking about\nThan than you or if you know what you're looking for and what questions to ask you know how to have the ones that you would do the stuff you want and not the stuff you don't and most people once they\nWhat you're looking for and what questions to ask you know how to have the ones that you would do the stuff you want and not the stuff you don't\nAnd most people once they've got the income I think that all the stuff like they have just like their work and that that all the things taken care of then they feel pretty confident about having some market gross stuff you know some participation\nWe're ... able in a lot of cases that have been more aggressive yeah the ... stock money because of that stuff they're just it's like having now we've got their bills paid it had it can sleep at night right right\nIt's a it's a beautiful thing um but but again they're not all the same please be working with someone that knows what they're doing and that's all he ended up in has all the different all the different entities that their exposure ... disposal rather than just on one company and this is the only thing\nWell in one thing I Want to be careful of variable annuities get explained a lot of times like that it'll do up on them our hands out but it won't go down with the market goes down they get explained like that's what they're doing and that's not what they're doing yeah\nSo you want to be using in our opinion you want to be using the right types of fixed annuity yes now I'm not I don't hate variable annuities\nBut people think they're taking less risk than they are a lot of times with variable in right and there's just a better life easier so I'm not a big variable annuity fan um but I don't hate him yeah I mean I've seen situations where they will be okay the best I mean people will come in here and they've got variable annuities\nIn in the best thing for them is to keep it\nOh yeah I mean once they've already bought it wouldn't have\nThey've already got it yeah it would have been probably better not something else for exactly but if they've got it we keep it so so annuities or a polarizing topic you know you hear people say oh I've just heard horrible things about him so we just covered\nThe horrible stuff that you and when we asked people what horrible things have you heard usually they say I'm not sure I don't know ... I don't know I'd just rather bad yeah so let's quantify what's the bad stuff that you hear and where did it come from yeah\nSo there are you know a certain minority of the new ways to do those things but there's a the vast majority that don't have those drawback try\nYou know all of them almost all of them have surrendered penalties and so you got to be very clear on what the surrender penalties are and you've got to be okay with that\nBut it actually freezes up to give people income that they can half are both lifetimes I think of it like given a pinch and then we can take and put more money in a grocery market and capture more of the market's up side when it's doing well without having people freak out and not be able to sleep when the markets are correct right yeah [noise]\nSo if you are wondering gee\nMakes sense for me to sit down with hadn't Tony and just see are there are some things that can better protect my retirement are there ways we can do income planning that I hadn't thought of before are there ways we can capture upside of the market while still protecting ourselves in our family on the downside", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "07"}
