C. into a massive ongoing temper tantrum\nBut perhaps no incident better express the protesters tenuous hold on sanity\nThan a demonstration at the Supreme Court where protesters mostly women broke through a police line and barge the capitals chamber where they proceeded to whale Nash teeth and pound the doors wall Kavanaugh was being sworn in inside\nSome of the protesters who managed to get all the way to the doors themselves tried desperately to claw their way and even though the doors were clearly locked and look petty\nScratch your eyes out [laughter] [laughter]\nOh my gosh [noise]\n... it took some time for them to give up it may take much longer for them to regain their sanity\nWell though regain that sounded even those paycheck stopped coming in\nClose the door oh my\nGosh [noise] grow up a\nIt was getting out of the phones hello Richard how are you\nAt Michael yeah saw the video you're talking about ... nuts [noise] oh but we need to make sure this thing's days in the right\nNow for the next thirty days does never underestimate the Republican Party's ability to snatch the jobs\nAre for being stupid oh one of the things that I Would do if I was in some of these campaigns are will will with one of the groups that at the ability to run ads but they take some of these um is there was a comment and I was watching Fox whatnot and it was a girl or a woman\nAnd she started going into Iran about we're going to attack where you live ... ... and worst league and the little host I Can't remember who it was just what you look through it without a solid and just the other types of such attack me and my job and she\nAnd she just went on back in the end all of these what we\nNeed to be presented before the paint all it did really well a mob yes I thought was the big one yesterday all of a Lynch mob and that's exactly what we would do is give the Democrats power that's got to be up front but\nA question isn't that the Republican smart enough to keep it all the all the ... farm\n... man I'm driving to work so I got was\nBank in Virginia so very much Richard and now it's a good ... a very good point you know you got to keep the momentum there because one of my concerns\nIs that there are too many people on on the right now they're going to view this as though it's the ultimate victory yeah we want to Kavanaugh and yeah we want to Kavanaugh confirmed by the end of the day is not going to affect the majority of people's lives\nAnd I fear that too many people out there are going to look at this though is the ultimate victory so we don't have to show up at the midterms\nThe last thing we need is a ... author raw or impeached\nThe last thing\nWe need is a ... foot raw or impeachment attempts\nFolks impeachments are that is something you you are you you employ something that you appeal to as rarely\nAs we possibly can now we've got impeached over here ... they're All right and the Trump do it you got pets\nImpeach capital and Trump does what nominates the conservative\nYou couldn't play those those are the sex card again you can't play the assault card again 'cause I refuse to believe that every single man in America has a pending assault case against him\nThey got nothing if he nominates that female yeah she's married seven kids two of them she adopted who are\nPeople of color yeah one of 'em so special needs kids as well not the the to adopt these uh\nUnapologetically pro life mhm Hoover conservative what are they going to what kind of accusations that can bring it on her yeah oh well she actually colored are here with clarion\nAnd not you know I've never lived up to uh-huh she she didn't go to Paul Mitch will get there yeah I went to the to the mall I don't know\nAnd and that's how ridiculous it's become let me tell you how ridiculous the lead wonders why after Labor Day did you did you hit the bill Cosby there trying to get Bill Cosby out of prison and do you know part of the reason why in Cosby's own words to run for office no cause he doesn't want to be there\n\nAre no I'm Serious so so my who's trying to get him out of prison is a journey of because he doesn't want he doesn't want to be there [noise]\nWash the Shawshank Redemption once and you know everybody's in ... and then here\nBut you know it it's still it's still speaks to just the ... of it all\n\nWe we would be just absolutely frozen in time if we had to go through a bunch of impeachment proceedings as it relates to Capitol but you know what else would happen if the courts were stalled out while this was going on what is Trump to how does he responds get my executive pan out\n\nI just I I Can't I don't know clogging up the door Wally gnashing of teeth like they're going to let you in some how you're going to ... I mean I realize it's all for optic I get that but at the end of the day I mean have you know shame if you are willing to sell out your soul\nFor the purposes of getting a couple of hundred dollars to beat on the chamber's door and 'cause you know something these guys have a stellar corporate career in front of them\nAnd that that ought to say something on the power of this storm that's coming up into the Gulf it's going to be a big one\nYeah it ... it might be because it's drawn I don't know if it actually change the director or because it's that time of year when it does change anyway but it never changes powerful I don't remember ... years are doing that are in that manner for years out here anyway\nOr did you hear I Would never believed to hear the R woman yelling in the Arabic or or Muslim who I Know oh did you hear that oh the protesters yelling that in the halls of a of our state Capitol\nHenry what where is this going no I I I didn't have a sense of okay I'm Sorry you're offended I I don't I don't know I didn't hear it I Wonder\nHow long before they start throwing shoes [laughter] and uh all the other Muslim oh idiot sacred she's anyway I what what happened to a Manafort he went to a locked down\nFor Henry so far you his five subject matters we're nowhere near today\nWell when you start talking about big it sure just makes my mind race [laughter] [noise] but metaphor went to prison isolation because he was accused of tampering or talking to a witness yet these people\nTalk to witnesses and try to get him to change their tune and none of them went to jail and those protesters\nAnd the main leadership of the ...\nThe shows and try to get him to change their tune and none of them went to jail and those protesters\nAnd the main leadership of the Democratic party have no difference in what they say so you're looking at the mainstream Democratic Party has become exactly as the crazy protesters\nThere is no difference so there is if you have someone like the crazy Democrats that worked for a\nA one Democrat Bernie Sanders go out and try to kill twenty five Republicans on a ball field and change the course of the Congress\nAnd the house of representatives in a coup attempt\nThese are the same ... there are the established Democrats their their ... their mindset is not far from that same\nIdea that they they have in their mind to take out Republicans no matter what there's just not because a truck if anybody thinks this is because of Trump's they haven't learned anything in the last Thirty years\nYeah I got interested in this in the eighties when I had a crew of a\nQuick Henry again because it's going to get to speaking\nPainters take a take one of my crew boats and all of a sudden I tried to tell anybody if their life was in danger so I just walked off the job and I have the privilege of doing that I I Do walk off the job if I find it morally wrong\nAnd and I told you the story reporting on and on this\nBecause ah last march or February I forgot now I called you and I told you that there was going to be a ... and it would give us a thirty five year renaissance of\nConservatism and you said that I was mighty optimistic you don't like it when I said that I had never even consider what has gone on with ...\n... so what do you think about my city now and I was wondering if it's just optimism or the the the criteria you used to validate that\nHenry and getting getting having all confirmed it is is not not a red wave in the making we have no idea what's going to happen in the midterms\nAnd thirty five years as a massively long political period of time to make such an accusation so I Will I Will temper my predictions I think we're going to be okay in the midterms if we get the votes out there\nBut as far as having some kind of massive red wave still don't see it I I see a successful mid term but I don't see some math massive shift further to the right you got a lot of Democrats out there that are in fact in trouble\nYou know we might gain you know three or four seats out of this particular thing but again that does not a red white and make and even if we do survive the midterms thirty five years again is entirely too long of a stretch\nWell for one thing you need to stop using wave it's a ... a nominee and then the government and believe in the ... the ... listen Henry doing since two thousand and Ken\nWe're that the Republicans come out and vote and change and the net terms several times I took that into a into a consideration\nAnd kind of took on a couple of the things I Know I'm running out of time yeah join you been out to him actually\nWell I guess I should do Michael is with fitness line out of my wheels\nOkay I've been you know you gotta take care of that and I'll get this call off my board Hello John how are you\nGood morning before I get into my comments I wanted to make something you mentioned about the\nWe'll get this call off my board Hello John how are

Feinstein what she said during her confirmation for the appeals for tractor on religion you remember that\nOh yeah that was a riot insult I thought that was that certain extent if it's going to be born at I think her name is ...\nI think it is yeah but now it's a good point because you know ... and James had reference that earlier as well they can't they can't pull the sex card out this time around they will have to do and if they go if they go all against religion or they hit her you 'cause you know there is no religious test\nTo hold office in this country and if they make it into one wow you're going to see a backlash like I don't think they've ever seen before\nThat is what happened there Michael but somehow that got slapped down the liberal media didn't push it but that Diane that was an absolute or they're just as if she would have been a moslem you to never saw it but but you know what I was just my thoughts were on the uh most of those folks in the protest it I don't think\nThey can be very religious doesn't that none of them know remember the eighth amendment ... you're ...\nYou're sure with you know and and and that's a good point but I mean I don't think any of

first go to make just call and then we're going to talk about this on the other side this is just a a fun little discovery\nThat uh we made on the Internet earlier today\nThat um I [laughter] I guess\nMaybe it speaks to the me too movement I just can't get my head wrapped around this one but ah we'll share that with all the other side but first let's get the ... hello manage\nOur you hey what's up just hanging around\nHere either early high position with the individual performance this weekend [noise] thousand yards passing yards rushing welder session and three tax justice does have it all this going to Dan ...\nYou're going beyond or something [laughter] I like it [noise] five it also\nHas there you go there you go thanks very sharp ...\nYeah yeah\nKavanaugh for high it's been

so yeah\nAnd and there's that yeah ...\nAll right we come back on the other side rules for your relationship\n\nSo you haven't seen this one I haven't seen that oh my gosh this one is priceless I'm ... and I in danger of breaking some of these rules do pretty much all of them 'cause I'm a guy uh yeah we all pretty much a did to break all of them yeah\nAccording to ah the author of this story why it is not uncommon for couples to have unspoken rules to ensure a happy relationship one woman took it to the extreme by drafting a lengthy contract detailing twenty two requirements for her boyfriend to sign\n[noise] she's single still just as good stuff they list\nActually surfaced on line on a website called board panda shared images are with comments from El horrified readers as well\nYeah\nIf you have to have a contract going into a relationship you have no relationship\nYeah well last month there was a a a bride\n... list of rules and regulations for her upcoming wedding\nWell last month there was a a a bride was was the rules and regulations for her upcoming wedding their way out on Reddit and shocked many years was over there including some stipulations such as timely refrain from up staging the ride on her big day\nAnd no admission to the wedding without a gift or Seventy five dollars or more\nNow that was the ...\nThis was a wisdom about twenty two little Biddy from this particular young lady directed at the boyfriend compliance with and this just goes to show you how completely disenfranchised from reality some of these younger people are\nYou are not to have a single girl's phone number I wouldn't even be able to do my\nJob number two\nYou are not to follow them or any social media including Instagram Snapchat and Twitter\nNumber three you are not to hang out with Keegan\nObviously another girl ... because it says including his house or anywhere in public\nNumber for you or not to go to Honda without me probably a reference to a a night spot civic and pulled out whatever I hear\nRight right that that's threatening oh yeah ... took him to uh yeah no doubt\nYeah so I think you know at the end of the day yeah you might want to be with her\nShe is ah what is commonly referred to as psycho\nYes and you know the reality of it is and you look at people like the three of us and not being around women is an impossibility right I mean first off my boss her boss and our boss or all female you know the majority of my guests my regular gas anyway whether Cindy Brown who's outlaw ways the ad on\nFifteen Years older than me or if it's making bars he was perpetually forty years younger than me or whatever the\nCase may be you know I'm communicating with these females all of the time\n\nAnd I could not get away from that for nothing I Am I'm In a relationship that I'm In I guess what 'cause I Want to be in it you may\nNot out of fear and then you look at this and and you start to superimpose some of these questions over this administration just from a political perspective and you start to see how a lot of these folks really do believe\nI mean I Wish I had the time to kind of more this over and do a Donald Trump list which I Do not but I'm a law like there are some people out there that are out of there ever loving noodles I mean I just\nDon't ask me how to even be I mean the audacity of buddies that you make a ... like that that that makes no sense would do would actually bow down to that cow down to any of it yeah\nWell you know you're starting to oppose things like the me too movement over this and the accusations leveled against Kavanaugh and whatnot and we'd heard you know all this nonsense about you know we have an attack on man attack on white man they're attacking a black man you know we have an attack on sanity in this country and there are a lot of people out there\nThat are just have completely lost their ever loving minds are for some of this stuff\nAnd I know it's funny I Know it's kind of fun but it really does speak volumes to the way people are thinking around here are these days\nI totally agree with him or\nYou can have a single girl's phone number\nI mean I I'm I'm date in the water at that point right there must have all those women\n[laughter] despite the fact that I speak to them rarely my sister's act like they are\nAnd so I've got them on my phone of course my nieces numbers my phone I got cousins numbers in my phone my bosses numbers in my phone some of the people that we interview on this program are in my phone\nAnd it just kind of makes me wonder what kind of insecurities somebody walking around with\nBut you know that that I think that one of the last one that I Would have huge have a problem with you have to takes me back in ten minutes mhm really really you mean you have it takes you back in ten minutes but I never heard the rules that she put out for herself\nWas the thing is I I'm not one is called but my my daughter will call me sometimes my oldest and if I don't rent or anything if I don't answer assuring me back again and again and again and again\nAnd I think there are people out there that feel like we're supposed to always walk\nWith our our phone is that what's aside arm just don't do that you know when I'm when I'm reading stuff I'm reading stop what about the phone down the charge or whatever the case may be I don't look at the darn thing\nWell it's a side arm just don't do that you know when I'm when I'm reading stuff I'm reading starting to put the phone down the charge or whatever the case may be I don't look at the darn thing right I might not see a text for an hour maybe too but you better takes me back the next ten minutes or there's going to be H E you know what to pay\nWhere we will be over 'cause you know I I we were eleven minutes\n[laughter] yeah then that takes you back its Hofer [laughter]\nWell you know also this one here you know you're not to look at a single girl\nI Can't look at my mom saying much t._v.\nWell you know something else too is that when I had a surgery you know I had a corny replaced\nAnd they purposely asked me when you replace this do you want to be able to see far or near\nAnd I said look I'm In the media I Want to be able to read and I can read these as you can tell I have no glasses on and the small screen and I'm reading directly off the list ... but I certainly look over it and you're very clear to me ... James and it's much fuzzier because I Can't I'm nearsighted I can see that far\nI can have a woman walk right in front of me and at a certain distance I Can't even tell which gender she has now that can be partly because of my eyesight it can be partly because it's hard as hell was gender they are these days but you know and by extension you know I I could have a woman walked out on a beach and I'm I'm doing this\n[laughter] you know that it it as\nA girl or is that our ... you know I I have no idea right and so you know it's so funny you can't you know what are you supposed to do like you know it's a ah a bass Alaska like from the Harry Potter stories where you take a look at his eyes and you turn the stone\nSo anyway I just I I ran across that I thought you know this is exactly the kind of the intellectual challenges that we're facing in this country to\nName but she has to be a sort of a certain age MIKE SHE has to be I think it'd be in the twenties there is no grown woman coming up with a stimulus like that ... no no\nNo a grown woman might have that list in her heart and her head off of it but those are going to be mostly unspoken rules until you violate one of ... because a lot of women have that goes understated role you better not cross this line but they don't tell you what the line is on the darn thing is moving anyway yeah is\nThat what it is they're moving on this moving line yeah I I constantly run into mhm yeah uh I think I rented a couple of times a week yeah\nYeah you too yeah no kidding no I did have the whole weekend for me yeah yeah yeah I screwed up they would you do\nI deal with most talk show host published shouldn't do when they go home I was I told\n'em [laughter]\nI mean so you got on the list [laughter] ... job to ... yeah you know is unspoken\nRule for talk show host that you know in radio and TV you shouldn't talk radio\nAnd I went home and I started talking and that was the wrong thing to do yeah\nDid you say something bad or was it just talking in general oh you know I I we know you you know how we get on subjects and you get passionate about something\nYeah I went down the road like a I got a whole lot of trouble yeah I see some up opposite so can you share no you don't tear no okay All right\nThough I was in trouble let's get up to the phones in the wool suits on ... mind and don't talk a little bit about the ... hey Murphy puts up\nA a you know those of us with the gift of gab or not honored within our own homes like the profits\nBut um I you know I Know it was a little while ago data resurrecting Henry for a moment here and his whole thirty five year whatever you're going with their ... and Michael you and I've had this discussion before about how frequently we get a progressive president\nWhatever is going with their and Michael you and I've had this discussion before\nAbout how frequently we get a progressive president and I was just I had to go back and double checked myself and look at it is in originally when I have that thought a few years back\nUm was it you know it's a lovely thirty to forty year time span but it's actually less than that than barring things like gay an assassination attempt or look at twenty five years you know obviously give or take\nBut ah before we get the next you know rock Obama before we get the next whatever and\nWe can't forget that in between we get the semi progressive ... ... if you look at Bill Clinton as a as a mold but he was somebody who got caught with his hand and the humid or so we had to go center in order to keep his reputation and all that sort of stuff\nSo we'll go through this period of\nProsperity as the economy recovers and everybody goes back to work and then will drift into complacency and we'll end up even further down the line than where we are now\nAre where we were a couple of years ago so it's I Would love to be as optimistic as Henry but I you know history just doesn't bear that out\nNo it doesn't mean that is that's where he does not and and that's why you know I challenged him on the thirty five years now I can see ten years of possibly\n... and you know as you point out this country will at some point in time shift back towards the moderate center because typically nations do that particularly this one\nAnd so you're going to some because late in this tournament you point out you know Clinton did get a bit more on the moderate side and this and that's what I think one of the things that so startling about the extremism\nBut what happens is as you point out the pendulum will swing right then it'll swing back left and in past administrations just like a metronome that as you know picking away on a piano it typically will move to the extreme a little further where the cycle\nWell yet it interestingly enough when looking at Reagan and Trump as basically being two of the top presidents certainly not the only ones but maybe in the top five\nOut of the forty five we have or have had a their former Democrats you know you know it's it's interesting that recently you know within the last forty years my lifetime that there was the best presidents we've seen\nCame from the other side well of course we're still moving towards the left in general throughout the whole entire country\nYeah you know it is interesting you've got the Democratic philosophy and then you've got the Democrat Party in the case of Republicans you've got with not so much the Republican right because they seem to be a very much all rhinos but then you also have the Republican philosophy itself and you've got these two political\nOr you know philosophies richer constantly crashing with in the other the difference is that you got people within those parties trying to manage their was philosophies and they often times don't share them\nThe most common of these illegal drugs most often smuggled into America is what is called Mexican ...

we're twenty days\nI think we'd go all the way through friday we're just not back on on November the fear is that is I think that's right okay I think that's what my little letter ... letters that nasty gram said go the phones skip not welcome to the\nProgram morning It's MORNING John good morning how are you that\nI'm Matt I'm furious rate okay\nI uh went about my daily affairs they\nAre tending to my business YES Network Yes sir and I had the audacity to think that the government workers are going to be doing their jobs\nToday was just another ordinary day for me I made the terrible mistake of thinking that other people would be a tendency to their work and I could trust and rely that they would be at their job so I could conduct my affairs was I\nAnd I could trust and rely that they would be at their job so I could conduct my affairs was I grossly mistaken the government shutdown today for Columbus Day\nI it makes me mad that uh that I Can't get\nCertain things done on this arbitrary dance being being set aside for for non productive work I think we have enough stupid holidays in this country I think we should start cutting back on them and putting people back to work and and so people can rely on others to be at the station so to speak\nYes they have to be out there giving do the best of their ability I mean to each according to his need and according to his ability and how we got to do that if we have these\nHolidays and we the people get darker are out here just recognizing indigenous people's day and the government is not working celebrating Christopher Columbus ... what kind of leadership does that show well\nI think I think if you if you as an individual thinker that Columbus Day is really important then you should have a party at your house later tonight after you've done your work or don't you don't\nSay hey hey [laughter]\nI Will be ... I Will be having a dream today\nMan I'm furious but um but I think that maybe slightly more serious now I think that if you want time away from work of any government worker or anyone\nUnder the auspices of the government holiday system if you think that you are entitled to it a day off you should have to explain yourself or write an essay in the ... it'd be darn well correct explaining what the holiday was all about and by the way you better spell it properly can't spell the name properly\nYou get in the day off [laughter] that's the way that fire and now I'm worried about that in just\nMadam just blowing off steam and I'm just glad that someone is listening to me because otherwise I'd have to go full children get arrested\nI'm Glad you're around like you'd get a dog I presume that we're going to line\nEverybody up in the parking lot very similar to how the protesters did in Washington DC did you see this big day\nThat the police just go through and say hey if you want to get arrested getting this line if you want to if you don't want to be arrested get in this law to the ... and we'll go and give you a green armband just like you know with the at the little kitty carnival\nGet an armed battles corral ride when they were doing it yeah we were watching it live I was like are they going on a rollercoaster ride over here in them or not\nYes and did you know that it got even better when it came to friday okay there were there were fewer protesters you know one of the reasons why\nBecause they were getting arrested law enforcement's [laughter]\nOkay we're doing the same thing as yesterday if you want to get arrested get in this law you don't want to get arrested you need to get on out here it's so it's not exactly like they do in the movies I beat down ... we've got dragged un pulling her by her hair if that were in the beat up the guy that would mean the paddy wagon get shut up hit their head on the door\nUm Frankenstein\nWe all we always know that there are women right right but the thing is in that world there was one thing she did not say\nIn the whole space Collins yeah did you listen to the whole speed listen\nTo the whole speech there was one thing she did and so you know hopefully what this is what her constituents won't\nSay I think we're I think we all go ... if somebody's going to be shocked\nI did you need to put this down because I understand the concept I Do not agree because I don't think the facts lined up that way\n\nBut Doug Jones US Senator from Alabama that never should have been\n\nIs trying his best because it's hard it's especially hard on his side of the aisle\nHe's trying his best to say\nThat\nHis job is to know all the information look at all the information know the background and make the choice that will be best for\nThe country\nI Believe that is true when it comes to some new regulations\nI Believe that is true when it comes to some new regulation some new policy that changes the way we look at ... uh the um\nHow many sheep can be grown here and there and how that will be products or whatever\nRight because I I've I face some of that when I was in the legislature and and people have these different views like we need to vote always the way the people won't well\nI've seen a number of situations where own day war and when something comes out\nSeventy five percent of the people were for\nA week later the people find out wait a minute there's some stuff in there I didn't know was in there now you're down to fifty percent of the people were for it right and you keep talking about it and people like\nWait a minute it's going to do that well his his well why is that it's going to benefit who I thought you said it was ... everybody's mom got a birthday cake I'm for that\nAnd then a mutt than thirty percent of the people were for it if we had voted on day one we would've passed legislation that I knew was bad you thought it sounded good\nBut you didn't have all the information so the argument is can be made\nThat\nA person campaigns on their beliefs campaigns own their world view their philosophy and people lack them based on those things and they say okay take that stuff we approve\nOf what you believe in we were approve of view we trust you go do the best job 'cause we're going to work our jobs we're not going to keep up with it I cringe sometimes with the idea of you just don't want the people won't\nGo sometimes considering the people don't have all the information\nThey can make a bad decision that's why we don't have a democracy that's why we don't have mob rule it but I Do enjoy it but at the situation like having a\nThe American people had the information all that are almost all the information and for Doug Jones do look at that information especially being a former prosecutor exotic when say oh yeah he's guilty\nWell and him saying that it was skewed from the very beginning yeah no it was a yeah I I was not and she didn't Susan Collins did not say that either\nBut she was voting for her people in her district or whatever and that kind of upsets me you know as an independent you know I'm not a ride them out of left you know and I'm just\n... I'm just throwing it out there as a person just like with Doug Jones if I was hurt people okay yeah you you said are you voted the way I wanted you to vote but you didn't say you were doing it for me\nSo you want them to say they're doing it for you is that that's part\nOf it let's say or listening to us okay you see what I'm saying I won't I won't Doug Jones to listen to us\nHow well what if the half that what if more what if one more person than half in Maine\nBelieves that Kavanaugh was some sort of predator because that's what ... and then she should vote for with the white hurt people won't hurt a vote even if he's not a predator or\nShe should vote the way the people that voted hurting in want her to vote but then you just say a second ago that you believe that what I Would say it was true was for the most part yes looking at the fact looking at all the facts but\nIt's just like you were saying oh this one\nAnd they ask you this one that okay\nYes looking at the fact looking at all the facts but\nIt's just like you were saying oh this one\nAnd they ask you this one that okay what if don't try to twist but now that I'm really not try to trap you what is your the what if you're a Susan Collins and you know that the people who were opposed to in\nOur being dishonest what if you know you're you represent a group of dishonest people who is not really him they they don't really believe he's a predator\nThey just don't don't don't want a conservative in the office and your job as a U.S senator is just to for advice and consent and if you say no you are saying he's guilty\nWhen you know your people know the tree\nOkay ... swap around a Doug Jones okay what if he\nHe's saying that we know lax okay well she knows the facts and her people in her in her state the facts also or should know the fire they should but I doubt that I'm not sure they do well they don't have this show ugly it's going to look at it and say well the people in Alabama don't know all the facts either\nNot like either I'm sure that's what he tells them south exactly but the difference if he'd be role and the difference is\nShe'd be wrong if she doesn't vote the but I guarantee you the majority of the people in her wanted did not call her office and say don't\nVote for him\nI I'm not a good point is I'm not sure that over half the people in her state weren't for Kavanaugh because they it is a little Biddy state and they do all that the Republican senator albeit she bought a rock star conservative but they do elect a Republican\nI I was just glad to see the person that I didn't vote haven't voted for been a lotta years\nVoted yes who would that be Shelby Shelby yeah won't vote for him ... he's been up to\nAnybody over two terms I Will not vote for you no matter what no matter what I Will not vote for you\nSorry what they're doing a jam up job I don't care over two terms they're up there for themselves they're not up there for us\nEven if they're doing a great job even ...

was still dealing with the aspect of the Obama over and with regards to how everybody was thinking and how crash\nTrump was and all we can't do that so they thought they could still\nKeep people in Malaysia with the accusations but now that whole venue change did not everybody is growing a fact fallen saying hey we can push back I'm owed everybody's not accepting that America is waking up so it's a different venue in terms of that but I still agree they didn't want Roy Moore\nI'm because she was going to bring the attitude of of of Trump\nWriters right and wrong is wrong and uh they didn't want to listen to that\nSo but it was very misleading with the uh the label of all the ... everybody he's guilty he dropped the suits and uh I read that too when I when I was so disappointed and I was like well they're just inundating him with the cost factor yes so they're just over running and so it's like a\nFull I get a clear mind Dane everyone will look at it on the back page I would've made six attorneys multi millionaires and ...\nThat's correct that's ... that's the world that he lives in no doubt about it so you think the bird to shaming\nBoy and may maybe we had a role

and maybe virtue shaming is not going to keep wiping us out\nNo it's not it's at that that that ah I'm always done but what is Roy Moore I was in jocks restaurant eating eating lunch and they let

just ... and I had had it I said she'd gone and I had to speak up and I said he's he's gone to court right I don't know but he's a rapist I said I said you could be a rapist I just said that are you a rapist I'm not a rapist\nAnd I'm like well if I say you are than you are right and she does know\nWhile he or she is and I do isn't been convicted of anything it's just accusations well he's a subject that's it that's it I was like oh my God when you grow up on it\nYou just let me know but all the boys were like oh yeah oh yeah or like a bunch of horses just to get I mean but when the guys ever do that I just call it's like oh my God\nYou've got tight pants on they're cutting off his circulation [laughter] huge I sat right on your um where the man by David that\nUp something that I have not talked about this is this story by one\nI sat right I'm with you on that nice David\nThat brings up something that I have not talked about this was a story by Warner Todd Houston Houston I Believe it is I don't think it's hosted in Houston I\nThink about this All right your son is in a high school Seneca badly high school in Germantown, Pennsylvania\n\nFive girls claim that they were sexually assaulted by your side guy Bob who knows those threats to us in sync code name yes\nFive girls accuse your son a sexual assault\n\nThe boy he ends up your son ends up losing his job he just working at a pool loses his job force to in your multiple court appearances goes to a juvenile detention facility then has detention at home\n\nAll kinds of folks at the school when he finally gets a chance to go back bullying him he's a salted five girls they all accused him they all agree your son did it\n\nWorld upside turned upside down\nThat happened in the school I was telling you about in Pennsylvania at Seneca Valley High school\nGuess what after all that happens to the boy\n\nThey retracted their accusations they lied about it one of them finally got a conscience and said we're All right now there is also going back against the girls but\n\nThink about what that means think about think about\nThe argument that had to be made in that town the ... this this little boy you're young man however you want to say at high school kid\nIt said I didn't do this\nShut up dude I Know your line those five girls would not say you did it\nAnd they're all together it's five own one he's guilty right school system figured decided he was guilty\nI don't know what the assaults we're I don't know what the details are I just know that he spent time in a juvenile facility had to go to multiple court appearances then detention home\nDidn't bowling if the school even after they recanted their accusations\n\n'cause you know I'm sure the story of oh he didn't do it\nYou know how quickly the truth makes it around but the rumor the negative accusations swept through school probably in one day the truth just kinda percolate out there\n\nIt's that kind of stuff that we were talking about for the Kavanaugh hearing\nI'm telling you a story\nIsn't that kind of stuff that we were talking about for the Kavanaugh hearings I'm telling you a story of five\nLadies young women accusing a young man of sexual assault\nThey said that the that he had assaulted them at a pool where he worked and again at a private home\n\nThe girls huge electronic communication devices to falsely accused him of sexual assault on two occasions so I guess that means they put it out on social media\nWhat's the response somebody please call me and tell me that I Am supposed to\nI should have trusted one girl I should address to the girl three four five\nThat shows up in your little group or that shows up and I don't know I don't know where I've I I I hate to say Sunday school class but and it just says all this stuff that's ... ... we just all get along can't we just\nCompromise with the communist can't we just compromise with the the crazy people screen they said they were they were literally scratching the doors\nOf the Supreme Court building when Kavanaugh was being sworn in\nScratchy fingernails scratching the doors I'm supposed to compromise with those folks\nJohn Casey quotes me both their dreams or their desires or their beliefs not to be vanquished\n\nBusy is a win or lose time in the United states\nJohn\nCase the Republican governor of Ohio needs to just say he's owned the other\nSide he needs to quip pretending he needs equipped pretending he's on\nThe side of conservatives that he's on the side of traditional values that he's on the side of the things that made America great\nHe is owned the side of the left but if he says he's fully aware of what he doesn't get to be on CNN anymore he doesn't get to have his platform anymore John casings value\nTo the media is that he's a Republican\nDaddy's one office as a Republican I used to be a Republican congressman\nMy guess is John Case it probably said a lot of things that he did not mean when he ran for office so that conservatives would vote for him or he did say things and he didn't sound very conservative and all of us conservatives are counterparts in Ohio\nVoted for him thinking that since he was a Republican he was a conservative\nThat's probably the case when we have those choices that's what happens to us many times in Alabama\n\nWe think since they're Republican they should be conservative and then we find out they're not\nBut when he started saying things about\n\nHow we you know you just you don't want to make people feel like they were vanquished so how would have compromised don't Kavanaugh\n\nWould his advice has been kicked cabinet overboard and get the next person kick Kevin overboard\nAnd not having an added to the Supreme Court and hold him over to the midterms is that ... that's what case it\nWould want to do\nIt's easy to go out and say because listen to what he says\nIf I said look our leaders need to stop playing as a zero sum game leaders need to figure out how to bring people together is there anything inherently wrong with that sense\nNo when we all want people to come together right do we want somebody else's you know you want them to be vanquished it sounds so it sounds so negative\n\nWe use our tones will say things that we ultimately can deeply regret is there is anything wrong with that no we all know that strict\n... and say things that we ultimately can deeply regret\nIs there is anything wrong with that no we all know that strict the tongue is a very powerful thing it's like a far can destroy the pork and give advice to people where we would agree with that\n\nLeadership there to stabilize the country yeah we agree with that\nBut when you put all of his thoughts together you realize the case is one of our guys who would rather feel good about himself and lose\nHe would rather tell us how virtuous he is well everything we believe in is scuttled\nThe leaves me another article ... or had an article from late last week it's published at town hall we're finally getting rid of the treacherous cc's who used to control the GOP\n\nThat's he says he starts off that ...
