a second vote that's where the comments are going to come in the back and forth is going to come in the filibuster is going to come in but we already we already know\nWell we know we have forty nine the likelihood that there is not going to be the fiftieth because this I'm senator Danes is there\nSo we should get the fifty pretty quick but then again there's a possibility that each one of these senators is going to have something that they want to say prior right now Mitch McConnell is that the diets let's go and check out what he has to say\nThat partisan politics can override the presumption of innocence all will reaffirm that in the United states of America\nEveryone has an effect until proven guilty\nOr will reaffirm that in the United states of America\nEveryone is innocent until proven guilty will either state the facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside when politically inconvenient and signal that media bullying and mob intimidation\nAre valid tactics for shaping the Senate\nThe mob can attack\nAnd the Senate cash\nAll set up and say that serious thoughtful fact based deliberation\nWill still define this body\nWill either give notice it totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough to destroy on Americans live\n\nOr will declare that our society cannot and must not well not shut the bar so low\nSo madam president today as a pivotal day and the nomination process of this excellent judge but it's a pivotal day for us here in the Senate as well\nThe ideals of justice that have served our nation so well for so long\nBefore on full display\nSo let's set back in ... through the choice moments\nThat the Senate and the American people have been treated to during the disgraceful absolutely disgraceful spectacle\nOf the last two weeks they're very nice\nJudge Kavanaugh was announced as the president's choice\nWhere are the junior senator from Oregon declare the nominees would pave the way they're tearing it\nCrowds of far allowed protesters\nStill filling out in the blanks on their pick inside there weren't quite sure who the nominee was going to be yeah\nWe've heard the junior senator from New Jersey to describe judge Kavanaugh's nomination as a great moral struggle\nIn which they are just two camps\nYou're either complicit and evil\nOr you're fighting against a\nWe've heard the junior senator from Hawaii argue that her personal disagreement with judge Kavanaugh judicial philosophy met\nHe deserves less of a presumption of innocence when it came to allegations of misconduct\nYou disagree with her\nYou're not entitled to the presumption of innocence\nWhen it comes to allegations of misconduct\nThat's where I'm a member of the Judiciary Committee that's the definition of due process\nApparently you get due process only if you agree with her\nEven more recently we saw the junior senator from Rhode Island hold forth with great confidence great confidence offering his expert interpretations of goofy jokes in high school yearbooks from the early Nineteen eighties that was incredibly enlightening\nBeer drinking references oh no our colleague was quite positive there must be some other hidden or sinister meanings applied until of course a number of judge Kavanaugh as fast as I said I'm stripe earlier this week\nSo stop and consider the snapshot\nJudge Kavanaugh last night's items right\nEarlier this week\nJust stop and consider the snapshot\nAbsurdity they've started the indignity\nIs our approach to confirming\nA Supreme Court justice\nThis is the Senate's contribution the public discourse [noise]\nBefore they had a drought on justice Kennedy's retirement our democratic colleagues write it perfectly clear what this process\nWould be about\nDelight obstruct\nAnd ...\nAnd before the ACA dried on judge Kavanaugh's nomination colleagues across the aisle including democratic members of this year I committed\nWere racing to announce it made up their minds are more totally opposes confirmation\n... hours after judge Kavanaugh was nominated\nMy friend the Democratic leader promise quote I Will oppose him with everything I've got it set hours after he was nominated\nIt was about like clear that his number one political goal was to defeat the nomination\nBy any means\nIt was right there from the beginning about 'em frozen a clear declaration plain as day nothing nothing good yet most Democrats or consider this modern day with an open live\nAll right let's be done with this we're not really hearing anything new it's interesting that the New York times and CNN had both made the point that this was going to be contentious throughout much of the morning possibly even going into the afternoon for that matter\nBut the fact that today is all\nThough was procedural to move forward that senators are not going to vote are not going to change their vote between today and tomorrow if Kavanaugh gets a majority of the votes for the procedural vote of invoking cloture for all intents and purposes he is confirmed\nWe should know that as early as the next few minutes but likely what we're going to say is a lot more of this as there are between four and five Heidi Heitkamp is kind of a a a little bit of an unknown although she has expressed doubts and she was confirmed Kavanaugh\nWe do still have Jeff Flake intermix then of course we've got a Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and the possibility\nOf Joe Manchin actually crossing the line it might be interesting to note that during the last state of the union address from President Trump whenever he made a point that seem to make sense obviously everybody in the right side of the aisle stood in applauded\nOnly one Democrat would stand and applaud President Trump's comments\nWho was it Joe mansion now it's\nInteresting also didn't know if you saw the state of the union but Everytime mentioned would stand who is the city's ceded to the laptop\nThat me a fancy Nancy and looks that below sea\nGave mansion or price lose\nThe female senator or a represented they'll sitting next to him as well uh she came out yesterday and said she was voting no she was also clapping wants\nThe ... next to him as well uh she came out yesterday and said she was vote no she was also clapping want swamp ... gotten her face right was pulling her finger and you can go to our roles they got a a good hour O'Connell film of her in front of below sea oh yeah oh yeah so\nAt the moment at the moment\nIf the people that we think are going to fall towards the right if they all fall the way it would be predicted we're looking at fifty one forty eight\nNow you've got to have between like Murkowski and Collins two of those have got to vote yes if all three of them do it's over [noise] if I were two of them do that we may mansion\nNow managing although he is currently leading in his reelection it's very tight\nAnd he represents a state that Donald Trump won if he votes ... his political future is very very much in doubt\nRegional polls suggested\nIn the last thirty six hours that\nThe Republican voters out there are going to stampede\nMr Kennedy\nMr Lankford\nMrs

these are way too to solve the questions\nForgetting that her performance her job was not to influence me and you and not really to influence the people of America it was to influence three or four senators\nBut Christine Blasey Ford's former boyfriend Ross the letter\nDoctors\nBut Christine Blasey Ford's former boyfriend Ross the letter we read the letter on the air a couple of days ago\nWhere he\nSaid a couple of interesting things one was doing some of the time we were dating doctor for to live with Monica el McClain who I understood to be her lifelong best friend during that time it was my understanding that McLean was interviewing for jobs with the FBI the U.S attorney's office\nI Witness Dr Ford held McLean prepare for a potential polygraph exam\nDr Ford explained in detail what to expect\nHow Parr grabs at work and help to McLean\nBecome familiar and less nervous about the exam Dr Ford was able to help because of her background in psychology also goes on to say say that you cheated on him\nShe's not afraid of close quarters we flew all over the place in tiny little planes she ended up living in a very tiny apartment that only had one door so my guess is actually this letter was from after her testimony where are you saying\nThat stuff's not drink 'cause it couldn't have come before they must have known something or they wouldn't have asked the questions that\nThen he says that she\nBasically committed fraud still using your credit card et cetera but that doesn't matter for mind and your discussion\nSo we had this thing and they and Christine Blasey Ford's what happens is the somebody reaches out to McLean\nThis is from circuit dot com the friend whom Ford is alleged to have coast has reportedly refuted the claims as well maclean says no that never happened\nHere's where it gets interesting do we need to take a break before I tell you about the interesting part\nWhat need to take both both just called let's take a break we'll get to bow and
