Republicans had as much as a man in the brain right\nOh panky and the brain will take over the take over the world you're exactly right\nYou know\nI think there is a big difference between the Republicans and Democrats because the Republicans are still remembering mothers learner and all that and they they remember all this stuff the Democrats have to be reminded who to vote\nAnd uh ... all men than guys and they they remember all this stuff the Democrats have to be reminded who to vote for who told who to vote for because Jonathan Gruber says they're stupid\nThe American people are stupid but you know who he meant it wasn't those who are calling you up in arguing about health care to sign it wouldn't work\nAs with the Democrats are calling up and saying you're better vote for it\nAnd uh like uh\nUh what's your call said uh you got to vote for it before he could read what's in it I I think a lot of Republicans remembered that especially conservatives and that I think it matters also that\nWe see that head to head contest happening right now with Trump in Obama how they're they're out campaigning for each of their respective parties oh that's right where is Obama hot\nYou know how come they don't like Obama no more\nI thought he was the messiah it may be and I have always question is for myself why on the minds of left going so crazy well basically I think it's executive order twelve triple three Obama signed his name off\nRepublican for chief justice I'm asking for your vote to keep Alabama's gorgeous place for the rule of law was respected and not

is it by the way I I Would have practice this back to Henry's call talking about Republicans being angry and people showing up in the pause and being engaged and go\nYeah so apparently and I got to look it up one more time uh let me find it real quick but um [noise]\nA a news agency station whatever they did a poll\nAnd I'm\nTurns out that sixteen point two million Americans apparently think chocolate milk comes from brown camels so when I found the\nPerson who posted the let me go to the story and I'll be able to read them more than ...\n...\nWe're gonna go slow\nThis is what is commonly referred to as stalling\nYes yes but I can only go as fast as the Internet lets me\nYes study find surprising number of Americans think chocolate milk ... brown cows according to a recent survey seven percent of Americans believe chocolate milk comes from brown cows survey was conducted by the innovation center of us dairy in April thousand adults Eighteen or over ask questions about\nThe role milk plays in their daily lives food and wine reporter\nStudy found forty percent of respondents weren't sure where chocolate milk came from\nSeven percent thought chocolate milk only comes from brown gals that adds up now this is dumb things sixteen points for that adds up to about sixteen point four million people more than the population of Ohio\nObviously\nWashington Post linked to study the past studies that consistently show many Americans have no idea where their food comes from which means that even if you walk into a grocery store for example a study in the Nineteen Ninety\nThe pastor that consistently show many Americans have no idea where their food comes from which I mean even if you walk into a grocery store for example a study in the Nineteen Ninety found that nearly twenty percent of people did not know hamburgers were made a beef mhm\n[noise] now I guess we're supposed to uh extrapolate from that that fat free milk comes from skinny cows\nI mean the masses yes [noise]\nWell I mean they do have skinny galaxies yeah so I mean you know yeah\nYeah all diet food comes from planes dropping like Richard well I you know skinny girl margarita comes from a Macy aided Mexicans I mean I mean come on\n[laughter] I mean see this is this is the stuff you know when when people\nWhen they were talking about voting or are they talking about getting out of the polls that talked about the policies of talking about the programs is it any wonder that you have so many people that are so defiant\nAbout things that Republicans are conservatives are even Donald Trump wants to do when you've got millions of Americans that think there are legitimately brown cows out there I mean I understand the whole thing how now brown cow but\nCome on no you can't you can't be that stupid I mean All right you shouldn't be that still\nSo you want to walk that one back down and rephrase you you shouldn't be but\nThey are ... they are I mean like I said there's people who still believe turtles\nI Know holed up here I get it I get him well that's that's probably the biggest threat to this country of anything out there because people and and the thing is we don't want those people\nTo vote\nNow I Am completely opposed to literacy tests were voting\nHowever however [noise]\nThere there is some kind of I uh\nI I guess I won't call it a moral justification for that but\nCertainly a societal one and this was\nThe reason you know back in the day if you're going to vote that's why everybody talks about how you know a man or a member granted the right to vote but women or not because men or men or women or women it's a little more complex than that\nIt was a matter of back in the day with very few exceptions women were not allowed to be landowners they were not allowed to enter into contracts that's why they couldn't vote not because they have an open female\nAnd so it's interesting that the founding fathers understood ... somebody to have a vote in this country\nThat they should be invested in that vote\nAs opposed to you know the emotion of can't we all get along or the emotion of oh a you know the what about the children or health care for all because health care's or write\nA and you know there's all these these these notions that just don't square up with the constitution because I'll tell you something and I'll be a very serious about this are probably gonna obsess of people were saying it but here's my tattered and battered constitution exits all dog eared and highlighted and\nThere's even a nice little coffee cup stay right here on an article for you'll be my in my view that\nThis little pamphlets right here\nStands between the right and the left\nAnd that sounds like I'm being a little bit a hyper active if you will but it's true\nAnd people need to realize that the folks on the left to lose the this little thing I mean you could sit down and read it's forty this particular one is forty six pages long and it's tiny and it's nice\nThe little thing I mean you could sit down and read it it's forty\nThis particular one is forty six pages long and it's tiny and it's decent sized ... it doesn't take anything to read it which is why it and it's still up to this day are on the website the unknown America dot com\nThat I was standing up copies of the pocket constitution and the declaration of independence with every order of the book I Know in America I did that it wasn't because I thought there was going to buy a book\nBecause I'm giving them a Ninety nine cent copy the constitution I Want people to read it and to consume it and to understand it because this is exactly what the problem is in this country today in terms of getting people to understand the concept of\nUs not matter right versus laughed but us versus them us lives inside these pages them is over here somewhere in their little George Soros sovereign little nation of the mind and people can't grasp\nOf that and so while you know we can't expect them to understand the constitution because the majority of them still think\nThat there are both vines running around this world that are being a around having their bits and pieces massaged for a sweet little well Trita chocolate milk\nNow here's something here's a question back in the day only landowners could vote okay so now we got away from that and all that mess but do you think it would be a good idea to come back and say only people who pay\nTax yes can or at least those that did if you're retired and you've done your thing\nYour your grandfathered in literally I mean you read that but yeah I mean there should be some vested interest in that because people are well you know you you know everybody has the right to vote you know I I get that but you know people need to understand if you don't have some kind of a vested interest in the system what are you voting for\nIf you are voting for a programmer policy that doesn't affect you that's one of the problems in the state of Alabama when we get into these debates about her role why should somebody in Shelby County be able to vote on whether or not an intersection Randolph county gets a stop sign mhm\nThat's a microcosm of the problem\nSo how many people you're gonna have going out there and voting in an election where they are voting for people on the national level that really don't have any impact on them it's the same thing that you and I talked about this we talked about what the listeners the whole Brett Kavanaugh thing\nAre you kidding\nNinety nine point nine percent of all Americans will never be affected by anything the Supreme Court does the only thing that affects any sizable number of people is roe versus Wade\nAnd those to those two entities cannot peaceably coexist from the policy perspective\nWell you know Robert Heinlein wrote the book starship troopers and everybody probably seen the movie was somehow or another got turned into fight and bugs and space but if you read the book he had a really neat idea in their\n... he had a I guess a post apocalypse kind of a future\nAnd you know the entire world had come apart and then there had been a form of federal democracy reinstated and they had to figure out\nWhat they did was\nThey may be a citizen and vote by the ... and on a lifetime of or a career services in the military and you did not earned the right to vote by that the thing was was they felt like in doing that\nYou are put the effort of the whole ahead of your own\nSelf and it's not how ... how we do right\nSaying something about that and uh just such a neat idea and that they wanted a democracy they wanted to have people that voted but they wanted to have people that voted for what was best for everybody and not just their own self interests\nWell if if you if you read the book he's written a couple of them by\nWell that voted for what was best for everybody and not just their own self interests\n[noise] well if if you if you read the book and he's written a ... Sebastian younger\nWho is a war correspondent ... one in recent years called tribe\nThat I just finished out not too long ago and he makes it very similar point that in tribal communities we're not talking collective isn't here\nBut in tribal communities people typically moved in a fashion which was most beneficial in tribal communities you know there was kind of a sense of cultural welfare if in fact it was called for but the people that recipients of it\nWere the only people that had actually put something into the system and we're no longer able to provide for themselves for whatever the reason\nAnd in this collective societies these tribal units that that dumb Sebastian points too\nThat the the ... the the good of the whole naturally weeded out those that were barnacles on the particular group or or or the drive in this case and we don't see that in this country today we have people that are constantly you know how it's interesting it is it\nBut you have people on the left that are so abhorrent to now the individual lives them on the right but yet they act in a manner which is you know individually\nSupportive of their own beliefs they don't support things that are bent beneficial for the nation as a whole and a lot of that is independence the ability to provide for something for your offer for one's own a good weather is a housing or clothing or food or insurance and this particular case that you know if you if you're unable to\nTo manifest those things in your life that you were somehow entitled to them nonetheless and despite whatever contributions you may or may not have made\nWell we've gone so far as you you could make a really good argument that we have allow things to happen in our country where we have deliberately created a non contributory permanent third class in order to be a constant source of votes on political party\nThat's exactly what it is\nKnow and I mean you know they can say that that's not what the great society was set up for and maybe it wasn't but that's darn sure what the result of it was\nRight no\nYou're exactly right\nTaken is down along that path anyway so give me some kinda indication in the near future when your plans to go to ... ville are and uh\nI Am I Am currently watching uh watching the weather I'm looking for some cooler weather and I'd probably do something next week or so\nOr something and uh we'll do something\nGreat look forward to a ... argument that yeah I Do and let's go to David go Hey David how are you\nA mark up Michael I a man I couldn't disagree with that last caller he had a whole lot of things dead wrong a and the idea that ah intentionally creating a a disenfranchised\nWell that sounds more like the last child or some uh you know some minor ... uh aristocrats that are trying to bring down America\nOr in a that's not an issue of Democrats or Republicans that's an issue of fools who think that there are if they can divide and conquer America for their private a game you know they'll they'll come out alive\nI don't know if you've ever studied World War two history but the first guy to give Adolf Hitler five million a march ended up in in one of the death camps himself\nSo uh you know these guys are organized crime that are trying to bring down America or\nIf you're referring to the deep state\nSo so ah you know these guys are organized crime that are trying to bring down America or\nIf you're referring to the deep state I don't necessarily agree or disagree with that\nRight yeah and and in fact you had an earlier caller about an hour ago who was trying to pick the hundred and first airborne against the eighty secondary burn what's that all about\nI I have no frame of reference for that David I Can't even speak\nRight I I mean they do but people are trying to divide and conquer America and in fact that previous caller a he was he was talking about are trying to think of the phrase that he used about voting a it's an on the alien ... right\nIf you look up the word on the alien ... it means you can't barter it away you can't bargain it away you can't give it away or you're born with it and yet you're right\nAnd uh that's why it's written into the uh a bill of rights or into the constitution into the declaration of independence in that way that we the people can run our own lives and we don't need some stupid aristocrats with fake money or to tell us that we don't have a life\nA and I'll tell you the real purpose I'm calling you know after the hurricane hit a you know\nJust a ... sounds like it it missed most of Alabama although I bet that the eastern edge got slammed pretty hard or that the the politicians are still denying the global warming is real\nAnd they're they're refusing to spend tax dollars on preparations they're refusing to spend money on on acknowledging that global warming is real or putting together shelters for the population and they're going to get a whole bunch of people killed with the next a series of hurricanes and\nTornadoes and hurricanes again you you know I've had this conversation before the hurricanes or a result of global warming\nA if you look at the one that hit on the east coast up or you know just a what a month ago\nYeah foreign thing was the color or excuse me that was that the temperature bath water the ocean\nAnd what about the hurricanes and we've had in this country over the last couple of hundred years or even more deadly I mean you and I have done that one either way back in the Seventeen hundreds were thirty thousand people died\nOh I remember the the issue of Galveston but that had did more to do with our architectural standards for example if you look at at uh the way that Galveston is shaped a and and compare it to the hurricane\nBut I'm I'm Talking about the structure of infrastructure I'm Talking about the intensity of waves and when\nA well you've got to look at at the reality and and back to the well I just did oceans\nThe oceans are getting so hot that bigger and bigger and bigger storms are are forming that's how hurricane form\nYeah I I understand that but what about the natural occurrences or things like El Nino and and the fact that for every scientist out there that advances the notion of global warming there's another one that refused that how about the fact that Fifteen Years ago we're worried about him I said I knocked wobble warming\nThat's not true that there's one for one ratio of scientist it's Ninety I heard a report the other day that said that they're really only for scientists in the world that are denying that it exists\nOkay let's take another direction the Batman fact the case why the politicians not do anything about it because it seems like it's back when you\nWere hired by the polluters and the polluters have poisoned the oceans to such a degree in that it's becoming a dead zone and it's getting hot when when there's life in the ocean\nAnd okay so again I asked a question if that's the case why we're not doing anything about\nIt because of polluters don't want to clean it up okay so what's the ...\nThere's life in the ocean okay so again I asked a question if that's the case why not do anything about it\nBecause of polluters don't want to clean it up\nOkay so what's the solution from your perspective\nWell you've got to make the polluters either clean it up are you running out of business\nOkay so why didn't the or the Democrats do something when they had control the house and Senate\nUh what what year was that the first year that rock Obama was in office\nYeah and what was the first sentence out of Mitch McConnell\nHe didn't he was he was he was a minority leader he was a minority later right and what's the first one of his mouth he was the minority leader they had\nThe muscles that politically do it David and you know you're\nYou know I'm telling you the truth word of mouth I don't care the first word out of his mouth they had the political muscle to do something if they had the compulsion doing what they did not and they sat on their hands because even they don't believe it's anything more that political posturing ...\nHe said we will not allowed\nOr I guess it's going nowhere because again you own answer the question that's where I lose my patients with you and I'm going to dump the call there was a lot of things even related to health care\nSharp right at first I Am out of time but I appreciate the call so very much your last caller is that just for this hour we're gonna have to take you to the other side but we will go straight back to the phones

I'm pissed about that did you say you know but I did hear about how they got rid of Rosario\nHow did they get rid of this dead like killer all ever comeback opiates no way did\nReally is she she she uh took opiates and and\nNo way did they really is she she she uh took opiates tune in overdosed\nSo let me say a B C was so dumb that their executives were so dumb\nThat they decided because of poor choice of words or whatever they would they had to get rid of Roseanne and they did that knee jerk reaction panic attack where virtue signaling so they decide to get rid of Roseanne all off of a show called Roseanne\nThat was their first mistake\nTheir second mistake was that they killed her off\nThey did not send her to rehab they could have made or get lost you know fall off a cruise ship in a drunken stupor where they could find her own a desert island after the season totally collapses\nHow many mistakes are they going to make you know a smart executive would have just quote killed her off temporarily 'cause you got to have a story but if you kill or often barrier it's not a superhero show my ears watch how were they were they bring 'em back from the dead\nWell that was even dumber but I have a question about opioids and I've been saving this 'cause I Know is controversial\nCan we say that opioids are legal can week is that that is that fair\nCan we yeah I Wish that I got I'm legally okay here legally opioids are legal\nOpioids\nAre apparently ... or were are easy to get\nTheir legal they're easy to get doctors will prescribe them so people can take as much as they won't so opioids\nLet's go ahead and make sure we and y'all be sure to call in and tell me how I'm wrong because I I've been wrong once or twice in the last couple of years eight six six five five one nine nine three three we've established that opioids\nAre basically legal they're legalized drug Scott but you can't take 'em outside I Know all of that\nBut there is close to legalize as we are going to get ours we have been\n\nAnd people take them based on their own choices right sure do as individuals they also take them knowing that they're addictive\nThere can be anybody now maybe you say ten years ago you got you got to go further than ten years 'cause we were passing 'em I think we're passing legislation about opioids at least I mean I've been out for years now so at least eight nine ten years ago that the people can't say they didn't know it was addictive\nI mean is morphine I mean it's opioids is it's opium ... I did not when I started taking them you didn't know what we know is that a a ... for ... years ago Fifteen Years ago when I started taking them out on his own um fourteen years okay\nAfter ten years of doctors prescribe mhm\nThen I had surgery came off of them realize I was a big to do so so you had no idea\nI'm not I'm not jumping on you know ... did not know they were addictive they're opioids are opiates\nOr you just didn't know the doctor gave him to use our oil or legal but I got to where the downside 'cause the doctor gave him\nThere are opiates or you just didn't know the doctor gave him to use our ... legal but I got to where the down side to the doctor gave him to you well\nAnd I got to where if one was good too was better okay and then I got up to where I was taken ten at a time oh my gosh\nAnd they'll let me let me fall finishes up so we got a so basically they're legal\nBasically they're easy to get\nSo it's just it I Know it's not like this but just say hey you can if you want them you can go out and get 'em and you can take\nVery similar\nTo weigh the way a lot and um and other opiates were in the late Eighteen hundreds early Nineteen hundreds you could just buy the stuff remember when Coca Cola cocaine and\nYeah All right so here's where I'm kind of talking where I'm kind of go in there are people out there who said that we will solve the drug problem in the country by making drugs legal\n\nMy my feeling is ... just looking at the opioid quote epidemic that we're now spending hundreds of millions of dollars fighting\nAnd looking at the fact that the turn of the last century\nOpioids et cetera drugs were legal because nobody really knew what they did know but they were legal and\nThey had a drastic negative impact on society which is why they made them illegal but I'm just trying to point out because I don't think many people have thought about it\nWe now have a quote unquote opioid epidemic that has to be fault that has to be countered\nAll of these politicians everybody as opposed to it we're spending hundreds of millions of dollars to battle the opioid epidemic make sure that people get their lives back we have to we got to bring the cavalry\nMhm\nSo why don't we might why don't we still make this argument that legalizing drugs is going to fix it\nBecause I've read the stories and the story say if you're a poor minority person we're going to send you to prison for having marijuana but if you're a rich white person and you're taking opioids nothing happens to you so it can be a crime\nProblem because we're not charging them all crime\n\nSo in other words easy access to things that addict people we have decided it's a bad idea\nOr we would not have an opioid epidemic famous fixing to get worse but do you see what I'm saying ...\nDo you know what's going to get worse wow how well because there is a new old opioid out there that is five hundred times more powerful than morphine could be on the market varies\nSo that any legal drivers out of legal lowest one they've\nMade the money is a B.

talking about secret opium fields in America and right off the top of my head to the top produces opium and the world and it's their chief primary export is North Korea in Afghanistan\nSo why have we not napalm their opium fields\nWill apparently we use any variety and do we we still do some of that in Afghanistan but um there's all kinds of conspiracy theories\nAbout that\nYeah it's I mean there's no doubt in my mind whatsoever that the medical companies are profiting massively off this and you and we talk about\nThis idea of you know legalize all the drugs and and just let people be free to you know if they want to ruin themselves you know one of the things that he's doing they still do in China is if you want to get rid of a political opponent you kidnapping and drag him down to an opium den get them high and leave him there\nAnd kill them off and then they accidentally overdosed\n[noise] yeah and then and then at the oh they had an opium problem that's why they're dead or

I don't want to get there yet we must they rely on salary because we want people to understand\nIt the way it's going right now we think's going to have a gas for\nI left don't get to that yet because that's an import our that's the third front okay so ... is modernizing Saudi Arabia\nMhm I'm too he's opposed to Iran which is\nWe're cool we're ... we need somebody oppose Iran 'cause we went and wiped out the other guys that were opposed the Iran Iraq in ... and we started we should have just let them fight each other like crazy in Turkey but those lawyers are the third the third leg of the stool for Saudi Arabia is they do\nHave a lot of oil right and there are a major player and also got so the second player in this whole mess that we ... we're supposed to focus on is turkey earned origin or however you say is now a murder again\nWhich I don't trust them\nHeard again takes over the country turkey was a\nA\nNon religious a secular country and was held up as this wonderful example of how a secular country could turn is back on Islam still be Islamic but but run itself as a secular nation or does it comes along\n... a year before last decides everybody who's opposed to him is staging a coup he kills people he round people up puts them in prison by the thousands from anybody who could destabilize his rule\nAnd we're still more upset about cars shockey\nBecause the Turks are saying oh we know the Saudis kill ... the Turks killed why more people than shaggy so that's the second player\nIn this survey like employer that you're talking about in Turkey and the stuff that's happening over there okay there's not really affecting us as much as this Saudi Arabia stuff is going to affect\nUs so we're going to get back to the oil and just say okay I I'm just so low on ... ... exactly right but I'm just trying to lay the background the outrage from the press the concern for the press\nThere is some thing there's something more than\nRallying around some guy from Saudi Arabia who claims he's a journalist\nYou see what I'm saying it cannot be just he's a journalist so we have stories that are now coming out that the Turks apparently have they say they have recordings of a seven minute long killing were they were\nWere Saudis we're cutting up cars shaggy while he was alive so they could take him out and pieces or they can boil them in acid and there would be nothing left of it\nThe White House which is the third player in this thing and how we became the third player is odd to me because the press continues to ask the president what are you going to do about the Saudis what if the Saudis killed this guy\nWhat if a ... maybe Graham who I knew couldn't stay older outside very long goes out and starts talking about how well we need to remove the Saudi brands if he knows anything about it remove the Saudi\nOh they're outside very loyal goes out and starts talking about how well we need to remove the Saudi brands if he knows anything about it remove the Saudi ... not yet well let me ask this question\nWhy are we not removed people all over the world who did bad things some of 'em do bad things to American citizens were not out removing that\nWas removed the Iranian regime is it going to be easy to remove a crown prince of Saudi Arabia I'm just shocked by this this saber rattling automatically like we've got to turn our back on Saudi Arabia here's my thing about kings\nIf you want to if you if you think kings are okay around the world if the king decides\nHe's going to move you all along to the afterlife guess what the king move you along\nTo the afterlife why are we shocked\n\nWhy aren't we surprised now we get back to the story from yesterday before we get to where it really hits the where the rubber meets the road story we talked about PJ Media by David Gold but he is reporting that a German newspaper says\nThat this guy was a high level operative for Saudi the Saudi intelligence service\nSo he is kind of a spooky kind of guy that he is an intimate a buddy was a buddy with Osama bin Laden he's the nephew of an Arab arms dealer what's that does not you can't help your relatives\nAnd is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Muslim\nBrotherhood wants to replace the Saudi monarchy with a modern Islamic state if you want to replace\nThe king and the king knows it what do you think happens to you and I'm not saying that the Saudi king knew about it I'm not but what how was this shocking and do you really\nWant the president the United states out there saying hey Saudi Arabians we're\nWe're against you because you handle people who were against you and let's run gas prices through the roof\nAnd here's where am I going to a conspiratorial and I think I Know we're big Davis go Saudi Arabia decide which they kind of have hinted at will find will just screw up the world's oil supply I'm the king do what I Will\nRun gas prices up to four or five bucks a gallon because of the decrease in supply water has people going to do because they're not going to overthrow the monarchy but what does that do the American economy\nPuts the brakes zone it does it not\nAlready got three dollars you know two fifty to sixty gasoline even here in Alabama\nWhat is the what are the Republicans running our own for reelection what is the president touting\nFor his economic policies and why he is a fantastic president the economy mhm what what my friends in the press won't to destroy more than anything\nTo hurt the president if they can't remove him from office personally\nTear down his economy oh\nPresident good economies in collapsed just like we said it would be taxed\nTear down his economy oh\nPresident good economies and collapsed just like we said it would be tax cuts didn't work yeah but I don't\nBelieve I think the grass is all they're either way it is wrong or their own Marta I what do you do is number one\nThe economy as you're not going to change the economy between now and in the mid\nTerm you change it between now and twenty twenty okay now that are very well that's right well maybe I should have been more clear rouse that's how you stop Trump\nThat's how you stop that and that's how you try to stop Trump but that's not ... you're not going to stop the midterms no now but she was the ... and ... they're going to vote\nFor right now that's\nNot true you don't think so no you don't think the majority of the people in Alabama don't know who they're going to vote no poll links\nBecause Alabama's a very red state they already voted republic oh no no historical polling and evidence of campaigns most people do not make up their mind who they're going to vote for until the last\nFive six days that's just the way it is\nYou don't get ... for it it's a fact you know it doesn't matter if you believe it is a drag because people don't mean the ...\nBut that's not a [laughter] a testing man how's that okay I'll take a statistic because most people don't just that the people who decide elections are not the ones who are already knew\nThe people who decide elections are the ones who have no idea who they are going over to the very end they're the they're often the least informed\nThat's why they don't know that's why our\nHouse races this why so much money spent at the very end that's why I get out the vote spends money at the very end because the people who actually tipped the scale left\nOr right our last until that last\nHandful of days and you hear up I don't even know who was riding in that same congressional race\nIn Alabama or if you're informed you probably know ahead of time but most of the time this because you've already picked a side generally even the people who want to be independent pick aside generally and they\nLive in LA
