today and then of course tomorrow Saturday for listeners on on Saturday they can also get to the square in Athens and here for twelve hours a storytelling\nBehind that wonderful I really up with thing bearing it certainly as a diversion from everyday life\nAbsolutely well let's talk about the race last week the lives Hurley ribbon run and no I had Josh why hit on the program we talked about that and let's talk about the success in the the uh the amount of people that came out just to participate in support the effort\nI Can't believe that I feel like it it's still the rabbit run this is exactly what it looked like black Saturday morning and it hasn't stopped raining than what a wonderful day it truly was phenomenal we had\nAt least sixty five hundred people walking or running all to raise money for the with early ... for fun to add on to the hospital foundation while you had sixty five hundred people there walking or running they brought another for with them or to work where your family though\nEither like we had in ... at ten thousand people I downtown on though and every single year I Am amazed at the individual who no matter what the weather is like they are out there supporting this card\nAnd they've done so since I was diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer Twenty years ago this phenomenal community and north Alabama had great for me they have that mankind email\nThey sent me a phone call base that may\nHot to cover up my head but I had no hair they have great for me it is just a a a humbling experience and so mark ten years ago\nWe started with her like rather than run\nAfter my diagnosis is actually at eight we'll see how many years Nineteen years ago I found that the wicker like breast cancer fun at the hospital foundation at the time you talked about the three towers over at Athens going on this weekend festival\nI was invited to church group said they ...\nOn you talked about the story tellers over at Athens going on this weekend festival I wasn't invited to church groups and civic groups and they invited me to speak and the middle of my chemotherapy\nBut I was going to be about my experience with breast cancer a young woman undergoing mother and my thirties with two small children and I was diagnosed with other aggressive form of breast cancer called triple negative breast cancer there's nothing positive about that so I was going to tell my story and I would say the least get a mammogram it will happen\nIf breast cancer can happen to anyone if you have breath man or woman\nBut they would start handing me money they put you want me to do with it\nAnd they said keep it you will come out so I thought about it I prayed about it and I went to the Huntsville hospital foundation and basically open an account I said I don't know what we need to do with the money\nBut please can I open you know and I thought a fun so we started to fund and it became very clear what North Alabama needed\nAnd that was a dedicated breast health Center for women to go because it took me about two weeks to find out everything I needed to know about my breast cancer it day it only takes a woman a day or two days\nSo in Twenty years it has completely turned around because the money is from that fund and now from the river and run all our finals and to the hospital hospital breast cancer and now also the battles and hospital press center\nSo now we have the disease and in my opinion the best breast health centers and the state of Alabama\nThat is great and speaking of your experience next week because of course October is breast cancer awareness month continues on for people in November and December and January and February March doesn't stop and I've got run to my kids act\nFrom hearts we'll going to come on the program next week in the month of November and talk about her experience but if you would there are those out there there's women and men to like\nThat are not getting checked 'em and there's also people who've been checked and they found that they had cancer and what is your message to them all the people who haven't yet gotten chicken in the ones who who are just found out they had breast cancer\nWell first of all I Want people giving is what a month away yes I Hope people will just think about this as they are gathering around the table this may be the one time in a year that you will see\nAsk Mary and grandma and everyone else in the family gather around you're going to be talking you're going to be giving uptick may I suggest one of the topic that you bring up is\nHow are you doing how are you how quite liquid talk about family history with the what's changed in people's lives over the last year\nFind out whether it be whether it be heart disease no matter what it is\nI think we need to open the channel a conversation I think young people need to hear from the older generations start truly taking notes\nThat may be the only time you see them that maybe the only time you have that conversation so take note if someone's been diagnosed with cancer and they're in their thirties\nSaid let me to start paying attention and that's something they come up from grandma who says oh yeah you remember the uncle tell had this and then this than the minutes and so you start putting the family three to gather up health concern yes so I Want to tell everyone to go ahead and have that conversation take notes\nIf you find like you said what you're saying that pattern\nGo ahead and go to your family physician and have that\nSo if you find like you said with your thing that pattern\nGo ahead and go your family physician and have that conversation\nAnd start getting checked for whatever the element may be that may be suddenly you're noticing runs in your family so get the appropriate test at the appropriate age it\nIf you're at higher risk for breast cancer you find that like you got one two three course strictly relatives and they were all young you should be getting checked ten years before\nYour closest relative was diagnosed\nSo that the real key with women and and breast cancer so women needless are getting their mammograms by at least\nAge so I Would say get a baseline but between thirty five and forty and then every year or every other year after that\nIf there are no buddies to do that if you're under insured or uninsured Alabama has the Alabama breast

Williams down and get on the fences right when you've got five hundred acres is spent on that happens you know a thousand times that takes a long time to go through there and it was apparently it\nYeah and it doesn't take long for the cows to find the how does it\nExactly exactly especially this time of year when you know for just starting to get a little slimmer on the ground right I just don't want it to the fall months a year and so those cows are are there out searching and looking\nAnd you can bet the first place are going to go is drive down tree a Spanish but has leaves on it right ... leaves next thing you know what they said that hold and the fence and they go\nWow I didn't grow up around cows I I spent you know a little bit of time round and but one of the things it's always amazing to me that the the most Warren ground is usually right there around the fans they follow the perimeter of the fence and man if there is any way for them to get out those rascals are going to be out on\nThat that's right that's right I mean I can tell you from experience [laughter] travel to get the\nUm the phone calls that I get a for cattle out or went out and go\nRight sure I can leave town and I know it and that's not happening out into the cattle out there trying to round up somebody go put cows that for me but\nWhen they're watching your Facebook page cows and watching your Facebook page to know where you are going to do that and it will read so\nBut ah yeah and and that's that's the devastation I mean when you've got cattle and you can't get paying them\nUm and they're either in somebody else's pasture or they're into my crop field um you know the gas got peanut ... caught and our ... next to you you don't want those cattle out there and then in their crop right ah they're they're battling enough as it is just to get a lengthy so\nThat that's a huge thing um one thing I saw that was really disturbing to me going through a that southwest Georgia area was the pecan orchard yeah just just looking at those uh we saw some you know a lot of trees down\nAlmost every tree ... right and just to clean up from that and they were you know they're just a few weeks away from harvesting those on so I'm I'm sure a lot of the the\n... right and just to clean up from that and they were you know they're just a few weeks away from harvesting those on so I'm I'm sure a lot of\nThe uh because they're on the ground and I don't know if that can be hard or not but there's a lot a huge task layer in both pecan trees I mean you can plant one today in your seven or eight years yeah they start in production\nYeah that's a that's almost generational destruction when something like that happening to become greedy and\nIt is and it was you know there there was a lot um down through Webster county towards ... and there's a lot of new because on a\nRoad going in ... when you stop\nAnd even those trees were light over a you know they were they were a point at all in one direction they are and uh so hopefully those can be straightened back up and be okay but you know you can just see that's long term damage yeah cotton crops you could see the uh the cotton and been stripped out of the bowls are a lot\nOn the ground there's law still in the plant but it it was not in a bowl form and harder pay 'em in from I'm sure that ... allows crawl up our our big minimal in their body and say it it was going to be a bumper crop issue or\nYou know a lot of farmers were going to get out of bed and have you know have some extra income they shoot\nYou know random we were um it ... meeting a last week in Montgomery and ... industries cheap for the state talked about the damage in Georgia being used in Alabama it's in the millions\nHundreds of millions but in George H into billions and um I think we're probably going to find out Florida will be the same so which is generally astronomical damage into\nThat trap you know own a a poultry farms are I Know in Alabama I talked to a guy yesterday falling away so that actually this year\nI'm In Houston and he had some damage there nothing major\nFarm down the road um that I've been on before a lost the roof off of a bullet house layer and I'm I'm\nHopefully they can repair they if they had birds they are so ... you know I Know there was some damage to poultry houses in Alabama Georgia the last I heard about Ninety two houses damaged or destroyed wow um and so there's a pretty significant number there\nYou know the net southwestern corner so you know if there's poker houses damaged there's all kinds of other\nEgg a tap building\nSure a grain elevator pay the letters shops dry she is the whole nine yards wow um and\nUh I spoke to another guy or earlier this week that um he's out of the Mariana Florida area a past and stuff and and southeast Alabama there too but they're big watermelon uh like for a lot of cotton picking up there in that area and and uh they had major structure damages\nOr their farm near Marianna their all their begins were\nToppled over ... D so they didn't have anything there to hold him a lot of farm shades and structures are are ... and they had a lot of equipment that was\nTotally out of Amos book out buildings fell out on ... or you know other other kind of damage\nRight well there are struggling yeah there are a lot of folks down that way that need our thoughts and prayers and help as we can give it in a random I Know you're burning up the road headed to to show some poultry houses today look at some forums if somebody wants to reach out to you or about buying or selling a farm or poultry farm how do they do that\nYeah just give me a call on my cell phone numbers to five six to three and five three seven that\nThat's right or you can reach Randall up church to the southeastern ... office at eight six six seven five one land Randall thanks for being on the show today brother in a blessings in your travels like Johnny yeah Dave I'm excited right now we're gonna leave clay County Alabama\nSeventh ... Randall thanks for being on the show today brother and the blessings into travels like Johnny\nYeah Dave I'm excited right now we're gonna leave clay County Alabama we're going to go down to Tallahassee, Florida we don't uh don't often covered that part in our topics on the land so here but we've got one of our own Daniel how to Mackey there who's going to give us a timberland report from Tallahassee oh Daniel how are you this morning buddy\n[noise] good Jonathan how're you doing\nI'm doing well um and do ... I was glad to hear ah for for our listeners that that might not know 'cause I don't hear you weekly I'm you're one of our southeastern leg or a page and she lived there in Tallahassee, Florida and had to evacuate for hurricane Michael and\nGlad to hear that you you came home and and your things were were relatively okay\nYeah I'm yeah I'm Tallahassee itself had a fair amount of trees down and on and had some power outages but we were owned the the far east side of the hurricane and um and were spared\nUm for the most part and you know all points West I'm definitely got a lot worse than we did\nYeah and I know part of your family business or the or for one of the other things that you do in addition to being a an agent with southeast Joanna group is you help folks uh your your family company their maintenance timberland and uh and timber assets and what have you been seeing a post hurricane\nOur only true drought waters in Alabama with a cold water coming off you know Smith like down the\nAnd the rainbow trout hatchery and and probably you know we've got ... radio stations all over Alabama and more on the you know the Internet and everything\nAnd probably have some listeners that don't even know we have trout in Alabama so just tell us a little bit about you know about the tale race here you know maybe the history of out are out there and then tell us about your business and how you get started\nSo ah when they built the dam and sixty two they started operations of a mess like damn and it impounded such deep water to a Smith lake is is it really deep lake and\nI think the original idea was let's put them on trial and the wait\nAnd see what happens you know to give people a different layer of the lake just fish though you know brand bat Missouri warm water species are going to stay up near the top but if we put some you know some trout in there they'll go deeper and that'll give people more water to fish\nAnd after a couple of years they realized nobody in Alabama knew how to\nFish sixty feet lead from Florida [laughter] and\nThat's the price surprise um but it's not but some of them were coming through the dam and getting into the river system low it and so they were targeting ah the trout and the river\nAnd they found guys down there I'm I'm sure most of them fly fishermen who uh who thought hey if their stock in my leg maybe there'll be on the river two\nAnd a and they were really targeting them and doing pretty well\nAnd so they changed over and said well we'll we'll stop talking the lake start docking at the rivers and I think that happened in the seventies\nAnd er and since then you know they they started talking I think probably once a year that's twice a year that every other month and now we get stocked with rainbow trout every single month to help 'em or it it's helped our cat trade it's helped people have more access to 'em and stuff like that\nWell are are the fish able to reproduce or do the child live long enough to reproduce there\nThey would live long enough or the the hatchery from which the state doc our fish are supposed to be sterile fish um even if they weren't the cost is the hydro electric than it\nRises and falls in pretty significant fashion and raw and uh yeah that that flow wouldn't allow them to uh to make a good read and uh NBA also raised a offspring and in that part of the river um you know it could be that\nIf conditions were right they could go up some of our creeks\nAnd a ... on but we haven't we haven't documented any of that taking place on the fifty\nRight one of the cool things just about where I live and Perry county as we have a fish hatchery in the town of Marion\nAnd they raise a lot of the fish that we swapped for tendency for their uh for their trial we send our spot I'm In a ... scenario right mass and that sort of stuff up there so it's kinda cool uh than our little towns having a part in that but it it is how far down river from the damn will you find these drought\nSo I've got a picture of it\nHaving a part in that but it it is how far down river from the damn will you find these drought\nSo I've got a picture of a guy who has who has a five pound rainbow and his town in his hand or down at Copeland ferry bridge which is probably I Would guess forty miles\nDown while wow who I wouldn't have yeah when I either that somebody I\nSo where are you doing it\nGorgeous gorgeous is the kind of cut off but rise or when they're operating edits putting way too hot of a water back and um for the route to to go down and that's the only in the wintertime so now you know as temperatures start football is the water temperatures start to drop back down this time is it and hitting the water for his long\nUm the stamp starts to drop and they'll start those are migrating they'll start maybe they'll do look for food look for better places to this that and eat and uh and they'll they'll just keep going until they found the right spot\nNo one of the most iconic scenes to me in Alabama as you're driving through is when you drive across the river right they're below the damn early in the morning and a water temp is cooler than the air to him when you you get all that the same as an off the water that's really cool there and their brand\nIt it is that that bridge is\nProbably a hundred at least a hundred feet above the water yeah and there are times that you're driving across the bridge and that fog is above you [laughter] well to both the rivers down that low and the fog is coming up a hundred feet yeah over it\nI'm not a fan and that is really cool\nIt is you know right on the surface there's usually a clear spot and so I'm so guys you know you can see what you're doing you can see right or what's around you but then you kind of you kind of take a break and look up and all you see is that that ... moving\nNo across the face the trees and over the surface of the water it's uh it's pretty amazing\nWhat brand and on I Know this is a real family affair or you know your wife Mary care on your and your father Randy ... helps run the shop and a beautiful children there and you know you just tell us about your business at runs the services you all for\nThe type of God's servers you all for in a little bit about flush out\nSo we offer um guided trips we do waiting trips where were you furnish everything um we've got waiters in boots and all sizes and so just people just show up at the shop where you get them geared up take 'em out and stand side by side\nOr either four or eight hours the other half day trip for a full\nTrip and I talk about the river about about trout about how they function and operate and try to get you\nYou know the the right casting and the right or ability to read the water in order to have the best and catching fish and that's you know pretty heavy on instruction in it where we spend a lot of time working with you and helping you um be more successful with fly fishing\nWe also offer a dress boat trip and uh I have a boat trip Andrew boat called an added post and it's made in Montana and it's a it's designed by two guys that really worked at it and and made it basically the perfect fly fishing boat\nAnd uh it's just convenient it is um it's comfortable it's super stable and so we can go out and that and we get to cover a lot more water we traveled on um we we have good success catching fish but it's it's more of a relaxed or if it's got it's got pedestal seats in it\nWe got to travel more um we we have good success catching fish but it's it's more of a relaxed or if it's got it's got pedestal seats in it so uh if you want you can just kinda sit down and relax\nAnd uh it's just a a great way to enjoy the day I'm spending targeting the the trout and a talking and and\nGet your downriver many how many could fit on the boat there Brenda\nOckun fit three anglers okay on a on the door so yeah it's\nA ... I can do as many as a ten on a waiting trip but we we divide that out by depending on ability and uh and number a guide\nThose those drift boats are fun I've never done it in Alabama but we my wife and I did it uh in Wyoming and it's just it is a relaxing in a beautiful way to to get to how how much water can you cover\nIn one of those ... and so I'm sure it varies by current but how much water do you fish and a day or and a half two\nAnd a half day will typically do about two to three miles nine I'm older down and then come back out\nIn a while yeah not a wholesome man ... such a such a great job so you said you you were talking about kitchen five pound rainbows um I mean how you know ... is that as big as I get\nAnd that's a trophy fish now for our water for sure um it you know there are um recorded instances of people catching fish up to right around the\nEight eight and a half pound very oh wow on the steps before it yeah so yeah\nMotives record in it and what's the state record in Alabama states\nNot I think nine and a half okay oh wow yeah\nSo and I know yeah that's it all catch and release are you able I'm assuming since I don't reproduce you can take them\nTo get to this state rag is a bias fish and no calling so if you catch in or at least you can you can fish all day\nOr if you catch a fish and you um designated as part of your ... that you're going to take it home in any way if you put it on a string or a puddle on the side of the river or in a bucket or that is one of your five fish for the day you know try and uh\nAnd so we do all catching or at least with our trip just because it's it's too much work sure it it just changes the changes the focus of the trip\nWhen we got to keep them along yeah I'm assuming you're family likes to eat out I mean that would be my guess\nWe do it so we had it it's kind of like the guy a while when I was younger I raised ... for for eight\nOr ... or [laughter] you know they're they're kind of your pet to kind of it's\nKind of hard I get when you\nWere you really want our class to catch fish yeah you really we I mean I Know I've been on many trip with clients where I Am way more anxious about them catch that dry are worried about it\nWell always ... I got to feel that way [laughter] if\nIf I take a if I take a fish out the next trip\nAll this running through my head it you know they could have caught that pet demos\nIt took me a long time to be able to St Chandler has cancer because that is such a scary wearing\nWhen kids find something that works well with a certain cancer they share that with everybody and knowing that we have to pay for all of the medical expenses that huge we have to worry about health and Shanahan he's my heart\nSaint Jude children's research hospital finding chores seating children learn more at the same gene O'Donnell are\nTuning Saturday at eight o'clock for a full hour of the Mark White show right here on superstation one oh one\nWhy the\nW ...

you're right about Christmas yeah Christmas\nSo guess what what are they what were we always talk about Christmas is a plug in outside of ... on the house uh those\nProjectors that but yeah there's actually right he's right that'd be like a star showers are show yeah whatever I mean you know this and I like I was down there so many different names in times this year here I mean there's showers stars light shower a\nLight up the house a Christmas this Christmas that are I mean there's so many of them and they're selling like talking to you know I'm Glad you\nLight up the house a Christmas this Christmas that are I mean there's so many of them and they're selling like how can you do\nYou know I'm Glad you reminded me of that because I bought one of those last year after Christmas and it was Seventy five percent off a while and I got to get that thing out of the attic and test it out\nBecause that's so easy to go out there and put it in the middle of the yard and projected on the house and plug it in ... ... that are kind of thing that is I I mean I like it the more simple simpler the better I think but\nYou know but I Do miss that the days are really getting out there and decorating and no don't who my kid [laughter] I'm like what am I say um but I Do enjoy other people to get into\nAll our yeah don't you love to drive around and look at\n... like I really do and say hey great job there and you knew there I didn't have to do things have drive but\nUh what I like those you know the older part of town that you go into you\nHave the odor decorations with the doors and those kinds of things and then the you know of course the I guess what would you call that the\nClass maybe I don't know it's not I mean but the where the houses in neighborhoods in subdivisions they've got you know the shows the lights the ... or whatever Santa Claus snowman trains running in the front yard I mean that's pretty cool so yeah but I first thing I get to Halloween then we got to get the Thanksgiving\nThey are hot I mean I understand because everybody wants to know what's going on I think most people enjoy being able to catch somebody and say something to him yeah I Believe if I were you are you know ... and they said they can hear the conversation is that right\nThat's right it's got to the audio feedback he's got an audio loop where you can hear as well as you know see video and a and they they have improved a lot but the thing about these uh once again or they're easy to hook up now because you can use the like I said the existing\nDoorbell transformers so um and then some of them are also battery operated wirelessly\nYou can take the little they got a little charging unit you could think of that in charge up like every every month or two months or something like that\nYeah I'd like the ones that would uh [noise] ... I don't have to fool with once on stall that so if you have the doorbell wire would that not does that not charging when you take the dog are you guys aren't wired to video cable in\n... that the ... the doorbell wire runs right into the power source of it empowers up off your transformer that runs a doorbell and then you Bluetooth to the\nTo your home or whatever yeah your wife ... to your system yeah and that's what makes a video doorbell to\nA little bit more better because you will uh they say it will tap on to a ... a little bit more of a few more different systems than the other ones were bitter because you know some like uh the oral pro cameras and things like that have a different receiving system but\nBut uh it's out there and is rated very highly so if you're looking for one and you want to spend an extra hundred dollars you can get that\nExtra hundred plus we'll get information about what we're gonna segue right into the still about the home and you know these are some things that we talked about that we can you can do maybe I'm ... actually these are things that pay off for you than improvements at your home and I was looking for some things to talk about some great things\nYou know one of them was what bothered them met that we always talk about that you didn't prove you know simple\nRenault Hank a paint Israel painted front or read [laughter]\nThere you go that's a good segue there so but you know why it pays off which is why because paint providers dramatic results with little investment so have you desire to have professional do the work such a sort of propane there's you know expect to pay thirty six hundred and six thousand furniture and an average American house about twenty four hundred square feet\nAnd extra job or run about five thousand or more so one of the things that you want to do is always asked for some help is not as okay an interior designer somebody he'll be matched inside outside you won't make sure that the roof\nYou know colored has got some kind of play in the in the in the uh extreme they're making sure you get and which colors you want to choose to paint the house and I don't know about ... Matt ... been ... um [noise] a favor inciting\nAt one time you know that was a big especially the new deciding that you can use now you know you don't even have painted or even do any type of maintenance for twenty five years just as hard as concrete\nWhile yes what you just said it's funny you said that 'cause it's as a you know study conducted by remodel a magazine fiber scene meant siding which has made a ... and so he loves fibers and cause an average of Thirteen thousand two hundred dollars is estimated to recoup about eighty eight percent\nYou meant siding which has made a ... and so he loves fibers and caused an average of Thirteen thousand two hundred dollars is estimated to recoup about eighty eight percent and I hear that all the time now a lot of contractors are going to\nThis is a hearty hearty plant board I think this what's called saying something like that you do a you know and vitals been improved and improved before maybe\nIt wasn't you'd be protected and it turned yellow and and then there was got hard and they can crack and they would split in urban limit them tends to Denton fade I mean because I've you touching aluminum you put a dent in it\nAnd I remember the old aluminum siding you know it'd be like the color white after a while you were touching you get white powder on\nYeah that's absolutely right so you know I don't know if I mean I guess older homes older wouldn't homes if you want to not have to paint but then he got to be careful about his hysterical society if you're in that area so you make sure each it with him about that you know it always what pays office building\nAnd I think you meant historical and I'll let you say that I call I'm going on now as I Know that I'm living everybody know what you are actually you know ... ... oh his job and you know I feel\nSorry for those people because it go I mean wouldn't when does are expensive and they got a tremor mountain would and then I Do that all over and they fix some they paying them and then of course the pain fade into ... and then you go back up again where some people have come up with things that looks like would but it's it's it's a plastic material and it lasts forever\nBut they won't let them put that in just is not hysterical that's right [laughter] so are building a deck always pays off you know it's always nice you can go out and sit down and your deck in a\nA bright colors to paint now they have nice concrete paint kind of stuff that my mother put on hers and it was just an excellent choice it sells\nYou know fills in the ... the gaps in in a has a little a course powder in it too so you won't slip and slide when it rains and ... it was excellent to to do that outside of hers uh what always pays off as updating the kitchen now guys do you spend more and more time in the kitchen or less and less\nUh you know over here not too much time in the case [laughter] she just went on the Internet all the time you\nJust when you need something to eat\nI agree but I mean I mean what's\nThere to spend time in the kitchen well I don't know I've been\nTelling my youngest one uh Isabelle that you know she wants to cook and I thought you know when he started cooking quitting so much fast food let's get some fresh vegetables and go getting fresh meat chicken or fish or or beef and in a uh some fresh fruit and this prepare meals and stuff and and we haven't done that yet [laughter]\nOkay so you're spending a lot more or less time in the kitchen and I know what it is it's a hurry lifestyle and\nBobby's got that too now match laid back and doesn't have any children but he is very busy all the time but uh it it's just ...

few tips on some of those right now you need to be sure you got one slicing and ensure be sure because that that's a\nThat's a tough job right the if you get the wrong person that they're cutting the treaty that follows on your house a lot of damage is done who pays for it also one of the things you need to look for is after the tree is cut down\nThe shore somewhere in the closet says that they will be a grind stumped for you that you don't have to have an extra hundred or two hundred dollar charge for that there's a lot of the biggest misleading things right there\nWill tell them why that they want to make sure that their license insured\nYes because you know if that happens in your insurance company to uncover\nWell that's the problem if they get hurt and they don't have insurance and they're on your property then they're going to go to your insurance company\nAnd you got to be All right yeah I've never\nUnderstood why if you hire somebody and this guy is working for this company you hired he doesn't have insurance and something happens to his worker then you're responsible why why is that he was on his job with his employer why am I responsible for that it just makes no sense to me\nWell that's true and why is it if you're\nGoing to visit the neighbor's house and you walk across somebody's yard and trip and fall and fall on stubborn hurt yourself you can see that neighbor and get your money I mean it's down and shouldn't have been in their yard that's right but I don't know if that's the lawyer side to make money or an insurance I wouldn't be 'cause they're losing money mhm but a ... that's a good question\nAnd he is going back to what Bob he's talking about about the ... uh you don't want to hire somebody who is not license and insured because you don't want to read to fall on some structure to your property and then go oops and hop in the trucking in\nHere and you know make that cut make that\nCut and they thought it was supposed to follow this way and if I was on your neighbors car\nI mean I hadn't even ... even worse than that some of them have been cutting trees down here in this uh you know these are some of this weather here lately here and it's been hitting the power lines it went out here there's a lot more [laughter] a lot more houses without electricity that's your fault new pays for it they're not sure about who pays for the damage there\nYeah it was a Saturday about seven months ago or we'd finished house uh I'd been back home and my wife and I had had a little lunch\nAnd the power went out beautiful sunny day or what happened then I'll look down and now do you have underground utilities are yes well my neighborhoods a little bit older and we [noise]\nSo you got me now yeah okay\nAnd I look out and the power lines are just shake and I'm like okay maybe that's one of the ... ... email look down the street and the neighbor was cutting a tree and it fell on the power lines and luckily it didn't bring them down but it made a made the break or throw somewhere but they had ...\nWell that's I take that back mad at my house are to how these two houses the one next door to us was added after the subdivision was developed so yes we have above ground lines but I see a lot of new subdivisions which I think is very smart\nIt's all underground and then comes into your house in ... and now we have cold weather actually ice or freezing or somebody missed cuts they're not fall over power and so I think that's over the years you'll probably see that get better and better and that\nKind of stuff ... so that's what you always hear when there's like an ice storm coming somewhere dry in the you know the power lines and the trees are going to\nThere was a rule don't drive over don't try to step over don't go around that don't go near it\nComing somewhere dry in the you know the power lines and the trees are going to\nVote there was a rule don't drive over don't try to step over don't go around that don't go near it just like you don't go near the water over the road because we don't get swept away\nSo I you know and also another thing that is when you're cutting trees down and have a professional to him you know be sure that they know exactly what you're doing because think about it a lot of these trees they they won't cut it out right after big hurricane storm and these trees are wet when they when the weight of them is like three or four times the original wait to watch that either I\nHey what about the guy I've seen so many what America's funniest videos or they cut it then they go I got is going to go right way to look at all of a sudden it's going the opposite way than running into this crashes the house or a car or you know are actually hit some people I mean\nAnd I have you seen those loans are there on the ladder and they're cutting the branch and it cuts in it hits and then it flips and knocks ladder down and I mean you know it's I don't know I'm too old for all that now\nYeah but you like to look at the video and I do you know I mean you go there's some things you say about those people\nAnd when somebody is holding the branch down the guys cutting it and then the Pam it violates knocks him so I don't know just be careful out there are professional\nThat's probably the best thing you could do I mean if you're handy thing go for it but you know the best best just hire somebody who is license and insured and they can take care of it for you and you don't have to worry about it all your dues right to check\nTheir ego bobbitt you okay another thing in the news like I mentioned at the top of the hour was apples streaming TV services coming to the market right after the first year\nYou see I knew what was going on because you know I was listening to you guys have had a meal what was going on when things are broke loose though I knew at that point I mean the bomb somewhere to go to Iran is a they got in the basement until everything\nPassed over and you guys was going to

and Tony hill [noise]\n\n\nWelcome every body this had hill and as always I'm here with my lovely wife Tony we are your host for retire with freedom\nAnd Tony we're going to talk today about guessing gone wrong and if you if you put this through the lens of\n... what do people care about the most when they're retiring ... what is their main concern so people's main concern is am I going to be able to quit working mhm and not run out of money and you always say this and not have to worry about it\nSee that's the biggest thing for me I mean not the biggest but it is part B of the question is if you live your whole life and you never ran out of money great job right if you worried about it the whole time what kind of life is that\nI mean if you're not certain and confident that you've got this nailed I mean it's really difficult to have an enjoyable life\nAnd you know I really do think if I had to boil down what we do in in what my opinion is of what we do I think given people back confidence and ...\nIs one of the things that we do well so what we're going to talk about now through the lens of that issue right just how do we not run out and I will be confident not only be confident is guessing going wrong\nRight and that's what we usually see tad when you know like a couple of come in all the time and it sometimes with single folks that come in and and they say you know\nTony we think we've got this figured out we're working with somebody or whatever we think and when we really dig in there and ask a lot of really good questions about things\nThey really aren't that sure about how it's gonna work there's been a lot of guesswork in their current quote retirement plan right so it's they think I mean that's the problem and it's such a disconnect and it's and it's um for me\nTroublesome I mean you know for people out there that I think they've got to figure it out because they they're working with somebody they think of as figure it out for them and then I asked them questions like how does that work and what's this going to do and all that and they're just not sure so it's confusing so let's dig into the meat of that well one of them\nDoes that work and life is going to do and all that and they're just not sure so it's confusing so let's dig into the meat of\nThat well one of the things that um you know we talk about in our class that we teach in by the way let me take a second here and just let you know our listeners\nWe do a class that is a a very deep dive into retirement planning it really gives us an opportunity to go into details that we just can't do on the radio show where the TV show\nSo for our listeners who may not know we've Tony amount amount to a television show as well it's on Saturdays at eleven on CBS so if you want to see us and actually now just hearing voices but uh see us talk about stuff we can also use some visual aids on the television show that we can't do on the radio but\nBut this class or is a deep dive in we strongly encourage you our listeners to come to this class if you'd like to do that just call the office\nOr you can call now we've got operators are that can take the message and then our staff will call you back or you can call during the week but the number is nine eight triple zero six nine eight triple zero six and so\nRunning out of money and guessing gone wrong we talk about in this class\nOne of the\nPrimary all I Would say the primary yeah it's the most I think it's the first jumping off point in and it's\nThe one that people are always guessing at but they don't think they're guessing now and that is how much income\nAre you going to need from your savings in retirement\nIn alleys Andrew guess what they're going to need absolutely and the person that working with allows him to do that and then they you know ... and the I mean if we don't get this park right nothing else\nWorks let me give an example of exactly what I'm Talking about here so recently I started working with a very nice couple they were listening to the radio show they called in and and are scheduled an appointment\nWhen we sat down\nI introduced myself his name was Joe her name was Jerry so we're sitting in our conference room right here in the\nYou know where my conference room and I guess any office right now our radio studio here so we're sitting in our conversation I'm sitting next to him and I said what inspired you to call us you know what's on your mind doing because that's how we start all of these er visits\nAnd it turns out Jerry's was a school teacher and she's been retired for a couple of years Joe's an executive at one of the companies here locally and he wants to retire in the next couple of years\nUh and they want to travel a lot they've got kids that live in different states and they've got young grandkids and in one of the things that that that's really important to them as they want to spend time with the grandkids while the grand kids want to spend\nTime when I hear that a lot [laughter] I'd get it so\nIt's a a\nA you know it's just one of the ways that life works a but it's it's important to understand those things so that we can focus on on doing the things that matter to us\nAnd so they can spend the time necessary to do that and less Joe's not working anymore because his job's pretty demanding and I said okay well what are your concerns and they said well you know it's just what you say on the radio we think we've done a good job we've saved money\nAnd we're not extravagant people were not spend trips you know we love a pretty simple lifestyle and and so we've got somebody that we're working with we really like\nBut we don't know that he's a retirement plan or it feels like every time that we're sitting down with him were just talking about our portfolio right you know we're just going through here the mutual funds and the stocks and bonds and here's how your allocated\nAnd we're just talking about our portfolio right you know we're just going through here the mutual funds and the stocks and bonds and here's how your allocated and here's your performance\nAnd we've heard you talk about retirement planning is a lot more than that it's a lot deeper than that it's a lot broader than that you know we've got to figure out how is our life going to work and how is all this going to sit together and have we thought\nThrough all these things and I said okay well you've put down here because we ask people to fill out a really short a it's a one page saying but asked some good questions that are helpful for us to help them mhm analyze things\nSo the first thing I did was I looked at how much income they're going to need mhm because that's where we always start out I that's the most important I mean after we figured out what really matters to someone ran and what\nWhat they're doing iron yeah yeah I mean I I Would thank you for that I ... I was struggling to find [laughter]\nSo I looked at it and I said okay it says here you're going to need\nSixty thousand dollars a year to level mhm which is five thousand dollars a month right and I said just out of curiosity how did you arrive at that number in and Jerry said we'll had high track all of\nThese things and I'm the one that pays the bills you know I'm retired and Joe works and so I Do a lot of the stuff you know he used to do this but now I Do it\nAnd uh and that's about what goes out the door every month and I said okay so when I hear words like that yeah about what goes out the door it's like ... so I explained to them how we do our lifestyle in our ... and I don't want to get into the you know they did have an eighty healthier but it's not it's not complicated ... pretty easy and quick\nSo they did the lifestyle I'm Alice ... and\nDidn't support the lifestyle they went away because if we plan for the wrong number yeah how are we doing now we're not doing that al ... or ... [noise] so is so so if we tell Joe he\nCan retire mhm and were wrong how much\nDamage have we done them now is it's horrible I mean it has it's going to be bad\nSo we don't do that [laughter] so we we are so anyway I explained\nOr a lifestyle now so we got back together for our next meeting and would you like to know what the results of our lifestyle analysis where\nI Can't wait to hear it [laughter] you take a guess alright well from my experience what are they spending Ninety [noise] a year you said it was sixty that can sixty was an eighty Ninety eight\nNo no no it was it that you nailed it it was Ninety\nSo when we when when when people are guessing and trying to figure this out alone and they and they want to cut out 'cause it makes it makes you feel better to just cut out a bunch of oh we don't have to do that we don't have to do this so we only need this much money\nSee the thing that I find that happens too often isn't so much the roots yeah 'cause I mean we can kind of agree or ruthless difference in late but okay I got I'm I'm I'm a painting the house I mean if it's not painting the house it's adding a decorated the air conditioner\nThe hot water heater early hot water heater I don't know ... ... yeah\nIn the last five to seven years we've replaced both hot\nWater heaters into air conditioning and you know what more so than its windows I mean so you know I was in the roof if the insurance companies pay for this story and start talking about the window [laughter]\nBut here's the thing that I find that they do more than that well I don't know that they do it more than that but but it's it's more it's more dangerous OK okay\nThey take their normal life style stuff mhm and start slashing it yeah oh we go out to dinner and so we'll just quit going out to dinner and we we do stuff for the grandkids so we're just going to quit doing stuff for the grandkids\nNo you're not tiny now right\n'cause because here's the thing no but so so let's go back to what we're really talking about running out of money right and dressing going wrong guessing guessing about so here's the bottom line and and and that's these are great stories that but the bottom line is\nUm it makes people feel better when they felt like they're spending less right but but I tell people all the time being on a budget slightly on a diet pretty soon you have to eat a cheeseburger you are not going to eat\nSo like they're spending less right but but I tell people all the time being on a budget slightly on a diet pretty soon you have to eat a cheeseburger you're not gonna eat salads\nEveryday [laughter] especially reading burgers or my favorite and I go to stake out all the way you know that I'm safe if I just order you a cheeseburger yeah\nThat you get me a cheeseburger and I'm good but but I mean so that's the thing I mean pretty soon you're going to you you you're not going to live like that and and by the way when people come in and what they ultimately want on our first visit\nWith with people in our in were sitting there and the coverage and we're talking and we're seeing what do you want and nobody ever says you know what I really want to do I just want to live less of a lifestyle that I'm doing right now right you know what I don't want to ever eat out again I don't want to go on vacations I don't want to help because my grand I hate doing stuff for the grand [laughter] yeah\nSo so I always say hey look to gather the three of us or if it's a ... a single person the two together well let's figure out what makes you the most comfortable and the happiest you can be let's figure out what that is let's let that be our target are real target let's don't guess at what that is this really identify what it is\nAnd then let's figure out how we get there and if there needs to be some adjustments will make them but we're not guessing at them\nSo so I had a visit recently with a couple and um his name was Phil and hers was Donna so feeling Donna came in\nAnd they had done the thing that I was talking about they had taken all these like regular lifestyle stuff not the roots in the air conditioners but just regular stuff and just slashed it yeah\nAnd and I said you know really you don't want to do these things and I said well no we we want to do those things but we're more concerned about being able to retire because they really didn't like their job so we're sitting down here in our coverage from Tracy had brought 'em in gotten them their cookie\nYeah everybody ... is like I Love going to all of these ... fresh baked baked cookies and the the people usually like the\nChocolate chip with America Damien that better for it in your in your\n... ...\nSo we're sitting down they're having to cook you'd be like all these cookies are amazing and I said yeah that's Tracy she does that\nSo uh so I said why of you you know done this and I said well we're so miserable at work yeah oh yeah that's terrible that we're willing to you know we lived on nothing before and yeah we can do it again\nAnd I said listen guys what if you don't have to you know what if we can create a plan where you're able to keep doing the things you want to do and they said yeah but we're scared\nTo spend the money because we don't want to run out you say this all the time good retirement planning is not about\nTossing people's money in a bucket of stocks and bonds and hoping that we don't live through a decade like the two thousands yeah because people can't sleep at night\n'cause even if they don't run out if they spend the next Thirty years worrying about it and they can't spend the money they've saved and they can't do stuff for the grandkids are they're scared to go out to eat what kind of life is that is terrible I mean so so what we were able to do for them which I find is most of the time\nWere able to put together a plan or they're going to be able to continue to do all the things that they're used to doing you know they're not going to be able to buy a Learjet\n[laughter] I don't they probably didn't even but yet I Dream that was not on their list of things they care that yeah\nAnd so don't you find that for most people were able to have a plan that's going to give them certainty allow them to have confidence that they can do the things they want to do without having to hoard the money\nYeah and and in everybody's situation is different but I think both ends of the spectrum which we do\nOr the money yeah and and in\nEverybody's situation is different but I think both ends of the spectrum which we do see some people are over confident and they aren't ... aren't thinking about it as deeply as they should ... they're not getting the right\nAdvice they're not getting the right structure and we and here's how you know you're not getting the right advice you're not sure how that's going to work when I sit down there how sure you that you're not going to run out of money\nEvery time I asked that question they look at each other and go or not really\nSure at our broker says we're fine yeah [laughter] yeah and I say okay well how did you how do you feel like well I don't know you know he's run these reports that say it should be okay but every time the market\nDrops my stomach drops with it yeah so let me make a suggestion for our listeners\nIf these people circumstances the stories that we've been telling you to date these very real situations that have happened right here in our office if they resonate with you and you and you're wondering\nHow is this going to work for me have I really nailed down what I'm going to need am I too scared to do this when really I Would like to or I just want to so bad I don't care what I have to do wouldn't you like to be able to figure this out and have the confidence of

it all for and so the point we're making here is the voice of greed mhm can\nReally do rail yeah especially in retirement mhm 'cause we're not talking about strategies for twenty five or thirty or I you know our daughter Payton is working out doing very well we're very proud of her\nAnd she's asking us for investment advice on how she's uh she's gotten some stock options and that kind of stuff and how she should take them and all of that\nHas to listen on you'd be\nBe as a ... adult to them and I'll be aggressive as you can\nWrite it you're young that's a completely different situation than an who's retiring in two months yeah well so the voice of greed can get you in trouble\nAnd you know what I tell ten ... you know I I say this I probably I probably only really have to say this or to have this conversation with some clients about maybe once or twice a year but when somebody kind of gets director of like you just were talking about\nFor and there um\nI just say let's go back and keep the main thing the main thing I mean what are we trying to do okay well we don't want to run out of money okay is that the biggest thing we do we want the money to last ten years Twenty years the well we like it to last as long as we do okay\nI agree with you [laughter] you have permission to die whenever you want to [laughter] so so the obvious thing is how about if we can you see how we have structure to plan where\nYou could live as long as you want to you could live into your hundreds and you're never you can see it it's not like we're guessing or we're hoping or or\nWell you know and let me and let me I'm Sorry to interrupt but not as I Want to make a point here\nAlmost every plan and we have ... and the only the only time this isn't the case is somebody's is adamant about it yeah but almost every play and we have we have money set aside\nFor a long term growth yeah I'll pay for play out in ... which is primarily stocks yeah right right so I Want to be clear that we're not suggesting that by staying out of the stock market and retirement is a good idea right what what I'm saying is if that's your retirement plans that\nYou're only hope I Hope\nI Hope the next Thirty years go flawlessly from an economic business global economy in stock market standpoint because if they don't you could be setting yourself up for a lot of pain big\nTime yeah I mean not that got a story I'll tell her short story that I I had a couple of\nCame in and and um he said to me um\nKnow I just think everything's going so well on you know I'm trying to do this all myself and I've done really well the past two years I've just been nail in it that's pretty sad\nAnd to me um you know I just think everything's going so well I'm you know I'm trying to do this all myself and I've done really well the past two years I've just been nail in it that's what he said he has for stocks [laughter] about that oh he has for stocks and\nYou know I've kind of track them since we've had this conversation several months ago when they're up and down and up and down up and down you know but he's like you know I'm I've been known to the past two years and I think I'm going to double my money in the next two years [noise]\nSo we had this conversation and I'm like well I asked her us 'cause wife you know how do you feel about this she's like I don't know I don't know anything about this I'm just leaving it up to him [noise]\nSo so then I say All right ... what happens if you don't do all your money in two years because he had kind of gotten behind he ... he's a partner\nAt ... the voice of greed is really concerned when people think they're ...\nSo he has a business partner and his business partner has saved more money than him\nYou know that kind of thing he hasn't been site to what's going on there so he thinks he needs to catch a B needs to do a little better so he literally trying to hit some home runs ... I mean he wants to be retiring in three years so the next two years he's going to in his mind on double his money then he's gonna\nBe more reasonable and because he he agrees this is unreasonable I don't want to this forever been two years I'm going to do it so when we look at the analysis that show the real data of not just what we think about all the experts are saying the next seven to ten years in the markets and all this kinda stuff he's like okay fine I'll do it in one year\nNo because the parents like projections right now by you know ... most people know more every modest growth yeah yeah I mean not not not not not but he's not the time we've been seeing yeah but you know the the\nBut here's my point is if you were saying in the mid to thousands that the markets you know we were going to be twenty thousand which is you know world right now but we're going to be there and the next five years in five years later\nYou know people were going back to work and you know handle you know [laughter]\nIt was wherever they share yeah and and so that's my point chasing returns chasing getting when you've got that greed in your head that voice of green your head you're you're chasing something and it it may seem intuitively like the thing to do\nBut if you can not clearly see if you asked yourself this how sure and lie\nThat my retirement is gonna go smoothly how sure about that and I really sure I'm a supercontinent ... one other quick story I had a couple a and last week and he always says to me he says Tony let me ask you one thing 'cause he's super nice love this guy by the way I just love them [laughter] so so ... they're talk which I'm an older\nAnd your coverage really on the other side are Little Rock operas rooms on one side of the radio room nurse is likely see we have to have that we have to have the radio room in between uh yeah so that yeah I don't know why [laughter]\nYou know it's a sign of something funny and I had to you're not that funny oh so we only want the kids say but I don't agree with you at ... o'clock myself up\nYeah so so I mean so he says to me like Tony ... moved from a bunch of different you know all the things that we're talking about but at the end of the meeting and we're sitting there talking about her visit were ... more of it at the end of the visit he says Tony\nI got one last question and I said what's that because I've already thought this is my this is our first visit so I haven't really said that he goes what if I die first 'cause that's you know I'm pretty sure I'm with you know three years old and and I said\nYeah I Know what it was really a whole lot of people that are on the ... and he said what if\nBecause that's you know I'm pretty sure on that you know three years old and and I said our lesson yeah\nI Know there's a whole lot of people that are not thinking about that\nAnd he said why God Bless him and I hope his wife appreciate\nYeah if I told her I said you need to give them a great big hockey thinking about you and said and I said you know what we are going to cover that our next visit we're going to go over everything I mean because what we have to do is planned for both of them live forever\nMost of the both of them die tomorrow one of them dies tomorrow why don't I mean every contention there's got to be a plan a B that you have to and and you have to be okay and you have to know why that is going to work how it's going to work\nAnd that's what ... ... gives you confidence and takes a while he had a thing\nYou know that you've got ... we say that in the class that we teach you we have to plan like you're going to live forever and we've got a plan like you're going to die tomorrow we have to have a plan for both of those things because we don't know the answer\nAnd if you're guessing you know we talked earlier about guessing go wrong right if you're guessing about this one you're setting yourself or your spouse potentially up for disaster and when we talk about that a lot in the class that we do that we were able to do a deep dive and all of this stuff you know we've got white boards and knock and get up there and\nDraw a bunch of pictures and it's it's really fun [laughter] so if you'd like to come to that class you should give us a call you can call now or you can call during the week\nUh and just you can call now and talk to the operators they'll take a message or you can call during the week and ask for an or ... or somebody here in the office can help you get scheduled for the next class we got one coming up before too long a and that number is nine a triple zero six\nNine eight triple zero six but in addition to that if you're ready to get real retirement planning done you\nDon't want to wonder about these things any more you want to know what happens if I live forever what happens if I die tomorrow\nHow's my wife or husband going to be taken care of if I go first or am I going to be taking care of if they go first what happens if this voice of greed in my head ends up being the wrong advisor\nAnd am I Am I starting to get so greedy about what's going on in the stock market that really am setting myself up for retirement ruin\nThere's an actual term in our industry for running out of money it's called retirement ruin\nWhich sounds a lot ... well that sounds bad but it doesn't sound as much as that running\nSo if you've got questions like that and you want to know the answers we're happy to sit down with you in visit with your right hand her office you can sit in my office next to the radio room or you can sit and Tony solve is next to the radio room but one of us\nWill be sitting down with you in helping you figure this out and we do this visit at no cost of no obligation", "show_name":
