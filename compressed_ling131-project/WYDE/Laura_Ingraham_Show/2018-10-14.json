attention and making sure that the right pills went in the right little plastic bucket\nWell in some senses that is true concerning faith and Jesus but only in some senses because one of the Bible says about faith is this that it is by grace through faith that we are save\nAnd this is not our own doing\nIt is the gift of God\nSo that the vet a faith that a man or woman exercises in the person of the Lord Jesus is not something that they look inside and fined for themselves and by themselves but it is actually a gift\nFrom God enabling blind people to see and those who do not believe to

also be that what they're arguing is you should give glory to God\nNot to this Jesus of Nazareth\nWhat is being said here it's not that the thief on the cross didn't have a hole in the world of ever getting that haven't because he was a sinner hanging on across next to Jesus and he asked them lord well you're a member of me when you come into your kingdom did did God to Jesus listen to the center of course he did\nThe Jesus listen to the kids and his cries for changes he did did you listen to the woman taking an adultery yes he did well what is being said here what is being said here can be

listen to the in tendons and he hears the cries of Benetton but he does not listen to those who are willful in their own belief and in their sin\nSecondly\nHe does listen to the godly man who does his

them and says you know you're the one should be starting off with a premise Reno this therefore that we know this therefore that he says let's do the same thing we know that God does not listen to the

and if this man we're not from God he couldn't do nothing\nNow\nLet's pause for just a moment because there's a lesson here for each of us in speaking to people concerning faith in Jesus Christ\nLet's pause for just a moment because there's a lesson here for each of us in speaking to people concerning faith in Jesus Christ\nWe may think about high point in John chapter nine is arguably the twenty five when he\nSays I don't know about what you know but I Do know what I Know and that is I Know that I was one blind to it now I can\nSee some of it I think\nA real tendency to retreat to that kind of thing\nWell you can argue me out of my experience I Know my experience I Know what happened to me and our friends walk away from it and say idiot because they wouldn't be able to say that they've had experiences of different things in different places and so on\nWe have told them that we prayed to the living God they've said that they can uh in in the realm of Buddhism\nWe've said that there is peace to be found in this they said they have never known such tranquility as they found it and not eastern mine said well then what are we going to do at that point you see\nWell this man is convinced of his testimony\nBut when push comes to shove and the challenge reaches for him he is able to step up and say well let's just think about this for a moment\nAnd why don't we think about this too and have you considered that and do you agree that this this and this leads to the ducks and so his faith was resting in the experience of what Christ had done for him to this point\nAnd he was absolutely without any doubt concerning it\nBut that wasn't the beginning in the end of his argument\nNow what we discovered is that they feel the sting of this the stinging impact of truth hits them and then ... therapy for\nAnd they do the only thing they've got left to do and that is they throw him out\nBut you will notice they don't throw him out until they have given their own answer to the question with which the chapter began how did the chapter begin well remember with a disciples asking Jesus who's sitting this man or his parents that he was born blind\nThe ... say we know the answer to that question the reason you were blind is because you were steeped in sin at birth\nYou are a miserable center that's where you are\nHow dare you lecture us don't you realize that we've gone to school for this\nDo you understand that we have the legacy the historical background of Judaism on our side and use some upstart beggar from the streets here think strict come in and confront us\nTo see how how the challenge of truth gets under the skin of those who knows they don't know the\nVery truth they are encountering\nWe ought to be surprised when our friends and neighbors wound up eventually just throws out\nFrankly we ought to get thrown out a lot more than we do many of us and the reason we are not throwing out the reason would accept it may be because we are more represented by the fear of the parents than we are represented in the face of the main ones blind\nWe're ready to watch the questions\nWell I don't know about that oh I'm not so sure about that well maybe you could ask someone else about that Tom on have the courage of your convictions\nHow dare you lecture us\nHave that courage in their convictions\nHow dare you lecture us\nAnd they threw him out

singer\nBreak asks his buddy if he met his backup singer he takes another shot and realizes he's not sitting with his body then he spends an hour searching for the perfect song [noise]\nOn stage he can't read the lyrics on the monitor he explains to everyone that he can't read gobbledygook gray decides to freestyle rap he keeps repeating the line I don't read no gobbledygook we\nAnd the structures are are are more more study that they're able to withstand uh uh the storms what they would do some of these high rise condos to test the windows they would fire a a four by four out of the cannon and if it just broke your past of a shattered it didn't pass\nSo they would do these things coming out of hope will and I said I think this is the first major storms since then to hit that area has got to be interesting to see how you know I I Know it's been about Twenty years since a lot of these changes went into effect but I Am what\nI I fully expect to happen is things things given given that that happened are going to be as bad as they might have been when when ...\nThrough what about like a preparations for this thing 'cause we didn't know exactly where it wasn't going to hit we knew the panhandle but when we could name a steady or anything like that until earlier today or the fact that this thing\nWas lacking the preparation or the heads up that we had with Lawrence and how it seemed to just go from tropical depression to camp for what what was the feel like in Tallahassee are are in the panhandle\nWhen when you got word that things actually going to be bad or when ... when did that happen\nSo I think we're about four or five days out probably over the weekend or he started again you know kind of keep an eye on this and and the idea was\nIt was going to be a media cat one at worst maybe a tropical both tropical storm\nBut once you started you know I I think it really picked up strengthen the Gulf and we had an unusually hot summer and an unusually long summer was hot into\nSeptember an early part of October I don't think that helped batters a whole lot but I the the the idea that the storm I think really built up strength there at the end just due to that the warm water in the Gulf of Mexico\nAnd these things have happened in the past uh they should think of a couple of ... um you know I I kind of started my journalism career in mobiles so I've kind of watch these storms is the way\nThe way they develop the ones that come out of Yucatan Peninsula that they come in like that they they have a tendency to really gain strength in a hurry\nThat's why I think happened here and that's why I think he caught I caught some people by surprise now that a school students here to FSU students\nThey cut them loose out of school yesterday so a lot of people in town I think a lot of students are gone a state government shutdown too but I I think the regular Tallahassee residents are pretty much ride this thing out\nThough is ah Andrew Gillum like hit jumping Jack then you make sure you're okay\nSo here's this bizarre controversy going on in Florida right now about uh so the scientists his Republican opponent right so I interviewed run it for ... for governor of Florida and he's got it probably get opponent and\nThe kind of gentleman's agreement that they were going to pull each other's ads and it was going to be a time of coming together or whatever and we're going to get through the store and\nI guess in Jacksonville and maybe another marketed Palm Beach they were running some of the commercials\nAnd ever and we're going to get through the store and I guess in Jacksonville and maybe another marketed Palm Beach they were running some of the commercials\nCriticizing Andrew Gillum for his handling of the hurricane two years ago a with hurricane her mind and that's become kind of the controversy had given went on MSNBC once already today ... ... ... prior to the one you just saw him on\nAnd he wouldn't complain to raise that point so there's this you know this backdrop the politics of it all kind of playing out\nIn the old double cross and the political had\nGot him when he got him um you expect if if your power goes out or if the power goes out in Tallahassee\nDo you expect Andrew Gillum to to take his time and getting your power cut back on a since you work for Breitbart that's a good point\nAbout ... about two hours ago running on a battery power and a hot spot\nRight now I got you you may want to\nKeep his right outside ...\nLike I go there a thing about the the hurricane that I was going to mention the second to go with the fact that there are things hitting land and this goes into the how it's going to affect you are in the coming hours or how it staying at a cat for and then moving down through a cat too and and there's still\nA major storm by the time it gets up to like South Carolina ... is that normal for you living in that the that part of the country\nNo I I think ah you take a Katrina maybe when you think of storms really out of that kind of staying power over land and not breaking up and staying organized there was one thing about this store says it's a little smaller is moving faster\nThat's you know when when when it's moving faster that's given at the ability to kind of stay organized and not break up like a lot of these stores traditionally do I think\nUh otherwise that that it's more it's more about that the good news of that is moving fast it gets over with faster but the bad news is Millwood fast which means that that gives it more it has more coverage area and what that speak a moral wins and faster wins\nRight men or the fact that it's just making that track up through Georgia obviously we here in Birmingham and even maybe in North Alabama will have some spin off from that for a moment right before it reaches land I thought that bad boy was going to cut north northwest\nAnd maybe not get as much of Georgia and more of Alabama but it actually stay on that track they said it was going\nWell I think a cold front coming through and and we're supposed to get some cooler temperatures that Alabama coming into the weekend and I think that ... is really why it's pushing toward Georgia that north easterly track\nYeah mental that'll obviously pushing out to the coast and and send it back where am I wrong yeah get outta here with MS\nWell we're going to a well obviously keep in touch with y'all be taxing you and stuff and you can just let me know how things are going what are the other big things in in the news right now that we're on the backside and we didn't talk to you since the confirmation that Kavanaugh\nUm what was your overview once it was said and done and he was sworn in what was your overview of the whole thing\nKnow I I think the Democrats really overplayed this are\nThey now we're going into it they had to do what they had to do to stop at the ... I think they needed to lease look like they put up a fight but they didn't legitimately put up a good fight and or an delayed it for a while but I I think there's some collateral damage I think it hurts them and it helps Republicans you know I think both sides\nGot you know took a little bit of it on the chin but if you're doing a net net analysis of this\nI really think that the Republicans get some some some motivated voters out of it you already have Democrats motivated\nThat analysis of this I really think that the Republicans get some some some motivated voters out of it you already have Democrats motivated I don't know what else you could do to motivate the Democratic base right now they're in the streets to chase it down members of Congress\nThey're doing everything he does that that you just appears to have all the enthusiasm but now suddenly you see the little life or the Republican side so to me that's that's really important in somebody's house races and I think it also\nWill change the map of the Senate I I think they're going to pick up a few seats Republicans now could win Missouri they've just jumped out to double digits in uh in North Dakota they they could win West Virginia I think this is really backfire on Democrats in that regard\nWell in the Democrats claimed to have the momentum up before all this stuff happened and then the result was\nKavanaugh being put on the Supreme Court and depending on who you ask\nThey're going to say that they benefited from it if you ask Republicans they say yeah this has got a buddy fired up right before the midterms they're engaged again they're not just kicking back and enjoying a Trump pecan enemy they're actually paying attention and then on the Democratic side\nYou got to say oh we're so irate were fired up and we're going to we're going to uh take our rates to the ballot box so do you think the Democrats are a little less a genuine on that front\nI I think they got to put on your ... at least make it seem like that's that the riding the momentum into the election now here's what\nYou know I wasn't alive but it kinda makes you think of the Nineteen sixties when Woodstock and all these things these these race riots and\nAll this civil unrest what's going on in the country but well what happened like tall presidential politics next one to elections in his second one he won in a landslide and this was coming on the heels of all the uh the war protests and all of that\nSo I you know you kind of wander there may be a lot of action and all that a lot of activity in the street from the left\nBut that doesn't necessarily mean that that they can win elections out of this and I I I think there is a all diminishing returns and also think there's sort of a counter counter reaction to a lot of this because people don't like the sort of chaos in the streets of turns a lot of voters away especially swing voters\nRight well and we know that when it comes to\nThe record books or tradition when it comes to the era of Donald Trump we got to throw that out the window to an extent and and I think without seeing a president a Republican president that's on the road as much as he is he going from stadium stadium across the country\nPacking them out everywhere he goes getting people excited almost putting him in a position where they they have\nTo pay attention nobody's talked about more than Donald Trump that I I think that that in itself would have the Republican base more fired up than they generally would be heading into a mid term two years after an election right\nAnd and you know Congressman Mike Rogers folks they they they make this point we were sitting now fifty days out thirty days out of the uh twenty sixteen election it looks like rub Republicans will get wiped out and Congress and it was like ... it was on her way to a landslide\nAnd that turned out not to be the case should Republicans actually held on to Congress but the trick was and and I think this is the magic to sort of the magical lecture here was ... everywhere on the campaign trail he was doing some times\nNow rent Jeff have you had any Democrats getting up in your face as a famous Breitbart contributor rider I mean you just kind of thing maybe you might be targeted\nLike it's a perpetual state of danger in ...\nIt's understand but critics stripes and now without power you know so much more you can say\nYou never know what's going to happen I jak jak found on Breitbart check him out on you know hammer news dot com is all over the place yeah we will talk to you again next Wednesday my friend\nThank you for having me on again and there you go to a man Jeff poor will take a break our number two coming up next they'll go anywhere\nDo you want to do enough I'm Coleman W why do you um Birmingham\nW two three Seventy ...

test the capacitor how to clean a blower wheel and sure enough this guy was giving me pretty good explanations he missed one maybe two little steps but nothing that little training couldn't fix

you feel about selling customers things they don't need did you hear that folks\nHow do you feel about selling customers things they don't need now brace yourself folks\nBecause without hesitation he said I don't have a problem with it at all\nI don't have a problem with it at all and\nThe reality is that he had been around and worked for enough other air conditioning companies in the area that operate it that way that he thought that that's what I wanted to hear\nAbout from the table I shook his hand and exits are the interviews over we won't be offering you a job but I think you for coming in\nThen I interview another guy same questions he's doing a pretty good job and when I lean in and ask him my little trick question how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need\nThis guy did hesitate\nTo kind of dropped his head and then he looked back up and then he looked back down and then he said\nI can do it and if I'm being honest I have done it\nThe company that I worked for required that I'd bring back a certain dollar amount on every single call that I went on\nSometimes they didn't need anything but if I didn't sell them anything I was going to lose my job and man I got kids to feed but then I got to thinking am I setting the right kind of example for my kids so I had to quit\nAnd now I'm unemployed and the market is flooded with heating and air conditioning technicians and it's been hard to get a job\n\nThat's an example of the type of competitors we have out there guys I told stories\nIn interviews about heating and air conditioning companies training there technicians to jump wires on two thousand dollar compressors to sell new systems like crossing wires over to break them and there are hundreds of heating and air conditioning contractors in this area last time I checked\nAnd chances are pretty good that a technician like the one in ...\nThere are hundreds of heating and air conditioning contractors in this area last time I

about it he did you know that the department of energy they've done studies that have concluded that the average duck system in a U.S household\nLeaks twenty to twenty five percent of the era that travels through it\nOkay so there's two different kinds of Doug leakage first there's supply leakage that's on the side of your furnace or air conditioner that blows the cold or warm air out at ya\nSo eight twenty to twenty five percent loss means that twenty to twenty five percent of the air that has created at your machine that's blowing toward your bedroom or your kitchen or your family room is lost on the way\nThat's like fives intends and twenties just floating up out of your dog work flipping through the cracks\nThen there's the other kinds of leakage return leakage now this is a little more serious because our returns sometimes go unnoticed because we don't ever feel them doing anything that's because the returns don't blow air out they suck air in\nWell returns are the worst leakers instead of blowing cooled air out or cheated air out into your attic or you crawl space like supplies do\nReturns suck addict or basement or crawl space air in to your system and then blow it into your house it also pressure rises your house in a way that you don't want your house to be pressurized okay you're pulling contaminants\nWell what's the first thing wrong with that other than sucking Erin from those areas how about the fact that if your ducked works in the attic\nTemperatures can easily reach a hundred and thirty degrees sucking in a hundred and thirty degree air into your cooling system is like running your air conditioner or your heat pump with all your doors and windows open\nYou want to know what else was that about sucking an addict recall space air well in the attic and sometimes and calls me as to how about the fact that it's got all of that fiberglass insulation it just take yourself a bright flash light up there in the middle of the night sometime okay you'll see what I'm Talking about\nIt gets sucked into your returns and circulates through your heating and air conditioning system some of it lands on your coil and it gets you coil all clogged up and then when you're laying there sleeping at night with your mouth open it's raining down on you it's going into your lungs\nYou breathe it all in a\nYou know that stuff's says that it causes cancer right on the role or the package that it comes and don't you\nAdd to that all the toxic rap poisons and bug poisons that the bug companies spray up there and then cross spaces that we find sucked into these duck systems and you've got yourself one heck of a case to seal your duct work up\nEver wonder why you or someone in your family keeps getting sick or plugged up on a regular basis please look at your environment before you go shoveling drugs\nGore plugged up on a regular basis\nPolice look at your environment before you go shoveling drugs into your system that cause suicide and depression\nWhen we do a total system rejuvenation for you we're going to inspect your duct work as well and we're going to look for the tell tale signs of a good working duck system and we're going to let you know just how yours stacks up\nMaybe you're out\nThere going I just had my furnace or heat pump or air conditioning system checked out and they didn't say anything about my duct work and they never have\nOr maybe I said something in the last five minutes that resonated with you and do you want to make sure that your ducks are not creating a financial or health\nLiability\nHave must

you\nSave money on the greatest consumer of gas and electricity in your house this is your home for tips in advice on how to keep your furnace an air conditioner or eat bump running like a top and the show was brought to you by freedom heating and cooling\nAll right let's talk\nAbout your indoor below or we'll the squirrels cage the hamster wheel the blower we'll whatever you want to call it that's the part that's responsible for pushing the warm or cold air out of the vents in your home\nNow all the air and you're home from floor to ceiling from one into your house or the other it goes through your furnace and air conditioning system over one hundred times a day and because most people don't have really good filtration systems those blower wheels they tend to get a little bit of build up\nThen I'm going to open up those phone lines again and allow some more people to get that two hundred and fifty two dollar total system rejuvenation for free and you're absolutely going to love the surface I promise so here's the deal we're\nGoing to call you and give you a two hour window of time for the technician to arrive and when he shows up he's going to park on the street okay now our vehicles are meticulously maintained but at the same time you don't have a leak until you've got to leak right\nAfter he parks in the street he's going to walk up and knock on your door and when you let him in he's going to say I'm here to take care of your air conditioner or your for his or your heat part\nAnd he'll reach down and put on she covers over his shoes or boots we also call them for savers he's gonna wear those each time he enters your house\nThey'll show you the inspection and cleaning form and he'll say something like each of these represents a part of your heating and cooling system and as I'm going through your system I'm either going to mark okay or if\nIn cleaning form and he'll say something like each of these represents a part of your heating and cooling system and as I'm going through your system I'm either going to mark okay or if I see anything that's going to give you challenges in the future I'm In a market in this column over here\nAnd if you want me to take care of something before I leave I usually can now once he has your approval to do the tune up on his invoice he'll ask you to show him the thermostat and with your permission he'll turn it on and make sure that it's working next to ask you to show him the outdoor unit and then the indoor unit\nAt which point he'll say something like I'm going to start your tuna now if you wanna watch that's fine and if not but it's okay to and then he'll start the tuna\nNow his very first task is to take the top off of the outdoor air conditioning unit or heat pump\nNext to this to get the leaves and sticks and mocking debris out of the system because all that stuff holds water and Ross out the bottom of your air conditioner prematurely\nNext thing you know your compressors falling through the bottom of unit and you've got to get the new one okay so something as simple as getting the debris out of the bottom makes a huge difference\nNow the next step in my opinion is the best we're going to use a semi high pressure nozzle to spray down your ... from the inside out because we've got the top off\nNow this is on your outdoor air conditioning unit right and it sucks air in from the sides and along with it\nClippings and dust and whatnot so we're going to back flush it wash all that gunk back out of there and if you've got all that stuff's stuck in your air conditioning system it's just like having a sweater on that baby\nNow listeners if you were I we're going to go for a jog hot summer's day with a sweater on and destroying our mouth what would happen right our bodies wouldn't be able to release the heat and we'd get really really hot\nWell the same thing happens to your outdoor unit your air conditioner your heat pump if it's dirty it's going to overheat it's going to cause problems you're going to have a compressor fail you're going to have motors fail\nThe number one cause of compressor failure is dirty coils so we're going to get the outdoor coils cleaned up for you\nSometimes we even have to use a foaming cleanser to get all that stuff off and man is that a sight to see you're looking at a good forty five minutes just up to this point so you can see why I say these other maintenance is our drive by maintenance as right if they're there and gone and forty five minutes\nNext we're going to test the electrical components in your system all the connections make sure they're nice in tight makes you you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires because sometimes\nLittle things that go wrong with your air conditioning system and furnace they can cause big things to go wrong All right\nYou may have a pending compressor failure because you've got a little started that's about to go bad\nYou may have a pending motor failure because you're filters all plugged up and you're not paying attention to it All right so we're going to check all of those little components every part of your system that don't cost that much at all

I don't never know [laughter] double negative [laughter] I don't never know like\n'cause we just talk to each other all the time it's just kind of how we communicate and yeah but then sometimes I'll listen back to the show and I'm like oh I'm interrupting too much or you know\nNo I Am well to interrupt there just I don't know if our listeners would know this or not ... but\nBut our studios right you are in our office so it is kind of it's casual for me and to add we are just really talking to each other about a topic we are talking about and talk to talk about every day and deal with all day long every day so it is kind of just the ebb and flow kind of conversation and I think you know get some benefit from\n... in your in your conference room is on the left hand side of the studio and minds on the right hand side depends on what side of the table you know so we we ... yeah right I guess yeah if I'm facing your way minds on the letter on your zone right if you're face in my way of yours is on\nThe left and minds on the right then I say all that right who cares [laughter] so we're going to talk about procrastination but but but the point I was going to make was let's put it through the lens of what really is on people's minds All right so let's think about\nAre the folks that we help mhm water they worrying about what's on their minds what are the big questions they have the\nBiggest question is will my money last yep that is number one that isn't that is number one and everything is part to it that really that will not money last do I have enough yeah um what's gonna happen to me if something you know if I get sick or die well my family be okay\nOr or the reverse of that if something happens to my spouse will I be okay we'll Abby okay\nJacqueline um [noise] you know when can I retire is also a huge what [laughter] when can I get out of here and retired\nYeah and and and I don't want to make sure that I'm not making a mistake\nSo so you know I Want to you know we were talking about this recently and I think sometimes we\nHopefully we do a good job of explaining stuff to people but we need to make sure that that we are tying it to what they really care about is like it makes sense to us but sometimes I think that it's helpful for for our listeners\nIf we're clearly drawing that correlation yeah you know we're talking about procrastination well who cares everybody procrastinates one is that a big deal well it's a big deal because if you want to know when you can retire yet or if you want to know if your money is going to last or if\nYou want to know if your family is going to be okay if something happens to you or if you're going to be okay if something happens to your spouse\nThere's a limited window of opportunity a lotta times on those things I mean you really want to take care of things but for those things you know before you retire and the four things happened right and even if you've already retired let me say this to end have already made some decisions around that you know there are still\nYou know before you retire and before things happen right and even if you've already retired let me say this to and have already made some decisions around that you know there are still opportunities you know that we can take advantage of or maybe fix or improve on those situations as well\nExactly so All right so now that we now that we've established widest procrastination murder let's talk about some specific surrounded what what do you see\nAre the reasons that people procrastinate typically as it relates to retirement planning as it relates to getting all this stuff figured out\nWell here's one that I don't see I hear a lot anymore but I hear it every once in a while and it's my parents never really did any retirement planning and everything just seem to work out fine for them so surely things work out for me too\nYeah and you know it's a I think people are more aware than there used to be maybe yeah but there but I Do it and it makes sense right I mean I understand why people added feel this way I don't understand because what we learn from our parents was\nNever touched the principal live off the dividends and everything will be fine\nAnd enter and and I think even if people don't actually say that any more tattoo it does it is in the back of a folks as mines because\nBecause it is the ... their experience it is the experience of what their parents did there aren't seemed to be fine and surely there'll be okay to even if they don't really feel that way it kind of puts a little it kinda puts you know sand in their boots they slow down all the progress in April but we can wait longer\n... and so the point of this as is\nWe're not our parents anymore the world's not like our parents world was we're living longer we're having a different experiences uh the economy's different economics or different there's electronic trading now the world moves at a faster pace way faster than it used to\nIn pensions used to be a lot more common and I are now yeah you know I think you just said this but you talk about this all the time you know the money has to last longer you know we're living longer right as a society\nAnd that's the number one thing people worry about is will my money left will my money left and that is the big question ...\nYou know in the idea of will just live off the interest in the dividends interest for as not what it was the interest rates are coming up a little bit yeah but not enough to exactly where you can get any real in first grade a decent interest rate on bonds or you know CDs or anything like\nThat and so the the point in your head is is there's a lot of things that people do that might have been a good idea at the time even your parents to put things your parents did or were probably a great idea and maybe the only thing to do with the time but just like times have changed opportunities a chain situations that change\nSo if you don't have to figure this out on your own that's that's really kind of impossible because you only retire what so nobody get good at no nobody ever gets good retirement planning because they've only ... they're going to try at one time\nAnd it and if they're working with somebody that I wouldn't do retirement planning they don't do it either yeah so so they're getting advice so\nIt's you know I don't know\nWhat people do right right I mean during the science is between a rock and a hard place because they're trying to do I mean\nThe the people that were we work with Tony they're smart successful people that know how to make good decisions a lot of them have a pretty deep knowledge of in investing in a lot of ways\nBut but they're not retirement planners their advisor their broker or the banker is a a retirement plan or\nAnd so\nThey've got these questions and they don't really feel like they're getting the answer right but they're not sure what to do\nYeah right and and and it's very listen this is all basis is meant to say this it's okay to\nPull over and ask for directions [laughter] I mean it's okay to stop and ask for directions up that's kind of like this one time tied and I were driving to a wedding to it's a good friend of ours is has been many many years ago and are going to a wedding\nI don't like the way this has had [laughter] it doesn't make you look good [laughter] that's been but there are stories that don't make me look good either so I'll I'll think of some of those while you're telling Muslim\nSo anyway we're driving to a wedding and and I you know and we're in it's rural and we're up in the north part of the state and we're not familiar with the area and we keep getting lost and we don't know where we're going and it's getting closer and closer to the kick off of the wedding if you will [laughter] it's like ten minutes to kick off and we're still not in it we don't know where we are and\nWe're getting more and more lost and more frustrated and we're\nIt all for the wedding if you will [laughter] it's like ten minutes to kick off and we're still not in it we don't know where we are and we're getting more and more lost and more frustrated and we're and we're fighting with each other going like why don't you just ask somebody like who neck I'm like I Can't find anybody\nSo we we finally do finally find a a gas station and we find out and we weren't as far off track as we thought we were it was just that there was a lot of twists and turns and and roads that want the same class with a bunch of trees on them\nAnd we couldn't get the GPS 'cause we're out in the middle of\nIt yeah it was horrible it was bad and so yeah we ended up a little bit late and had to slip into the back in ... was a little embarrassing but but we ended up having a great time and it was fine so the story ended up good but my point is that\nDon't wander around lost when there's help to be there I mean and so so let me say this so you know what tad here's what I Would recommend people be thinking about\nHow 'bout picture a day when you don't have to worry if you have enough money because you know you do you know that you don't picture day when your health care cost recovered and you don't have to worry about that\nOr when you can go visit your grandkids travel you know you have enough money to help out the grandkids are the are the kids if they need it and you can swoop in and be the hero and help out with something picture a day when that can happen picture day when you know that all these things are taken care of\nSo today that day\nIs the first step pick up the phone and call nine ... triple zero six and figure out with us together how we can make all this stuff happened where you can literally stop worrying about this picture that day when all this has done and taking care of and you can just go and do the things you love to do nine eight eight triple zero six\nWe have got to take a break now but when we come back we will continue to talk about a little bit of procrastination stuff and how that could impact people's ability to retire when they want how it can impact their ability to have their money last uh after that we will talk about retirement uncertainties\nThese are going to be huge issues that affect the big questions the big questions being will your money last winter and you retire or you're going to be okay here's your spouse going to be OK\nAll of the things that\nKeep you up at night or a or what's on your mind in the morning if you're if you're trying to get near retirement so we're going to talk about all those things you do not want to miss this statement\n[noise]\n\nAre you retired or about to retire and concerned about whether your money's going to last you worried about the volatility of the stock market\nWill the next market crash and derail your retirement plans these are the concerns that our client families had when they came to see and that's exactly what our retire

... are not really getting up at risk including the potential off the principal [noise]\n\n\nOkay we're back and we're talking about retirement planning and the big question is will my money last ... last as long as the both of us do\nYou know what happens if we uh if we have a health care problem or something like that is or how long will we be taken care of how well my family be OK I'm when can I retire those kinds of questions all those questions or what we're answering today\nSo a draw closer and we'll talk more about that one of the big things that we're talking about now is procrastinating and putting it off 'cause it seems like it's in the distance here's a biggie [laughter]\nYou should have put in ... and your boots [laughter] somebody say one time um you know\nWhen it comes to when it comes to taking care of these things a lot of people are like a a metal man on a magnetic cow yeah right yeah yeah so that's so that's procrastination ...\nAcross the nation are real\nOr being a metal on metal person we don't want to be we don't want to exclude the ladies there's metal ladies on a on a magnetic couch to\nYeah there there are so one of the big ... this is one of the biggest I'm too busy oh yeah I'm too busy I'm busy at work and visit I mean one of the things is if you're too busy to figure out if you can quit being busy when are you if you wait till you're not busy you'll never do anything right because we're all too busy\nHow many times do you sit with folks that you know we've been working with him we we get them through you know they they finally retired the turn of the paperwork\nAnd one of my favorite favorite reviews to do with the client is is after they retire you know how's it going how much every and you know what they either say oh this is great this terrific should have done it five years ago all these different things\nBut one of the babies are always here as I Am so busy now I have no idea how how I had a chance to work or any time and work all the [laughter] I'm busy doing everything I've got honey do list I've got things I'm doing a project you know stuff I've been putting off plus they throw in the fun stuff to travel the grandkids\nYou know sometimes they're now keeping the grandkids a couple of times a week there's just some lots of things going on\nSo the thing about this is is we're all busy I'm busy you're busy I mean we're busy doing things\nBut I think that people should ask themselves\nAre we busy just being busy or we busy actually accomplishing something it's okay to be busy with stuff that doesn't that irrelevant and just frivolous and fun that's fun too but sometimes it's time to like\nSeeing something it's okay to be busy with stuff that doesn't that irrelevant in just frivolous and fun that's fun too but sometimes it's tend to like accomplish something and say I need to clear out all the\nEmpty busy work and really say All right right now and lift my head up I'm ten five years away from retirement\nWhat matters to me if that's something I'm interested in doing if I Would like to figure out do do we have enough probably a little behind you know what do we need to do if I'd like to figure that out now is probably the time to do that because um I got to focus on that little more that wasn't that important when I was forty but now it's becoming very important\nWell and and I know this is true for you too but if if people are already retired mhm than in I Would say about half the people that come see us are already retired and about half of them are still working planning on it if they're already retired then they're big concern is\nAnd I think a lot of times people you know feel like they don't know where to start like you said because\nAnd I I think a lot of times people\nYou know feel like they don't know where to start like you said because it's the first time they've done this in him and they're not going to get good at it because they're only going to do at once right you know you're unless you're a retirement plan and you're never going to be good at retirement plan right I mean the things I've done once I'm not very good at right\nUh and I think some of that also is that you know maybe they're they're worried about what they're going to find out yeah you know three are concerned about\nWell what's the answer going to be it may not be the answer I Want and so I Would say this you know it's it's like our conversation earlier about the ... the asking for directions we weren't very far we were a lot closer than we thought we were in our experience is\nThat you're probably fine you know you need to have a complete plan in place\nWe need to have strategies to protect you from the next market crashed we need to have strategies to generate income you know how are you going to turn your savings in your investments in your portfolio into\nIncome that's going to sustain you and your and your spouse for the rest of your lifetime ... there are things that need to be done to protect you\nBut our experiences it's very doable yeah and chances are you're in better shape than you think\nSo I Would encourage you to think about this if there was a way\nThat you knew you had a plan that you know your money was going to last\nYou had a health care situations taking care of your family is going to be taken care of you know when you can retire confidently and and you know you can go and visit grandkids if their local or not local or you can help out with the kids if they need a little help you know sprinkles they get a real problem you're able to swoop in there like a hero and do it and you feel good about it\nI'm not worried that is that it was too much you know if there was a way that you could look and say All right where are we where do we stand in where are we headed and you could clearly nowhere that path is\nI mean wouldn't that be something that you'd want to know about would not be something you'd be interested in exploring and it'd be a compelling future like you said a lot of people are worried about what's gonna happen they're worried and they come in yeah I don't think I've said enough I'm not sure we have enough I don't think you know and um I don't think I can retire yet\nSo the hard times we find that that that's not the ... sometimes you find out that there is a way to do that so if there was a way I Would just encourage people to figure that out now don't sit there and worry alone you know don't worry that there may not be a way so there's no use in even trying to figure it\nOn our experiences there is almost always a way I Know it it you know a lot of times there are definite improvements that need to be made to protect you better right to make sure that you're\nThat it is going to work ... but if there was a way to do that to give you confidence right when would you want to have a plan in place so we would you know we're talking about procrastination we encourage you\nTo take action and we're happy to sit down with you and go through our retire with freedom process and show you how do we help people do this\nSo if you thought there really was a way to do this
