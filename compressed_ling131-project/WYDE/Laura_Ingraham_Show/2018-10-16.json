really trying to decipher through this Elizabeth Warren DNA tests that seems if our calculations are correct she's won one million\nCherokee Colombian I don't know if you've ever heard of the Cherokee Colombian before they're rare\nBut it's worth charity is synonymous with Colombian and it's a bit confusing will break that down a little bit later in the show also breakdown them I heard this writer ah give a talk the other day\nThere was absolutely incredible and his name as\nHughes and he's a very intelligent African American man or he is a sophomore at I'm at a very prestigious school that is now leaving my mind because it's five in the morning and we all know it's early uh and she gave a he's a psychology major and he was talking about\nUm stale grievances and things of that nature and how the way that race is portrayed in modern politics is just\n... it's just grotesque and so we're going to talk about that a little bit a little bit of a discussion topic for you really get your opinion on what you think I I'm really going to spend most of today though talking about Elizabeth Warren because you just can't get any better than somebody coming out and\nWell it's really somebody coming out and saying they're Cherokee and then producing a result that's supposed to show that she's a Cherokee Indian\nOnly to find out that the person they used as their Cherokee stand in for the DNA sample was Colombian or something of that nature I mean it just doesn't get any better than that also talk about a little girl that was um that a court order to be pulled from life\nColombian or something of that nature I mean it just doesn't get any better than that also talking about a little girl that was um that a court order to be pulled from life support yesterday and there was a court battle to find out what would be the correct way to handle it so we'll have all that coming to you\nToday will also take whatever you want to talk about eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three were just kind of hanging out this morning\nSince the Kavanaugh ah\nSince the Kavanaugh confirmation has left the news cycle you know it's been very quiet it's been pretty slow but we got some stuff to talk about especially it's always fun to talk when Elizabeth Warren makes a fool of herself so we'll make sure to a\nCover that eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three is the number to join the conversation but without further ado I got to go to the man with the planned the man that always keeps the show on the road and keeps me relatively in check I think some would say Dylan how you doing this morning\nI'm doing All right now they're not so sleep full restful night\nMe either I'm trying to figure out what's going on here man because\nI lay down stare at the ceiling and I can't sleep and I don't know why because I've been up for like fourteen hours up an active I've been doing stuff but I Can't go to sleep and I don't understand why it's like I Can't turn my brain off it's like I lay there and just stare at the ceiling\nI Need like a remedy I I don't I don't know what to do you know people are like a shot of whiskey and I'm like that doesn't seem healthy you know the the whole night cap thing but then you could also do stuff like this melatonin stuff but I also feel like taking sleeping pills regularly\nUnless you're prescribed them would really hurt you know what I'm saying I don't like taking pills unless you absolutely have to\nThe thing about taking mountain melatonin every night is your body gets used to it and it comes to expect it mhm chef you ever stop you are so much worse off than if you had never started\nExactly and it's like a dependency thing right because I mean it's it's the same argument with taking in any substance you know if you've taken\nCrack cocaine regularly and you try to stop all of a sudden I don't know what it was such a strange ... extreme example this morning but if you take and crack cocaine regularly and you try to stop your body because becomes accustomed to it and therefore you go through\nA just terrible withdraws I'm kind of a more common one is cigarettes or alcohol um bodies go through the same with the draws for that I Know that all too well had a grandmother that I'm\nSmoked for sixty years and so she was a she smokes and she was a teenager all the way into her late seventies and she tried to quit multiple times and it's just it it truly is an addiction man and once you start you really can't stop because life is just so different without it\nWhich is crazy that people are able to sell a product knowing full well that does\nThat you know what I'm saying it seems a bit and saying\nYeah and the tobacco plants they use to make cigarettes are they have them specifically bred to have more nicotine and be more addictive\nSpirits I smoke I smoked a mental American spirits and those are great\nI mean it's very interesting I've always been curious appreciate him or he has her marriage every day\nI don't think I'll ever a pickup smoking Dylan but here's something that I Want to know if you've heard and I want to talk about this when we come back I'm deviating but I'm fine with it because I've always wanted to to talk about this and have this discussion\nDid you see are the little vapor thing that looks like a U.S be a ... a jewel yeah they're getting sued for millions of

of dollars\nAnd it's getting no news coverage whatsoever so\nThis is the article starts out it's really interesting because it literally goes right to the reference I was saying and done I think you'll find this it's kind of funny it's not funny because it involves a kid smoking in a kid consuming nicotine but the stories kind of funny\nIt says one in San Diego base mother posted in an

I thought it was like jewelry\nOr something and something yeah and that was like six months ago yeah but whenever there's a spokesperson\nFor like a tobacco brand or something like I'm thinking of like the Marlborough man\nLike that right but then we got the spokeswoman for jewel name Victoria Davis comes out and she says a in an email that company officials quote do not believe the cases have merit and we'll be defending them vigorous ally but researchers say the jewels sly age verification techniques\nDo not believe the cases have merit and we'll be defending them vigorous ally but researchers say the jewels sly age verification technique and social media marketing campaigns are the most revealing of the company's true intent or one of the cases against Joel is a nationwide class action lawsuit\nA the tin named plaintiffs who wrench from fourteen years old um fourteen years old to adult using\nA user's living in several states alleged the jewel cause nicotine addiction and consumers according to court documents that you'll devices more potent than a cigarette allowing high levels of nicotine to enter the bloodstream at a faster or speed rate\nAnd it just it keeps going I'm trying to see why because there's something having to do\nYeah I'm just going to summarize this because I think I Know what's going on here\nAnd so what they're alleging is essentially that this company um you've heard of influence their marketing right I I'm sure some people have heard of it it's basically where it's like you know a celebrity you like say like Tom Cruise and Tom Cruise uses like Old Spice right than old spices like hey do this ad for us\nAnd we hope that other people will go by Old Spice or have post a picture of you holding Old Spice and you're at will Jewell did that with a bunch of celebrities\nSo for those of you do now because the first time I read the headline about Medicaid I didn't know so when I looked up the definition just with the text book says it says medicated the ... in the United states is a joint federal and state program\nThat helps with medical costs for somewhat limited income and resources Medicaid also offers benefits not normally covered by Medicare like nursing home care\nAnd personal care services so it's just that on a basic level and it talks about government funding\nRight state and federal government funding\nUm and that is to limit the costs on the consumer so like villains that it is a push towards kind of a universal healthcare ideal where the government help subsidize some health care where the government says look we're going to pay for a little bit of it or we're going to pay for some of the costs so that you don't\n... the whole burden so it's an it's an interesting idea I'm not sure how much I agree with it or not but the argument is really interesting specifically coming from Alabama politicians\nSo the articles that the race for governor in Alabama has been boil down to three issues governor Kay Ivey claim that she studied the ship of the state Democrat challenger Walt Maddox whining about not being able to secure a debate and Maddox wanting to expand Medicaid without a serious plan for doing so\nAnd that's that that has been a lot of Republicans problem I don't think that Republicans aren't necessarily\nUm I think conservatives are but I don't think all Republicans because I wouldn't by no stretch of the imagination call all Republicans fiscally conservative\nBut I Do not think that all Republicans are against medicate I just think that a lot of them don't feel as if Maddox has a plan and I think that's the qualms with a lot of these health care plans amongst Republicans where you know it sounds great you know ... the cost of health care\nIs insane in the United states um spit it costs a to the consumer I'm specifically on insurance and things of that nature rose under Obamacare that's neither here nor there but\nThere were different there there are different things about health care that I think you could get Republicans on board with that had to do with the government of helping out a little right especially if it was targeted\nTo people of lower income it's the same social safety net\nThat we have in a lot of practices and a lot of those social safety nets for people who have lower income communities are bad now there are some social safety nets that have caused more poverty and I've had have caused people stay in the cycles of poverty again that interview I heard with Komen Hughes that we're going to talk about later references that\nBut\nIn of itself some Republicans wouldn't see it as a bad idea conservatives what kids conservatives want government out of private industry rent but the only argument that I can see being made is there's not a lot of competition in the healthcare agency I mean we saw this with ... Penn right everything makes a product\nThat anybody that goes into I Believe my sister needed one for a long time I believe it's ... lactic shock are due to an allergic reaction they'd need an F ... they're hardly any\nOff brand or secondary brands other than ... ... ... even if they want because there really is no competition in the market can say you know this product save lives and right now or selling it for thirty bucks\nBut we decided that they are going to cost three hundred a piece now nothing in the ingredients that change nothing has changed\nAnd save lives and right now or selling it for thirty bucks\nBut we decided that they're going to cost three hundred a piece now\nNothing in the ingredients that change nothing has changed we just want to raise their profit margins\nAnd and that happened a few years ago you know it definitely did happen and that's the that's the interesting thing especially when it comes with service fields and I heard the statement the other day and it talks about you know capitalism I was reading a book that talks about the free market of the finest\nAnd what people believe socialism to be or what it would be at its finest and it's like look both of these systems and another themselves up or would operate fine in a utopian society\nRight a free market system would operate find as with socialism but what kills both systems because those are like two opposite ends of the spectrum light right socialism and free market is this idea of human greed\nHuman greed is typically what kills utopian plans and we've seen this throughout history like most places where socialism has failed and that's one that conservatives love to go to is when talking about democratic socialism it has failed due to human greed\nAnd it's kind of economically illiterate but that's neither here nor there it's failed typically because of human great um\nAnd a lot of where just strictly free market\nHas been instituted human greed is kind of kept in check because of this idea of true competition but when you allow true competition you know I'm trim an anti trust laws or something like that people can dominate a market entirely um and so they can raise and lower the prices they wish so we got a little bit off Medicaid but\nI think that is one of the things that ruins this idea of um free entirely free market healthcare is\nHuman greed but I think it also would ruin this idea of completely socialized health care would be human greed as well I think both would open the doors to human greed so that's why I think some government intervention in health care is fine but with this Medicaid specifically they were talking about expanding it in a state of Alabama\nAnd the article goes on it says Republicans in Alabama have been steadfastly against the Medicaid expansion proposal because it will require an additional outlay of up to two hundred million dollars\nThe infusion of federal dollars that would come after the expansion has been cited numerous times by numerous Democrats running for statewide offices and the ... the argument is that the program we'll pay for itself\nIt won't so\nIt's a really interesting concept right they they are claiming that the Democrats are claiming that the program we'll pay for itself and at the end of the program won't pay for itself\nLike I mean do you disagree with me it doesn't seem like you agree with me on that I just do not see how the program we'll pay for itself I think that's a valid point I've not looked\nInto the program but there are very few things that pay for themselves it's like the idea of perpetual motion it it kind of doesn't exist\nAnd once it does start paying for itself who start siphoning money off and who start saying well let's pull some money\nFor here and let's pull some money for this area in this area in this area and again that such human greed human divisive element I mean it's what hurts a lot of our modern day politics it's why politics is so greedy and corrupt in money and views\nUm but\nWhen you look at Medicaid like I'm not saying I'm for Medicaid expansion or I'm not but I Will say\nTalked to two state representatives about this when they came and spoke at a college Republicans meeting and their answers to me weren't really satisfying because they talked about the lottery right and we're one of the only states in the United states\nSensors to me were really satisfying because they talked about the lottery right and we're one of the only states in the United states does not have a lottery and then they taught they said we don't need a lottery we don't need that money\nRight how much does the lottery produce two hundred million an excess typically\nThat's the typical statewide measure is how much it usually producers and then they said we don't have the money for Medicaid and then I said well how much does Medicaid cost and they say anywhere from one hundred million to two hundred million dollars\nAnd I said you're looking at those issues\nCompletely separate of each other if we look at how they would work in a society don't tell me we don't have the money for it because I don't know the rules and regulations you have to hop through with lottery money but just on a basic basic basic level if the lottery where to generate two hundred million dollars\nAnd Medicaid costs one hundred and fifty to two hundred million\nYou got the money if you Institute the lottery and join the rest of the nation that has the lottery\nSo I just think a lot of arguments against Medicaid are kind of not sound specifically this fiscal one but\nI get it like I'm not saying I'm for Medicaid expansion I don't like government interference in private business I'm I'm much more of a free market approach\nBut I just don't understand how somebody can sit there and say\nWe don't have the money for Medicaid but we're one of what is it three states in the United states as an instituted a lottery the lottery would make two hundred million and Medicaid cost one hundred two hundred million dollars\nSomething's not adding up their chief eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three and again I Know there are a hoops you have to hop through a lottery money is it ethical to take money that's made by lottery and use it for health care I get it I'm not saying it's disillusion\nI'm just saying don't tell me we don't have the money when you're sitting there going we don't need the money from the lottery program\nThat the two arguments are quite literally counter to each other and they're the talking points of a lot of Republicans in the state of Alabama\nIt just really doesn't make that much sense to me as somebody who leans conservative on almost every issue eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three is the number to join the conversation at eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three don't go anywhere this electrical you're listening to the wake up call\nRaised

I called police on black people for no reason but come to find out just like Ninety seven percent a mass murders there always Democrat\nI mean there's news out there but why bother\nA involved or\nSo remember when Trump said he would give a million\nAh the ball or\nOkay so remember when Trump said he would give a million dollars to a charity if Warren can come out and prove that she's a Native American mhm well\n\nSince she's not one hundred percent Native American he should not do and they want you know one million dollars but I mean he could play along and donate one one thousand twenty fourth of a million which would end up being around a hundred and Seventy seven dollars I think he could donate that\nThey have no right exactly right\nI mean I Would donate as much money as you are Native American\nWell the or a citizen of the Cherokee Nation yesterday said that Elizabeth Warren is more concerned about her political future than the interest of tribal sovereignty and native rights and of course that spot on\nA long standing assertion by Warren of her uh Indian or Native American heritage was called into question yet again as a result of the DNA test were made public\nNow as I understand that she was going to hold a press conference at foxwoods up in a New England because you know she's about his Native American as a casino\nSo she's going to stop it stop it\nWhat you're doing the nose holding thing that I bet you money she's one of a speaking engagement with great\nWell you know it's common [laughter] but you know something apparently they're hiring so much yeah [laughter] really emerged when she doesn't get elected to the Senate she got mad at the hotel hey Elizabeth stars your career when Greek uh\n[laughter] [noise]\nYeah oh ...\nRebecca ... who is a citizen of the Cherokee Nation told ... Laura Ingraham that Native American identity\nIs not up to Elizabeth Warren I mean they're they're P O D I yeah I mean they really and truly are because it it's nothing more\nThan you know propaganda for the purposes or try to ... to a to a certain minority group and you know the thing is you know why why pick Native American why don't you pick one that's I don't know a little you know little more subjective ... not on that you can prove it through DNA and I I'm\nI'm trying to decide whether or not I want to give her a patch because there are certain people that might believe certain inaccuracies about their past but I don't see the purpose of doubling down on this the way that she has and I don't know if she is just a couple of weeks ago she announced\nWell look at all of them have we heard anything from Maxine Waters since she's been under investigation for fraud because of the um campaign contributions being funneled her kids yeah and we heard anything from Nancy Pelosi\nOther than just rhetoric once in a blue moon it's they're out of the limelight they need to get their fix and they go back to mhm then there'll be in the limelight for about a week and then you won't hear anything from them for about\nTwo weeks but and then they start Jones and again so they got to\nMhm and then there'll be in the limelight for about a week and then you won't hear anything from them for about two weeks but and then they start Jones and again so they got to get back in\n[noise] well one of the things that's very offensive is the fact that ... and you're well aware historically speaking\nThat the Native American community has been granted certain rights in this country that are read are restricted if you will to them\nOkay and this one woman comes out from a from this group and says we live in a country where most of the non native population doesn't understand or know basic information about our identity our tribal sovereignty and about our history as native people\nAnd so these myths that you know native identity can be determined by a DNA test directly undermines our rights as Native Americans and our tribal sovereignty\nAnd at a time and place where we are celebrating whether or not we are\nUh you know African American or Latino or whatever this is an affront to not only a minority group but one that is the the basic foundations of the original population in the Americas\nAnd its its base I mean it's it's it's to the point where you have offended essentially everybody ... in this country because everybody likely has some form of Native American DNA\nAnd so when when she doubles down on things like this you know you got people out there that are protesting Taco Bell because there are cooperating the ... the Latino identity you know and and and yet you have these uh senator that is doing it in such a vibrant fashion it makes this big\nCapone vault type of a revelation and that is just going to be a complete Luna I mean I'm Talking looney bird mhm and you know she's probably going to get reelected when the time comes probably\n\nBecause it is a vote for will just keep voting for you know she has a deep our name yeah\nYeah when maybe she used to have a lot or a after that letter\n\nShe said where scarlet in on her sweater now\nFor a big liver L.

Republicans out there but did you see this story is one Democrat who was actually just kicked out of the party because he had the old ash city to say he stands for the flag\nAnd Neal's before God needles are the authors when he sat and the Democrats kicked him out of the party yesterday\nIf that does not show you the completely agnostic viewpoints that the left has the secular over like the

walk away because it's just not a fair fights not worth it it's not worth it ...\nBecause you know the ultimate outcome and your legitimately are concerned about hurting the guy because he is so ill prepared for this particular confrontation ... Democrats don't have that bone\n\nThey don't care they will they will kick you and beat you to your knees they are like the proverbial knockout game where some dog walks up to an eighty year old woman on a sidewalk and blind solder\nThat's the Democrat viewpoint of politics in this country today\nAre like the man in Brooklyn they before yesterday that was caught on video beating the old Jewish man industry yeah and no one stop the hell yeah\nI have got scars on my face from stopping to help but you don't see that\nIn a lot of left quarters that's not to suggest all we've got some Democrat liberals and listen to this program is calling from time to time who I'd legitimately respect without any doubt whatsoever\nWho I like even to the degree that I Know them\nBut there's a huge swath of them out there that are vicious vindictive misinformed\nAnd willing to perpetrate lies indoor frauds for the purposes of political game\nWas the opposite with both sides because you get a lot of Democrats say not all that the majority of Democrats aren't like what you see on TV that you'll need to get up and say something because I'm already a Republican value on TV are bashing\nAs I say not all ... the majority of Democrats aren't like what you see on TV then you'll need to get up and say something because I'm already over public ... on TV are bashing the small amount of\nPeople who were big it is is every Muslim uh terrorists know how many times have we had people is very radio program\nMake the point that well if the if the the percentage of the Muslim population that is not terrorists which is obviously substantially in the majority\nWhy don't they stand up and put an end to those kind of tactics why are they not more vocal about standing up for their faith in their beliefs and and and challenge\nThe the the theocratic over viewpoints a Muslim extremism okay let's use that exact same example when it comes to Democrats\nIf you're OK CEO ortez or whatever Cortez whatever her name is if they don't represent the majority then do something about say something about it\nSame thing with Elizabeth Warren Zinn the Clintons of the world if that's not you how many Democrats do you think it will generally are Christian cause I must say the majority of them All right let's see how many Democrats do you think there are in this country in the city the state right now that are supporters of their Second Amendment rights and known firearms\n\nThen let's see let's hear it that's what I'm Talking about what I say it's not a matter of ... versus ripe it us versus them\n\nAnd that's not to suggest the Republicans don't try to play their base either they're just not as good at it\n\nBut it's high time somebody stands up and tell these people to set the hell down shut up because you don't represent you don't believe or feel or aspire to what I Do because of the end of the day and you and I were talking about this in the parking lot just moments ago\nAll because you don't agree with something on one side does not in the swimming you're automatically in opposition to everything on that side it's not it's not a zero sum game\nAnd what I mean by that is that in in politics things there are there's a sense of fluidity if you will within party believes all because you don't believe that this over here the Donald Trump has done you don't trust that you don't believe it you don't like it doesn't mean you have to discount all of it\n\nAnd there are some good Democrat leaders out there I'd like to find them a little more frequently but this idea that if you're not left you have to be right it it's just like in the movie Talladega night well that you told me that when he's everything what are you talking about right yeah I was drunk\nWhat do you mean weddings everything you're not number one you're a loser well there is number two and there was number three I mean even raise Bobby is smarter than most Democrats and he's a drunk\nI don't think so and of course democracy suffers as does the constitution and it seems as though the political process in both Senate and house becomes more corrupt do you feel the same way\nAnd it becomes more susceptible to influence and there are always those politicians who can be bored because money talks and talks big time in Washington DC\nTomorrow Mr Crawford says that promises made to read the people before election day seemed to mean little after election day I'm Bill McCormick\nW E s M there'll be ...

now what you're saying about uh uh you have to work for that money\nBut the problem I have and I and I'm seeing the Congress now and this this this media including Fox or trying to solve so the idea of this ... Hoagy or whatever his name is is a a Saudi character of Peter King from New York this morning\nSaid you know all of that so cruel what those people do to people why I got news for you in any then you know the roses balls were hung by the United states government for treason\nAnd that was in Nineteen fifty for any been that long ago boys and girls and um when you I I go to the equivalent sworn into a a congressman Palmer's office or the example of this animal that through his father is off the top and all of a bridge\nYeah um yeah and the judge ruled that he couldn't get the death penalty because he was more to the\nWorld because the process the defense attorneys came up that he was a yeah like you have like fifty six right uh and then sell the because of the attention the judge had to go but the judge fights in porch but here's my thing\nOr the largely that's going on in our government right now or is is worse than that example because and I am all in favor under title Fifteen and I don't even like that because that's been some of the loop hole lives they've done to us in the last sixty years actually since the civil war\nUm we uh we we've lost sight of our our bill of rights for the people in this country but uh you represent the people use their responsibility is on your shoulders and if you have if you have a larceny and your heart and that's what they all have\nUh the uh uh the examples that are coming out now by the shadow government the guys are actually have butter and cut out for the United states government coming forward and tell them the truth\nAnd everybody's you know YouTube and listen to some of that and understand what's going on what has been going on in this country um but they don't work for that money when Maxine Waters didn't make fifty

the prayers just decided this was the story that we needed to be talked about constantly you know I wasn't sure wine this guy mattered\nSo much\nThe press just decided this was a story that we needed to be talked about constantly you know I wasn't sure why this guy mattered so much now the fact that he's the Washington Post contributor I think is one of the main reason I don't know anything about it\nIn early on in the stories I couldn't find anything about it other than he was this journalists that question the Saudi Government so they have laid it all at the feet of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia or the one who's trying to bring Saudi Arabia a little bit into the modern era\nThat guy is you know if he's a good guy I don't know\nBut PJ Media has an article on it and I just want to ask
