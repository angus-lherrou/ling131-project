I'll be fine movements are you you just buy the um one thing that you are probably miss those like a checkerboard and a couple of rocking chairs and whatnot\nYeah we're going to start doing broadcast straight from the Cracker Barrel [laughter]\n\nAbout this work um so first of all I don't really know what Saddam out here um you said west side blood ... or ... ah with regard to the whole Tupac to end up you know big you know that sort of stuff but and I'm really want to millennials says right now with that one so while it just showed my own age but um\nWith regard to at all though I mean you have to remember number one during a ... and uh [noise] as any is a self involved nurses would probably tell you a ... loves himself some time yet\nYou know if you're speaking of a third person and that's the whole thing has always been about that you know what was going to be about that and it was a publicity storm for ... you know sadly it was something that I don't know if Donald Trump made it in a serious manner or not it's hard to tell because no one really knows where he's piled in his ship to\nBut Jim ... is a serious situation which were Jim Brown it was\nBut for Kenya it's all about time yet\nHe wants to room as far as that's concerned it's all about him I mean and\nSo yeah it's crazy you know he's always been pretty good we've known that do for years\nSo I personally really don't know if that's good or bad or how you really want to view it but that's just my two cents all great day\nYou to fill thank you for the call so very much and let's get Jim in here hello Jim how are you\nFirst of all my only idea of prison reform is to re foreign some new prisons okay I'm going to tell you something right now\nAll you hear about with regard to the black community is were being treated unfairly were are there's more of our people being incarcerated well there's more crimes in their neighborhoods being committed and that's just the way it goes you have this perception of the black community\nThat young black men are gangsters and this and that well that's the perception that they've pushed with gangster rap and his joke and tell you aren't enough already on how gangster rap originated\nI think the cure for the problem of young black males committing crimes\nIs more young black males doing time in the military mandatory what is a problem with the first time they have a run in with the law a judge say\nOkay you're going to do some military service because I think it will help you in your life if you want to have a mediocre life will let you joined the army if you want to have an exemplary life you joined the marine corps\nEt cetera I think the problem is in their family with their divorce and all of us on the conservative side especially on this show no\nLBJ and his cohorts in the Democrat Party made a concerted effort to discriminate against blacks with welfare with abortion clinics in their neighborhoods all of this stuff\nI think what needs to happen\nDiscriminated against blacks with welfare with abortion clinics in their neighborhoods all of this stuff\nAnd I think what needs to happen is not a cuttlefish and although I Love Jim Brown I loved that guy and I think he's genuine one of the few genuine people in the black community ... you know people like that [noise] ah I think what needs to happen is\nPeople that don't want to continue down this path they need to\nEncourage black families staying together and young black men do at Loyola Terry service\nCan't really say anything about why can't we said the same thing about troubled white you\nCertainly but you know what when you have ... missions going to talk to the president about blacks being incarcerated they're bringing this to the surface well I've got a solution for you and I'll tell you like Joe\nOr Jane ... you can walk it back in the fifties when a military service was mandatory yet a lot less a blacktop elation prison stint you\nWell you know my position on the ... the ah conscription aspect of our society odd thought for a long time ... military service should be mandatory for all young men and I and I I think you can trace a lot of this country's problems back to the lack of it Jim I appreciate the call\nRight fellows I you know the whole conscription thing you know South Korea does that South Korea does mandatory two years that you have to serve in the rock climbing Republic of Korea but\nWhen people start going back to the whole go to war go to jail aspect of how the U.S used to be when someone in the first time offenders they get the option of an army nowadays that's not going to work\nBecause in just a gym before you start scream at the radio take it for me 'cause I was in recruiting for all seven years so I've seen the society that we pull these people from\nWe don't need them in the army were there in a white black Hispanic Chinese it doesn't matter if you go in front of a judge non times out of ten you have a bad attitude already and you have no discipline under your belt whatsoever the army the navy the marine corps is not going to fix it\nBecause once you get into the training aspect of it especially in basic training or boot camp or whatever you want to call\nOnce you get to that aspect\nThere are certain waved points you got to make to graduate and if you don't make those way points you get recycled that means you get moved to a new for unit who's just starting what you just finished so you can learn it again after the second time you're out\nYour your booted out and then once if you happen to get through the system or fall through the cracks and they get to a unit then you become my problem\nAnd then I'm chapter and you out waste them more money and more time on you that shouldn't have been in the military in the first place\nSo I don't agree with that aspect now could scripts in okay that's fine you can get them when they're young and before they start getting the issues but the whole goat or go to jail that would not working to say today society because there's just no discipline in today's society and we can teach you is when we can hold your discipline but ever since all the ...\nHow ... how many understand that because as a non military guy and and now the the desire wasn't there is just the knees weren't there isn't the idea here ... and I'm going to phrase it from the perspective of a civilian and my understanding and my my short understanding\nBut isn't the idea here in in basic boot camp again whenever you want to call it to break people down and rebuild them off yes so isn't the lack of discipline is that do not make saw the case that that's a failing of the military here\nPeople down and rebuild them up yes so isn't the lack of discipline is that do not make a case it that's a failing of the military\nHere is where it comes into play when Jim was in when Jim joined when Joe joined when I joined that could that the drill sergeants drill instructors Diaz whatever you want to call them they could adjust us\nYou know if we had an issue and when I say adjusts amusing air closed because that means they put their hands on you and I just you they can't do it anymore they took all the power\nAway from the drill sergeants they took all the power away from the Diaz they will get in trouble if they cuss at us soldier at a record\nSo there'd be no a drill sergeant Hartman or ... whatever ...\nThey're they're bad generations gone until they bring it back the discipline aspects I when I was in Alaska chapter it out which means kick out I checked it out twelve people in two years that is ridiculous when I was first Asian at Fort Bragg my unit we chapter that one person in five years\nAnd it just shows that the army changes the marine corps everything changes with the times and who's in office and all that because the kinder gentler military you're not allowed to cuss at 'em anymore even though I still do it you're not allowed put hands on them because you'll be brought up on assault charges and you'll be kicked out you I've seen drill sergeants who were the sevens\nTwenty two years in the army and the kid got in their face and started screaming at him and he put them on the ground out gone and not even okay you you can retire no you're out you're gone you put hands on the lake\nSo drills sirens were scared to do anything especially when they do the whole um integrated basic training when when I say integrated male and female when they have them together of yeah forget it for get\nSo we've taken for lack of better way of putting the testosterone out of the ...\nYeah yeah the the train's been snip for lack of better term [laughter] heavens\nWell obviously\nAs you point out a lot of cultural changes in the military and we continue to see these things and you know I I Know the sun times are our friend Jim can go a little bit to the extreme right on stuff but we have absolutely uh you know ... a lot of our young men in this country today and that's probably part of the problem is well\n... ... if you get like um if you look at a Chelsea ... Bradley Manning I don't call in Chelsea still do but if you look at Bradley Manning there was a\nYoung guy who was in the service with him in his basic training and he wrote a blog in a story of from day one when he met Bradley Manning to graduation and it was I Can't do it I Can't do this to heart is it's too hard as Bradley Manning and it ended up the drill sergeants doing everything for\nHim and pushing him through the system he should've never graduated basic training if he had never graduated basic training the wiki leak would've never happened and his name would have never been in the news we've had issues where\nFor one of the political parties that is totally dependent on monolithic thinking oh that's the reason they're having to come apart\nI I mean you know and I think that you know support for Donald Trump in the black community would be increasing without ... but he certainly puts a face on it doesn't mean\n\nI I mean you know right gotta say does oh\nWell no your observation about you know the the a king and queen so to speak of self promotion is definitely spot on and I think that Trump has not have as much as I like him I'm getting caught up in the moment himself\nAnd I think that's you know one of the danger spots with him but you know at the end of the day I think your your observations ...\nWell I you know that's just my thoughts on that and you know I was going to weigh in on putting people with the problems in the military haven't been there myself but pretty much Jane set everything I was going to say oh you're simply not allowed\nTo do what needs to be done with people that don't already have discipline in in order to instill some in them\nRight no I didn't mean done our society won't tolerate it\nYou exactly right we're definitely going oh kind word gentler\nAwesome in them right All right let's say Don our society won't tolerate it\nNo you're exactly right we're definitely going all kind word gentler and simultaneously weaker\nYeah oh I don't know hey James\nHe's not here yet James had to step out for a minute\nOkay let's go and ask him to tell you a little bit about the rocks I don't know about the rock army but the marine corps right\nOh wow we're talking about seriously hard\nFor individuals because of the regimentation of course I think there's a Saudi lends itself to that more so anyway right\nBut anyhow\nI Would sell people on was it just had those observations\nBegging my ... my rubber present is a very much carte All right right and let's\nGo to Charles is call hey Charles how are you back on good how you got good [noise] um well you were talking about prison reform having to David\nKanye bought up all the subject matters you did and there's something happening in Alabama today has to do is a prison reform just certain degree I don't know if you're white but elderly woman and a child in her care in a neighbor were killed by a man encounters all that parole die out\nAnd I'm like they did not a there was no follow up on this man he was homeless and he didn't know these people and killed them [noise]\nUm and today there is a lawyer for the family and and I was driving said that she would look at look at this with very stern asked to see what today but a parole board is not actually interview the person going out and if they had in this case they could have saw something was wrong with it\nYeah uh it's family saying why you know you should let somebody out and it's other people saying that it is and keep them in that there is no actual evaluation a parole board in Alabama or the person before them to say that such a thing was going to happen\nAnd I just wanted to bring it up and like it's something that I'm figured you not want to know about it\nWell we appreciate uh Charles very much\n... thanks a lot\nLot of our opinion a lot of emotion\nIt is it is I think you know that's one thing I can say for what happened yesterday I'm In the oval office um it shows\nWe have come so far in the state is to my wife the other day that we have a long ways to go because what we're seeing micro we saying you know when people say we want to sit down with President Donald Trump and people won't sit down with President Donald Trump\nI think the messenger you just can't send anybody to sit down and talk with the president you know things like you know if you want to get something done you have to send somebody that has action that I'm able to uh have that power when they leave to put things for will push it for\nAnd when you have people like ... with a with the record that he has not saying that he cannot change\nBut I think the place he's in mentally right now he's not the place or where he should be sitting there trying to negotiate um a meeting between Colin Kaepernick and president Donald Trump or trying to sit down and doing something to talk about president before\nGoing you wouldn't need a lot of things to form his own personal life you need a lot of these reforms on himself and I think you know when we sit back and we watch these and people who want\nAll of us to work together I get it but you know I think a lot of folks don't get Mike ... is ... is the wrong person to be sitting at the table trying to represent that plant being a friend of president I don't have a problem with that I just have problems in trying to talk about prison reform we don't know\nAnd to be sitting at the table trying to represent that plant being a friend of president I don't have a problem with it at that they'll probably sitting there trying to talk about for the reform when you're talking about\nWell it was definitely be on as you point out and opportunity last and one that might have even set the a debate back just a little bit\nI think so because it makes it and I hate to use for the reform and ... and his work together but it it makes it seem like it's not that important because ... entertain other than entertaining what has ... I'm just being on what have you done\nCountry have done some things in the black community but the country has not done a whole lot he's been for himself and his wife and his brain and his clothes and his son I'm not mad and make your mind I'm entrepreneur or two but don't put yourself in that space when you have\nThe country do not deserve to be sitting in front of the United states and work with them then remember thing to have lunch with a person because you know that's a boy who I don't have a problem with that but you talking about with them before you know\nLet's get out to a angry carries call for it to take our last break of this hour to morning Kerry how are you\nMore than like come on and Joe art James go a first they don't want to say that in a in a room and everything and I and I hope irritating workout and\nEverything and everything's good carrier we appreciate your ... your love and your support\nOkay you know 'cause you know I'm I'm like you know you feel like you know I feel like a part of me I always listen to music remote by radio station ... in and took my mother was the every day with\nWill be Kevin devastate so you know like I say I just you know what was shared by workout ...

L. A. for lobbying et cetera for working it varies a\nState and local level for changing of the anti gun laws and becoming more friendly\nAnd ah last year we almost doubled our net in Winston county just unbelievable to upgrade and part of it I think was we did the same thing last year right time on your show and the event is on the Thursday the Eighteenth and uh\nWe're open our doors about five I just talked to Kim Miller who's the chief of police in double springs he's the one is also running the gun show and we have a little conflict on the Eighteenth that your listeners need to be aware if they're going to attend and you're coming from\nThe north end of double springs they're having a homecoming parade for double springs and they're going to close down the road through double springs around six o'clock and be closed at least a half an hour and already been starts\nA technically starts we open the door to five thirty were going to open the earlier and about five so anybody that's coming from the north anybody coming up to two Seventy accord on when it comes to double springs which you have to do to get down to the south part of town where the army or the municipal building is where we're having the event\nCan you show the door and ... yeah yeah you can buy them online\nOr at the door and we've tried to sell tickets and most people they did they just want to show up at the door so probably eighty percent of what we sell is at the door better we have sold a lot of table so you can buy a show your sponsorship mainly businesses do this and they can buy a table which gets them eight\nChairs at a at a roundtable tickets and they get a gun or a depending on the level of table you buy you have a choice of about six or eight different firearms that we get for you for your table purchased so the table purchase will get you a firearm and ate tickets and if you figure it out it's a you're getting a somewhat of a discount but not drastic one\nAnd then many of the people like Scott ... donated the gun that they got for the table back and we're going to use it in a raffle\nSo they're getting a full full of marketing deduction for the ride them out\nSo it's ah like I say the only thing we cannot do 'cause we're a Bible once received we can't do politics now that don't mean that somebody running for office can't show up and shake hands we just can't let them get up and give a political speech and do that kind of step but we do have quite a few people show up\nThat our politicians and we allow them to work the crowd for lack of a better word but they're not allowed to get up on the podium and and promote themselves\nNow where's the venue again it's the the they call it the ...\nFor lack of a better word but they're not allowed to get up on the podium and and promote themselves\nNow where's the venue again\nIt's the the they call it the and this will building it's the old National Guard armory\nWhich is ah about two miles south I I guess about two miles south on one Ninety five from downtown double springs or you can't miss will have a big billboard up there\nAnd this is about the sixth time we've done it I think in every year it just gets bigger and bigger and better and this year we we sold to give an example we saw six tables last year we got Thirteen this year oh lovely so and then uh\nUh just the the support we get from just the community is unreal because Winston county is not a large county and it's not a rich county\nBut uh the people there are just phenomenal sport in the second amendment\nLet's change direction is just a bit because of your experience in law enforcement you and I over the years and you've been a friend in support of the program for many years now but I Want to get your thoughts gym 'cause you're always brings such interesting insights about where we are here in the state of Alabama with the current status of our gun laws\nOr I pretty much agree with one of the magazines was showing the the\nThe friendliness cyber or their favoritism of gun laws\nI Am one of these people that believe I'm a cop second in a citizen first so and I've done this my whole life because I grew up on the wrong side of the tracks so when when I Would have a confrontation or something in in uh in law enforcement I Would look at it as how I Would want to be handled if I were in that situation and that's a double edged sword\nIf I'm totally out of control blackout drug you victimized when people I Hope somebody who use labor force is necessary to customers stuffy and get me out of the ... protect people but on the other hand you've got to realize a lot of people are upset their venting there just having a bad day and you gotta you gotta read that too so\nI think the gun laws in this state needs some serious reform ah I don't think that this might be extreme to some people but I don't think that any state or local authority has any authority whatsoever to make a gun law\nBecause if you go to the second him a Second Amendment and the tenth amendment it'd be like them saying that you are Alabama can pass a law that we can hold you without bond or Alabama can pass a law that we can search you without a warrant\nThe or or or you can be forced to testify yourself and all the the Fourth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment so you can't do that so it applies across the board so Alabama State can can violate your rights well how do we come up on the second amendment and say that we have to have a permit to carry a gun\nI mean you'd have to have a permit them to buy two to plead not guilty or to have a speedy trial if you were to apply that to amendments so I think we've got a long way to go one of the things that did upset me is the fact that you have to have a permit to carry loaded gun in a car\nMany states have an actual exception to the permanent rule specifically for that when you're traveling so that you can protect yourself and your family while you're traveling so in that case I think Alabama is way backwards\nI was really glad to see that they did allow permits now 'cause I'm a federal firearms dealer your permit to negate the Knicks check as long as you've got a valid permit you can I can put the permit number on your forty four Seventy three and sell you a gun I I lobbied for that since I've been here about ten years I started lobbying for that day I got here\nSo I'm really glad to see if they did that but you know who gets caught in the in the crux their ...\nCops right law enforcement I have to call in them every time you buy a gun because they don't have a concealed carry permit unless the sheriff in that county\nWould just to grab to swim or if if they were to buy one himself so I I thought that was kind of funny you can walk in with your permit you can walk out with a gun and no problem police officer boxing by the same gun I got to sit there and call the FBI to get a permission to sell him again\nYou're a permit you can walk out with a gun in no problem police officer boxing by the same gun I got to sit there and call the FBI to get a permission to sell him again\nSo they're not automatically granted concealed permits\nNo it it's part of the law that says if they have their commission card they can carry a concealed weapon but they're not issued a concealed weapon permit with a number or anything on it specifically says well they call them pistol permits in Alabama right but they don't have that any other thing is they're issued by the county there not controlled by the state so I started immediately\nAnd I've been inspected by or the or\nThe or the ATF and they liked the way I did it because whenever I put my permit down I put the county on it and they said well you're on the few people that do that but it's almost a necessity because if you don't know what county should just permanent they couldn't go back and check it because every county use a different numbering system\nSo there is some inconsistencies air but uh yeah in my opinion we have way too many anti gun laws\nIt just across the board I understand that people that will be convicted of violent felonies\nShould not be allowed to to carry guns already against the law\nIt's against federal law in Alabama just made it against the law I Do believe that people convicted of non violent felonies after they have served their term and they're completely out of the system ought to have some way to go back and adjudicate that so that they can get their rights back because I Believe that self defense is an absolute natural right\nI don't care whether you're a deer or whether you're in a ... year human if something's attacking you have the right to defend yourself ...\nI couldn't possibly agree more so why do you think that we're getting the the the pushback because I Know that in in the last couple of years you know several times we have had a sheriff Mike hey All right here in Studio ... does have some of the other programs\nAnd share of hail seems to think that some of the pushback has actually coming from some of the sheriff's office says is that your experience what part of its\nRevenue and see and and I've had this this talk with our share if I'm Still part time employed with Winston county I still help him out with transportation and security stuff\nAnd I've had that conversation they think oh well if we do away with our permits were losing revenue but here's what happened in Alaska just what we talked about earlier is if you get your permit you don't have to go through the background check by a gun and if you want to travel out of state you have reciprocity okay so\nMany of the sheriff's thoughtfully believe that if we did away with permits if we went to constitutional carry here they lose all this revenue ... they wouldn't in Alaska went to constitutional carry but they still issue permits\nAnd they do that and people buy them for the specific reason that they don't have to go to the background check and if they go out of state they can very good so I Would just this is just a wild ask yes I'm Sorry my language it's just a wild guess but uh I Believe that uh\nIf we did cos just don't carry here and still offered permit for that reason they would maybe lose twenty twenty five percent of the revenue it wouldn't be able to watch it wouldn't lose completely right so I I think there was a good compromise can be reached their\nUnfortunately Jim were getting really tight on time and I got some of the first we'll be talking to throughout the course of the day but I Want all the details on this one more time\nOr the details are the two things one is the uh friends in our meeting next Thursday or tried to be there before six because they're going to shut the wrote down it's about two miles south of downtown on highway one Ninety five and this will building thirty dollars to get in fifty for a couple a ... and uh now that is also including dinner\nYeah that's my next to a gym in next is catering to dinner and then the second thing I Want to get in or was the gun show that they do and double springs on October twenty seventh in twenty eight and this is different than most this isn't a promoters gun show this was promoted by the police department and fire department all revenues are used by them free quit\nOctober twenty seventh in twenty eight and this is different than most is isn't a promoters gun show this has promoted by the police department and fire department all revenues are used by them for equipment and stuff\nWhich patients protect the community and Kim Miller is to contact person there uh with the he's the chief of police and he does have some more tables how few tables left in thirty five dollar speech and he's at two o five\nOr eight nine five four four seven and again that's the week after argument on the twenty seven twenty eight and once again like art and has been a really good to be in\nVery good stuff really looking forward to it and I just got to tell you that I really appreciate not just your stopping by ... you know the fact matter that you've been so supportive of this program and everything that we've done here and I am sort of supportive of everything that you ... that you bring to bear every time we have a chance to talk with us from a studio or just on the phone\nWhile I to be honest with you I'm Glad you're doing it because I Would burn out if I was you or do you know I don't think I could take a steady diet and I have been probably a little less vocal on the phones and I used to be I mean we called them because I just get so fed up with the political\nRhetoric is going on and the diversity and it's and it's all brought on in my opinion by the emotional website it's not our side is causing the problem it's the motion on their side and it's been\nWhipped up and whipped up and and and that we just we don't control the narrative rather than a few places but we have here and so we're gonna have to get out there and like your other guest in and start educating people and trying to have these conversations\n[laughter] for booted out their own young really uh [noise] yeah\nHe talked about not having TV show because people couldn't see you're not really wondering what you do when the cameras are down\nOh don't do that though go there no don't go there because you don't but Joe Joe here does a a ... a program over there and on on Saturday afternoons but he has a a a daily TV program\nOn a bunch of programs to just like you know he's a he's a big like you I Know\nYeah well he's also got a D. V. program into\nA he's not be able to ... times I I kinda went off in Iran at this past weekend with him as well but you know you you get the nice to meet people for the first time you're a little reluctance like our relationship Samy\nYou know those those men out there they always put their best foot forward and then you start date and then you fall in love and you get married and they get fat on ya so I I finally vote comfortable enough with you guys get ... on you\nKnow what I Love that because I've just been sitting here I'm scrolling through the where is it a change that Facebook page [laughter] oh great I'm following him on Twitter\nYeah there's a lot a lot of good characters here there's absolutely no doubt about it All right so one of the reasons I wanted to bring you on the program I talked to on this again is being out in California\nAnd particularly with the the coming midterms and the fact that you've got you know such a a um finger on the pulse of California politics what do you think from the perspective of somebody\nOut in California is going to happen in November\nOh man you know what it can now I just hope that we can hold out and keep control of one of these sides of Congress and I know a little worried taken away from California for a minute because the Florida Panhandle just got\n... oh yeah and and that's\nConcerning I got we've got to wonder if they're how their infrastructure back up and twenty five days from now and it turns\nOut it's a very good point that even extended the ah\nThe voter registration day down in Florida for those that were affected\nFirst time you and I were on the air on your program we we talked about you know my position on Brett Kavanaugh the accusations of the women you know obviously you and I both know how this thing has panned out up to this point\nWhat what is the the basic consensus where you are are are you hearing from people that might be on your program that they're concerned about there's been chatter about a constitutional overhaul has been concerned about\nThe impeachment of Brett Kavanaugh what are you hearing on your end\nYou know we have this remnant in California of people who who are\nAlien to to logic and reason and those are the people I talk to and we interviewed people from all over the country all over the world too so you know we're just I mean I don't know what they're talking about this\nAnd those are the people I talk to and we interviewed people from all over the country all over the world too so you know we're just I mean I don't know what they're talking about this impeachment uh from what I understand\nI'm not a lawyer but the lawyers I interviewed have said you can't just go round impeaching Supreme Court justices that has to be some sort of dereliction of duty while they're on the court what I understand but who knows\nUm that the liberals have been throwing his eats it ever since Trump got elected we know that and they want things their way or they're just not going to like it now they want to get rid of the electoral college 'cause that hurt their feelings\nWell you know you probably also heard the story that there's been debate about the\nAh the Census Bureau asking people about their citizenship and I don't think a lot of people realize that citizenship status your ability to vote in this country has a relationship to the electoral college\nAnd because if you don't have the proper district game then the electoral college gets a convoluted if you will in terms of the individual emerged from the individual districts and it's it's so fascinating to me that people can't seem to get this we've got the Democrats\nThat are screaming about the eradication as you pointed out to look for what college do you have the Census Bureau then you have this constitutional overhaul that plays into the Census Bureau as well as um as well as the college itself and I don't I don't don't understand\nHow people can't get through their mind that if they were even successful in doing that that at some point in time that a strategy would be used against them in the future by government is ration\nOh please throw something you're so right Michel our forefathers were so insightful and you can't imagine how over two hundred years ago they had this vision that we wouldn't be in the electoral college I mean they really came up with some good stuff look at us right\nAnd ... and they knew and they they they they got it done but\nYou know on that part of of the voting thing let's just a ... little news here from ... Atlanta, California the D. M. V. here has admitted that they accidentally added Fifteen hundred non citizens to vote\nJust exacerbating any voter file you know might be going on here and this is the second time last month\nThey admitted to adding twenty three thousand mistaken registration so now the secretary of state calling for an audit and independent auditors tried to make yourself feel better but\nWe will see what happens and that's just one of you know a few little kid that from planet California they've got um a sleeve worn twice this outbreak in Los Angeles I Can't figure out what to do about any of the homeless problems here we've had a half a outbreak break in San Diego for a couple of years now\nBeing spread among the homeless because they suffer plastic bags away\nNow those plastic bags me for many things one of which are very important they use for their waste just if I could talk plainly right takes as the way things got a little ...\nAnd and then you've got San Francisco which is so overrun with hopeless homeless is becoming famous\nFor all the human waste all over the sidewalk get much but so much so now Michael I don't know if you know this I mean you may not have a need to have it where you are there's a new app called snap crafts\nI actually have heard a lot going on with the\nPeople know that people can report the report the waste on the sidewalk there I'm just not going to go to San Francisco for a while but it there's so many areas that resemble a third world country and you know California used to be\nWell there I'm just not going to go to San Francisco for a while but it there's so many areas that resemble a third world country and you know California used to be you know this paradigm of of perfection of paradise people wanted to come here\nAnd now it's just it's unreasonable to pack them nuts\nThat the people get pretty loopy the governor and I just don't know they're handing out new they're handing out needles in San Francisco but a a few days ago they banned\nStrong statewide when I was on your show before we talked about the banning them in Santa Barbara now it's statewide and I'm reading articles on how to carry their own around your unreasonable straw and I just saw it as I thought this is just because it's ridiculous I Can't\nWhat do you think Amy was the impetus for all this craziness because California seems to have lost its what good mine I Know that there's a lot of conservatives out there there's a lot of people that are concerned about this but my gosh when you've got San Francisco which has turned into a landfill for all intents and purposes there's got to be some kind of local outrage I Would imagine\nI the only thing I can think of you know I'm I'm from the mid west Michael\nI'm a transplant I'm from Ohio and so you know I came here no for us for for my teenage up a back then and\nYou know I always thought you know California is going to be so great and and it is in many ways the great weather ... the line of great people here you know we've got\nSo many ... military installations and so especially here in Southern California San Diego Orange County there are a lot of conservatives a lot of military and and we just we look around and go what is going on so the only thing I can think of as and got Hollywood\nUh they live in that bubble and in LA they think you know we're big were like New York we have this bubble we should run thanks forgot the electoral college and then in San Francisco you've got the hippies who came of age and who are now in charge and this is what's happened\nAnd it's up to remind them I mean it it's so sad to me 'cause you know we've had several friends of the program that live out in California I got a couple of regular contributors that had been you know to spend time in California I got another woman with a name and Meghan bars\nThrough now lives in Las Vegas she's a refugee from California and I hear these stories repeated time and time and time again\nAnd you know you you look around and you see people and you say run for office let's change the tide here but then look at cabinet looking at anybody for I mean even before Kavanaugh people want to ruin you if you run for office and I was thinking about this yesterday\nI don't know I'm going to live or or slander expert on the shelf and talk because something has got to be done I won't take away any ones right right it's nothing that thought to be done about them the F crap top people can do about anybody any time with no ramification when they're proven wrong\n... you're exactly right you're exactly

not been exonerated by the Romans who who liked to crucified and roast a Christians until four hundred years after\n... you're still in the old too so but we're in the ...\nNow where do I find all this stuff ball it's\nJulian Assange is last message\nThat's where I'm going to be able to find it on the Internet you know that when somebody says how you go you go you see it on the Internet that doesn't make me feel really really good boiling\nJulian Assange talking in in a live person okay All right and then he has that fund back\nVideo there's a guy that comes out that he shows the video Julian aside and then he shows the funds back video and then he goes back to the Bible and shows how they're going to tie in to biblical revelations and make people think they have spiritual powers because there are a ... and they have\nA reverse engineered some of that technology and they made to use it for evil against us to try to control it this way\nAnd make us think that they have magical spiritual powers over us\nSo everybody needs to start taking medication today talks their body from metal talks\nHow how do I do that ball\nWorse over us\nSo everybody needs to start taking medication today talks their body from metal talks\nAnd now how how do I do that ball\nThere's videos out they're all over the place and that certain a fellow that put this video out about how he's taught it to them using it for religion because if you notice\nThat the Democrats used the metro area Jewish ... that's where they tied numbers in all their beliefs and they did things don't specific dates and thanks specifically to mark the Bible\nOkay it's really more demonic in your mind could ever can see these Democrats are\nThat's a lot of money that goes along with all of our demonic spirit follow\nThat has a lot to do with the smart those that I was doing a book about earlier there are you familiar with Martin those ball\nYeah well this is what Julian Assange called this with evil that\nEvil does well yeah that's just another thing I don't know I Do have one more question ball\nSo did the aliens or they are they deem and yeah\nThey are they are they they are good and evil just like we are\nSo you think they're like they're like they're not they're not doing their little green men ... great tasty we're gonna have\nA they do but what it is is that it it's doll body is it not real bodies is their energy ah going into these forms so that they can perform physical task\nNoisy I'm going with the name of going out now I'm going to jump off the deep in here and tell you can go watch a video of a woman um I think she's already passed away she passed all this information out\nTo some God it put it on the Internet\nAnd this could just they say for all I Know ... but there are videos of her take it a lie detector test after Roswell and she supposedly was the one they interviewed the alien from last well they told her there's all kinds of aliens faces out there and they travel by not having a body\nRight I'm Talking about ... thank you so much [noise] okay I think\nNo other I'm really I'm really not completely doubting you I'm listening Abramoff it's\nCrazy stuff that I'm telling you I research like to believe in daylight and that's why I went back to the alien interview of this woman doing this interview supposedly with the ... there was one alien left on the Roswell\nA ship when it crashed and they kept her for several days and the woman she was talking to was talking to her third to lead to sing and she said that that's how all alias communicate it's very telepathy and that's why they are trying to control our minds is to keep us from having those wisdom\nTo outsmart they're evil\nGot it ... ... do you have a great week you know I'm a little rebel I'll admit Frank welcome to the program or\nA mom who's been drained\nHi look I Frank Frank Frank I I used to never\nBelieve any of this stuff but\nI think there is a good chance Hillary Clinton is really a rep though so many don't doubt everything\nI mean I Know she's a little more strict [laughter] live shorter lives yes let me tell you something\nI didn't really have and as soon as somebody forever to me I'll be willing to accept this yes I Am her in the ... in the six thousand years of record human history that's all over your six thousand\nRight before ... most of them [laughter] if there is\nSix thousand years of record human history and that's all over your six thousand here\nRight before Clinton most of them\nYeah [laughter] if there is an alien\nLanded on this there is no way on this earth human beings good to be quiet about it it would be no scary it would be no the human nature has not got the ability to shut it up and there's no force the owners are shutting it up\nNow that I that I mean what you were telling me on the on the phone [laughter]\nOn your cell phone you told me almost tell you told me on the phone that you believe in Kim trails\nAnd a current Jim ... been hearing about Kim trails in the years or twenty year woman came trails Jim trails this\nHappening it was just my luck you kill us you know but if you don't think they're real then why does the C a director John\nAh what's his name brand and Brennan former when a guy that voted for government is just a minute to Kim trials there's usually why\n[laughter]\nWhy John [laughter]\nHe's why he wanted to go on why should we transfer drains Frank\nI told you don't go you demand goes broke I with you on that he is a raven day go mood big\n[noise] much rather have tried to I got a good spot [laughter] so you do have a drink [laughter]\nI'm not I'm I'm agreeing with him Merv welcome to the program [noise]\nWow [noise]\nWhat are you know I've given up thinking everything is out there I mean everything is crazy because every day I found out something that I was told for my whole life would there was not through and now is to think about the things that we are that are kids actually believe are facts let me I'll sit everybody off\nEvolution they just believe it's a fact we made it up it's a theory we can't prove it\nThe ah folks hope it's true so they don't have to believe in a creator God but our children in many Americans just believe it is an absolute fact I'm now we can go to climate change made up\nHoax yep but people both leave it so so I've gotten to the point now where I think there are things the government or government just tell us innovate and we believe him because they told us that\nI I don't disagree with that Scott and I'm not going to disagree with Paul uh but I I'm going to go back to something somebody said earlier it is not as sad that yet\nIt's gonna be this afternoon as soon as it is that where we are going I'm going I'm good with any\nExactly and that's in the book of genesis but it's also observed by cry in the New Testament days the Sabbath is still in effect\nI Murphy what's interesting Maher mar I Know\nYou you you took the Rome because most of them would have because the ... the other day who\nCalled in and goes you know we're not talking about that oh the New Testament anymore I mean the old days when we're talking about the move to the ... so I was getting by getting\nAt that's fine but it's something everybody needs to be here because I've sat then explain this to people like oh well it's still just said Sunday were worse than the war on Sunday I not what we're talking about this crisis that if you love me you'll keep my commandments and one of those commandments is keeping the Sabbath\nOh well it's still just it's Sunday were worse when the war on Sunday I not what we're talking about this crisis that if you love me you'll keep my commandments and one of those commandments just keeping the Sabbath now here's what's interesting\nAbout the mentality of it when you read genesis good the darkness and then the light the first day your day\nYou we sleep at night in the darkness we are awake in the daylight hours when God is there so you enjoy your day\nWith God in the white you go to sleep when it's dark you wake up with God in the white therefore you're always with God\nAnd we are on the Protestant side of things just are very dismissive of that and you know the Greeks and the ... and everybody when they got in and and started messing with the church\nSwitched it around where we end our days in the darkness and we don't need to end our days in dark as we need to end our days and the white and\nSo you know always being with God now Kim trails are real I drive around out here in the sun\nYou know you you featured my\nOperations on your program yes as I deliver\nPick up dumpsters and when a plane to leave a trail in the sky that looks like they're trying to play tic tac toe and it's still there three hours later\nThat's not a con trail that's a Kim trail and that's very real\nGood have idiot scientists out there just like what Paul it brought up somebody else I think that think that they're going to stop global warming by spraying these fake clouds which only happened to appear over major metropolitan areas\nWhich you guys are owned aboard you'll get the ... we got into the locker room\nAnd I really do remember back when I thought it was I going to happen [noise]\nWhat there's ... all in the U.S right now\nAre they rip doing I'm done [laughter]\n[noise]\nI

carry because I go people Scott\nAnd they're not they're just letting letting them sign their hikers and got what they can commit more crimes\nNo Charles I'm just going to go ahead and tell you that ...\nIn my opinion and I don't know the specific cases but this is all part and parcel to a two prong air for one is we've got very liberal federal judges who have decided that\nYou know putting too many people in prison is some sort of violation of there right now we can make them slaves and we can work um ... that's in the constitution\nBut having too many in there is some sort of violations of the state is all panicked about overcrowding in prisons then you've got this new virtues signaling this going on even the president's part of it I don't know how far he is willing to go with their\nOwn sentencing reform prison reform whatever prison reform\nIn many many cases means\nDon't send the bad guy to prison I'm the I'm Sorry that's just what it means Charles so now we have all these issues rolling together and even some local municipalities and counties are saying look we don't have a place to put them so we're just going to let them back into town the sad part is I Am more\nLocal municipalities and counties are saying look we don't have a place to put them so we're just going to let them back into town the sad part is I Am more worried about\nYour safety your family safety your properties safety than I Am about that person's comfort or discomfort and the easiest way to stay out of\nJail is don't commit the crime\nWell Scott ... are you familiar with what's happening today about the the three murders in a gun or all of the grandmother the grandson in the night\nAnd and the guy got out on parole and nobody had watched you done anything about him in and an eight and in a case of murdering these people and\nA ... said that she's going to look into it I was ... I'm mistaken doesn't actually he's a person if I had this individual when they act and that's my calling these people are going to get that got say something is done early to prove it\nWell let me tell you one last thing before I let you go Charles I had somebody in law enforcement that I greatly respect and I was asking them about this\nThis urban legend and you've heard it before we have people in prison because they got caught with you know when one marijuana cigarette and Senate president and and this person said look I'm not saying that's never happened\nBut in the day and age that we live right now\nA huge number of these people that are that the left is advocating for that says well they got put in prison for a non violent so and so he said look we know they robbed the store we know who they shot the ... we you know and you don't know 'cause we're innocent until proven guilty but they got this long list of the stuff\nBut the but the charge that was absolutely no way around it he had a pocket full of drugs that's the one that we can make stick and that's the one that sent him to prison he's a bad guy\nBut but you got these people that they're going to well you know it was not about a fifth chances are\nThat person has a long history of other things they think he did but this one was the one you can be found guilty of easily\nAnd it bothers me that we've decided we're going to lead a bunch of these people out because it's going to make us feel good well if I could make these people stay in the legislature towards neighborhood instead of my neighborhood I'm good with it but that's not how it works Charles\nWell I I just I liked it the checks and balances seem like they're leaving us for some reason\nThey're falling apart because we're losing our minds in common sense is not common thanks very nice lot so you we gotta keep on rolling I got other stuff too I Want to talk to you about what he was you don't want to keep talking just wide open on a friday let's do it Greg welcome to the program\nMan I'm doing fantastic I Hope you are pretty good\nI was watching TV last night but yeah I Know that my Loni is getting their interviews just\nA ton I I Believe nine o'clock what shows the question if I may see as our says I'd be saying I Believe it's nine o'clock by asking her about a ... a fire and health issue or when she got on a plane that was the starting that\nWent on the commercial advertisement about it\nThat that's what's important that that's one of the reasons that folks have gotten where they don't really pay attention to the news the fact that the coke getting on the plane makes news the fact that the shoes she wears make news the fact that when I started topping ... from the first thing that my computer\nThe news the fact that the shoes she wears make news the fact that when I started topping in Maloney a draw the first thing that my computer search engine wants to talk about was that uh she wore clothes in Africa that resembled\nUm something the Nazi sympathizer one war in the first Indiana Jones movie\nThat that is not new to me it's it's crazy so you're going to watch the interviewer not\nWatch record or something other and so I can see it and see what it's about but I think it's just something like ... ...\nYou got as exactly right if they can if they can ... a mad at the president or remind her she should be mad at the president or whatever they're going to do it I mean these are the same people do you know give their son a hard time Brazil anybody\nGot man thanks they the Louds used to be ... in ...\nYou got man thanks they the clouds used to be ... cotton looking now there is\nAlways been stringy crowd call Jane Jane span\nAnd they're using these hurricanes and stuff they're going to start using them in war\nWould that be\nAgainst us again or heard that a ... [laughter] well maybe I'll do the other night while you're a yeah trying to say basketball coach and welcome to the program\nAnd we had another while discussing today\nThis is a Jew education did you ... I don't remember which one it is\nAnyway but I Do respect to one of my favorite color is Joe\nActually watch these people put these cameras trousers down and there are different from jak calm trails 'cause I've seen that too and and the jet calm Charles we're about forty thousand fifty thousand feet these chemicals are much lower and the rise in and they not only are doing it deliberately I've seen\nTwo or three planes and the horizon the same time Criss crossing each other putting that these long plumes that only grow and expand and take a blue sky and to really hazy day and not only that sometimes it's a company with a uh a\nChemical smell a couple of months I was trapped at in and had to breathe that longer than I wanted\nTo know you have seen it ... you you telling me that this is absolutely through and you had seen it\nI've seen that more than one occasion 'cause one time I the first time I saw it I was actually listening to early morning Michael heart show who got a caller called\nIn that and to live in that same region I went outside and I watch them there's more than one plant in the horizon at the same time and they're putting down to low fly their delivery making these patterns what the stuff is uh uh people have said bury him an aluminum and whether that's true or not is not something I don't think I Want to breathe then\nAre they keep saying I'll eminent as bad for you and everything and if there's mercury involved we definitely don't want to do that\nBut there's just there's so why they're doing it I don't know uh but uh I've heard that they're trying to patch the ozone layer I've heard they're trying to give his Madison occupations\nAre vaccines against a flu viruses and stuff I've heard all sorts of theories pro and con on this is good for us just as bad for us\nAnd the truth is I don't know but the thing about it is what if it is good for us why are they doing it in secret and not telling us\nAnd if it's bad for us obviously there's not they're not going to tell us but as far as the marijuana situation yeah I Know we've kind of laughter made jokes about it but Joe was right about this I mean it it elevates estrogen level\nWhich I definitely would take it would affect your sperm count if you're a man ... and so and I think that that's something that will do that for a long time\nAnd by the way I I was a ... I was a pot head I mean I I was into a really strong for four and a half years\nNearly all of our listeners then we're in the pot and we're getting married about myself when\nI'm One of these old corrupted baby boomers you know I got too many skills is in my closet\nAnd run for office I mean by skeletons would\nBe real you know and I don't I think I'd like to leave him let's just say let them stay buried as long as they\nAre going away but like I said you know I run for office but I ... my butt but Jesus Christ got a hold of held them all the ... hold of my life I get my early twenties and change those desires but I I Will say this I don't want to\nPut anybody in jail for marijuana but I Do think it might be a gateway to not merely other drugs but to maintain the the cult that we're worried about the cult that connection\nNot merely other drugs but to maintain the the cold that we're worried about the aquatic connection\nThat's why big Dave cell sasquatch and other people I Know man I\nDon't know about sasquatch I'm more worried about what judge him from Marshall County testify to having been a part of exercises and then people that smoke pot or interested with theme was much more concerned about whether it leads to other drugs\nI got you appreciate it I got to go to Greg real quick you've been very patient Greg thank you for listening\nHey Scott I'm a first time caller

that they are to protect themselves won the ... came a standoff and the Germans flew airplanes over those trenches\nJumping out poison gas on the soldiers that with some of the first airplanes so that was probably the first came trails of history probably\nAnd I just I just wanted to point that I was I think a lot of people don't know about it or have forgotten about it and uh it's something we

when\nThe congressmen and senators were shot at the baseball field did you know that the man who almost killed represents represents the ... the wounded ... others\nWas actually shouting this is for health care\nHow how did how did that not get out\nSays I was there at the ball field was seen as least almost died from a very very angry by the man who was inside it really by rhetoric on the left and this has been reported enough when he came up on the ball field with these semi automatic weapon\nWas the ... almost died from a very very angry about a man who was inside it really by rhetoric on the left and this has been reporting enough when he came up on the ball field with these semi automatic weapon barring probably close to two hundred shots shooting by people almost killing the he was yelling this is for healthcare\nDidn't they decided they didn't know why he did it\nAnd that's why we wonder why people think the government will say or do or hide anything Danny welcome to the program\nAnd Scott I'm OK you could comment good ideas talking about the Sabbath earlier yes um\nThe the thing that convinced me I I'm a Christian I been observing the seven states that it's for Fifteen Years now okay\nThat'd be Saturday right so I understand ... ... okay\nAnd what convinced me is that the commandment says the seventh day is the Saturday at the lord so if a if you if you believe in keeping that think commandments thing clearly the one that says remember the one that we've forgotten\nWhen that starts out with the war remember says what David Savage is and how you should keep it it's it's simple it's one of the tent\nI Wonder if we messed up the island or somewhere maybe it's really on Thursday\nWe but we know Easter is the first day a week every year and\nIt really but that'll rated ... but don't we just say Easter is East I'm I'm just being it's I'm just be an ornery now\nYeah I I don't know I've had people say that before but Sunday is always the first day it's always on Easter right Easter Sunday so the day before is always a seventh day it's right Saturday\nTo say and I guess I mean I guess the Jewish people probably were fairly good except for some of those years with all of their pagan leaders and stuff that it remembering Wednesday was actively the original seven day\nLook goalie problem I have with that yes the Saturday is football is hard to keep it wholly yeah you're on me a million Sunday by the time [laughter] so that I don't go ... we got an advantage\nThough we have a a CBO weaker record everything in the ... you got it yeah yeah it's er watch layer a couple of other things um if you want it really gets conspiratorial you can go into a project blue being about the game trails that's something they were talking about the looming only good project\nBeam and that's I don't really believe in that stuff we'll see how it works out I really don't follow too much that stuff anymore but it was kind of interesting and one
