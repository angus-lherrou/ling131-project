Walker we've been talking a bit about the Pittsburgh obviously and I know that\nYou're giving us some insight into anti Semitism in in this country and throughout the Christian Community and I'm curious and I'm asking this\nFrom the perspective of a layperson because I have to admit to you and I and I've said history before I don't understand anti Semitism now just in India in full disclosure\nOn my mom's side of the family as I told you her uncle was Jewish I have multiple Jewish gardens\nAnd this guy was from marriage and it's just this was never anything that really entered our world you know my my family my father was Baptist but it wasn't Southern Baptist but it was a non practicing Baptist he was never very religious but my mom was very devout her ... her Catholicism I was baptized as a Catholic and over here you have the Jewish faction of the family\nAnd it was just never anything that kind of permeated our world and again you know they let it all up in New York where there was a very vibrant Jewish community so maybe I'm just a little bit out of the loop or jaded by that I don't really know what can you help me understand surely the the origins\nWell it started a long ago of course with uh the ruins persecution the destruction second double in Seventy eighty carried on for the next two hundred years until room broke the backs of the Jews won Constantine became\nA both hope and I'm a\nHead of room a he instituted many new uh mandates through the influence of his mother Lena\nA changing the Sabbath from Friday Saturday and Sunday changing Passover to Easter and a stab of seeing the doctrine of the trinity which at that time was for the purpose of refuting tutor on me six chapter for which says you're always read the lord are gone the longest\nEstablishing the doctrine of the trinity which at that time was for the purpose of refuting tutor on on the sixth chapter for which says hero is where the lord our God the lord has one and introducing the three persons of the trinity the Catholic Church then went on to 'em\nUp until Nineteen Seventy three or Nineteen Seventy four took the position that the Jews killed Jesus now\nGrowing up as a Jew in Pittsburgh Catholic city living in a very isolated a compact a Jewish community or we were surrounded by Catholic churches and the Catholic community as a kid I was called a Christ killer\nThis is the first thing I ever and I remember about seven or eight years old going home crying and asking my mother looked listen ... somebody called me a Christ killer\nI don't even know who that is\nI we knew nothing about Jesus it wasn't discussed in the synagogue um\nAnd I was a pretty developed a regular synagogue attending child a I've been an observant Jew up to appoint a for most of my adult life\nIt came out as a baby to fulfill God's Plan of salvation we've taken God out of the equation we blame the condition in America today because we took prayer out of school in the sixties\nAnd I'm saying the problem of today is we took the Holy Spirit of the church we took God the father out of the church and we are not preaching the whole\nOf the Bible were not preaching anything but a feel good message that is not transformational if these people excited and walking out on Sunday mornings saying oh that was such a great power for some and I feel so good well did provoke you\nDid it teach you a biblical truth\nDid it was more than two verses of scripture and then thirty minutes of an ex boss tore teaching is there a troop Bible study going on this is why do

... bring gym in the conversation your morning Jim how are you\nHey fellas before I get going a James this is the last time you're going to see the green light and let me say it's been a pleasure listening to your work on the air you're consummate professional uh Godspeed\nWatch your sick and bring all all your people appreciate it OK\nYeah yes and I I'm listening to this conversation before I get going let me say that a murder of anybody is a tragic act it's a violation of the Fifth Amendment okay and that would be whether they're Jew Muslim\nRoman Catholics or Protestants but I'm listening to this discussion and just wanting to be turned off this horrific back\nInto the fault of Christian now I've been around the Catholic for fifty years and I never heard any of the stuff that the rabbi stopping it though but I Would like you know when we get into this discussion about the reason that there's a lot city\nFrom say the Spanish Empire which was the greatest Catholic empire in history with regard to the gym I Want to ask the rabbi if instead of you know our society\nThey need to estimate maybe he would like to talk about what the hell would says about Jesus Christ we forget the stuff we try to make you feel one way and I'm not going to get into detail I like the rabbi to comment on that but they said they don't have much precious lord and savior\nHis tail light in not just said since it\nJam can I stop you for a minute\nLet me say you're just stuck twenty minute OK\nOkay but what ... what am I make a very very specific point to you okay I'm I'm not a\nOK okay but what for for a minute but my when I when I make a very very specific point here okay\nI'm I'm not a ... person I'm a Bible person and I go by the order by about ... ...\n... okay that's stretching a rabbi and you get that chance but I think it's because you criticize the training Christian religion of the true savior\nBefore uh before he criticized too much where I Am very devoted devoted to the topic was a Jewish woman at your daily\nBut at the same try any knowledge of Catholic any notable Christian you don't know what you criticized are fake without bringing up the trial but\nBecause they don't just as much animosity Christians to as the other way and when Jean ... and it's terrible thing I just speaking generally\nYour gym the Christian religion you know you shouldn't you\nJim I'm just going to set you straight the Tom and his not the Bible\nAnd everything that I quote is from the Bible\nI grew up here so I Wonder why there's data Martha ... why don't you\nLess less less less a gym I let him finish less\nThan five percent of the Jewish population\nLess than five percent worldwide\nEven embrace the teachings of the moment that is the rabbinical study and the extra biblical commentary this part of the problem gym is that as Christians in general across the board two point five billion Christians across the world\nThe Bible is the rural and guide and\nI go by the Bible I ... I ... I don't go by I don't go by any man's\nTeaching I knocked cat it gives them nor tall mud\nI go by the sixty six books\nCan change in the old and New Testament according to the word of God\nAnd so we can talk about extra biblical writings we talk about Mark Twain we can talk about Charles Dickens we can talk about anybody else who offers something but the only thing is the un Arab word of God and there's nowhere in the ... word of God\nThe one that there is one religion other than the believe in Jesus too\nI as far as how people observe and whether it's from a Catholic Church and marry or anybody else that is denominational doctrine that is not in the Bible as a matter of fact there's only one do we worship mess God alone and so much\nIs because we don't have to watch what we say we're able to give an unbridled response but the Jewish community incredibly divided when Donald Trump made the announcement that he was going to Pittsburgh there were eleven or the got together and wrote to him and said don't come you're not welcome here\nUh but the chief rabbi a of the congregation said I'm an American this is my president and if he wants to come by Jeffrey Mars if he wants to come he should come he didn't come there to disrupt he came to represent the American people to show\nHis [noise] ah support and for his ... to give his condolences and if you notice that this was quite a bit different visit than other visits to disaster areas he wasn't there to glad hand he was there to pay his respects him millennia pay their respects and they left\nThere was no town hall there was not a whole lot of rhetoric was done in decency in order in a very beautiful and at a fine way and it was a message to the Jewish community we stand in solidarity as an administration with you\nAre but the Jewish community is incredibly divided there is a lot of anti Trump sentiment that's what's going to turn out next Tuesday is this anti Trump Jewish sentiment at the polls because\nWe were immigrants now we were all immigrants\nI remember this was the diaspora we came here most of us came here illegally either in the early Nineteen hundreds when the Russian persecution began a the middle of Nineteen hundreds in the thirties when the communist came and the Hitler regime began to rise and then post Holocaust which I'm a first post ...\nThe middle Nineteen hundreds in the thirties when the communist came and the Hitler regime began to rise and then post Holocaust which I'm a first post Holocaust generation and so when we look at the immigrant status of the Jewish population of America\nA very pro immigration a because all of us were immigrant families but we all did it by the book\nThe immigration naturalization act nine fifty two the year that I was born\nA clear clearly stated don't come here from Ukraine with the commitment to Ukraine don't come here for Moscow with commitment to the Kremlin don't come here from Poland with a commitment to 'em and you to to uh whoever was in charge of polling come here with a commitment to America and we all did that\nAnd the America of today\nUh things like gun rights Jews typically are not hunters I Jews are typically not gun owners\nAnd so these are issues that don't resonate with the Jewish community because of violence so when he made the statement that synagogues should arm themselves this was very polarized and to the Jewish community saying you want Jewish people\nBut nevertheless the synagogues here have security\nArmed security on the high holidays ah almost every church now has a security program he was saying being inclusive in that and take actions to protect yourself he's not asking every Jewish person to go out and buy guns\nSo how does the the Jewish community square the the Democrats support and the reason I'm asking that is there has been questions as to previous comments made by block Obama in addition to his actions\nAre in recent weeks we've seen pictures pop up on the Internet that show you know ... and the company of a very devout anti Semite or a you know that it um Louis Farrakhan and Obama\nNot necessarily done a lot for ... from our perspective the Jewish community and I'm appointed Obama not not as the former president but as the ... head of the Democrat Party Hillary Clinton was standing and I'm curious how they're able to square that with the actions of the previous administration\nIt is a conundrum that I've struggled with most of my life I'm a liberal in the seventies\nBecame a conservative when I came into corporate America and saw the reality of the benefits of capitalism in a free economy and a change my political allegiance once we got out of Vietnam\nA that was all I wanted that administration to do that was in position I took from the seventies when we see the people at Louis Farrakhan when we see a Reverend Wright when we see this anti Jewish rhetoric\nUnfortunately their eyes are not open to the fact that this is an agenda because you have a Bernie Sanders a Jew you have a Dianne Feinstein a Jew you have Jewish people that are aligning themselves with\nA democratic agenda and saying we know what's best for our people and because we're such a minor part of this population numerically\nOr people don't really care necessarily about the Jewish vote remember in America or if there are seven and a half million Jews in Israel\nAnd seven and a half million Jews spread out through the rest of the world including a big population in Paris a big population Toronto than you're only talking about a handful of three or four million people\nIn the United states it does is that a populist that you're going to go after and you really care about getting support you want the money I mean you don't necessarily\nIs that a populist that you're going to go after and you really care about getting support you want the money\nI mean you don't necessarily are looking for their input a new agenda other than the fact that they are pro life\nPro algae BT and are going to stand among I'm side they are pro is not pro life but they are pro choice and pro algae BQ plus and therefore they're going to get the vote and get the money because of that and those are the two key issues for that community\nWrote a conversation where the rabbi Eric Walker going to take a real quick break come back on the other side you're listening to

the program again\nGoes hunters ghost charters during the course of the investigation they put cameras in the house I bought audio recording devices in your house and I understand they picked up some very interesting pieces of audio that are\nCompelling and yet disturbing so why don't you tell us when we got here\nOkay well a couple of things you need to understand is that in order for a ... an organization to claim that your house has something going on\nThey have to have something either audio picked up they have to have either a visual and they hacked or they have to have a personal experience and ... they have to have two or three to say that\nUm some something has happened in the house now ironically I'm ... my wife actually pulled out something I didn't even I've never read until this morning this is actually the report that was made by\nThe investigative team and I'm just going to give you a couple a\nTidbits real quick before we go into the um the VPs um during

basement\nSo they all had personal experiences as well as well we're going to play on the east should explain a little bit about the setup of how they got the cameras and writing and they came in they came in and they set of all these different camera thermal imaging damage or you know the BP detector they had\nMicrophones and recording devices all through the house and they're they're all night long I mean it's it's it's very disruptive and mean ... you know they why or how dark and then they're like twelve hours right on the set all this stuff up\nOr they did the first investigation and they were very very mom about what what they had you know capture\nAnd I I remember saying to my wife a couple of days later I'm like look I I don't even know if they're gonna call back and then a day later they called back and said listening can we come into the house one afternoon\nFor an hour or so we just want to follow up on a couple of things so I said sure um they met me at the house in the afternoon ah my kids were school my wife and I were both home we went out and sat in the driveway and we let these two investigators back into the house\nSo that came out they didn't say anything again they laughed a couple of days pass by and I get a phone call and the ... what\nSo they came out they didn't say anything again they laughed a couple of days pass by and I get a phone call and the ... what I was told was up until the investigation of our home the most ... had ever captured in a single location was for\nUm the day of the first the night of the first investigation they captured Seventy seven wow mhm of the Seventy seven Seventy four of them were captured or my son's room\nSo like we want to come back and we want to bring everybody\n[laughter] so that's basically what happened is they they they want to do in like five or six more investigations and you know they brought a medium in will touch on that a little bit but but I Want to do now is I Want to give you um I'm gonna play a couple of the things that they captured on audio and I'm going to start out a little white would then we're going to work up a little bit\nSo um if you could go to a night\nThe first one I Want you to play is a track number two\nYou might have to turn it up a little bit and this is just sounds\nSo this was the woman that they here in our house [noise]\nSounds like a little coyote\nWe don't have ... they were the leaves are where we live\nAnd I know now that's called nine one one if you see one yes [laughter] [noise]\nOkay the next one I Want you to play on that same one is a track number eight [noise]\nKnow play that again [noise]\nHere we saying chunk chunk so the investigators like we don't know what that means and I said I Know what that means chunk is the nickname of my son when my son was a little baby he's a little chunky so I used to call them chunk you won't put out one more time\n\nAnd that was a track eight [noise]\nOkay [laughter] I'm All right so um\nSo what happened was is that the the capture a lot is different recordings I'm not going to play them all today but I Am going to um\nPlay what happened on the good [laughter] so um that was just a couple of little things that they happened to have at night um if you want to play track fourteen now before you play this track I Want to set the ... the ...\nYou know I thought you said also say that when they're in the house and they're recording these things they're just talking or asking questions out loud and they don't hear these things right to the ... year these are things that were captured on their digital recording\nGot him when they played played them back so I'm track fourteen before you play that just so you understand at the time my son was in a crib tent which is a mess tent that goes inside of babies crib to keep them from crawling out of the trip so the crib you get zipped into it so what happened was that was recording device in the room\nUm I went into the room in the middle of the night\n'cause I heard my my son just start to stir and I ... the the um ... so what you're going to be here is something you can hear very loud zipper noise and then it's gonna be something that proceeds just after the zipper noise and that's what you want to hear an abstract fourteen\n[noise]\n[noise]\nYou like growl mhm warmer time [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nYou're like Raul mhm or overtime [noise]\nOkay [laughter] so that's ... ... whatever ripping the pet ... mediums and look at it\nAnd then something growled afterwards you will do that one more time

some eerie stuff for a a Halloween additional but I Will tell you\nA quick little funny out on the Twitter feed one of my more a long winded callers is name Henry inherently good law was out of him or his own voice\n... average to raise the program a moment ago Seventy seven easy peas and one night question mark maybe it actually was entering you don't have been around a lot [noise]\nI'm just going to be some more a VP recordings for this if you want to go ahead and load up at other CD James I'm so they came in\nUm she walked around the house\nI'm now again I'm only going to relate what she said I'm I don't know if I Believe it all but there was a couple of things that she did say that kind of threw me by surprise so she goes into the house and she asked us if um\nOur family had ever been you know live during the state or anything of that nature um couldn't really answer that like as you know our our father side of the family goes back all the way to colonize Asian right at you know we have ancestors and the Confederate Army we'd Middlesex county Virginia's weren't found me dry for\n[noise] and what happened was she um\nShe she keeps seeing this woman and she's cultural Ruth\nAnd she says uh Ruth looks like sometime a handmade and or some type of nanny she's dressed sort of like at the turn of the century and she's sort of like attached to the babies in the house with the boys in the house mainly\nOn in addition to Ruth there is a a man who she says is wearing a bowler hats and his name is Peter\nNow third she says her child in the house um I always thought it was a boy she said it was a girl\nI'm Will play a couple of ... a little while that all sound like a girl [noise] um and then you know ironically are psych forecast sickly rather I think was or anybody else and I'm like yeah your grandfather's in the house\nAnd when he's in the house when you have you know parties and stuff he likes to walk around and you know you interact with people and then she said then you also have a dog that sleeps at your ... at you know on the floor by your door\nThat takes care of you and when it was alive and lived for fourteen years and then she pauses sad and it was definitely a German Shepherd\nWhich we had a German Shepherd named princess right was that kind of caught me by surprise that live for fourteen years that was the one thing that she said to me but that was kinda like whoa you know you know wait a minute or\nSo that was what she said when she came in and then she did another investigation a with a ghost hunters they brought her in that night they went back into my son's room they sat there for a little while and they um\nCaught a couple of things so on that next CD the first one I'm going to I'm going to do is um [noise] so what's going to happen is you're going to hear the investigator speaking about what happens is they get answers so I Want you to play track twenty three\n[noise]\nSo mediums [noise]\nThe medium says we're here to help and then she gets an answer you wanna try that again\n[noise] [noise]\nYou that I heard it but I didn't she said would you so the investigator says we're here to help and then the responses would you\nYou're that I heard it but I didn't she said would you say the investigator says we're here to help and then the responses would you\n[noise]\n... and ... and that was a girl sounds like a grown man right middle child yeah could you um play um track number seven\n\nAll maybe [noise]\nSo the investigators says you feel better now maybe and she says yeah you do that again\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] okay now one investigator brings up our grandfather our grandfather's name was ... by the way which when I was very young I mean like he died many many years before we were born I'm\nAlso you know I never met him either yeah\nI I was out one day and some woman walked up to me it just said you have a guardian angel hurt his name was always just walk away and I was like home and then like a week later I was talking to mom about it and and then she was like yeah well your your grandfather's name was ... so if you could just played track thirty five\n\nSo to say a lot of [noise] your story\nSo he says I understand you follow them around a lot and you hear her say yeah so you want to put out a gun\nSo to say a lot of [noise] your story\nYou're like yeah so that's just a few of the BP's I'm um I'll I'll stick [laughter] is that enough for you as you can keep going if you want [laughter]\nNo but I'm so like the medium you know came in and and you know we had asked for a few questions and and she basically said ah I remember one of the questions we asked was at the house and she said no she was like if you were to move away they be packing their bags with you and say where we go next\nSo what is that the the genesis of this the ... you ever come at the termination 'cause like I said you know when when you and I was growing up as kids in Hoover but there was a lot of weird stuff coming home and cultures being off the wall stacked neatly yeah and all you know ... and of course you know our mom had these interactions you know fairly frequently herself\nBut once I left that house it never happened with me again\nRight well I did with me in that house both our houses in Birmingham it happened in my apartment in Long Island or it happened in the fraternity house I lived in in college it happened in our ... our parents' home in New Hampshire every place that I've gone I've had experienced is another thing or another the calling card at the same as water\nNow we used to wait and and this has happened to our mothers you wake up in the middle in the in the morning she'll she'll get how bad is stepping a puddle water at at her bed side\nI've come into my apartment and there was pools of water all around the counter tops and nobody has any idea of how they how they got there [noise] um I had a six dresser drawer you know dress her in my apartment and the middle drawer I opened it up and the whole thing was still water\nAll my clothes were soaking wet\nOne morning and there was no water above and there was no water below so that's another thing that's been a been a calling card for this um we've had times where we've had friends come in the house and they open the door and someone was behind the door and pulled the door shut on them and they did a ... type of war with door knob\nYou know things of this nature so you\nAnd what was behind the door and pull the door shut on them and they did a tug of war with door knob\nThings of this nature so you know I mean you know how out there the sound of course I Do but my ...\nBut you know really like no no 'cause it just if something like this has happened that means they're attached to you right and if you\nI mean one of our callers is on hold just talk to me but this is\nI'm not gonna say demonic but this is what some people in the Catholic Church will call demonic obsession is when ... beard is obsessed with you and they're going to follow you around and bug you until you break so they can fully for this now whether that's what's going on here or not I don't know\n... to this way like I've always approaches to say we die approach politics I Try to look at things from every different angle get 'em get as much information as I can from all different sources and then you know kind of make my own educated judgment and you know I've never felt the need to ever have to\nProve this to anybody it doesn't matter to me me me 'cause the truth of matter as my my objective with bringing them into the house was to you know kind of help my wife kind of get you know\nBe able to cope with this a little bit more and that and I I I Believe that happened in in that respect I I you know mission accomplished for me\nSo what is the most recent thing that's happened\nUm she doesn't feel there's been a lot of happenings since we've been in back in Birmingham I've had a couple of instances\nSo they didn't want to come in Alabama\n[laughter] they start in Alabama though I've had a couple of instances where I saw them walk past me there was even a a night a few weeks ago rocks that got out of bed to build a night because I hurt a massive noises coming through out the house and I write investigated you remember that\nIn Illinois I'm ... and like I said this doesn't it's not like every day I wake up nearly hill is Nicholas biases good morning David is just it doesn't work that way it's just you know every once in a while to get really really active um one thing that we noticed over the years is is that\nIf we don't talk about it it gets quiet if we start to bring up the topic is like they have to remind us that they're they're\nUm which is funny because last year when we were going to come on the show I was having a conversation with a ... at at my job and we were standing at this bar and a bunch of bottles from the bars are flying off the shelves and smashing onto the floor\nAnd that was witnessed\nYes that was with us by by co worker um you know I've had a lot of people witnessed a lot of different things um\nWe had a babysitter that oh sauce and stuff\nAnd yeah um our daughter can you guys ... doesn't regret bread stick around recover right back\n\nThe voice for the state of Alabama it's the Michael her show\nHoney that's a beautiful picture but\nDo you make

government Robert Mueller that's what I call it I mean\nNo I don't I don't I I mean let me recant that have I don't remember that Doug Jones said we had to believe all women\nBut he was definitely a part of the moon but that said all women had to be believed\nLet me ask you this we got to get Mr Jones doubt art and twenty twenty can we get you out of retirement we need somebody in the air\nThat leash thanks has a real point of view because Mr Jones they sure does not have my money here world point of view we might disagree on a few things that nobody I think mainly in Congress started seeing it as our point to be much already\nThere there is not a lot of it is it is amazing to me he that a New York downtown New York billionaire\nYeah and he has a better understanding\nOf mine in your view of the world than some of our own elected officials\nIt's pretty sad but you're telling the truth Trump speak hate speech have Trump did it out of the parking on telling you this much out of this may turns this will be the knockout blow for Mueller mark my words Miller's days are numbered it runs Dane and they know if we if Trump can hold onto the house because they don't pick up seats\nOkay Joe blow for Mueller mark my words Miller's days are numbered run stain and they know if we if Trump can hold onto the house because they don't pick up seats in the Senate and he's a good chance that it

G O o bobbing singing the CBS political Paul nursing the Democrats are going to gain control ... yes I Am or do these polls\nWell here's the thing and I was talking to somebody yesterday about it I think you might have been a Robin ... hey here's what's going on historically say over the last hundred years\nA mid term election usually means a beating for the party that was in power for the party and the White House so so when the Republicans should lose a tremendous number of seats in the house that's just the way it almost always happens okay\nSo that that's normal\nThe press this time knowing that most Americans don't really keep up are out there touting losing control of the U.S house of representatives as a reflection owned the president and his policies right that's what they're making it sound like\nHere's what they're not telling people which is why shows like this are so important and it's unfortunate that we're we're moving but I'm actually kind of fired up about moving somewhere else as long as we can keep all our listener family together\nWhat they're not telling us is if the if we barely lose the house\nI Hope happen but um if that happens great but we are going to try to do our best to provide you content through the Internet um as easily as possible and doing a joy how all\nThose things up on a ... a\nA yes or there there's some things out there with terrestrial radio um that will make things easier for people but uh we\nAre going to try to keep the Internet based stuff going also just because you can reach out all over the place but we we ran some numbers there were some numbers ran on online listening for this program six percent of the people that listen online to this program are in Washington DC\nAnd blaming George Eighteen percent or in Atlanta Georgia\nHow about that yeah well I'm\n... what's your what's your own or with all the ... the first ... on the wall to wall all hours\nI Would be on the goal right now is to do with tend to a lab and show over the Internet follow that up with some sort of pod cast so that people could listen to it you know during drive time on their way home and that might pick up some of those folks who say look I Can't listen to you\nBecause of the time of the day but I'm not doing this mid day 'cause I'm a little bit ahead of all the big national\nPick up some of those folks who say look I Can't listen to you because of the time of the day but I'm not doing this mid day because I'm a little bit ahead of all the big national shows and uh but that local southern fire normal person thing just\nKinda fits and I'm not I'm not super serious but I'm not a joke you enough to do a morning show people would be stressed out by the time they got to work yeah you\nHeard a lot of a clown a from a that time of day\nYou got it Mike I appreciate anybody and thanks for letting me know that story it don't make me feel good\nUse as thank you guys for what you've done a pretty good\nYes our take care Bye bye keep on rolling we're going to take them in order thank you for being patient GM welcome to the program thank you for listening\nTo morning how are you\nSomething I hadn't really heard anybody mentioned about the election yesterday as we are definitely dropping three whatever you want to call them turned colder trader or whatever Republican senators\nWere getting rid of some squishy as well I take that back I think squishy was probably too flattering a term for some of these guys and I say I'm ongoing flake is going to be out that's one Corker is going to be out that as to who's the third one\nMcCain oh\nAlready wrote him off [laughter] you miss [laughter] we are and\nYou know really it Marsha Blackburn would be great for Corker for ... year old that recently\nYes uh but I don't even know who's running for the other seats uh I guess there's already one of only for McCain or\nSam Martha ... run into takeover flakes right yeah and um then ah the former the former senator is replacing McCain and I don't think you'll be up for it but the former senator was of course it's not hard to be far more solidly conservative than McCain but but that was a step up instantaneously\nBut but really with those even if a Democrat wins I think would be better off because we know how to make a real count and we wouldn't be waiting for the last minute from what I've turned photos\nAbsolutely Jim I remember I told you about that with some of our problem in the Alabama Legislature we ended up with a super majority but two or three of the Republicans\nReally we're still old Democrats and and one of them was especially ... especially hospital and they had figured out look Republicans don't have the ability to stop a filibuster unless I get what I Want\nA trial because you can't fix something unless I get what I won't so some of them became very expensive so just to just to reform something in government usually ended up costing us something just to do the right thing because you had to uh how do you say you don't want to say\nBy all but um I have the way [noise] [noise]\nWell the the not conforming or not and not backing the Republican agenda or whatever that that in itself weakens the Republican Party 'cause it makes\nIt gives the Democrats something to say we're on we're not organized as we're not the together and we don't really believe in what we're doing and all that stuff right oh\nI remember a time though Jim when it was the conservatives there were so few of us that uh we were the ones quote unquote holding up the agenda cause the the Republican agenda wasn't very conservative so we're making progress we're just not liking it as fast as I won't say\nThat's pretty much that way in the house now\nServe it is so we're making progress we're just not liking it as fast as I won't say\nThat's pretty much that way in the house no\nYeah I don't disagree buy for the call I said what do you have your your given us a positive shiny sunshiny they kind of attitude and I appreciate it\nSo your body and we are getting rid of some of the school is just as good a lifesaver lifesaver welcome to the program thank you for listening\nHey Scott I'm listen first of all want to I got to do things on one side first of all I'm just catch bits and pieces about this stuff that you guys are leaving the station is is everybody leaving 'cause I heard something from I'm Michael hard this morning but I never hear anything come out definitely say that you're kind of like in around\nYeah the station to station format changes next Monday so friday is the end of the end of this talk read this news talk radio station will change the way it does things next Monday so where everybody's on their last two or three days\n... okay well from my perspective that sucks but I'm the other thing I was going to say that you had a guy that was talking about uh CBS and some of the stuff that they were doing it for the Democrats and I happened to notice um I think is Scott\nScott I'm not Scott Kelly but one of the one of the uh their news guys is doing a like a fifty states to or where they're going round and talking about the politics and each one of the states and they\nStart off and they're given like a a little bit of Democrats a little bit of a Republican side but I've noticed that every single one of them they they finish up talking to Democrats and it's almost like they're campaigning for the Democrats\nOh ... my only disagreement would be that is probably not that it's almost like [laughter] okay that you're right they are and um and and that's really\nThe media's goal if you you can't watch much of the mainstream media lifesaver ... it doesn't take long to realize that they lean to the left and they lean to the last very hard and anything they can do to help promote that agenda they're going to ... maybe I\nUsed to think they did and some of them just didn't realize it but it is it is abundantly clear now that they know what they're doing their purposely doing it and they're doing it because they believe\nThey are creating a better world by ushering in socialism and left leaning policies\nYou know it was hard to believe though either on the local stations are doing the same thing and you would think especially like in harmful because of the the the defense department is so big up here ... that kind of tends to to you know ... for the Republican side but even the local stations up here are doing the same thing they're almost didn't exactly the same\nWell I think part of it lifesaver is look at the folks who you know it's not a hundred percent but the people who decide they're going to be engineers and worked for a defense contractor those folks are very\nLogical they think things out there looking at the facts matter to them they tend to lean to the right for that reason\nBut to think about the people you knew if you knew any who said I really want to be a journalist\nAnd never met one\nWell they're not they're not the most conservative even when they start in many of them go into it because they think they want to make the world better many of them are there and it won't be considered intelligence so they get to college and the professors tell them if you're smart you're going to be a left\nBetter many of them are there and it won't be considered intelligence so they get to college and the professors tell them if you're smart you're going to be a leftist I'm\nSo ... they take on this self aggrandizing hey I'm smarter and better I Know how the world out to be I'm a journalist no one appreciates me so they they get the victim hood status right out of the gate\nAnd then they go out in in working this communication world and they give us they feed us what they believe and I think it's just part of a it's not a master plan it's\nJust the type of folks wind up with in journalism for the most part lean to the left because that's their personal disposition\nYeah I I don't think I Would disagree with that is that they think there is a master plan because everybody's moving into too much in in in in conjunction with each other\nI agree I'll give you that when there's people that I talked to do it but just the folks who decide I Want to be a journalist great point lifesaver appreciate your body\nIs they're going to be some way we can or you can put something on your Facebook page about where you guys are going to\nYeah what are you going to be doing yes ... jackets out on Twitter or Facebook which is Scott based show or Scott basin

Guillory Clinton about no I don't disagree with you all the time together liberalism and Darwinism\nAnd racism all rolled up into that same ball which is why they can't be honest about who they are what they believe or why they're condescending et cetera I agree with all that\nBut I still like\nAndrew Jackson [laughter] [noise] but it it's still\nTrue today Scott and just like you referenced Hillary Clinton you know and I was ... it takes a village to uh you know to run your life for you and to care for your child when really it's\nYou and your child you and your family need to raise your child my village and it all stems from the legal system that that whatever reason whether it's you have money or more education for a higher position that the government that somehow makes you better than everybody else and that's just not true\nSal America's population grew but if you were educated like really\nEducated like many of you you spend a tremendous amount of time talking about the great migration oh there were people were all packed in there it was a a town in part of town there was the there was the Irish bar to town and that we're all everybody's treated so bad it's just you know\nBut numbers wise that's not what calls the country to go but you wouldn't know it my kids right now my youngest\nSon he's doing social studies\nA month ago he was doing social studies and they talked about immigrants\nHe's writing a report this week a month later oh the immigrants he's going to have a whole semester\nWhere he'll come out at the end I'm not saying that it shouldn't be taught my wife has been out of shape when I when I get bent out of shape about it\nBut really a whole semester where every other day as immigrants his reporting today as the challenges that immigrants faced\nSo he grows up sees a story like Donald Trump on a ... wants to keep out the caravan chances are of I don't straighten him out it'll be like well ... that's what built America how can we do that I study that you see what I'm saying well\nMaybe there's a lot of people don't even realize that you had to have a sponsor to come over here first and you had to have like if if we made\nIt a whole bunch of a pharmacist or engineers then we let them come over up until sixty four well people don't realize that for decades\nWe pretty much said now we're done\nWrong and we all open it up in sixty four yeah do you follow the the the uh one of the legacies of Ted Kennedy other than you know leaving a girl to die that he should have been ... other than that\nOne of his legacies is\nAll this illegal immigration and immigration and I'll ... I'll still say we ought to go back where you have to have a sponsor if you don't have a sponsor and then if you do something wrong you and the sponsor get in trouble\nThat's not a bad idea I'll go I'll go with merit where we've we need another engineer part of the reason the left doesn't want to go with a merit based\nMigration is there's nobody we need\nRight because a lot of companies don't need to sort out from overseas I mean to me or you know cause users engineer graduating from Alabama or Auburn right now\nRight and you know used to be the uh business if they needed it they was sick you out and then they would sponsor you coming over here right\nNow about it and not any more so remember yesterday I started when the pilot on a talk and now to Paul Paul a ton of saying some of those things different things today we talked about the acts he owes article yesterday that said\nWell may maybe Trump can't do that there was a National Review article that said his chances of being able to do that are less\nThan fifty fifty\nIs that making forty nine fifty one\nCNBC has an article today I Want to I'm going to stop I'm only about one word the headline probably was desire to to read Trump's attack\nAttack listen is Trump's attack on birthright citizenship will hit a constitutional dead end that's what they wanted\nTo say here's what\nEarth right citizenship will hit a constitutional daddy and that's what they wanted to say here's what they actually wrote that you tell me if they\nReally thought if they weren't anywhere close if they were over fifty\nPercent sure that he can't make this stick\nIt would have said what I just read the but it says Trump's attack on birthright citizenship will likely hit a constitutional daddy and\nUh so even the last act CEOs CNBC they're not sure they're not even they're not even sure enough to just claim it's an absolute fact which is never stopped them on other issues\nPresident Trump as a system that a plan to do away with birthright citizenship for children born to non citizens and undocumented immigrants is in the process\nIt can definitely be done with legislation into direct sales but won't use legislation it'll happen with an executive order now the president of the United states clearly has been talking to\nMany legal scholars he tweeted out three hours ago so called birthright citizenship which caused our country billions of dollars and it's very unfair to our citizens will be ended one way or the other\nIt is not covered by the fourteenth amendment because of the words quote subject to the jurisdiction there of\nMany legal scholars agree so we were right right off the bat two minutes and to seeing the first news of that coming out yesterday\nTold you that they were going to be representing the jurisdiction there of\nPrice\nBut at all you know we've got it right I I Do I have lived this I have lived the argument\nAgainst anchor babies I Know what the argument is on the other side unfortunately as I pointed out yesterday many of you many of your kids will be sent to do a report on the issue they'll get on the old inner webs\nThey'll search for it and literally the first two or three pages over results will tell you know that\nIs a that is settled law\nThat's just the way it is that's what you say that's why I encourage you to read the constitution yourself\nFind out what you think some of those phrases Maine and don't forget they were written over two hundred years ago\nAnd we have a limited scope at times on what some of our vocabulary used to me I got to take a
