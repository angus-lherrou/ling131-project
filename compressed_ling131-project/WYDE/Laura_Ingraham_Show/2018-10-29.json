uh yeah yeah well he stole the whole vast thing for me\nOh wow we got this story yeah you know it yeah you know it but this weekend was about a week and whatnot for her over I Can't tell yes yeah yeah it was Robert an album that while you actually wearing all and color Todd today it's kind of harbor and ask yeah yeah ... ...\nHe doesn't have to worry about anything from this past weekend so he can where\nOh is that what it is I don't even a year pushing it though on okay and I\nAm reaching 'cause there's nothing in the news except for the same old junk that\nI mean the well we could I could start my rant about them shutting down uh fourteen months of a a fifty nine downtown down just really frost my whatever's that I don't understand why we can't do better are we actually go to break\nUp with yeah here's what really gripes make several years ago you remember when they burned the tanker burn up and they bark to bridge out on yes if I get one southbound\nWell they let a contract and they gave him what twenty five or thirty thousand dollars a day for everyday they cut off of the estimate of whatever it was originally nine months or something like that and they finished it thirty days\nWhy can't they can't governor ivy and the more on this running al ... come up with the same contract on this puppy\nThat they're talking fourteen months of shutting down downtown Birmingham I it's absolutely ridiculous in my brain to take and then on top of it they just now started the public hearings\nSaid well I have known this for a year that I hadn't have you have you actually had coming south or coming north from the south and had to exit on seventeenth street or you're going to the courthouse\nThe I don't have you have you actually had coming south or coming north from the south and had to exit on seventeenth street you're going to the courthouse now you exit basically around third avenue nor I haven't you drive for like four miles on the ramp\nThat takes you all wherever the seven why not just closed down seventeenth street I mean it is closed down when I'm not talking about the extra time at the whole strike the whole category because now we've got a ... worth of exit ramp to make its way over the ... around malfunctioned junction\nWell we're going to get a lot of that apparently I think you're right and and I you know I I worked back on when a gym Folsom was governor we had a little incident that ... had down in Montgomery where\nA before Nineteen eighty eight and a regular came in which said you know has or all the hazards materials and stuff\nAll the chemicals that they use to test the asphalt well when you got done with that you throw it out the back door well it was a carcinogen and it was a thinker well we had four hundred and fifty houses with contaminated groundwater on them I brought me in a in a living\nWell the first thing we did is set up libraries where we put all the information and we had press conferences I had press conferences and for the first three months and after that they wouldn't even show up I mean we we named him out we put him to sleep\nAnd there's a way to handle that but you have to let the public know what's going on and I don't understand with an organization as big as Albert why they couldn't have started to six months ago to get the public's input into let us know what's gonna happen\nAnd to tell us why they can't let the same kind of contract that they did on the sixty five south bridge I mean it just makes no sense to me it has to and I wonder how many small businesses\nAre going to go out of business if they do shut this down for fourteen months that's the real crying shame there because you know they're going to hurt downtown business\nWell on top of that Bob there's really no alternative route if you if you live in Atlanta and they closed down part of eighty five or Seventy five you have an option going to Birmingham you really don't know it all goes through malfunction Joan yeah\nEverything and I got to figure like coming here when I come from North and beautiful downtown Argo, Alabama I Would have to go all the way on four fifty nine down to sixty five and come back up sixty five to get off on green springs yeah\nNow that not only is the gas mileage horrible but I mean that's another thirty forty minutes though ... and they'll give the traffic they're going to put on on four fifty nine now which is you know during the crushes pretty horrible\nIt's going to even get worse so I don't understand why where al ... is with this or\nIs it just strictly a matter of money and it's our money is what I'm understanding well it's got Jefferson County sewer written all over it or don't even get me started [noise]\n'cause if you look at the progress are making the Shelby County or sixty five north and south down it's amazing compared to what's going on Jeff county because Jeff can't malfunction junction they've been working on that since I was in grade school mhm\nAnd Shelby County that area of sixty five they started at what July of this year and they're almost already paid through our pastor Wright almost ready to open it\nI have to go to clear to my dentist down there and I looked at the amazing profit ... progress that they've made making it what's going to be four lanes now and both sides north and south explains\nOr know there'll be three lanes on both I thought it was okay maybe this three may maybe it might be widen before but most areas it's as big as three they\nBeen hunk I mean they've been moving and grew in on it and I don't have a I mean I understand that this is more complicated because they've got the bridge structures and all that kind of business but to me there's they should have been an easier way to do this and shut it down for fourteen\nAnd uh I mean I understand that this is more complicated because they've got the bridge structures and all that kind of business with him either they should have been in either way to do this and shut it down for fourteen months just like\nIt's going to be that proverbial cluster hey Bob Norcross hanging out weather's James inherit ... going to be ... secretary scarred six six five five one died three three come right back\nIt's not right versus left it's us versus them the Michael hearts show\nThe following it does not necessarily reflect the opinions or views have proper broadcasting its employees affiliates or advertisers mom room\nThat's what's on the line and this year's elections this is just as Tom Parker you also how the leftist mob stride to tear down just says capping off\nThey want me to be next after for Thirteen Years on the Alabama Supreme Court has a strong but independent conservative voice has taken on and beat in the Southern Poverty Law Center and been outspoken that roe v Wade and he'll bergenfield were wrongly decided\nAnd I'm a strong supporter of President Trump and his efforts to put more conservatives on our federal courts the leftist mob doesn't like that\nThey want judges who will overturn our laws and look the other way when the leftist mob tries to destroy our society this is justice Tom

I Know you I recognize your voice and I'm like well that goes I listen to you all the time\nAnd I just would tell you how what a wonderful job you do and how much we appreciate everything you do and I always say people's hands I asked and their name and I would say the guy's hand and before I could say where he goes it's a real pleasure to meet you Mr Ramsey [laughter]\n\nYeah they sank you uh-huh yeah I mean I have another yeah and matter of fact it happened again one day last week I was that day if you do the I had his\nWater proven company album and water and I am actually is a a local big box store purchasing some stuff for this project we're working on\nGuys the counter does the exact same thing and he goes I Can't believe it I listen to you every single day thank you so much as another guy behind the counter well who is this is the talk radio host I was telling you about you ought to listen to him and they refer to me as a host from another station I'm and I just went to um\nNice to meet you guys I just kind of walked out backwards [laughter]\nListen debate Morrow huh yea which they should have you on a yeah be our five for nine six AM check it out\nTo be ... but he did go on Facebook and correct himself\nYeah see he's innocent naive as he did but next time\nSomeone says you know hey you're Dave Ramsey just say you know\nWhat you know I did the um debt free you know ... ... a pleasure\nYou know you start screaming I'm debt free and just make sure you reenter everybody started eating beans and rice\nYeah being ... and ... yeah I Love red beans and rice so basically if you cook them what connects sausage thing and I think you know that's an Alabama marvel for those that are familiar with it but if you haven't tried connected to smoke a neck a sausage with your red beans and rice you're missing a really good meal from the south\nHad the sauces last week fans the beans just slap it on a blond and blue yeah just\nAbout anything and ... and there's a local um eating establishment they have a whole bunch of franchise places all over um\nRuns with ... and they have connections can save more lives on the air well they're not sponsor but OK mile is you know the great sweet tea that you buy at the grocery stores where they have connections sausage disc It's MORNING\nAnd I sent them a a message on Twitter so when are you going to start selling connecting sauces hotdogs\nAnd sore and they're actually in the process of doing kitchen studies with those they measured me back and said we're actually in the process of doing kitchen studies with those making small dogs with them and just regular ... ... on\nLabor Day weekend that was set in chains a mall or go get some gasoline [noise]\nMan\nYears later on a Sam downed plane I was down\nHey rocking back [noise]\nGot about a thirty minutes to go\nAt least air time wise [noise]\nFive Norcross hanging out with us is run down the hallway to get some coffee James was floated around here as well [noise] gift guide six six five five one\nNine nine three three Dylan sang it out the board so many things as well and we just don't\nReally want to talk about a whole heck of a lot there's obviously the the news is a pretty similar to a war that has been over the course of the last multiple weeks all sort of ... Anthony Scaramucci who popped or by earlier today talk to us about his brand new book about how blue collar\nDonald Trump really is and we're going to probably replay if you did not hear that particular interview may very well replay it tomorrow because he has some fascinating insights about the uh the history and the life and times of Donald Trump so perhaps we'll get back into that a tomorrow replay it\nYou have a whole bunch of the fires from ... throughout the course of the week\nAs they're either listen to us for a long period of time remember Steve ... he'll be with us on friday as well Dr gene allowed ... rabbi Eric Walker be joining us on Wednesdays program\nMegan ... and Dan Walsh or be this on Thursday so we've just got a whole bunch of folks that we've been hanging out with on the air for the last several years\nIt'd be popping by and just a ... or gambling us with a um just whatever's on their minds are gift guide sixty five five one nine nine three three and\nA we'll talk about whatever is on your mind but as I as I stated and James who said earlier it's pretty much just the same old same old the Trump hating and hopefully hopefully\nWe're we're going to see next Wednesday is somewhat of a camping down some of the rhetoric kind of post Kavanaugh because after the confirmation you realize how quickly so much of that went away\nDo you think it really will go away though 'cause I have a feeling that regardless of the outcome of the the midterms whether the house has taken over by whichever party takes it\nI don't think the rhetoric from ... it's going I think you really I think it's going to amp up\nI don't think it'll end entirely but you know I Would imagine that some of these folks are just gonna have to be compelled to take a break because it's not getting them anywhere and go ahead I'm\nSorry to say you would think they would but they haven't since two thousand and sixteen\nI Know but how but hurt can you be entirely very apparently\nI guess I guess I mean\nWell I think they figure out the worst day ours is the more campaign contributions well you have to think about the people that contribute to their their definitely move into money Bob there's no doubt about it and look\nAt a veto Rourke out in ah Texas\nHe he's down in almost every poll you look at except for their own internal one that they do and they're spouting out that their neck and neck you know they're they're tied with Ted Cruz and the polls so send them more money there already his campaign of loans already over eighty million dollars in donations\nSo and it's what I'm saying I I mean I think they ... and and I don't trust any of the polls anymore no I don't need I mean I think they've been weaponized just like the uh\nABC federal agencies if it I mean I just [noise] it's why I don't trust anything I hear anymore on some of it's everything and I I like that word that they started using weaponize these that right well you know\nBut none of it's funny everything and I I like that word that they've started using weaponize these that right\nWell you know it's just like out in California you know they've spent over three hundred thousand dollars to register illegals\nAnd as of right now this morning airtime is more than forty nine people have registered to vote in ... in San Francisco proper so they spent sixty three hundred and some change per voter\nI just don't know these folks are going to show up I Know they're making noise but I just don't know that they're going to show up\nBut isn't that just for a local school board election\nIt it is yeah it is but but look at it looked like it you know at at our our ... so he's got all this money first of all if the guy's a clown right and you know the the fact of the matter is so many of the people showed up at his rallies they're kinda reminiscent of the feminist marches where you see you know certain body parts on top of people's heads\nAnd I just don't know how committed the process that they are so hopefully and I'm not really expecting a a a mid term mandate but I Would like to think if we're going to get one that may be at least temporarily some of these folks from just shut up\nNow I understand your position James and I can't say that I disagree with you but my gosh I mean doesn't there come a point in time where where you just cut bait and just get on with your life or has not become their life\nYou mean the politicians know and some of the voters voters\n... well ... and let's go back to the early ... earlier call was scare moody and several times that was mentioned the blue collar guys right let's talk about the blue collar guys\nThat's your HVAC guys that your mechanics that you're welders now those are Thirteen dollar an hour people\nThose are guys that like when's the last time you hired an electrician marijuana okay are you hired a plumber those are the blue collar guys now those guys by the most part are pretty fairly intelligent people they're not what the Democrats make the blue collar people out to be I Know\nThey they have under estimate what blue collar is from the Democrats don't I don't agree with that because in their viewpoint blue collar as the guy dropping fries at the fast food joint\nAnd you know it's like you know ... and James I talked about this you know my mom who's out you know she's a married do it you know an ex New York cop but she was for many many many years involved with this guy's name was south south died of cancer some years ago but ... was\nConnected connected but he also happen to have been a stone Mason by trade and he brought a lot of the swimming pool so at least a decade around the swimming pools for some of these\nGoodfellas and he used to always say to me Michael the money's into labor the money's no labor Sal but was that was working and people think I kid about this I'm Serious Bob\nFifteen Years ago this guy charged four hundred dollars an hour to be in your yard working on your poll\nAnd you're absolutely right and you've got diesel mechanics out there making a buck fifty a year and you've got a you know plumbers and you know even even in in the water business if somebody has a specialty trade there's an enormous amount of revenue and profitability and a lot of these contractor type businesses and these people aren't stupid\nNo they run businesses and they know profit and loss I mean that's and that's part of the appeal but that Trump has had to people whether you find them a noxious they're not the guy has made a ton of money he does know how to run a business\nWell let's just let's just you know let's just touch with a quick here is Donald Trump by our definition is the noxious I say yes\nWho in my life isn't but then again I\nIs Donald Trump by our definition is the noxious I say yes\nBut who in my life isn't but then again that's kind of\nBut it but it was kind of what we voted for you know just was so funny is that the liberals Ron Ronald scream and see we told you he was wiped it and we keep saying she we know that\nBut most of the people I Know that like you say the same thing that he did a little lame circumstances if you get them in a cocktail party and do martinis in and they're going to say exactly the same thing drop which we\nWell I'm not one of those kind of folks that doesn't get out every once in a while you know I'm not above you know going out and test not a brand new craft beer every once in a while because that's just the way our roles are swimming but the times I've been out and listen to people talk their talking well gosh exactly and I mean the majority of them are ...\nWell the one of the things is I don't think it's going to ... on the left because all these people follow the politicians are quote unquote politicians and the people the movers and shakers in the Democratic party so they follow him on Twitter they follow them on Facebook ... Snapchat\nSo they all all these people so when the elections are over there not going to\nHave our own record is salt on their senses is not going to end after the election 'cause all these political candidates and all these Democrats for Heathrow in the same junk out there\nSo I don't know I mean there's a few of them and in the years that I've spent with some of those guys are a when I was running the circuits and in in DC uh\nYou know there were some good ones in there and there was some real rotten apples in there but\nIt but don't you get frustrated with the fact of the good ones seem to get drowned out and I think it might be part of the reason that Trump is the way he is\nWell I I think what happens to most of them is they leave they don't run again and it it it's what Gary said he's not planning on running again after this election cycle and not trained to believe him I think in some of them that I've known from\nVarious states in Mississippi in Georgia because of you know I primarily did that dealt with states in the south east\nThe good ones only last a couple of terms and then they're gone I mean they've got other businesses and I I from private conversations some of them really get disgusted with what they have to deal with to get anything done right I mean how could they not I mean\nI was glad to get out of it when I retired that I didn't have to deal with it anymore because some of these meetings that I used to have with some of these politicians I really wanted the first thing I wanted to do is not going to get a shot at ground I just wanted to go get a shower\nWell it goes back to what you're talking about earlier like a you know even malfunction junction\nWe know and and all the wrangling and that goes on behind the scenes and Hi you're not getting anything done but in the meantime you know you've got a little bit of worn out their donning her head dress and and you know Maxine Waters run around screaming impeachment and you know Booker dawned on me I Am Spartacus ... and I'm just going to get ... comical is the well\nAnd and what their face what's the one where's the grindstone cowboy hat ah Rick Wilson ... Wilson\n[laughter] I mean seriously people that there is no dignity and some of that at all I mean [laughter] I just don't understand because that is truly theater yeah\nI mean when you look at that and I will say that particular as a cartoon character yeah I ... and every time I see her on TV I just go how could anybody who see themselves on the news at night and not go I Am a liberal buffoon\nRegardless of the rhetoric I mean why would you dress like that I just I'm Sorry I just\nWell you know every once in a while I'll do something crazy about red cowboy boots raw where am I my pays way sport that I bought but I Do that you know to kind of\nI don't know generate buzz of your way out to be funny or whatever the case may be but the case of Wilson she's got a collection of those hats she wears that every single day and how do you can't pay with a straight face like that\nWell you know we have one here in Alabama that has a ... that matches all of his outfits including his leather outfit and when he goes out to eat he breaks out his ...\n\n[noise] oh yeah let me tell you so it it it we have it locally too\nWell [noise] I've I've seen some interesting jackets on are are good buddy there are a state auditors well\nYeah so yeah yeah and you know I enjoy that sort of thing if it's not [laughter] if they're not representing\nSo yeah yeah and you know I enjoy that sort of thing if it's not [laughter]\nIf they're not representing me as a you know if it if it's at a private cocktail party or a barbeque that's fine but when you represent yourself in public as a as a servant of the people it really makes me wonder about where you're coming from and how you look at things and I know I Know\nWell it's unbelievably silly tomorrow whether it's a one week out from the midterms will have an idea obviously you know will be going most of those races\nAre y'all gonna stay in late to call in either I\nI I don't know what I don't know what we're doing I I don't know what we're going to be doing so anyway I Will you know will definitely keep an eye on and I know that I'm going to be on the D. J. C. side of things on Wednesday trying to break down whatever the results end up being\nAnd I you know I'm just hoping that we're able to break down all the results you know over there because you know there's so many races out there that are I I'm just praying for example a recall in Texas\nWell I think they're going to be a ... a a a raft of Chad recalls yet what I'm looking for the ... there's there's going to be lawsuits on almost every one of them especially the Senate races no I\nI think that's going to be the case because you're you're gonna you cannot go through this election cycle without the famed outrage from the lap regardless of what the outcome is going to be because even if some of them when they didn't win enough but they were going to have the accusations of voter fraud\nAnd ballot tampering somebody's gonna have to bring Russian collusion into this at some point in time and so I was going to be very easy to see how it plays out but then at the same time the nation's business does not get conducted\nWell it hasn't been being conducted for a long time but that's part of the problem of why we're as we were talking about earlier why Trump look so good because ... years nothing was getting done\nThat actually was not alright last break of the hour we're going to get back on the other side will take a caller to Bob Norcross hanging out with this were a bit longer you all stick around you're listening to the Michael ...\nWhat are you in the room Nick Saban even stands up it's the Michael ...\nSays talk radio has just stick to just the way you can find out about what's coming up what's going on or what do you miss my following at one oh one super station all these would've forcibly go to Facebook dot com answer for super station\nWhy why do you can take us wherever you go to the super station one on one hand it's like having your own personal news anchor in Norfolk\nThat's not creepy and on\nYour home town got an countries they should get super station one on one building Whitey [noise]\nEverybody to join us on Friday nights from nine until midnight on the best in high school football school [noise]\nWe'll have special get coaches interviews and take your calls and get you ready for your college football Saturday\nWhite here on your high school football leader in all of Alabama\nPatriotism means to stand by the country [noise] it does not mean to stand by the president or any other public officials [noise] Theodore Roosevelt [noise] your your home town got an countries ... super station one on one\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n...

P. D. that's the Social Democrats they have been able to come together see what is what I'm saying big guy so the left in the right these\nTwo main political parties one claims to be somewhat conservative the other ones because I used to be just some wild liberal\nEven though they're most both count liberal and they have this\nUnholy alliance and they can agree on one thing keeping all the other voices\nOut of political power\nSo they have this establishment which would be Iraq Washington Republicans in Washington Democrats who might pretend like they're fighting each other and a fake wrestling match\nAnd as long as they keep\nEverybody else out of power always good with the world\n\nWhat I Want you to note is even in Germany\nThey have the same\nKind of stuff going on that we did with the very very top we've talked about how in Washington DC it seems like the same people and the same policies in the same things happen no matter which side's in charge\nAnd like the same people and the same policies in the same things happen\nNo matter which side's in charge\nAnd that's what they're doing in Germany that's what we do here\nRank and file probably doesn't really think about it they're like we're we're for our stuff and we're we're opposed to the folks on the left and the left as opposed to the people in the rye\nBut at the very very top they just keep it the same why do you think we can't build a wall on the border Republicans are in charge\nThey were able to pass tax cuts which I'm for which I exam didn't think was a great policy\nThey can do some things you don't think these people hang out together I was hoping that coalition will be broken up because of some of the way they act to during the cabinet but we'll see bill welcome to the program thank you for listening\nHey thanks for having me out Scott or you know so many points about Germany I agree with some of your points I don't agree with I call right to me that the problem is Merkel\nOr either the parties that's in power the problem and if they say European problem as opposed to a German problem is the European Union because Germany as far as a people and there are these me yeah they've made some level of appeasement but the takeover and the invasion is not just limited to Germany\nThat's correct you have you know swayed in his last angle on this last span is on the verge of being lost in a way it was almost lost until this last election but they finally have a conservative was standing up for the Italian citizen\nCorrect you recall from Hungary posing hole and I can't see you yeah and\nYou don't do them Belgium is completely fall and I mean Belgium and the Netflix is caught in that regard so the thing with Merkel is she was the grant catalyst after Philip tater for what was the use plan\nTo allow Arab invasion of the European continent that is true so you know what\nWhat what the party over there are just picked up by by what was Merkel pretty much stronger harming everybody because in spite of assistance or whatever nothing ever went that way they open their borders to millions of people with no vetting\nAnd now you have what what you're seeing what looks like a backlash politically just like you had in Italy you know we're we're we're we're almost in invaded ourselves at Hillary one we're on that in that line of of you know and I don't mean to be so are you calling me bigoted I guess what I mean well you know\nInnovation invasion that's what it looks like a closer look like on the order now when we were opening our borders from a pilot's allow hundreds of thousands of Muslims from Arab nations to just come into the country that looks like an invasion to me that's what's happening when they're staying sure what you that in Germany\nI agree about my only argument bill would be that Germany I won't say runs the you but but they carry the biggest stick in the ... because they have\nThey are the financial backing the largest contribution to me that's because yeah as an industrial\nNation they're the most industrious of all the European nations to compete with China and the United states if you want to say you're talk on the world well Germany is one of your top court so that's why they have more sway but that\nBecause of that they've been more encouraged and instead of eyes I mean they actually they were going to get away with the gas they have stopped buying their gas from Russia so Trump for that and now that's all you know just in upheaval\nWho got at the gas much like Bill thank you appreciate it you're in a great point I just\nOh that oh you know just end up evil gotta get much like bell thank you\nAppreciate your great points I just think ah Germany died in ... you know real strong with you I I don't I think if Germany had said no\nWe're not we're not doing this Margaret thing I think the whole year you would have leaned more that way because they do carry the money bags we'll\nBe right back [noise]\nYou're listening to ...

but back to what our last caller was mentioning Marsha Blackburn\nWas having a campaign event on Sunday in Tennessee she took the stage to speak to the crowd there were hundreds of people there and she was interrupted multiple times by protesters now\nEach time she was interrupted her supporters drowned out the crowd by chanting usa usa usa so you couldn't hear the protesters but the part that got everybody upset when she called for a moment of silence\nFor the victims of the synagogue massacre in Pittsburgh\n\nWhile they're trying to have the moment of silence\n\nProtesters were screaming\nOut that Marsha Blackburn is a white supremacist\nAnd you can watch it if you want to watch it on TV you can watch it you can go to you to go to the Daily Caller she said I've never heard of people interrupting a moment of silence so they can have a protest Blackburn do W T the F I think it's despicable\nI'm okay with that term to so let's get it straight we are deplorable but these folks are absolutely despicable\nSo why Marsha Blackburn is saying let's have a moment of silence for American victims who happened to be Jewish\n\nThe protestors are shouting that she is a white supremacy\n\nWhose side are we going to be own in this craziness and the civil war that is this cultural civil war that we're having right now before that we talked about Donald Trump Donald Trump\nOr that is just cultural civil war that we're having right now before that we talked about Donald Trump Donald Trump\nWas speaking at the turning point USA's young black Leadership Conference is a three day event for young conservative black leaders between the ages of Fifteen and thirty five\nSo Trump speak to that group\nAnd like the caller said crickets\nNow have Donald Trump was such a horrible racist person why would he speak to the young black leadership summit\nOh I Know you want to know why the left\nYou know one of the last things that Donald Trump is tricking everybody\nBecause that's the way they operate we saw the\nDemocrat US Senate candidate in Tennessee his staffers saying president is president reticent his staffers saying that he ... he really would not have voted to confirm Kavanaugh he was just saying that\n\nFor the sake of some moderate Republicans who might really want to vote for him then we get Claire McCaskill's where she's really\nSecond Amendment\nAnti gun rights\nBut you can't say that she has these hey look these anti gun groups they know where I Am they know where she is see they spent a tremendous amount of time telling groups one thing and not really being\nFor it so in their world Donald Trump can't really\nBe for young black leadership he can't really be for\nA bright future opportunity prosperity for brown people people of color he can be\nHe surely he's just telling them that like like we do\nDo you understand you get what I'm saying\nI think that is part of the problem\nIs that so many of our elected officials all the way up to some of them on the ... do the same thing I I I've heard it before some of those some of those guys in in Montgomery, Alabama or Washington DC that you think are solidly for the second amendment\nSolidly pro life behind\nClosed doors\nThey just said things like look it's just what I what I tell the people that sort of the people want to hear that how can we how can we make it look like me the candidate me the office holder\nOr that I'm for this but that's not really ever pass it into all\nWe're going to have one day this week big Dave we're going to do so you don't no one wants to miss this week we're going to go over the constitutional amendments that are going to be on the ballot for next Tuesday right we may do that tomorrow and the very first one is a great example\nNo matter where you are on that piece of legislation mhm you will get a glimpse of the kind of shenanigans they go on in Montgomery and Washington all the time because that constitutional amendment\nIs something we should probably support I'm just going to tell you if I had been in the legislature\nThat constitutional amendment is something we should probably support I'm just going to tell you if I had been in the legislature that constitutional amendment would either not me on the ballot\nOr would have been altered because it's something we should support we supported as a people\nBut I think it's got a poison pill will put in it that that the monkeys with the very nature of what we're trying to say and then we have a question of\nHow does it look if we reject it\nSo you you don't want to miss that but let's just go ahead and say we're going to do that tomorrow would you remind me do it so we all do or or\nSome ... journey to ... it was only ... ...\nIf that might go\nOh yeah ... ...
