B. C. course she's walking out with a a a a package worth ... million you know it it's so funny at that level of the brass\nYou get can and you make more money being fired than the average American were making five lifetimes but with that said\nShe's out over her blackface\nRight thoughts I don't think she should have been fired um I think she should have I think she knew better I think she knew her ratings will slipping\nI'm and she knows that anytime you do anything with race or religion as the season journalism ... years\nThat it was ... controversy I don't think you think will spark this kind of controversy so her naivete what she's saying that you know I didn't know any better yes they make you know she had the conversation with a worse than me\nI'm Joan ... daughter Melissa Rivers and it was another dude on there and you had to go into it and it was kind of pushing back on a little bit um ... mate and kill is known for the controversy city of Los or die for it no NBC News ... ratings and they use that to get her out of there and so when you seem to win it\nSo John forte know NBC or knew she was living in ratings and they use that\nTo get her out of there and so when you seen as when an intimacy to see see all of the company going other shows and posted on social media you talking about you know we don't tolerate this or anything like that you know your writings on the wall you're not going to get suspended you buddy get can right when they will have nothing right now\nHe put that out there because there's something to her contract that can you know come back and say well we don't have to pay you this because of this is this and this and so that's why the company the corporation came out against her so she's going to get a lot of money of course but she ain't gonna get the public thinks that she's going to be to get\nSo how offensive would people in the black community find that very the actual okay while you're there [laughter]\nBecause here's the thing Michael you you are a historian and you taught me a lot of things by a lot about yesterday I did not know myself personally\nBlackface okay we're not talking about putting on makeup and things like that when you say the word black face it has a really bad come to um I I really bad member for a lot of people\nIf we ever forget that we are one nation under God will be\nProved torso\nSuper station mono one [noise] do you want to do [noise]\nMiles was more than we\nMy heart and soul and the\nNa na while running a\nYeah\nAh by a man\nWe've got more white bombs everybody's getting them I saw\nA lock and hanging out with us let's go straight to the pros and we'll start with Mark Mark how are you [noise]\nI tried again Clark you're breaking up on me [noise]\nWhen you hear me now they are [noise]\nAll right so\nDo you remember back before Vince McMahon solidified and made wrestling national and they're all the different little regional organizations\nOh yeah channel forty two rats way that you miss auditorium in Birmingham, Alabama\nThere you go so I'm watching it down in Florida watching end up with Gordon slowly now what what happened did you have a rest more show up\nAnd he'd be a ... he'll when he appeared and you know he tour your area for what six months a year and then he would move to another alliance for some period of time\nBut then maybe a year or two later he shows back up in your area used to be a good got when he comes back he's a bad guy can\nYou remember that yeah yeah\nOkay All right now you know I think we tend to believe that are concerned that the the wonder or who they portray themselves to be on TV\nBut I got to wonder if they're not just actors who portray different characters depending on what ... and all\nThat is not an accurate statement at all ...\nWill you'll get Paula's on all the time oh yeah oh yeah\nOh she puts it she was the original box and fall and you know she was conservative when she was at fault she left boxing I 'cause I didn't watch it I'm not sure I think it was CNN she went to\nThe time or to us all we're no longer is on the CNN poll is on Alison camera road when she was on she was very conservative\nPaul is on the CNN poll is on Alison camera Rhoda when she was on Fox she was very conservative she goes to whatever it is I see her on every now and then now I see clips of it on the blog stuff\nAnd uh she's not Allison camera was on Fox and I you know I kinda got to wonder\nIf we didn't describe Megan Kelly is being right of center when she was at Fox and uh\nYou know she needed a new persona search she created one for a time then\nNo I got I think that's a very astute observation you know even looking at people like Glenn Beck you know when back was on CNN he wasn't a liberal but he was definitely more of a centrist and all of a sudden you know he goes almost all Breitbart\nYeah so I don't know I I mean you know\nBut you know of course I don't know how much of the program you've been listening to today\nBut in the first hour I made the observation and and I am poor people to to to you know take what I say and you know use it as a part of their decision making mix\nBut to do your own research and don't take with Joe says or Dylan or Janes or anybody for that matter at a hundred percent face value you need to learn it for yourself\nBecause if you if you do rely solely on may you're getting my opinion I think my opinions right and I always defend my opinion because you know this is not the tricks for me people that have met me in person say that I'm pretty much the same guy in person\nBut I Am on the air but at the end of the day that the reality of it is it is still in my opinion and so in in the case of you know doing your due diligence and gathering your news you need to go to multiple sources for exactly the reason you just described\nWell I think that one of the principal difference as to me between talk radio and what we get from television\nIs for the most part the people that we listen to on TALK radio or the people that were listening to whereas on television for the most part the people you're watching or the people that are portraying themselves to be does that make sense\nYeah it does oh I I mean you know now I don't know maybe like the people on TALK radio need to wise up and be somebody else and get a bigger audience on TV I don't know\nWhere you and I we've talked with us also as I think a lot of people are not aware of the fact and we have never done this by the way but a lot of radio programs in particular they will use what are called the callers\nAnd see color or somebody that calls for the purposes of starting an argument or bringing up a point that the host doesn't feel comfortable bringing up and there are organizations out there that rent these seed callers for a hundred and fifty two hundred dollars per call\nAnd you know a lot of the big time talkers on radio were found to have been guilty of employing these tactics and strategy is to create a certain delusion within the show itself which is why I had been preaching for years Clark and I know you've heard me that that media that journalism it's an entertainment industry\nAnd yeah\nAnd people don't realize that you know you've got to have advertisers you've got to do what you gotta do to attract those audience is now we don't do that here but that's because of my personal beliefs that's my personal integrity in character come into play and not the way the industry has managed\nWell you know what you're calling a seat color is what I Would have called a shell back when they had medicine shows or a straw all you know it's\nPretty much the same thing and I don't know you know if you look on the national talk Radio's stage you know Rush Limbaugh will be the first\nPretty much the same thing and I don't know you know if you look on the national talk radio stage you know Rush Limbaugh will be the first one to tell you I think that you know he's all about being an entertainer\nBut he needs to use the entertainment to capture the audience so he can get the message out he wants to get out oh and I don't know you know I haven't listened to him as several years ever since ... came up with yellow hammer in the middle of the day but uh\nYou know he was a master of the um and you know and he did you know he made the show entertaining\nWell weren't ticket to do our churches for just a moment\nYou know we've we've talked over the years how a lot of the preaching has become watered down and you've got you know big bands and stage productions and lights and and and fancy graphics all this to make it more appealing to get people into the venue so that the message can be delivered\nOn a on a an you know it's the best thing is is I think that it might have been successful for some period of time but after a while the the attraction of the glitz wears off and uh\nYou know if you're not properly going through the Bible with folks you start losing folks in or you know it's one of those short term things that ended up in long term detrimental\n... court a very good call gotta go regions are very much\nTake care of you to let's get Christina in heroic recovery Christina how're you\nDoing great how are you good ah thanks\nFor taking my call I just wanted to respond to um to what Joe Lockett was talking about and um I I agree wholeheartedly you know art of what's going on in our country with all of our race issues I think it's important to remember that the Jim Crow era\nWas just not that long ago it really wasn't there are many people\nAlive on the planet today who remember that era wall and who experience that era firsthand and so um I think that that I I I agree with him wholeheartedly\nOn the white person on and I can't even imagine what it must have been like raising children and that era\nAs well as today um I mean I I have boys on the mother of four boys\nAnd I don't have to have the conversations with my boys that\nI I think from talking with black people that I Know and hearing a you know ah just talk about it I don't have to have the same conversations with my teenage boys\nAnd we're in ... you're in defending a king or a kingdom which I find really shocking for a you know an air to the John heart a legacy when did I defend the king or a kingdom\nWell I mean if you're I mean it sounds like your soft on on king the sprints guy but ... if you're not I hope you\n\nDon't make stuff up on my radio program\nDid I defend a king or a kingdom nothing my mom is\nA good actor I think you ask him a question\nI mean I I just love how people just kinda go off the rails on me there I I have no idea yet\nAgain what that phone call was even all about and the arrest of eight hundred princes and all the other kinds of things that we find out there on the dark Web to give us the illusion that we know what's going on in the world around us and our Donald Trump is afraid of a brand because of the brands presumably how journalists\nWere headed okay well let's just get out of the farms and good grief I'm stupid or for that hello Michael how are you\nHey good morning let's make it clear real quick I don't care about ... or ... or whatever his name is ... and I don't really care about making Kelly I just call and make sure I can get by Joe oh they're yes I'm here\nOkay Joe I gotta make sure I'm I'm not doing something wrong there was a Saturday Night live skit some years ago with Eddie Murphy were dressed up as a white person ... man that was on the is good I thought it was so funny and and I know I so I'm white there might supposed to take offense to that now\nDressed up as a white person and that was on the is it I thought it was so funny mhm and I am so I'm why am I supposed to take offense to that now\nDo you find that offensive and ... oh no I didn't I okay that that's the issue and then it out to the fans that are going\nTo do so there's older movie there's a Gene Wilder ... silver string ... in a in that movie but blacks based on so you get on on a train that was funny too mhm and then on the other point a Perry dress up as a black woman should black women be offended by that\nBlack women I find that funny at a movie called white shape but but\nJim at this point I mean but he ... he's he's he's he's baiting ... ... email ... to me but the point that he's trying to make you the people who say they find it offensive right if I'm Talking about your family or your ... your your your friends or something and you tell me you find that offensive whether I Do or not is offensive ...\nLet's let's let's just go back to let's introduce some intellect and do this with him or her review of color obviously of knocked off the story of and I'm going to be polite about it in the movie Blazing Saddles ... clean our little\nUh you know also another dog ... or ... funny movie ... but they use the N word right and there is\nThat movie owns stereotyping it does but I think it's also important to realize that and I don't want to draw a\nMe too movement aspect into this and but there was years and years and years ago where if a woman felt like she was assaulted she didn't speak up because you think should be taken seriously and cetera et cetera and I'm not going capital here simply make it a point\nIn the past kinda stay with the theme of laziness adults and some of the very hyper stereotypes are in that movie there was a time in this country where certain groups or there'll be black or women or whatever didn't feel like they could speak up\nBecause you know Blazing Saddles was done in a time that was relatively close to the civil rights era my closest to that and so now ... and people didn't feel emboldened as though there was the protections\nOf the courts or even society or community although somebody might see us get back in the day that was funny\nAnd a lot of them quite frankly we're ... but the reality of it is you grow up you mature you realize that maybe that wasn't quite as funny as we thought it was ... TV programs like uh all in the family it doesn't get made today\nNow I Do understand the previous caller was trying to make a point why is it offensive now when it wasn't offensive then but here's the deal we don't know that it was an offensive then we just know that people didn't speak up about a possibly being offensive then for the possibility of some kind of backlash whether it be in their career in the movies or just the right there would be perceived in public\nAnd I think a lot of people have to realize to know that making killer was using that for ratings and NBC use the racism car too far but the real conversation still has not been hey you know why was that so offensive\nMaking kill it did their own Halloween no one can say didn't tell me why making killer we bring our blackface on Halloween makes no sense\nShe sees on NBC family show she can talk about anything else but she bought about something about race in Halloween it was raining it was the these insects and lives mostly wanted to get an NBC fired her because she use um the the race car right and so NBC use race go too far\nSo race is being played throughout the nation and it's still being made light of and people are tired of hearing about it but people in our ... at the end of day at the end of the day that race is a serious issue\nOf the nation and it's still being made light of and people are tired of hearing about it but people in our ... at the end of ... at the end of the day that\nRace is a serious issue black folks should make light of like we do and white folks should make light of like they do on both sides raises a serious issue and neither side is taking this through the need to be\nWell it's also worth noting that are because we laugh at something doesn't make it\nFunny and it just speaks to our character hello Jim how are you\n...

with us and the very first question I have four Megan today is\nMegan or use a bomber\nNow in the bomber I Know how to spell Florida\n[laughter] so that that gives me away\nYeah and you probably know how to put the right ... right about opposed to join the ... despite the fact presumably some of them are delivered by carrier so what do you make of all this Megan\nWell there are a bunch of fake bombs much like fake news and you know I don't know who did this I don't know what type of stuff\nDo you make of all this Megan\nWell there are a bunch of fake bombs much like fake news and you know I don't know who did this I don't know what type of a political leanings they have but the pressure does do what they\nAre the press has spent the last so I don't know how many days now few days ah basically blaming tromp or Trump supporters are white supremacists or Nazis or when they have absolutely no idea the investigation isn't even close but it fits their narrative doesn't it\nAnd I find it really interesting that um what Democrats were chosen you know I was watching\nI think it was CNN unfortunately forced to watch it in the airport the other day until up brains\nI'd love to really get into his hard drive and he's a freak I he basically says well it's like you know semi ... following Trump's Twitter feed as a target\nWhen I was little but yeah I noticed\nThat all of the communist are getting the bombs I you know I Can't help but because I'm a little bit cynical I think that this is nothing but a ploy to create fear a because as I've told you before on the program is who benefits from fear\nWho uses fear in order to ah basically mobilize their base a and so when you look at a this action you always say well who benefits from this action\n[noise] so you know perhaps a it is a dumbed down Republican uh who can't spell Florida a who is concocting these so bombs are in order to create some noise\nBut I Can't think that it would be some Republican uh that would want to sabotage the chances of the terms you know who would want to sabotage the midterms probably the same people that want to sabotage this administration but again that's just speculation\nWell I I think it's you know speculation worthy of our consideration because it's obviously\nI'm I'm going to say well organized I mean I think what's known as ... you know this is possibly done intentionally and of course you know the the amount of posed to join the packages winner would not have been enough to have gotten the uh the devices actually said there's been speculation Somerset by courier and whatnot\nAnd it it's almost like it's a\nIt's an amateurish\nTo be accidental if that makes any sense\nRight yeah exactly no it it it's nearly two amateurish purposely ah and in in order to create a chaos right and again who creates chaos\nA that would be the left of crisis doesn't exist let's create one ah but what I also find interesting as a the handwringing and the fear that is going on amongst uh like Jim Acosta and Don Lemon and others in the mainstream media\nFix the problem now before the storms come through\nBy calling bill to zero five

bill I complete homework\nBut ... we care about the hard work you\nVote in the room looks such while your advertising partners or people we take the time do you do when you go to the Y. and ... you can trust that you're doing business with those people you can do that you are so many reasons you don't see 'em a one liner snow and we'll start with the\nCity of annoys reached way to do business what ... what are you worried [laughter]\nWas on the in the door [laughter] nobody wanted [laughter]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nBeen doing a Google love your way ... [noise]\n\nThey walk out of it you\nTwenty minutes brass you our our right Megan looks a change directions jobs ...\nBigger road trip because I wanted your dogs on ah the Caribbean and Trump's response to it today\nYeah I refer to the care of and Caribbean it's like a dodge mini van ah this is an invasion this is a migrant mob a and I think I said you last week you really think it's not going to grow in size like a tumble wheat\nOr you know it started out as just three thousand Hondurans Guatemalans\nI and others you know crossing into Mexico a on the bridge and suddenly they just picked up steam and its fourteen thousand or at least we know we don't have the ability to count each and every head but its approximate\nAnd I'm sure as they near the Mexican border they'll join a ten thousand more people\nAre that are going to storm through our porous border and what's interesting is that the Democrats in and forgive me because I haven't heard if I miss something let me know but I haven't heard really the Democrats announcing this behavior it's the only like they want to of course roll out the welcome mat\nI heard John Case that just because of the Republican who takes money from George Soros I talk about something about what would Jesus do and do you know this is a you know if we're we're God loving Christians we must welcome them and uh you know supposedly he has a direct line to God\nUh and then I Believe I heard a Hillary Clinton believe it or not\nA reference the Bible or and talk about Christianity\nWhich is a total joke when's the last time I ever saw her go to church um or talk about the Bible I think it was back in her Arkansas days when she won at the evangelical vote a so they're using this uh again I'm as more of a blasphemous\nType of political stance\nOr when it's convenient for them up but this is the future of our country should Democrats gain an ounce of power or control\nOf either branch of government or the president's seat we will have nonstop migrant mobs reaching our southern border because supposedly that's what Jesus would want us to do is let them in and violate our sovereignty\nAnd our immigration laws or forget about all of the legal immigrants that are going through the process of becoming naturalized citizens a screw them or they're just going to have to wait much longer as this invasion\nBreaches our border and then I'm looking at all these people are and most of them seem really well said ah doesn't seem like they miss the meal\nOr if these people are poor uh wow I I'm sure that many in Africa are kind of jealous of of how well fed a these people are and let's not forget that most of them have at least four or five six kids into\nA none of them speak English or none of them I Believe are going to be future physicists or split an Adam\nUh and most of them are saying well they can't find work well that's not a a reason for you to violate our laws and seek asylum if you were really wanting to ...\nWell that's not a a reason for you to violate our laws and seek asylum if you were really wanting to seek asylum you do so in the first country winter and the first country they entered with Mexico\nA which has the same language that they speak and there are third world hell hole a they have plenty of job opportunities in Mexico similar to the ones that they could find here\nA ... a based on their low skills ah but that's not the goal the goal is to ah violate our laws and the Democrats will be happy to help them to do it\nBecause this is what the Democrats one night I refer to it as the ... care of that\nAnd what this means is that you important dependency create crisis in order to stress the capitalist system and you hope to stress the capitalist system to such a great degree that it collapses\nAnd when it collapses that you can fundamentally transform a member that fundamentally transform our country and to a third world hell hole\nAware socialism as the economic engine\n[noise] well I I Do find find that amazing that it has grown in in such a short period of time to the degree that has seemed to be picking up momentum seems to be a ... they're getting here quicker because we now know the government on trains and buses and you know automobiles et cetera et cetera\nAnd so of course you know droppers responded that he will not allow anyone to seek asylum that there's going to be known ago she Asian so the view that might have even been\nMight have even been eligible to return to why as route are you happy with his response to this point\nI'm very happy with his response he put out a tweet just the other day that to the care around that basically said turn a you know turn away or go back a we're not going to let you in\nA but how much power does the president have to close the border well he can just simply closed the border he has to have you have to seek congressional approval\nAnd I don't know that he would have it because I don't know that there will be that many Republicans\nAh that would get behind closing the border but again this is a ... that says they going to be no matter how we look at it a photo op\nUh whether or not they reach our border and the time of the midterms remains to be seen like you said they're not on really put\nAny more they're getting rides from truckers and cabins and trains et cetera\nSo you know we'll see if this photo op works for the Democrats ploy in order to create another crisis right around the midterms are much like the bombs the fake bombs uh and so\nThe president doesn't have that much power or any power to close the border without congressional approval but he is sending an extra eight hundred troops\nWell what are the Democrats going to do with these migrants by the time they reach the border I'm sure that they've planted the ACLU within the care of and that is teaching the migrants on how to uh seek asylum if they set foot\nOn our soil and specifically in the immigration laws are so specific carve out interestingly enough for a Central Americans are and so again this was designed by the Democrats whereby they can exploit\nA our laws in order to a hand to them more power and political opportunity\nI imagine you don't consider the timing suspicious\n[laughter] well of course [laughter] of course it's ... it's like I said this is you know a ...\nThe timing suspicious [laughter] well of course [laughter] of course it ... it was like I said this is you know a nother crisis another form of chaos uh\nIn order to hopefully get one up on the president and show how\nYou know race is she as a for not letting these people violate our immigration laws and just storm our borders whether it's in Texas or Southern California and now they reach Southern California I'm sure Jerry Brown will rule out the red carpet I mean\nJerry Brown the governor of California already spend thirty percent of its state budget which is about thirty billion dollars thirty with a B billion dollars\nOn the care or the welfare of the education\nOf illegal aliens uh so what's another Fifteen thousand more illegal aliens are and when you look at the ... utopia that California has become you know one in five people live in poverty you know like I said a third of their budget goes to the care of illegal aliens\nI and you have a homeless population specifically in LA county which is growing in San Diego county as well that has spiked a Seventy percent or in a in a short seven years\nUh well like I said oh we have to do is look at the progress of model of despair when it comes to California California could solve income inequality they wouldn't have Seventy percent spike and homelessness and seven years\nUh and they wouldn't have one in five people living in poverty or and so these midterms are extraordinarily important and I find the timing of the migrant mob and the timing of these folks bombs are quite interesting and I think it's in order to not only\nA create fear amongst the Democrat base but also create fear and the Republican\nBase I get so we cannot allow fear to control us because that's exactly what Democrats want to do\nSince you burn it off what do you make about the um the revelation of course in an office in the country or wherever we spoke about earlier today speaking of Claire McCaskill and her campaign ads where she stays is she is not one of those crazy Democrats of course he didn't say it herself\nAnd it's a couple of our men and the video itself talking about voting for McCaskill because she's not one of those crazy Democrats is that is that her trying to re brand herself reposition herself she means you've got one of those crazy Democrats or is it just all of the optic\n[noise] well it's just on optic I mean much of Claire McCaskill's I'm a candidacy has been nothing but optics even her serving\nI has been nothing but optics\nI like I said she's painted herself and to be a moderate for emperor campaigns are run an ad that says I'm not a crazy Democrat well who she referring to exactly or is it crazy Bernie is that crazy Hillary who because Claire McCaskill was happy to accept their money and happy to accept their help on the campaign trail\nSo I'm not sure what crazy Democrat she's talking about\nUm but there are plenty to choose from a ... a Bob Menendez of New Jersey is also in trouble or against his opponent a which is great news because in FBI affidavits a that never really made it to trial he's accused of\nUsing an abusing young uh I think it was a Dominican Republic a republic prostitutes\nAre on these junk gets that he used to take really are\nUh but you don't hear the me too movement you know coming out in force and demanding that he resigned you don't hear the same um me too movement coming out against Keith Ellison the second are in charge of the DNC\nAnd thankfully Keith Ellison is in trouble as well because he's running for attorney general in Minnesota I shudder to think what would happen to Minnesota if he got that job\nUm but time and time again when you ah peel when when you look at the policy\nOf these fraudsters they're not moderate Democrats and so I really hope uh two things happen during the mid term one incumbent Democrats lose a these new Democrats that are rising stars whether it's beta and Texas are ... and in Arizona or Gillum and Florida lose\nA and we send back a their socialist policies at least set them back Thirty years\nThis is our time to shine a in November and I hope that we do have a right away but seemingly we do have the ... ... they don't believe that the Democrats would go to the these many\nAnd ... and I hope that we do have a right away but seemingly we do have the ... ... they don't believe that the Democrats would do that the these many links uh hysterical lake or if they weren't truly concerned about the midterms\nMay not typically because of time you know do allow people into the program when I got you on the air about what David has a question for your summers who was on his mind real quick Hey David what's\nA medical grade to talk to you Megan always great to listen to you you've been writing here as always\nA question Michael does I've given over the years and try to encourage other people to give\nAs much as possible to invest in our nation and as always been in the Senate for the U.S Senate races about thirty of them and pass for me this year is the house we have to\nWe have to key we got to keep both of them but uh you're totally on target with with everything you're talking about Claire McCaskill was the first one to to endorse Hillary I Believe two in the past but a\nA moving moving on from there I've been telling people that heritage action dot com or is the best organization they're supporting and Thirteen races got over twelve thousand I'm a ... around the nation are active on the ground grass roots\nAnd I'm trying to win and those Thirteen races\nAnd uh they even accept stock\nUh ... what do you think about people investing in the country you just talked of of how important it is for us is that the Democrats back as far as we can on that are socialist agenda so just wanted to ask you that\nAnd I'm Sorry what the question related to investing in stocks I missed\nThat memo in investing in America by voting with our wallet before going into the voting booth or I'm Sorry I wasn't clear there\nOh no that's okay well you know when you look at the research for example um historically people do vote with their pocket books I and so you know I'm watching the Dow kind of go a little bit crazy right now but we still of course have the tax cuts\nUm in our pocket\nOr which has created you know hundreds of dollars if not thousands of dollars per month for certain families and then you look at the Democrat plan and they want to raise taxes they don't want to cut taxes even though some candidates are running on cutting taxes um and so I Do hope that people vote with their pocket books because\nUh that's historically how it's then they vote two ways they vote with their pocketbooks when they vote for a leader who they trust and so far Trump has been a leader or that we should be able to trust because he has delivered\nOn his campaign promises outside of building the wall I mean there is some construction going on but now as we are witness to this\nMob ah that's about to reach our borders a I'm a a wall would be a great thing they wouldn't be able to set foot on American land if we had a wall and how I Would even throw a moat around with alligators ah that shouldn't be too expensive\nOr anything we can do to protect our country has to happen at the ballot box a bit high as a country our country will look like California\nOr if we allow the Democrats announced the power and if we end if the Democrats do you take the house and the and you mentioned your concerns there and so am I\nA then I like I said will have nonstop chaos for the next year's a where nothing will really get done a deli even start impeachment proceeding or even though he can't be impeached because well hold the Senate\nA where nothing really get done a deli even started teaching it proceeding or even though he can't be impeached because well hold the Senate\nAh and they'll do it just out of a fight and they will do it out just political theater or in order to try to paint Trump and confident man um and uh the need for not only run for office but a vote out of office\nUm and help they'll try to replace him with you know whatever I Democrat candidate that they're grooming for twenty twenty\nOn the it's up to the American people to fight back\nYes indeed it is to fight back and David I appreciate\nThe call buddy I got

tell incentives implantation Florida is where they're covering the van with the part\nI don't know where plantation Florida is but I'm telling you this than I don't doubt me when you see the van yeah this is the stickers on the van if they weren't put on the week before last\nOr I'll give you twenty bucks or ... this this is what I Will want you to consider okay the ... the main is supposed to be from Florida okay\nBut he but he cannot spell Florida and he is ... ... when he comes to building a bomb but he is perfect and finding twelve people's addresses and having them delivered to the correct address\nA ... that tells me that it's not a a good old boys from the south that tells me that someone inside the\nGovernment inside the structure of what we are called the deep state that they're pulling the salt they may not be house bladder but you you can't tell me that a man that cannot build a bomb that goes off but he can find it brought address is to have to protect\nDid have ... and I'm having a hard time saying finding is kind of like\nBig big news two days then people started saying hey wait a minute or these even ... even really bombs not that it would scare anybody that has something sent to them and it looks like a bomb then we start having reports that say well they they may not be bombs and then some of the stuff that's inside of them is not even explosive\nWhere are some reports I don't know and and I'm looking out here at all the usual news outlets and where where are the comments about whether or not these things are real were were literally Here's New York now it is back to packages suspicious packages\nSo were they bombs or were they not\nWell they weren't bombs and all of them all and uh I I just think it's somebody on the inside Scott\nAnd and someone not not only has access to the postal service without having packages screened but has someone that can hand deliver these packages but you can't tell me some guy down in Florida that that's just a stretch\nGreen but as someone that can hand deliver these packages but you can't tell me at some guy down in Florida that that's just to stretch\nA you know how can you be in New York and deliver packages and mailed applaud on this ... this is absolutely nuts inside job they will sympathy lines drawn to solve this is an after this not there'll be something next week\nYou think of what you think they've got another ...\nOh yeah we got another October surprise kind of\nGuy I was hoping just this one was the October surprise by staying appreciate you got\nTo take care now there's a lot of people out there asking a lot of questions in it I'm not seeing a number of answers\nAbout\nWhat exactly has going home\nUm\n[noise] we've got the president being attacked because he tweeted out something about here it is Republicans\nRepublicans are doing so well in early voting at the polls and now this bomb stuff happens in the moment I'm greatly slows news is not talking politics very unfortunate what is going on Republicans go out and vote and of course that got people over like any media I ate all bent out of shape\nHis tweet comes moments after police intercepted two more devices in the Democratic senator Cory Booker and former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nAt CNN so Clapper Clapper was on CNN\nAddress list along with John Brennan\nSo maybe we will figure out exactly what all is going on there a hundred more U.S troops have been sent to the Mexico border I was talking with some folks this morning\nAbout this caravan and my friend was making a very good point that these people in this caravan and big Dave I had not thought of it this way because it's so\nEasy just to buy into what the press is\nWe're told that these people in the caravan are\nFleeing poverty and violence I've been to Honduras\nI've been to Mexico but only on the well not been the parts of the southern side this person had been has done work in Mexico city a number of places in Central America we were discussing or how it was like when I visited Colombia\nAnd he just straight out said look I have been here I have\nSeen the poor he says those folks aren't the poor the\nPoor and some of these countries are so poor they're not striking out on a two or three thousand mile journey\nJust not just not going to do it there they they live in rags they live in huts made out of cardboard boxes\nBut what do they find they find the addresses but they can't figure out how to spell the people's names it's it's an odd thing that's going on\nYeah it's a yeah I think it's all a\nBig fight things from the Democratic party I'm Sorry to say but\nUh that's that's my gut feeling about it and ah I just didn't want people to jump to conclusions about who my district blame them because I remember the story about the guy from thank God that they blamed and and one of those forest telling the parents are the people that got killed families that that's what happened\nSo you know there are ... they have no shame about lying to people about what really\nWell in the press as long as they can say it for a couple of days and get it and get it stuck into the American consciousness then come back and come back a few days later and correct it\nYeah and why did nobody remembers that and that's where I just remember what they are first time you've got

the very next day and interviewed a lot of the people that worked in that hotel so\nYeah that's another violence scene that so possibly the shadow government involvement you remember\nUm I'm Debbie Wasserman Schultz had a four guys on our payroll Saudi Arabia is making a hundred and Ninety thousand dollars a year and a you know where he got to the bottom of that we ain't got to the bottom of Anthony Wayne ... the whole thing is a disaster\nAnd uh and and there's there's probably some Republicans involved is mass to\nBut we need to get out and do we need to vote a straight Republican ticket to start with because this this gum that started all this or a hundred and fifty years ago plus a where the Democrats and they they have a they have railroad this country\nReally a back Seventy years ago so we need to vote get out and vote\nI agree David where are you should vote but do you do not ... you're crazy if you vote straight ticket\nOr I mean and I I'm Sorry I'm not saying you can't vote for it for all Republican but you need to look at each one of the people that you're voting for or you don't look at me like the Scott basin I Know when we're ...\nWe're we're we are talking nationwide yeah you need to look at all these candidates and say who you're voting ... like some of this new young blood\nAnd it's like you know who thought Claire McCaskill was a was a a was

the primary Mitt program\nHey what's going on I'm trying to I'm trying to help big day and try to figure out why I'm a my a fledgling website is not working\n[laughter] you know this whole bottom thing is is that a common view okay you know the man super intelligent because this was a multi faceted operation he pulled off state what multiple say he's an idiot driver in a band bumper stickers that surprised me the famous every ... you know it would be [laughter]\nYou don't drive around and Democrat land with a a just a truck sticker on your car much less the way his clothes like\nClearly he's watching the news whoever this is because now he's sending out bombs so supplementary Booker and so and so but don't you know they're looking for a Republican wise the advertising like he's a NASCAR Republican you know with all these stickers\nHe does look like a that's a great he's the NASCAR and away we don't want to say that NASCAR to be ... he's a um oh what do you call it um\nWell we all just order he's [laughter] he's a advertisement bomber I don't know what\nIt is it's ridiculous ...\nHe's the most conspicuous and conspicuous person ever it all off the war on you can't spell but he can run this multi state time operation\nLooks like the whole thing is based on stereotypes how could I be the most stereotypical redneck right wing Rube and and just flash it out there for everybody to see and then get I'm limited gets caught\nI mean I'm sure there was an outrage stickers pro life stickers that's probably all kinds of stuff\nYou've got you've got to see the only ones I could tell was a a\nPicture of a president kind of in front of the Democrats seal with that with either Bush or W Bush or Ronald Reagan and then there were definitely some stickers that had a Republican elephant on them with some sort of you know some sort of saying beside it and and that's all you can tell\nBut the thing is that clearly fluid narrative at first it was it was just a Republican and then when the planes trucks go after Robert De Niro threaten a punch Trump it's like the narratives fluid it's flowing more than\nYour point I don't disagree minutes\nI mean it could be a Republican but still whoever it is is wrong and prosecutors put in jail is not representative of everybody\nAbsolutely but it but it but it absolutely would\nTake away the narrative that Democrats or violent which which they they have been in signing the mob no doubt but the only way to make them look like they're they're just um\nExpressing their views yeah they're screaming and people are restaurants yeah they're saying don't let people ever a moment of of a peace\nBut the only way to Trump that is to go have someone do something ridiculous like this and mail them bombs are fake bombs\nWell I don't believe in there and the ... went to look at the timing of all these things are we ... we could we not see this\nAh yes we're stupid in most of us can't say that thanks Mitch art I

an exit ramps\nAh we just only straight shot there were making the toll road so we make some money on it [laughter] but when you go over ... pesos a buck fifty an axle um [laughter] what's going on\nIt's speaking a right wing or so that I had this thought floating around in my head\nAnd you know the\nInteresting to see people say that bombings really aren't a Republican kind of a thing and and that's pretty true I mean most of the bombings throughout the history in this country had been done by left wing Democrat type people\nBut for all of their below the aiding about how bad we we Republicans are clinging to our guns and our bibles and all that it would seem\nFor all of their below ... about how bad we we Republicans are clinging to our guns in our bibles and all that it would seem to me that if we weren't just so adamant about getting rid of them went in and we just go out and have target practice one day\nI mean that would just be much quicker and much more efficient which I'm not advocating\nFor no no I mean it just doesn't seem like a oh ... what did you go ahead and look if you go over and if I had I guess I could put it out on my Twitter there is a picture now out somebody was pretty don't grown closer had a good camera\nView of the suspects what they're calling the Trump\nMobile now and when you see it y'all we'll see what I'm Talking about with the details now I could not tell from the vantage point we had here at the station\nThat it was a lot of ... stickers I can see the back better but it is a ... it's a ...\nIt is what a leftist would think a typical Trump supporter would do to their own vehicle but you got to check it out I mean it is very well done it is all lined up\nIt is yeah I mean it it's\nIt's amazing I'm a I'm going to see if I can get this big draw during the break in posting Rio and Twitter are so check it out Twitter Scott Lisa Murphy thing else\nSeems to me thinking if I was ... you know\nIf we're your bracket models but you're right if if we if the left the right wing was going to do something I don't think it's this I think you're right\nI that's my point you all have a good weekend you got a buddy you have a good weekend to let's go to a I had a new way I can talk while I Try to get this big drop it how you doing buddy\nOh doing okay well yesterday I disagree but they have a great with him I think there's I think mindlessly voting a straight Republican is not a good thing I Do think this time around concerning the context of the modern Democratic Party I think we do need to vote for consistent alternatives man libertarian constitutional party or Republican\nI sometimes I vote Republican I voted for one Democrat in the last like thirty forty years because there's only one conservative Democrat that I met\nWhen was that the head of the head of the way back and\nThat's actually a few years ago I Can't even remember what position was running for it I Can't remember his name\nBut I did vote for him and uh but I I think that are\nNow in hindsight are you sure even conservative already just tell you is conservative\nWell we had a lot of talk okay that it's not good and but uh now I think that the I've kind of third party it anyway because I think we do need an alternative party and I think um I think we need to do this for freedom site because like if you just get so locked and a one party\nThen we can be easily manipulated by that one party and I think we have to have real alternatives and then we have better afraid I'm a better choice but unfortunately considering a modern mentality of the modern Democratic Party I don't see it is anything but socialistic they didn't tell us to ... so\nA factor when if we agree with somebody on principle like Judge Moore we should vote for him I wouldn't vote for a third party when judge wars there\nAre also other politicians that are great with if we don't agree on principle well then do you know you're shooting by your lights and I respect your choice even if I don't agree with that I respect your ability to make a choice in those tax so I just I just don't think we need to be manipulated by the Republican Party or the Democratic party I don't even think um\nI don't agree with that I respect your ability to make a choice in those tax so I just I just don't think we need to be manipulated by the Republican Party on the Democratic party I don't even think of myself as a Republican\nI'm more of an independent and that's a constitutional party becomes relevant I gladly identify with that the Libertarian Party it's good but fortunately what you're getting the Libertarian Party has a lot of liberal Republicans effect that way I Am I I think that my mission legalized drugs\n[laughter] I think you're right they said we got to take a break we will be right back\nYou're listening to Scott ... radio\nIf you're in the market for a new Honda you need to visit Honda Jasper they carry only the best the best we're
