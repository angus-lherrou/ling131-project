and struggles with others\nThis morning I have ... ... well on the show with me you are listening to the Mark White show and and ... uh posted a blog back in September and it was about an eating disorder that she struggled with then of course when I saw the blog I thought there other people who need to hear ... story\nAnd so I asked her if she would be willing to come on the show and she agreed to do that\nAnd I want to through the show to educate and encourage and inspire and that's the goal of the show and ... story\nWill educates you because some people don't know about eating disorders\nSome people actually know about him but they need encouragement to get over that home that they're dealing with and it's something when you have an addiction\nThat you've never overcome it per se to the extent that it it gets out of your mind but you control it and you're able to manage and and deal with life\nIn a way that's better for you and healthier and I believe that ... is doing

football dad have only lost one game so because the big boys to ... oh yeah I mean their money [laughter] it was a big stink or\nWell you have a blog and if you will just tell us about the blog itself so people can start looking looking it up and seeing some of the things that you're writing about\nOkay well I started the blame on a blog um right after\n... about a year ago last night and it was right after I had my son DJ and I just felt\nI needed like a a way to kind of get out and\nIt was almost is kind of not my like I said lady just get out and be my own person kind of a little bit [noise] um\nAnd it's kind of to just encourage other young moms and just young women in general that you know it's okay to be a mom it's okay to have struggles it's it's just okay like it's not that big a deal\nYeah and and you reached quite a few people I see some of the comments that people post and they seem encourage about what you're writing and so it motivates you to continue on\nYes definitely I when I first posted um the posts about my eating disorder I was really nervous about it I was you know afraid that it might be considered taboo or whatever but um the comments I got back were just so encouraging and just helped me honestly with my own struggle so\nWilling it's understandable that you would be\nConcerned you know when you put that kind of information out there to the public ... how are they going to respond yeah and I think a lot of people who have struggles and challenges such as the U.S have that fear\nWill what are people going to say right right well then you also think about what's the person going to do your do the struggling with the same issue yeah how's it going to affect them will be a positive effect on them will help change their life right and that means more than the person who might be the critic\nOh yeah I got I got so many messages from people about my post in them telling me you know hey I have the struggle to your posts really really helped me and it was people that I Would have never thought you know oh they're struggling with this and that and then and then of itself was super encouraging so\nLet's go back to the days when you first started struggling with an eating disorder and just tell us how this came about and the challenges that you faced it but um\n[noise] well it all started basically with you know I used to get this magazine and it was teen vogue magazine and I got it and I love that magazine but I didn't you know hindsight's twenty twenty I didn't realize what would it was putting inside my head and we were asked\nWe were at summer camp actually and I had gotten another piece of cake I mean it's really simple and there was this boy and he was like you know he was like wow you're so fat you know and I didn't realize what that did to me you know at the time and\nI guess that was around the first time it actually started just really just breaking me down um and then it just progressed from their\nI had a couple of friends that knew about it but honestly they didn't know the seriousness of it they just kind of thought oh well she just had this is not that big a deal you know so it\nIt was really really hard in the beginning and you know\nMy parents they weren't really sure how to deal with it um my mom had had a friend in high school to die from an eating disorder so it really scared her um and it just basically it was just society and the things I heard in the media that we're telling you you know you had to be a certain size and\nHer um and it just basically it was just society and the things I heard in the media that we are telling you you know you had to be a certain size and then when it really really got bad\nI was Fifteen um my boyfriend who I married um he he's kinda getting he's not a bad guy but I'm the I found out how much he weighed and I was\nLike oh well\nI weigh more than him that's not right\nAnd so that became my goal in life was to weigh less than him and it just\nBlew up from there so\nWilling and of course you talk about the boy that said you were fat and I know\nThat sometimes boys in flirting probably will make those kind of ... and so you know there are several ways it could be taken ... and you took it in a way so what it tells me is you know young men men women we all need to think about what we say to other people and the consequences for saying that because we don't necessarily know\nIf that person is teetering on a on an issue and then somebody says something to put you over the top and and they just didn't understand the magnitude of of what they said\nOh yeah I mean that boy he was one of my closest friends I mean we've we're still friends you know um and he doesn't know that he said that and that it messed me up or whatever but um he and I know for a fact that he did not say it just out of meanness you know he was just\nSaying things [laughter] ... yeah exactly\nYeah so so you're Fifteen Years old it became a very bad situation in the course of with your with your husband now you you had a baby and you've you've dealt with this also through through your pregnancy oh yeah it's been been an issue there when you when you were pregnant tell us about\nThis um so you know when you're pregnant you have all these cravings and all you know you're just hungry all the time and so I always my craving\nWas strawberry milkshakes which you know on a normal basis that would be fine but you know with struggling with an eating disorder that was really really hard\nSo you know it was like\nI was battling with you know I'm pregnant I have to take care of the baby I have to protect the baby but then my eating disorder was like that you're getting that you know it's like it's almost like this another person another person in your head and it's like you know you're getting fat and it's like no\nI'm just pregnant you know it's not that big a deal but\nSo it was really really really huge struggle um you know and I bought I mentioned that I was very very addicted to like this it was just a really really huge struggle and when I found out pregnant with my first child\nUm I quit cold turkey because that's\nI guess that's how strong\nTaking care of a baby you know and so it was\nAnd Thursday and friday morning from six thirty until six in the evening you can also place to go orders for a meal or fresh baked

in the spring and pumpkins right now in different different items so Jake our forms an ... a lotta people like to go on friday and Saturday did you pick and that's always fun we enjoyed taking corn to Lexington in the past the pumpkin patch and\nShe's always loved it and a lot of fun and sharing Carter is walking in the morning Sharon and social handy the headset and you can have a seat and we'll start talking about the lady walk how 'bout that\nWelcome to the program and this is Sharon quarter\nAnd she is with the paint lady walking glad to have her own during the ... good deed segment and the reason I wanted to have sharing all this because I Want\nThis to be a vehicle to help the pink lady walked to continue to grow and more and more people bring awareness to breast cancer awareness in the course this is October breast cancer awareness month but if you would share your story about how the pink lady walked came to be\nWell in two thousand and six I was diagnosed with breast cancer and I was diagnosed again in two thousand twelve\nAnd at the time I was a\nParticipating in just I'm just talks and I'm a ... latest will come together and share our stories but I wanted to do more\nAnd I continue with that until um I got the idea of having a walk a friend of mine had a walking um Rogers veil and I asked her I was like well how how\nWhat do I need to do to do that\nAnd she gave me the steps to do that and I had my first walk in two thousand fourteen it was rather small and it was rather quick get into it together and so I wanted to take it a step further so\nSmall and it was rather quick get into it together and so I wanted to take it a step further so\nI wanted to create a non profit but I wanted to not just be in name only\nAnd so I researched it on how I can get uh the documents and I'm certified and all of that to create a nonprofit so I did that\nUm and so now we are a five oh one C. three a public charity\nAnd so now we can see donations from businesses and um individuals and the the donations are tax deductible and my goal is is to seek out women or and or a man\nThat are just going through the fight because we'll always have\nMoney for research people always give to research but people that are actually going through it they need support as well and\nThose individuals sometimes you have like myself I had to drive to Huntsville every single day for a radiation treatment\nAnd care for thirty days straight so some people are not fortunate enough to have\nInsurance like I Do I have a very good insurance but some people are not fortunate enough to have that and so that's what pink lady walk is all about we want to help individuals in any way that we can whether it's\nGas money um sleeves compression sleeves um\nUm special broth anything up prescriptions and we also reaching out to a agencies last year on hospice of lump sum county was one of our first agency that we um\nThat we um that was a recipient and this year is the Cancer Center of Huntsville so they they're going to be our recipient\nThan you and you have women that you pick to for this year but that you're going to\nHell yes yes uh one lady ... her she's actually she was our speaker last year and she's going to share her story this year her name is Beverley salmon she's a um this is her second bout with breast cancer um think our first one was in two thousand for a another young lady I'm\nSharma laid a Heinz it's her first diagnosis and I think she's still going through a radiation treatment and then we have I'm Andrea Russell which on the flyer it's tap Scott\nSo she this is our second bell spreads cancer and of course the Cancer Center in Huntsville the recipient because we feel like the agencies they can they can do more they have people that\nNeed gas money to get the treatment or they may need a special type a nutrition and they can they can help that can use those funds for that\nNow we're course talking on friday here do walk takes place tomorrow engine on Saturday and for people who are listening they'll listen today and then tomorrow the walk starts at nine thirty\nIt starts at nine thirty and I'm a we have registration and you can register up until tomorrow I'm going to make a big human ribbons just to support those uh that are out you know just to show our support for for breast cancer so\nAh the shirts are going to be hot pink if you didn't get a a registration just wear shirts similar in color and just help us to to form the ribbons\nAnd you formed the rhythm before\nI paint if you didn't get a a registration just wear shirts similar in color and just help us to to form the ribbon\nAnd you formed the rhythm before we let you read it on a profile picture pink lady ... lover much fun and yet and it was a smaller ribbon it wasn't ... and then it became a bigger ribbon where we're going to be able to be a bit over this year yeah it looks great I Love I Love the idea thank you so I\nYou know my big thing is willing to support education as you are and awareness and we want to encourage women and men if necessary to go and get a mammogram ... to going back this testing before this becomes a problem\nAnd in that local health department they do free um mammograms the ... you have to meet their criteria and I'm not so sure what that is and I think you have to be at least fifty and but they

I I'm In a mixed or say\nRight well tell us about the American chestnut I you know a lot of our listeners have heard that name before but that may not be familiar with with things about the tree and then the blight also that affected it\nSure I'm not a contest not ... as you mentioned a minute ago it was it was the dominant in the eastern shore is some people even call it the redwood up to the east right now it was so\nGreat orange trees that grade to over a hundred and all of the ... the diameter\nThey were a major source of lumber or Muslim shelter and ... and for lots of different uses that it's called the cradle to grave trade those people who you know everything from cradle\nThe casket if people were very the rise and fall and we paid all the great stuff it was very important for the region are nuts were very important people either I'm turning their causes ... in all the feed them and that's not you know\nI'm ... commercial that you make it other than that for for food and also the Atkins you send them in the city to sell them right\nI'm Mr Morsi and most of our listeners or you know are probably just when they think about just nuts were thinking about the Chinese chestnut that they did they've seen in St planted or a lot of homeowners wildlife into Jesus you know plant Johnny's just much which landed the different genetic down there but Chinese or a whole lot smaller but just just kind of give a difference in those trees\nOkay the um [noise] the Chinese tree is it runs\nIn looks more like an apple tree in terms of its shape and it's really been bred uh\nIt runs in books mark an apple\nTree in terms of its shape and it's really been bred\nOh for commercial and for for ... for a city I mean it is a lot a lot of what a merchant my daddy along and the American lives a little while tree is baller stranger\nOn was it was um you know more more prevalent in while sitting right and\nYeah it's it's always been fascinating to me to see the old the old photographs of a you know I Love the\nThe Appalachian south and I've got to get we got a cabin up close to ... my wife and I do a lot of time and the national forest and\nAnd it's really interesting I've seen some pictures around there of the of the trees it I guess in the spring when they would bloom and it looked like snow fall you know owned by some of the hillsides they're really amazing\nIt here and there were quite ... of them and that that was a good description I actually was descriptions to it [laughter] it's almost like\nNinety it is why you you just we we can't gain perspective for had ... which is really amazing well and that's\nI I have heard it said that one out of every four one out of every five trees in the Appalachian Mountains was a un American chestnut so I don't know if that's accurate or not but that's a lot and I I when I was in college I took an Appalachian ecology class in the ...\nAnd we went up and found places where chestnuts have been cut and the stumps were still there and it was amazing how big some of these stumps arm and then you can still get up on her organic perspective of how big the trees or\nAnd it's a ... you know it was a shame for sure to lose all of those trees in and tell us about the blight described to buy two as\nWell as a lawyer what was in the St accidentally through um\nSome technical specimens that were on the end of the country a person here in New York so logical part which is now in the\nButt in Nineteen oh sure sure I hear that there is a lot of his ... and trees were dying or has some kind of disease that she didn't recognize the video but it's got a\nCouple of years almost all trees and in part it died ... and so\nUm it was accidentally enemies from Asia probably on some plants that were brought over on you know China and get him by phone my current thinking is that it any more than\n... but it spread very quickly um they'll even into the deep south the rate of about it you know all the year\nWhile entail and the forties and fifties and um it it is part of the ... in the old olive tree back on ...\nWow well I I have heard a that in two thousand five or two thousand six somewhere and there are there were one or more trees found in the Talladega ranger district of the Talladega national forest is is that right\nAnd typically during the summertime yeah I Know they're still trying to get some last minute spring done now\nUm but generally late summer early early fall typically the general area when you're a spray and then what you want to do they weren't allowed to about six or eight weeks or so just letting letting those chemicals are absorbing the root system\nUm and really get a good kill a owned the vegetation that has grown up since the timber was harvest a horse to 'em and then after that typically in October November maybe early December\nUm this typically when you you burn burn off all of that debris all that slash those piles tops and um and have a good fire that will that will carry 'em through the property and it's important to ah if I might\nYou want to spray you want to have a good stand of natural vegetation coming back off this week downs to come by those those briar patch is those kinds of things you won't those to come back that way when you spray you get a good bang for your book when you spray it and that's right they are dirt right yeah so\nAs far as planning a once you spray\nStay that way when you spray you get a good bang for your buck when you're spraying and that's right ... right yeah so\nAs far as planning a once you spray you burn it\nAre typically December January maybe first February somewhere in that time I'm as what you do your tree planting and um you wanna you'd like to get it done and as soon as as soon as you can December January and then\nAh just ah hopefully have a good wet spring that way those literally a new root systems and started Gil established right um during the ...\nYeah and all you're trying to do is to give those are new seedlings the best chance they can to out compete all the other stuff that's naturally going to grow and then hope that their water being so I mean that's in that essentially what you're trying to do\nIt is you want to get on the best chance of survival and have the highest you know when you put those trees in the ground and I'm just trying to do everything is you know as soon as you can with a good uh early spring rain from Mother Nature and uh and it went blah blah ... typically in the sense we just got walk away from it for\nTen twelve fourteen years yeah a long way to all different you know with fire regimens and everything but um ... which what you see a lot in the south now the planet I'm you typically are what you do that you're you're good to go for a while\nOh yeah how are you folks to if you if you've got some timber and the last year or two\nUm now you need you strongly consider you know spending this money and replace your property you know ... we we we don't have time to get into the do the yield curve but you're you know if you just look at the numbers of what you are you going to be with with a\nA property which has been re planted in Maine interested in in sight brampton chemically treated and burn you yield over long haul was going to be way way way way higher maybe two to three times as high as it used to just an actress name brand real quick before we get to be a year\nYeah you were really sharing a compelling story with me about you know about helping helping somebody with a timber sales manager and tell us about that\nYeah I was reaching out a reached out to a client or yet reached out to me and I'm\nSomeone looking to do something with their property and um you know from cell and that that never wanted to sell it or cut the timber\nAnd um I've taught what this gentleman for a a couple of months and uh right now he's decided he wants to do something with the chamber of its own this property and um it's roughly the but the temperature is roughly about a hundred acres and um he told me that a hit\nOr decided to go ahead and have it cut and then I had a lot of hard with ... a hard what species\nAnd ah he had told me that he had reached out to some folks and um some of the prices that he was offered a on a per unit I sail and he's wanting to clear cut everything\nIn order to ... per unit type sale and ah he was telling me some of the prices that he was offered and uh I I told him that they were low uh Reilly as good as horrible it is you know right now and everything and\nYou know in one case

know a lump sum is a ... in his situation as well\nAnd I told them to different ways that you do it to ... per year a lump sum and and I told him I said with a clear could know a lump sum as a ... in this situation as was the best way to go and uh it really made me feel good that to be able to help someone in that situation who\nUm may not have gotten paid for everything you know what the proper

great show for you today we have we're going to talk about what happens if you are forced to retire Tony we see that a lot or we're going to talk about financial warning lights so things that\nAre are blinking red you may or may not be thinking about and that you need to be\nWe will talk about emotions in retirement planning we're going to try to get to all of this we've got a lot\nWe got so much stuff yeah we've got we're just we have a what's the word I'm looking for\nWe're we have a plethora [laughter] a horn of a Hornet plenty but also in addition to that we've got our good friend\nUh and and the person who's his team does all of our tax stuff\nBoth tunes repairs level he's here with us this morning and so\nUh we're going to start with that because we're gonna we're just going to start with the best yeah and go from there are going to see that but that we're going to see how that's right what does what what what wait a minute I forgot about that get what buzz buzz [laughter] All right [noise] but how you doing I'm\nDoing great ten Tony thanks for having me here\nIt's a pleasure as always so you've got a lot of good stuff to to ah help our listeners think about as it relates to taxes and and we're going to talk about a couple of things that are are recent\nAnd um and how to think about those are some as it relates to the new tax law and then an executive order that was just sign so we've got a lot of good stuff to talk about here so abuzz what uh what do you want to talk about first to tell us tell us what's on your mind well I've\nGot a lot of clients that are that are Seventy and a half or older and they're taking required minimum distributions are MDs from the IRA so yeah so they've got to take that out every year and they've got one problem the new tax law\nHas itemized deductions limits of twenty four thousand dollars and if you think about people that are pre retirees are retirees twenty four thousand dollars to exceed that amounts pretty hard to do because it's going to beep\nTypically mortgage interest and the and taxes that would be your property taxes your income taxes in your car tax will will that's kept at ten thousand dollars for so many people even\nEven people with great wealth or not I'd amassing though one way to to to solve that problem especially if they have a charitable inclination they want to give money to charity or or their church\nThey can take part of that are empty and make it qualified charitable distribution that could take all or part of it so it does\nThe earth or their church they can take part of that are empty and make a qualified charitable distribution that could take all or part of it so it just it it comes out of the IRA directly to the charity now\nThe the amount of the income doesn't get included in an income but of course they don't get to take the charitable deduction eat higher right but they wouldn't have taken it otherwise because they're not item us and so that's a way to to kind of beat that a new law and and to get up into safe taxes\nBy making charitable contributions\nSo I Want to help clarify for folks on this because this is something that we've helped our clients to for a while because of this when did this first become a thing it's been seven or eight years right and it was temporary for a while but then they made it permanent right right so\nSo I just want to clarify you need to be Seventy and a half or older to be able to do this right buzz that is correct and what happens is you use the government's making you take a distribution out culture required minimum distribution and you have to do it anyway but if you are tightening or giving money to charity\nThan you can send that money directly to the institution you can't take possession of it right you can't take a distribution and then contribute it's got to go directly from your custodian\nTo the organization but I have that right correct it goes from the trust of the of the IRA directly to the charity so if you do that that means that you're our MD is not taxable\nAnd in what buses saying as you don't get that as a tax deduction anyway\nUh but with the new item position rule yeah most people are not as far as well and even if you could let me let me ask you this bus even if you could itemize it's still better to do it that way right because you're paying no tax on the money versus just getting a tax deduction\nThat you would have otherwise even before the new tax law was still a good idea to do that right\nAbsolutely 'cause it may help you and other ways because as your income goes up there may be other things like Social Security made that become more taxes or you or you could lose other deductions like your medical expenses which are related which are tied to a percentage of your income right\nYou know and and yet the thing is you know all those things your taxable income goes up so everybody worries about how much tax not paying how much do I owe and all those kinds of things and why do I owe so much after I'm already retired and what you're saying buys is right I mean I I mean exactly right and let people worry about the most is\nAs I Am pulling money out of an IRA or a four O. one K. attacks tougher to count\nThat is considered taxable income so the more you are pulling out whether you want to have to it makes everything else more attacks are on it you know you just got more income and and then your Social Security gets taxed at a higher rate possibly so yeah it's a good idea it's a great idea\nSo bugs you mentioned a ... it can cause your Social Security tax to go out why don't you help people understand how Social Security is tax\nSocial Security is tax depending on what your combined income is in combined income is your total income that would be dividends interest pensions you name it\nPlus one half of your Social Security benefits so if you're combined income is thirty two thousand dollars or less you pay zero taxes on your Social Security\nIf it's greater than thirty two thousand dollars but less than forty four thousand dollars then only fifty percent of your Social Security is taxable\nHowever when you get about forty four thousand dollars in combined income eighty five percent of your Social Security is taxable so people that are in those brackets need to be aware of that 'cause you can as you can see in very short\nBecome eighty five percent of your Social Security is taxable so people that are in those brackets need to be aware of that 'cause you can as you can see in very short increments the amount of tax you pay can go up pretty drastic and\nSo sometimes people here that and I go oh my goodness I'm paying eighty five percent tax on my Social Security so I Want to help clarify what that means is that eighty five percent fifty or eighty five percent depending on where you fall of the amount of Social Security receive is subject to taxation at whatever your tax rate is\nBut a lot of folks don't know that Social Security tax at all they're surprised especially when they first file or whatever they're like oh my gosh this is going to be taxed too\nWell it is double taxation [laughter] [laughter] so [laughter] we we paid it on the front in and they were paying it again I mean it wasn't always that route you know if the law [laughter] so so that's good to know and you know I I it just uh it it\nDawned on me as you're talking about our MDs and the amount of money you're having to pull out and that sort of thing or another thing that I've been talking to our clients about in fact we just we did a client of that recently where I was going through and telling everyone that you know this is an analysis that\nWe needed to do for them [noise] was\nWith the new tax brackets so so most taxpayers are their tax brackets are going down I mean everybody is going down and most people I ... I should the tax brackets are going down period but for most people that are going to pay less taxes when the new tax law yeah so\nAnd you mentioned earlier you said you know even people with great wealth a lot of wealth they don't necessarily have a lot of income\nAnd we see that all the time with our clients that are retired\nThat have done a really good job of of building up wealth is you know let's say they've got a million dollars or more you know several million but they don't have a lot of income right and they're younger than Seventy and a half so the government hasn't made them start taking\nMoney out of their tax tougher accounts cause Seventy and a half you have to start taking money out of your tax deferred accounts called RMC required minimum distribution\nSo they might be sixty sixty two sixty five whatever younger than Seventy and a half\nIf they don't have a lot of income there is a small window of opportunity for those people to get some of that tax deferred money into a tax free bucket by converting door off\nAnd buzz I'm just curious to know you know what your thoughts are on that for people that that are in that circumstance that I just describe what\nTad let me give you an example and I've got a client who was he's been very successful and he recently retired he's not Seventy and a half yet therefore he's not in the ... he's not taking required minimum distributions from his IRAs which which are quite large Rob the way he listens to the show where we can because he told me that [laughter]\nWhat this is one of those things they say don't try this at home [laughter] don't try a lot of this at home you need professional help I mean really\nI mean truthfully doing you're retired or think about retirement planning like this [noise] ask yourself this question the first time you do something as it usually your very best effort\nNow you know it's like you never get good at it really didn't\nWant yeah if you do something one time you never get good at it and never have a chance to get good at it\nAnd so what we help people do is benefit from the experience of the fact that there have been a lot of people that have done this is just they all did it once\nAnd we've helped hundreds of people do this so so a whole lot of what we do here is just help people be aware of what can be done yeah all of the things that are available to them\nThat they may not have known about and buzz I Know you do the exact same thing for your clients and that's why you know if if people are needing tax planning\nThis deeper than what we can help them with 'cause we're not CPAs but there's a lot of tax stuff that goes on and retirement plan absolutely and that's why we have become as knowledgeable as we have\nSo that we can help people figure this stuff out but then when the rubber hits the road we really need somebody like you buzz\nHelping people do this and so that's we bring a team of people to the table\nYou know al ... and all that and what people are trying to figure out as we all my money last is this going to last is it going to work and if you're not managing your taxes properly I mean there's an opportunity you're missing that you could really be you can really be maximizing how long your money's gonna laugh\nAnd so we don't want to evade taxes because that's illegal it starts with an evening we do want to avoid taxes if we can do it legally right rice a living\nThey taxes because that's illegal it starts with an evening we do want to avoid taxes if we can do it legally right rice lately so if you're\nTrying to figure out is my money going to last how long do I have to work\nWhat's gonna happen when we retire how do we take our savings and turn it into a paycheck that we can have confidence

can nail this down\nAnd it's not a budget NATO budget work she please not to mention budget worksheets don't work so we so we have a proprietary process that we call our lifestyle analysis\nAnd or an accurate and we choose not to share it on the air 'cause we don't really want to be educating our competition on how to do retirement planning if they can't figure it out on their own [laughter]\nSo ah so this is if you're trying to decide do I take the severance or not you know Tony you just said don't go with your gut 'cause everybody's got is oh yeah let\nMe out of ... and ... and ... and let me out of here also when you when you get a figure of thrown at you it seems like a lot of money at the time right I mean it seems like a lot of money and south you know seeming and feeling and hoping is not salad\nYeah because here's the thing I mean the men are usually going to go first or us\nPoint yeah because here's the thing I mean the men are usually going to go first\nOr us ladies live longer and you know that's that's the thing that we're going to have other jobs not just financial problems but we're also going to have to figure out who's going to clean the gutters and all that stuff so there's a lot of things that we don't do now\nWhile we have a husband that we will be doing at some point and money is one of those things and money can be one of those things that super emotional it can be very fearful ... for a lot of folks\nUm what I Would say to you Grace Anne and to every woman out there that's trying to do this for the first time on their own first of all don't be intimidated and don't say I Am never going to understand this to yourself\nIf you are working with the right person who can not only know about financial stuff but it's able to meet you on whatever level you're on and can talk to you\nI'm In in plain English about what you're wanting to do where we need to go where are you right now where do you stand\nAnd just stay with you in that in that conversation until you understand and we move forward about what we're going to do and make good decisions I had I have yet to sit down with any lady that ... that I have not been able to\nSit with them at whatever level of understanding they have and we haven't been able to make clear confident decisions\nUp some of the one of the best I guess I'm compliments I get\nIs ladies telling me all the time this is the first time I've ever understood you know this is the first time somebody hasn't talked over my head and this is the first time actually feel empowered you know so at least I've got other things that I've got to deal with but I don't have to worry about the money piece\nUm that's just that's some something that I Love to do you know it's a passion of mine and I think that everyone should have that level of confidence and understanding about their finances\nWell you know Tony it's not that complicated it's scary for people because they think that it is and chances are they've worked with people in in the financial industry before ... who has made it complicated yeah\nIn in the thing is is a lot of folks I mean Ted we catch ourselves doing this the longer you do something and become competent at whatever it is I mean you go to the doctor and he starts talking about stuff and you're like wait I don't even know what that means you know it's because when you get in in a certain you know career field and you you know things\nYou start using terms and terminologies that that are common sense to us and common place to us\nBut but not so much for everybody else and so I doubt I think we both of us even when you sit down with with single ladies\nDo a great job I think if I Will say we do a great job of something ... of one thing is is really saying ... I'm not going to do that I'm going to talk your language I'm going to say things in a way that you say things um I don't blame things until you understand exactly what\nI've always said this there's a big difference between knowing something in being able to teach mhm [noise]\nI think there's a lot of people with a lot of knowledge that are good teachers right and you know again if if if we may be so bold as to to complement ourselves I think that's one of the things that we do really well yeah\nUse help people that are financial planners understand all this stuff\nAnd if you explain it the right way and you explain it using exam\nPeople that are financial planners understand all this stuff\nAnd if you explain it the right way and you explain it using examples that they get right you know we talk about our fiscal house so we talk about building a retirement plans like building a house and we have\nIt in ... we do this and are it just dawned on me you know we do a three hour retirement planning class we typically do it right here just state by her office in Inverness and if you would like to come to that is three hours are typically on a Tuesday or a Thursday we used to charge a tuition for it but we don't anymore\nAnd we do a deep dive where\nI personally think this is one of the most valuable things you can do for yourself and your family has come to this class and I'm not just talking now about people that don't have a grasp on financial matters I'm Talking about people that think they have a a great grasp on financial matters right\nUnless you plant hundreds of retirements even if you're the one that manages all the investments and understands all that I think there's a lot to be learned in this class if you'd like to come to that call you can call the operator and leave a message and our staff will get back with your next week or you can call during the week and just get on the list for the next class it's nine a triple zero six\nTwo oh five nine a zero zero zero six\nBut we were talking ... in that class where using a lot of a very approachable examples right for people to get it and you know ... uh we did one recently there were a lot of single women in there and they were given us the same feedback you know this is the first time this has made a lot of sense to us\nRight and there's a different you just said something a second ago had you know even if it's somebody who does has done prior to retirement all of their investments in their own thing\nI'm there is a huge difference that people sometimes don't understand between accumulating money saving for retirement and now now I've got a ... I've got to start using my money\nAnd I got to make sure it lasts as long as I Do and I got to look at health care and taxes and inflation and\nAll the things are going to happen to me that I've never faced before\nSo grades you know going back to your mom I mean I I Would recommend she come see us I mean you know I mean but honestly\nYou really want her in and if you even if you don't know about money I think it's important maybe that you interview people with her so that you guys are comfortable with with the folks that you're working with it should be someone you literally felt like\nThere are taking your ... your mom by the hand and guiding her through her through this and not in a way like don't you worry about it we're going to just take care of it for you in a way that empowers your mom so your mom knows what she's doing and why she's doing it and then it makes sense to hurt that is important because\nEven if you think you're working with somebody I'll say this titled him even if you believe our hope you're working with somebody that understands it all quote unquote and has a plan for you quote unquote ... if you don't understand what it is I when as soon as you retire or soon as this decision this money gets foisted on you\nYou're gonna wake up in a sweat in the middle of the night is going to happen from time to time I I Can't tell you how many people say oh my gosh I Hope this doesn't apply to me whatever hurting the news and whatever the economy's doing and whatever the president's doing whatever this is happening\nSo you don't have those panic attacks in the middle of the night when you understand what's happening\nIt's when it's the unknown that scares the devil out of here [laughter] so and and I know this is scary and I'm not making a lot of this I I care about this deeply because you know your mom should know your mom should be at least resting and the fact that she's got that covers\nMaking light of this I I care about this deeply because you know your mom should know your mom should be at least resting and the fact that she's got that cover and not worrying about an\nHour would say for you grace you know you said I don't know that much about this either get I Know I I Would say you know fix that\nBefore you happen to have yeah yeah and and so you know I'm inspired after this question I'm inspired to to do a special offer now this is for\nWomen only they would like to empower yourself yeah to understand retirement planning yeah and uh we we don't normally do this either but sometimes I've found Tony ... ladies are more comfortable with you\nAnd sometimes there are more comfortable with me they are yeah and so it's you know uh it's kind of a you don't know [noise] All right so in addition to an offer only for women I Would also like to give you\nEmpower you to choose huh I think I Would like to sit down with Tony or would you like to sit down with me\nThat lady but\nEither way here's what's gonna happen we will go through in detail in help you think through where are you now water what's going on what are the things that really should be paid attention to and how to go about paying attention to them\nWe will give you very clear feedback in plain English about what where are you are and what needs to be done to get you in the best possible position\nAnd we'll explain how our process works so that you are empowered to make the decisions obviously were guiding you but you know and again we may decide to work together long term we may decide where the right fit to to help you\nAnd maybe not but this initial analysis is does is designed to get you to get your sea legs under you as it relates to all this so that you can feel confident with what's going on if you'd like to take advantage of that\nA lady's call and the next Fifteen minutes and uh one when you come into our office\nAfter we sat down will also give you a copy of the book that I just finished writing called retire with freedom so in addition to an analysis you will get a our book or we're going to be selling this book for thirty four Ninety five but for the for you that come in to sit down with us you'll get a free copy of that\nSo we want to do everything we can to empower you\nAnd we think that this is the best way for you to do it so if you'd like to take advantage of that call and the next Fifteen minutes nine eight triple zero six that's two oh five nine eight eight zero zero zero six two oh five nine a triple zero six", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "13"}
