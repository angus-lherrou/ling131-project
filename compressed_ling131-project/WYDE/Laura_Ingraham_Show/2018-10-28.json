{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WYDE", "content": "W windy up and go ... W why do you are you in Birmingham W two three Seventy to Birmingham W. B. J. C. G. to Birmingham no\nNo\nMany people with the church and are interested in spiritual things but I've never really wrestled with the foundational question do I believe in the son of man\nToday I'm truth for like weekend Alister beg explains what that phrase means and why it matters it's part of our series called a light in the dark\nGoing to read no surprise from John chapter nine and ...\nWe're going to read no surprise from John chapter nine adverse thirty five Jesus' hair that they had thrown him out\nThat is the man who had been born blind and he'll buy Jesus and finding you've found and he said do you believe in the son of man\nWho is he ... the man asked telling me so that I may believe in\nJesus said you have now seen him in fact he is the one speaking with you than the man said lord I Believe antiwar shift in Jesus said for judgment I have come into this world so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind\nSome fantasies who were within heard him say this and that's what are we blind to Jesus said if you were blind you would not be guilty of sin but now that you claim you can see your guilt remains\nOn then\nWell we pray together once again\nLet us pray for other what we\nTeach us what we are not\nMake us what we have not give us\nFor your son sake on then\nWhat we read the concluding verses of the chapter but our focus this morning we'll only go as far as verse therapy aid essentially this morning study turns between a question and answer the question is there to the end of ... do you believe in the son of man\nAnd the answer which then comes inverse thirty eight lord I\nBelieve\nJesus we learn from the opening part averse thirty five I sought out this man\nIn order to ask him this express question the question is there do you believe in the son of man\nAnd I wonder if they're just to you three things concerning the question first of all I Wonder would you agree with me that what Jesus poses is of vital question a vital quest\nSon may immediately want to challenge that assertion they perhaps wanted to suggest that it would be more accurate to say well it is an interesting question or maybe we could even upgraded to an important question\nBut to suggest that it is a vital question in the scheme of things I may be an indication of rhetoric rather than accuracy\nAnd so in light of that it falls to me in suggesting the vitality of the question that I must have the wherewithal to substantiate the assertion and so I invite you to turn initially to John in chapter three\nTo explain why it is that I\nOffered this as a question which is vital John chapters three and there are ... Thirteen\nJesus Says no one has ever gone into haven't except the one who came from heaven the son of man\nJust as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert so the son of man must be lifted up that everyone who believes in hidden may have eternal life\nI don't remember what the question is do you believe in the son of man\nWhat are the implications of belief answer\nBelief is the open door to eternal life\nWhat are the implications of belief answer\nBelief is the open door to eternal life\nTherefore\nGeezer sets the question in the context of eternity if you look at versus Eighteen you have a solemn statements still enjoy on three and then various Eighteen whoever believes in him is not condemned\nBy whoever does not believe stands condemned already\nBecause he has not believed in the name of God's one\nAnd only son\nSo the question of believing in the son of man the question posed to this man one's born blind addresses the whole issue of life\nItself and in Jones gospel particularly there are tremendous number of statements concerning life it bursts upon us in the prologue when Jesus was introduced into him was life\nAnd this life was the light of men\nIn John chapters three geezer speaks to Nick a demus about internal life\nAnd John chapter ten he says I have come that you might have life\nAnd you might have it in all of its fullness while in every instance he was speaking to people who\nWho had physical life who at our line\nPointed not the fact that Jesus use of the terminology speaks to something far deeper far more significant than simply our Journey Through our air the existence whether it be Seventy years or longer\nAnd to this man he says I have a question for you\nDo you believe in the son of man\nHe's asking him whether he has ever entered into the discovery of a life that is in Jesus a life that one's in Jesus goes all the way on hindered\nInto eternity\nThat of course will be challenged by people that may be challenged by some who are listening to me now the idea of a life that will never end yes that's what the Bible says\nThat once we discovered the resurrection life in Jesus once his spit it comes to live within us even though we die even though they put us away in the ground still we will live\nAnd the reality of that truth brings to the Christian an expectation of what is still to be while they enjoy the privileges of life in the now\nSo that they turn a life is not something that we are Speier to over there when we get there but he turn a life a life of which uses it speaking as a life which begins now and continues all the way through into eternity some years ago maybe Twenty years ago maybe twenty five we'd have to go by\nPeople would have to prove this in general conversation\nAnd most people would have said especially if they came from a scientific background I never heard such hogwash and all my life\nI Am a scientist semi rational as I Know certain things I have verifiable data\nThis is all speculation and beauty is nonsense\nBut I have found and not exclusively but increasingly\nThat many of my friends who were once marked by that kind of rational lives in are beginning to change their tune you find them sneaking around in the new age section looking at materials\nThat no seasons scientists should pay any attention to it all thinking about angels in dreams therapy and wondering about the healing power of prayer and asking questions about dwarfs living at the end of their garden and with our fairies in Ireland really\nAnd wondering about the healing power of prayer and asking questions about dwarfs living at the end of their garden and with the fairies in Ireland really exist than spending vast amounts of money and making books number one sellers on the New York times lists that are so clearly full of nonsense\nThat it is impossible to believe that sensible people would spend so much money while at the same time still wondering about the truthfulness of the Bible\nBut they all have a sneaking suspicion\nThat perhaps there is something more perhaps\nThe Bible has something to say\nWhy they're sneaking suspicion is there because the Bible says that God has said eternity in the hearts of men and women\nIn other words a man and a woman knows\nIntrinsically\nThat death is not a cul de sac\nThat death is actually a gateway\nAnd it is for that reason that debt\nWhen it comes in all of his finality still doesn't end the conversations that people have about their loved ones so that even though they made me unbelievably people still talking about where their loved one has gone or what has happened to their loved one or how they felt their loved one with\nBut now Jesus Says do you believe in the messiah of God\nIs actually it's a question that is a very relevant question for for many of us this morning because we've been developing our understanding of these are some of us haven't we\nWe started off that there's a man called Jesus we may as a result of thinking about things I've concluded that he was actually a prophet of God but we haven't ever come to the point where we have decided that he is the messiah of God that he is not other than\nGod himself that's the third aspect I Want you to notice the question is not only\nIt is but it is also an unavoidable will question a vital won a specific one end and unavoidable one was unavoidable for the men\nAnd actually it's unavoidable for each of us\nDo you believe in the son of man\nNow the answer to that is either yes or no\nMaybe is a no\nI don't know is I Know\nI'd like to think about it some more as I Know an unchecked box is a no\nAnd the reason I say that it is an unavoidable question is is that although you may go through all of your life seeking to avoid the impact of this question\nYou will\nWhen God calls you beforehand answer this question\nBecause the Bible says it is appointed on demand wants to die and after this comes judgment\nAnd the basis of judgment\nIs simply and essentially this\nHave you believe\nHave you believed in the son of math\nHave you cast all of your hope for forgiveness for time for eternity have you reached the point where in casting yourself in believing childlike faith upon Jesus you're able to say I know who am I have believe\nIt's an unavoidable quest\nSurgeon are preaching in the late Nineteen century in London used to speak of or someone who had ... who's general statements concerning religion or of no help to him at all and he describes the dialogue going as follow somebody asked him and and um\nDo you believe and the person said yes I Believe and he said what is it that you believe and the man said I Believe for the church believes and the person who said what is the church believe the man said the church believes what I Believe\nAnd the man said well what do you and the church believe the man said well we both believe the same thing [noise]\nBut I Want to do that won't do\nChallenging us to make a decision about Jesus you're listening to Alister bag and truth for life like the blind men who Jesus skilled and the ... he encountered every single one of us has to answer that question do I believe in the son of man [noise]\nMaybe you want to believe but I'm like the blind man you haven't received a miracle maybe you're struggling with an impossibly painful situation and you don't\nMaybe

...\nThe name\n[noise]\nThe cause of the the aid Cuba was receiving from the old Soviet Union one of the requirements was you bend your churches and burn your bibles\nAnd there aren't enough bibles in the country\nWe also saw the need for Cubans to understand the Bible war\nSo we were sitting all of us maybe ten or twelve of us in rocking chairs in Havana and one of our team members have been today board member said well let's pray about this great neat and so we prayed\nWe decided to go on the air we were praying that the lord would allow us to raise money for ... well that was the summer of two thousand Fifteen now we've raised two hundred thousand Bible step this point and\nWe also wanted to go on the air on radio thinking there needs to be good solid Bible teaching but there wasn't any Christian radio\nThat covered the entire island [noise] so we decided to pray about that as well but then in God's Providence we learned in less than a year the trends World Radio\nWas going to put on the air a blow torch five hundred thousand watt transmitter that would blanket Cuba\nBlanket Florida two and a lot of other places every night and our prayer we saw was beginning to be answered the idea for el Pato for the lighthouse began to grow\nAnd so we discovered\nThat the speaker for this broadcast rights\nThe idea for el Pato for the lighthouse began to grow\nAnd so we discovered\nThat the speaker for this broadcast rights under hard nosed my assistant Dan worn was finishing up seminary\nHe's fluent in Spanish he grew up as a missionary kid in a Spanish speaking country\nIf that isn't God's Providence I don't know what is\nYour right Charles I was really excited when you proposed the idea I hadn't been in have been very long but to know that we weren't going to reach Cuba with a gospel centered Bible teaching program and to pray toward that was just so exciting to me and so with much ... seem to be God's will to pursue this idea together\nBut an idea like that pretty expensive\nI should say very expensive by the way to send a radio program over the airwaves from five hundred thousand what transmitter\nTakes a lot of energy which means a very high electric bill but we knew that if the lord had brought the idea to our minds had lettuce to pray and he had given us the speaker you Dan\nHe would provide everything else including the money\nRight so in twenty Seventeen we began fundraising it was a year before the launch and let's be honest there were times we weren't even sure if we're going to get the funding\nThis time a year ago we didn't know if we have enough money and then we went on that you're in November and we had a matching program that to some friends of haven today had put together and it's like God open the floodgates to provide for the first year [noise]\nIt certainly was a struggle yes hurdles to overcome but the gifts were just pouring in and we're just so thankful to the lord that he's provided the money for this first year\nCharles I remember that so well we were praying and looking to the lord for answers and it was a week like this week where we were on the air with a matching program and by the end of the week and all of the funding plus a little extra came in and we praise the lord together\nAnd we did and and then I've got to say I was one of those of little faith [noise]\nI didn't have a lot of faith that God would do something at the beginning of the week but then\nIt's like he just turned ... friends with the ministry were just responding friends the wanted to become part of this great revival of the end of the week which is a good number of tears because God is so fake\nAnd duty as Charles so it all came together and this is all to God's glory we we were able to raise the fun we found our producer we began cranking out programs and I know that\nUh we had some catching up to do the trans World Radio wanted to have six weeks of programs that we were going on the air\nReally soon so I've never written so much my life even when I was working on the English cited haven but it just kept flowing God's Grace was good and we were able to be ready to launch the beginning of February and\nFirst week came a human I traveled there for the ribbon cutting we we cut the ribbon remember along with what he's right\nThose powerful towers off the coast of South America\nBut in the Caribbean and uh\nOur executive producer heard just a bit of it on his car radio on his way home from Southern California studio\nAnd and the federal debt ceiling\nBut when his car radio on his way home from Southern California studio and federal debt ceiling we we me\nAnd we praise God and we knew we could barely hear it in California we knew this was a blow torch that was covering all of Cuba so we launched so far\nAnd then we waited for response and of course there's always the hesitation is and he wanted to go into here are we going to hear that anyone is listening\nThat's right we actually went to Cuba we were in Cuba the first week el Pato was on the air across the island and we waited ...\nBut then I got an email as I was writing on a bus across [noise]\nI think God that night\nA very good salmon on your program got last year\nSo when I read failures email and that I read it out loud to everyone on the bus we just praise the lord together because we knew the program was being heard and as we traveled to Cuba and then\nCame back to the states we began to receive more and more messages from people who are listening to the program and not just in Cuba or at this point we've heard\nFrom so many people in so many countries around the world we hear from listeners in Venezuela and Bolivia Nicaragua your way we had somebody write to us from Chile this program is reaching do both Spanish speaking world at what I think it's so special about that is every day on the program we share\nTestimonies gathered by our in country Cuban producer\nOf what the lord is doing in Cuba how he's changing lives in transforming people's hearts with the message of grace and those Cuban testimonies and in a in an island nation that's been cut off from the rest of the world for so long those testimonies or going out and their blessing the worldwide Spanish speaking church\nIt's just incredible and I I Want to share one of these testimonies it's a lady named ... and this is what she says ...\n... my name is ... I live in ... and I love your ministry and your life from my country\nMade them the right to continue to a black president and make it an instrument of blessing to the nation's into all of those who are in need of the word of God my grandson and I hear your teachings every night and it helps build our spiritual life and continue I Walk and think that the case may\nSee a moral I Hope I pronounced that's\nDemanded my gringos Spanish no that's that's great what we just heard is just for the many\nReal Christ followers in Cuban day\nThere's voices would never be hurt if it weren't for\nYou know it reminds me that a lot of these listeners are are saying that not just the Bible teaching is having an impact but they are so encouraged to hear people from their own country talking about Jesus talking about how they were lost and desperate and looking for answers looking for hope and truth and they found it\nIn price and in many ways it's still hard for people to share ideas\nThrough social media or you know we're used to just jumping on line and catching up with the news and seeing\nWhat's happening in the Christian world but\nThey don't get that opportunity so el Pato is helping to connect the Christian Community in ways that they never experienced before let's listen to this lady she actually helped gather these testimonies for a photo and she wrote in and explain what a blessing a these testimonies have been in her life\nBut I think the guy for being able to collaborate with outsider of leaving the Senate she and I pray that God will continue to use federal that it may reach for people and let's say that\n... outside of leaving the Senate she and I pray that God will continue if he is a federal that it reached my people and let's say that\nBecause it's a powerful a fresh Christian to share testimonies and let God is doing and I think can encourage me to that and it just doesn't have to know how ... ... it's not easy to secret at a store and the leverage to try to fight in the case that when you hear about a fellow Christians is going to say the same fight it brings great contract\nGod he's testimony to strengthen and they'll take\nAs you were saying that this is such a great after Kennedy\nThank God for allowing Daniel ... [noise]\nWe get that ... that guy keeps his program on the air and that it would reach my [noise]\nHer name as Mr ladies and she lives in Cuba she loves Jesus just not just\nWorm your heart's hearing from Christians who are being reached thanks to your help no fault\nOf the ... redemption lighthouse dance something we've talked about in the office\nIs ... how to help Cubans understand the Bible and read the Bible for themselves and and we've been thinking about that minor profit\nW ...

I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred for one three seven four nine five\nSo how 'bout folks to me what it really comes down to here is we're not getting the right form or enough vitamin D delivered the right way which is why we have so many of these health concerns that you probably can't put your finger on\nAnd Dr biggest I Want to start just recapping here that there are a couple of different forms of vitamin D and maybe explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf de formulas is different from what you put together here\nWell there's vitamin D too and there's vitamin D three and the two is the type of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body still has to be converted into vitamin D three vitamin these three is the activated\nForm so it's ready to go to work now the vitamin D three that I use my formula I think it's the best because I've seen the best results\nWith myself and my family with my patients plus I've worked with a lab where the people in the lab of taken this and they they test their blood every day to see how the deal is going to end up going up and out through the roof where it should be\nWow so Dr biggest I mean who should consider taking your fast melts vitamin D formula\nWell I Would definitely start with kids short development and the unity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong men men and women in their thirties you're talking about higher health immunity\nCardiovascular problems start to turn on but it's also the child rearing years and vitamin D for pregnant women is very very important ...\nPeople in their forties [laughter] that's the way you know you start to more of those aches and pains like you've never felt before you think you're getting older and again it's important for your hormones and to keep yourself physically active\nAnd of course when you're in your fifties you start telling her you can't golf and can't play tennis you know

public service announcement brought to you by the U.S department of transportation the ad council and they say should\nAnd I think some of that's off the topic I think these people really believe that Trump is responsible for all this I Know I talked to a couple of guys uh CNN Today that I I Know and they they think it's they they they think it's ...\n... ... ... ... ... ... in in at his rallies whether that's the truth or not I you know that that remains to be seen if you can if you could realistically tied to what Donald Trump says at a rally that's going to make people do certain things I I think is a\nLittle far fetched but they they should believe this narrative so how far do they take it I think more importantly what what is what's going to be the public's reaction to this is or is there a group of people who are they thinking just to see this\nSee this other TV it'd be like you know that's enough I'm not voting for any Republican anymore we need more Democrats in office because there's a more civil party I\nI think that's that that's a bit of a leap in a bit of a stretch and I you know if that's what the hope is I don't think I Would bet too much money on that\nI I think the real question is is what is\nThe gases that are going to do when he finds out he's got employees talking to some guy from Breitbart\nOr they're going to get\nGoing [laughter] you got to realize the ... is\nBack in the day in DC everybody kind of started out at the same time all the same\n... it's it's a lot closer behind the scenes and you think it is it may it may seem like we're at each other's throat but a day to day you're just kind of you you go to the same party's you see the same people you go to the same bars he uh yeah I had to have people you know it's it's high school to point out\nWell and we we see when stuff like this happens we watch Fox News come together with CNN I mean we've even seen instances of\nOf ah Donald Trump attacking verbally attacking Jim Acosta and and people on Fox News come to his defense and all that which I think hey you know there's not not a guy more deserving than Jim Acosta get\nBlasted news conference but that's that's neither here nor there and I I get what you're saying are the big thing and and and what's really contributing to this conversation about these\nPackages is the fact that it's less than two weeks from the mid turns and it's a\nWay we've done to me and you've done several times about the October surprise and Everytime something crazy happens whether it's cabinet or or it's the caravan or it's it's this\nIt almost seems like it's an October surprise but it's not the traditional October surprise where one party brings it out says here's what I've gone on this guy it's like we're in an alternate universe\nYeah it's like a big big bang but it's not a it's not like\nGeorge W Bush's DUIs are right or or something just to the last minute Access Hollywood tape right it's it's always it's always one of these ground shaking events that you you don't see every day\nBut it's it's not a October quote unquote October surprises just these last minute incidents and I and I you know I I Do think they they do have some sort of an impact on the on the election what are you saying\nLast minute incidents and I and I you know I I Do think they they do have some sort of impact on the on\nThe election what are you saying or with the package stop what do you say to people that have that come out immediately look at the situation and say you know what this is a shady\nThe Democrats may or are behind that is there for instance mailing bombs to themselves which is a sense nobody got hurt I feel like their conversations okay we have\nUm what do you say to those people who have such a distrust for the Democrat Party that they're saying I Can't put it past the Democrat Party to do this for there as well as an October surprise\nYeah and I see a little of that out there and I\nI you know I think he's a little too soon to have that discussion Reno or of but the fact that it's out there and you see a lot of people talking about it I you know there's ... there's going to be people believe what they want to believe\nUh it it will be something as if this does come out and we find out that it's just sort of this a reverse Orwellian sort of situation where they're\nThey're they're [noise]\nWhile waging terrorist attacks on themselves to advance their power right\nThat that would be that would really be something and I I Do think no matter what the you're always going to have a set of people that are going to believe that's the case I you know and then it it it it's probably being discussed right now by Alex Jones or something oh yeah I don't know I've already seen all had a gun infowars\nMad if that's the case you know I ... if it is the case that I expect the story to go away and not be on the news at all if we find out that this guy's a Democrat doing this and the media ... a Democrat or we all about it we'll get back on Russia gate or something\nRight well think about this though Jessica pointed this out to me we've concentrated a lot and then there you are at Breitbart did you see a lot of these articles as well er about hoax hate crimes we feel like we see them all the time and it's it's one right after another and it's usually a hoax hate\nCrime that is intended to hurt either Trump or conservatives or whatever the case it's won't we tend to see so often\nI'm so that's where people I think get this theory and and have come out so soon to say you know I don't believe this run off the bat because we see those hoax hate crime so much\nYeah they poison the well on themselves a hoax hate crimes I think and that that's why you were you get a lot of this I'll say this I think just the sort of the survivor right now reminds me of post nine eleven with\nThe anthrax scare that they had a really scared public image or they're just they're just bad\nPeople in this world that want to capitalize on sort of things like that I you know I I think it very well could be one of these cases where somebody sitting at home thinking this is how I this is how I make my star eyes on how I get meaning in my life I'll I'll I'll get in the middle of this highly polarized political environment and and do these things\nRight um the Republicans seemed to have a lot of traction and you may disagree with me here I'm just looking at this from a you know a guy that's just a regular dude that watches politics\nI'm I'm watching these huge rallies Donald Trump split non and granted you know everybody far and wide comes to these rallies and that's how he fills up these arenas and even has tons of people on the outside but I'm seeing reports in in swing states where\nEarly voting is actually favoring the Republicans which is something we never see we're watching conservatives across the board just fine\nEarly voting is actually favoring the Republicans which is something we never see we're watching conservatives across the board just fired up about midterms which is on President or what do you say ... main pretend we're missing twenty four hours ago before all this went down where do you see\nWhere do you see a U.S landing on election night do you think Republicans keep this momentum on November six\nI I Do think the Kevin ... ah I think that did wake Republicans up but it's just a matter of maintaining that are maintaining nuts momentum right so that's you know what what is that is it is it this caravan down in Mexico the does the ... guy I don't know uh but I think\nHere two weeks out over the last day less than two weeks\nI keep on the stock market stock market really changed the ... election in uh in two thousand and eight\nWhen he had that big dip with McCain running against Obama McCain kinda lost his cool a bomber was cool and then I think that had a you know that that really at a impact on the outcome of the two thousand eight election and you know because if you recall\nSharp pale and just got nominated\nAnd they were showing some signs of life off the pale and bounce and then all of a sudden you had this this this economic downfall where it led to Morocco bomb I kind of coming back up at the polls Obama and Biden and that's what happened you know the rest is history I I think the stock market's definitely going to be a factor\nI think that Trump whether hurricane season pretty well you know obviously though the hurricane two weeks ago was was was really you know really bad but\nIt didn't it didn't result in a New Orleans type situation so I mean I think these are the things that I think will be more of an have more of an impact on the election then the ... the so called pseudo October surprises or anything like that\nI Do wonder though what ... what do you know the caravan does make it it does sustain itself to be something that gets people out the vote\nRight well we need to talk a little bit of a state raises the governor's race in particular and will do that if you can hang on whether this\nWill uh will take a break come back on the other side also take some of your phone calls if you want to ... to ... you want to do is make comments questions or whatever to oh five nine four one one zero one one back after this we saw with Andrew and Jessica\nHDTVs Eric ...\nAnd I want you to make sure that I'm going

your heating and air conditioning system we're going to talk about what to look for in the heating and cooling contractor\nAnd then we're going to uncovered the keys to making that sucker run for ever\n\nHave you have somebody come out and tell you that you needed to replace\nMaking that sucker run for ever\nHave you have somebody come out and tell you that you needed to replace your furnace or air conditioning system\nI interviewed a guy one time who said that the company that he worked for required him to try to sell new heating and cooling equipment to customers whose heating and air conditioning systems or two and three and four years old\nOh look I don't care how in efficient they claim your heating and air conditioning system is if it's less than eight years old you shouldn't even be having the conversation\nHow about your energy bills do you have energy bills to just keep going up and up and up\nDid you replace your air conditioning system maybe or your furnace and not see the energy savings that you were\nPromised\nI Want to talk to those of you out there who have a furnace or air conditioner or he bumped that six or eight years old and you've been told to junk it\nIn my lifetime I can count on one hand how many six year old systems that I've seen that needed to be replaced most of the time they just needed a really good cleaning it's going to take you years to get your money back out of Newark conditioning system\nDo you have six or eight grand just lying around that you want to Chuck it your heating and cooling system\nOr would you rather than just a little bit of money getting it cleaned up operating more efficiently lower your energy bills viewer breakdowns and more money in your pocket\nNow we're going to talk a little bit about what you should expect from the heating and air conditioning company that's coming out to maintain your system because I've got a feeling that a lot of you out there have been getting the drive by maintenance\nYou'll recognize it it's the one where they come out for twenty to forty five minutes ask you for fifty sixty Seventy bucks and then they're gone\nMaybe they hook up a set of refrigerant gauges maybe not if somebody's not spending at least Seventy five to Ninety minutes you need to get somebody else\nA freedom heating and cooling to not usually takes between Seventy five two hundred and twenty minutes from start to finish that we call that cleaning or tune up a total system rejuvenation\nAnd it includes cleaning your outdoor coils and inspection and documentation of about sixty Seventy different components in your furnace and air conditioner\nSome of you are going sixty Seventy different components that's a lot of stuff right\nWhen our guys show up they spend an average is Seventy five to a

to\nDid you know that the number one and number two trades being taught in the prisons today we're plumbing in air conditioning\n[noise] that's right folks the number one and number two trains being taught in the presence today are plumbing an air conditioning\nAnd I'll listen folks I'm not saying that I don't believe that people deserve a second chance I really do believe that if you made a mistake and you did time for it when you get out you should be able to get a job\nI just decided I wasn't going to put them in your home now fellas if your wife's going to be the one that's on when the heating and air conditioning guy comes by do you want to take a chance that that person as someone who learned heating and cooling in the pen\nDo you have kids how 'bout them did you know the fifty percent\nSoon as someone who learned heating and cooling in the ... do you have kids how 'bout them did you know the fifty percent of the guys that I have interviewed can't pass in nationwide criminal background check\nFolks I went through over one hundred resumes in a period of three weeks and only hired one person freedom heating and cooling is very selective about who they put in your home\nI Want to talk about one of the gentleman I interviewed and keep in mind when I Do an interview I asked them all kinds of questions about how they do the work\nI asked them how to test the capacitor how to clean a blower wheel and sure enough this guy was giving me pretty good explanations he missed one maybe two little steps but nothing a little training couldn't fix right\nNow at some point in every interview I Try to compare our moral compasses so sometimes I gotta get a little sneaky okay so here's the seventh question I asked him\nI leaned in and I said how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need\nDid you hear that folks how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need now brace yourself folks because without hesitation he said I don't have a problem with it at all\nI don't have a problem with it at all\nAnd the reality is that he had been around and worked for enough other air conditioning companies in the area that operated that way that he thought that that's what I wanted to hear\nAbout from the table I shook his hand unless it's or the interviews over we won't be offering you a job but I think you for coming in then I interview another guy same questions he's doing a pretty good job and when I lean in and ask him my little trick question how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need\nThis guy did hesitate to kind of dropped his head and then he looked back up and then he looked back down and then he said I can do it and if I'm being honest I have done it\nThe company that I worked for required that I'd bring back a certain dollar amount on every single call that I went on\nSometimes they didn't need anything but if I didn't sell them anything I was going to lose my job and man I got kids defeat but then I got to thinking am I setting the right kind of example for my kids so I had to quit and\nUnemployed and the market is flooded with heating and air conditioning technicians and it's been hard to get a job\nThat's an example of the type of competitors we have out there guys\nI told stories in interviews about heating and air conditioning companies training there technicians to jump wires on two thousand dollar compressors to sell new systems like crossing wires over to break them and there are hundreds of heating and air conditioning contractors in this area last time I checked\nAnd chances are pretty good that a technician like the one of the story it's going to be coming to your home or your neighbor's home\nYou know you might look down the street today and see an air conditioning technician heating technician and it might be that guy\nI'm certain that he didn't decide to quit the heating and air conditioning is this just because I wouldn't hire him and remember there's more guys were that guy came from\nThe heating and air conditioning is this just because I wouldn't hire him\nAnd remember there's more guys were that guy came from he got his training at one of those unprofessional heating and air conditioning companies\nNow listen we'd go out to customers houses all the time that have air conditioners with corroded coils or blowers that

concluded that the average duck system in a U.S household leaks twenty to twenty\nThe they've done studies that have concluded that the average duck system in a U.S household leaks twenty to twenty five percent of the air that travels through it\nOkay so there's two different kinds of Doug leakage first there's supply leakage that's on the side of your furnace or air conditioner that blows the cold or warm air out at ya\nSo eight twenty to twenty five percent loss means that twenty to twenty five percent of the air that has created at your machine that's blowing toward your bedroom or your kitchen or your family room is lost on the way\nThat's like fives intends and twenties just floating up out of your dog work flipping through the cracks\nThen there's the other kinds of leakage return leakage now this is a little more serious because our returns sometimes go unnoticed because we don't ever feel them doing anything that's because the returns don't blow air out they suck air in\nWell returns are the worst leakers instead of blowing cooled air out or heated air out into your attic or you crawl space like supplies do returns\nSuck addict or basement or crawl space air in to your system and then blow it into your house and also pressure rises your house in a way that you don't want your house to be pressurized okay you're pulling contaminants\nWell what's the first thing wrong with that other than sucking Erin from those areas how about the fact that if your doctor works in the attic\nTemperatures can easily reach a hundred and thirty degrees sucking in a hundred and thirty degree air into your cooling system is like running your air conditioner or your heat pump with all your doors and windows open\nYou want to know what else is bad about sucking an addict or call space air well in the attic and sometimes in cross race as to how about the fact that it's got all of that fiberglass insulation and it just take yourself a bright flash light up there in the middle of the night sometime okay you'll see what I'm Talking about\nIt get sucked into your returns it circulates through your heating and air conditioning system some of it lands on your coil and it gets you coil all clogged up and then when you're laying there sleeping at night with your mouth open it's raining down on you it's going into your lungs\nYou breathe it all in a\nYou know that stuff's says that it causes cancer right on the role or the package that it comes and don't you\nAdd to that all the toxic rap poisons and bug poisons that the bug companies spray up there and then crawl spaces that we find sucked into these duck systems and you've got yourself one heck of a case to seal your duct work up\nEver wonder why you or someone in your family keeps getting sick or plugged up on a regular

into your house or the other it goes through your furnace and air conditioning system over one hundred times a day\nAnd because most people don't have really good filtration systems those blower wheels they tend to get a little bit of build up on them and a lot of times we see a good eighth of an inch of build up on them\nSo here's the deal we're going to call you and give you a two hour window of time for the technicians to arrive and when he shows up he's going to park on the street okay now our vehicles are meticulously maintained but at the same time you don't have a leak until

his or your heat pump\nAnd he'll reached down and put on shoe covers over his shoes or boots we also call them for savers he's going to wear those each time he enters your house they'll\nShow you the inspection and cleaning form and he'll say something like each of these represents a part of your heating and cooling system and as I'm going through your system I'm either going to mark okay or if I

which point he'll say something like I'm going to start your tune up now if you wanna watch that's fine and if not that's okay too and then he'll start the tuna\nNow his very first task is to take the top off of the outdoor air conditioning unit or heat pump\nNext as we get the leaves and sticks mocking debris out of the system because all that stuff holds water and rushed out the bottom of your air conditioner prematurely\nNext thing you know your compressors falling through the bottom of a unit and you've got to get in the new one okay so something as simple as getting the debris out of the bottom makes a huge difference\nNow the next step in my opinion is the best we're going to use a semi high pressure nozzle to spray down your coils from the inside out because we've got the top off\nNow this is on your outdoor air conditioning unit right and it sucks air in from the sides and along with it grass\nClippings and dust and whatnot so we're going to back flush it wash all that gunk back out of there and if you've got all that stuff stuck in your air conditioning system it's just like having a sweater on that baby\nNow listeners if you were I we're going to go for a jog a hot summer's day with a sweater on and a strong our mouth what would happen right our bodies wouldn't be able to release the heat and we'd get really really hot\nWell the same thing happens to your outdoor unit your air conditioner your heat pump if it's dirty it's going to overheat it's going to cause problems you're going to have a compressor fail you're going to have motors fail\nThe number one cause of compressor failure is dirty coils so we're going to get the outdoor coils cleaned up for you\nSometimes we even have to use a foaming cleanser to get all that stuff off and men is that a sight to see you're looking at a good forty five minutes just up to this point so you can see why I say these other maintenance is our drive by maintenance is right if they're there and gone and forty five minutes\nNext we're going to test the electrical components in your system all the connections make sure they're nice in tight makes you you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires because sometimes\nLittle things that go wrong with your air conditioning system and furnish it can cause big things to go wrong All right\nYou may have a pending compressor failure because you've got a little started that's about to go bad\nYou may have a pending motor failure because you're filters all plugged up and you're not paying attention to it All right so we're going to check all of those little components every part of your system that don't cost that much at all to repair or replace\nNext we're going to check your indoor heating system or from is we'll check the burners your pressures which is make sure your exhaust is venting out properly that would be important right we'll check all your hoses your drains you flame sensor and most importantly we're going to check your heat exchange or\nThat's the part that is known to crack and leak carbon monoxide\nThat we all know that carbon monoxide can kill you but did you know that the majority of people that survive a one time carbon monoxide poisoning event have life long side effects do you see now why I say that\nSurvive a one time carbon monoxide poisoning event have life long side effects do you see now why I say that you have to have these two naps and inspections every six months you don't really have a choice\nWe are going to check the temperature difference between the air coming into your machine and the air going out of your machine\nWe're going to check the duct pressure check your surge protectors your system sterilize there's if you have them but you know how your filters look and advice you whether or not there's something more time or cost effective\nAt the end of the day\nIt's about making you more comfortable in your home and saving money All right so get it to end up it doesn't cost you anything it actually pays you to do that alright\nGet it cleaned up\nAnd look if you want to experience everything we've been talking about here on the radio without the risk of

to start a savings account because it's likely that you're going to need to ... lead disassemble your heating and air conditioning system have completely clean sanitize disinfected and put it back together and that\nCan get expensive\nWe're talking thousands with\nAn S. okay a little piece of free advice folks if you're going to buy a one inch filter\nBy one from your local big box store your ... your ... your home depot wherever it is that you're going through filters nowadays and here's the number one rule the number one rule is to get a filter that you cannot see through okay if you can hold your filter up and you can see your hand\nTo get a filter that you cannot see through okay\nIf you can hold your filter up and you can see your hand on the other side\nNot a good filter okay [laughter] that's basically is and sister take that out are looking for gold or something take that to the beach with you we call that a rock stopper it's good for a golf balls bats butterflies and stuff like that okay but it's not good at filtering\nYour air and it's not going to protect your heating and cooling system and you need protection your heating and cooling system is expensive okay\nThat's what the filters for for crying out loud okay and these people they get these little ones that you can see through I mean I can watch TV through it okay\nCome on people spend some money on a good filter good filters don't cost you anything they save your money okay\nNow the correct one for you to buy if you're going to get a one inch filter is a one inch police raided\nFilter that's P pleaded filter\nLook for one that resembles the ridges and a ruffles or wavy potato chip okay goes up and down and up and down\nAnd it's going to cost you somewhere between six to twenty dollars and I know it's a big fan um I don't think that I Would go for the twenty dollar one and the reason why is because while they are great filters\nAmericans can't they can't I'm trying to support the next generation of leaders to the American farmers grow act leaders program funded by the Monsanto find each year farmers can help local college student I endorsing them for a Fifteen hundred dollar grow

great\nSo uh we've got a great show for you today we have we're going to talk about what happens if you are forced to retire Tony we see that a lot or we're going to talk about financial warning lights so things that\nAre are blinking red you may or may not be thinking about and that you need to be\nWe will talk about emotions in retirement planning we're going to try to get to all of this we've got a lot we got so much stuff yeah\nWe've got we're just we have a what's the word I'm looking for\nWe're we have a plethora [laughter] the horn of tiny Horner plenty old but also in addition to that we've got our good friend\nAnd and the person who's his team does all of our tax stuff\nBugs Coons repairs level he's here with us this morning and so uh we're going to start with that\nBecause we're gonna we're just going to start with the best yeah red and go from there are going to see what bud that we're going to say that's right what does what what what wait a minute I forgot about that do what buzz buzz [laughter] All right [noise] but how you doing I'm\nDoing great ten Tony thanks for having me here\nIt's a pleasure as always so you've got a lot of good stuff to to ah help our listeners think about as it relates to taxes and then we're going to talk about a couple of things that are recent\nAnd um and how to think about those are some as it relates to the new tax law and then an executive order that was just sign so we've got a lot of good stuff to talk about here so above what ah what do you want to talk about first to tell us tell us what's on your mind well I've\nGot a lot of clients that are that are Seventy and a half or older and they're taking required minimum distributions are MDs from the RAs yeah so that got to take that out every year and they've got one problem the new tax law\nHas itemized deductions limits of twenty four thousand dollars and if you think about people that are pre retirees are retirees twenty four thousand dollars to exceed that amounts pretty hard to do because it's going to beep\nTypically mortgage interest and the taxes that would be your property taxes your income taxes in your car tax ... well that's kept at ten thousand dollars for so many people even\nEven people with great wealth or not I'd amassing so one way to to to solve that problem especially if they have a charitable inclination they want to give money to charity or or their church\nThey can take part of that are empty and make a qualified charitable distribution they could take all or part of it so it just it it comes out of the IRA directly to the charity now\nThe the amount of the income doesn't get including an income but of course they don't get to take the\nComes out of the IRA directly to the charity now\nThe the amount of the income doesn't get including an income but of course they don't get to take the charitable deduction eat higher right but they wouldn't have taken it otherwise because they're not item us and so that's a way to to kind of beat that a new law and and to get up into sales taxes by making charitable contributions\nSo I Want to help clarify for folks on this because this is something that we've helped our clients to for a while because this when did this first become a thing it's been seven or eight years right and it was temporary for a while but then they made it permanent right right so\nSo I just want to clarify you need to be Seventy and a half or older to be able to do this right buzz that is correct and what happens is you the government's making you take a distribution out culture required minimum distribution and you have to do it anyway but if you are tightening or giving money to charity\nThan you can send that money directly to the institution you can't take possession on it right you can't take a distribution and then contributed Scott to go directly from your custodian\nTo the organization that I have that right correct it goes from the trust of the of the IRA directly to the charity so if you do that that means that you're our MD is not taxable\nAnd in what buses saying as you don't get that as a tax deduction anyway\nUh but with the new item position rule yeah most people are not as far as well and even if you could let me let me ask you this bus even if you could itemize it's still better to do it that way right 'cause you're paying no tax on the money versus just getting a tax deduction\nThat you would have otherwise even before the new tax law it was still a good idea to do that right\nAbsolutely 'cause it may help you and other ways because as your income goes up there may be other things like Social Security that become more taxes or you or you could lose other deductions like your medical expenses which are related which are tied to a percentage of your income right\nYou know and and the other thing is you know all those things your taxable income goes up so everybody worries about how much tax not paying how much do I owe and all those kinds of things and why do I owe so much after I'm already retired and what you're saying buses right I mean I I mean exactly right and what people worry about the most is\nAs I Am pulling money out of an IRA or a ... tax deferred account\nThat is considered taxable income so the more you are pulling out whether you want to have to it makes everything else more attacks or are you you know you just got more income then and then your Social Security gets taxed at a higher rate possibly so yeah it's a good idea it's a great idea\n[noise] so [noise] buzz you mentioned a ... it can cause your Social Security tax to go up why don't you help people understand how Social Security is tax\nWrite Social Security is tax depending on what your combined income is in combined income is your total income that would be dividends interest pensions you name it\nPlus one half of your Social Security benefits so if you're combined income is thirty two thousand dollars or less you pay zero taxes on your Social Security\nIf it's greater than thirty two thousand dollars less than forty four thousand dollars then only fifty percent of your Social Security is taxable\nHowever when you get about forty four thousand dollars and combined income eighty five percent of your Social Security is taxable so people that are in those brackets need to be aware of that 'cause you can as you can see in very short increments the amount of tax you pay can go up pretty drastic and\nSo sometimes people here that and I go oh my goodness I'm paying eighty five percent tax on my Social Security so I Want to help clarify\nNot a tax you pay can go up pretty drastic and so sometimes\nPeople here that and I go oh my goodness I'm paying eighty five percent tax on my Social Security so I Want to help clarify what that means is that eighty five percent fifty or eighty five percent depending on where you fall of the amount of Social Security receive is subject to taxation at whatever your tax rate is\nBut a lot of folks don't know that Social Security tax at all they're surprised especially when they first file or whatever they're like oh my gosh this is going to be taxed too\nWell it is double taxation [laughter] so [laughter] we we paid it on the front in and they were paying it again it wasn't always that route yeah it's the law [laughter] so so that's good to know and you know I it just uh it it\nDawned on me as you're talking about our MDs and the amount of money you're having to pull out and that sort of thing or another thing that I've been talking to our clients about in fact we just we did a client of that recently where I was going through and telling everyone that you know this is an analysis that\nWe needed to do for them [noise] was\nWith the new tax brackets so so most taxpayers are their tax brackets are going down I mean everybody is going down and most people I I ... I should the tax brackets are going down period but for most people that are going to pay less taxes when the new tax\nSo and you mentioned earlier you said you know even people with great wealth a lot of wealth they don't necessarily have a lot of income\nAnd we see that all the time with our clients that are retired\nThat have done a really good job of of building up wealth is you know let's say they've got a million dollars or more you know several million but they don't have a lot of income right and there are younger than Seventy and a half so the government hasn't made them start taking\nMoney out of their tax deferred accounts because it's Seventy and a half you have to start taking money out of your tax deferred accounts called RMC required minimum distribution\nSo they might be sixty sixty two sixty five whatever younger than Seventy or half\nIf they don't have a lot of income there is a small window of opportunity for those people to get some of that tax deferred money into a tax free bucket by converting door off\nAnd buzz I'm just curious to know you know what your thoughts are on that for people that that are in that circumstance that I just describe what\nTad let me give you an example and I've got a client who was he's been very successful and he recently retired he's not Seventy and a half yet\nTherefore he's not in the ... he's not taking required minimum distributions promise IRAs which which are quite large Rob the way he listens to the show where we can because he told me that [laughter] so ... when I met with him just a couple of months ago the majority of his income this year is capital gains in ... and qualify dividend income\nYourself this question the first time you do something as it usually your very best effort\nNow you know it's like you never get good at it [laughter] you don't want\nYeah if you do something one time you never get good at it and never have a chance to get good at it\nAnd so what we help people do is benefit from the experience of the fact that there have been a lot of people that have done this is just they all did it once\nAnd we've helped hundreds of people do this so so a whole lot of what we do here is just help people be aware of what can be done yeah all of the things that are available to them\nThat they may not have known about and bugs I Know you do the exact same thing for your clients and that's why you know if if people are needing tax planning this deeper than what we can help them with 'cause we're not CPAs\nBut there's a lot of tax stuff that goes on and retirement plan absolutely and that's why we have become as knowledgeable as we have\nSo that we can help people figure this stuff out but then when the rubber hits the road we really need somebody like you buzz helping people do this and so that's we bring a team of people to the table\nYou know al ... and ... and what people are trying to figure out as we all my money last is this going to last is it going to work and if you're not managing your taxes properly I mean there's an opportunity you're missing that you could really be you could really be maximizing how long your money's gonna last\nYeah and so we don't want to evade taxes because that's illegal it starts with an evening we do want to avoid taxes if we can do it legally right rice a living so if you're\nTo figure out is my money going to last how long do I have to work what's gonna happen when we retire how do we take our savings and\nTrying to figure out is my money going to last how long do I have to work\nWhat's gonna happen when we retire how do we take our savings and turn it into a paycheck that we can have confidence is going to last as long as we do what her all of the things right now that we could be taken advantage of

triple zero six nine eight eight zero zero zero six be one of the first time caller is right now [noise]\nInvestment advisor we services offered only do we registered individuals through a wolf management Elsie AWAC freedom financial group are not affiliated companies [noise]\nSony we're going to talk about forced retirement [noise] unfortunately uh we're seeing this more and more and so\nOur listeners if you are\nFacing a forced retirement or you're being offered a package and you're not sure what to do yeah or you're working at a company that continues to force retirement and you've just been fortunate that it hasn't happened to you know yet right then this is something to pay attention\nBecause the big question one of the big questions that everyone has when they come in here if they're still working as when can I retire right and when I retire might be the question of\nUm is it okay for me to accept this package on being offered in how will that work and how all my money last if I Do or will it last if I Do on the other thing is um you know hoops it's not it's not one gonna retire they're making me go right so how does this work and how will my money laugh is\nIs is my money go yeah am I going to or we you know my my spouse and I are we going to be able to sustain our lifestyle that's the big question and you know a lot of people\nThey're going to be able to sustain their lifestyle but they're scared to spend the money 'cause you don't want to be older and out of money you know they blow through too much too fast so I mean there are a handful of really big questions that are on\nPretty much everyone's mind when they're facing a situation like\nThis and unfortunately if you get it wrong it's you know sometimes it's not fixable if we don't figure it out yeah really well\nSo let's talk about some of the questions should accept a retirement buyout offer typically one that will include a severance or take my chances and stay with the job\nAnd people ask a satellite\nSo so what are your thoughts on that\nYou know here's my here's my thought here's my whole salt right here on earth that whole thing you're one ... one whole thought on that please please do not go with your gut yeah please please get advice get get it analyze not just somebody who tells you sure that looks like enough money\nI haven't asked any questions about what you're spending on what's happening and why do you want to be doing and all the big things I'm not letting you guess at things and we're not guessing it thanks please please get a real solid analysis that you understand and can see\nHow your money's going to last as long as the both of you do well before you take this off\nAnd we have a lifestyle analysis process that we go through and you know you said if if somebody's not asking questions about how much you're spending and that sort of thing I think even brokers it you know big brokerage firms and people at banks ask people they do at\nMuch are you going to need and retirement the problem with that is in in please don't take this the wrong way are loyal and wonderful listeners\nOur experience tells us you don't know the answer right so even if they're asking the question if they don't have a process that they're giving you to say go do that\nRight so even if they're asking the question if they don't have a process that they're giving you to say go do this so that\nWe can nail this down and it's not a budget NATO budget work she lays out a much larger worksheets don't work so we so we have a proprietary process that we call our lifestyle analysis\nAnd or an accurate and we choose not to share it on the air 'cause we don't really want to be educating our competition on how to do retirement planning if they can't figure it out on their own [laughter]\nSo ah so this is if you're trying to decide do I take the ... or not you know Tony you just said don't go with your gut 'cause everybody's got is oh yeah let\nMe out of hair and any any me out so when you when you get a figure of thrown at you it seems like a lot of money at the time right I mean it seems like a lot of money and so you know seeming and feeling and hoping is not solid\nWhile we have a husband that we will be doing at some point and money is one of those things and money can be one of those things that super emotional it can be very fearful ... for a lot of folks\nUm what I Would say to you Grace Anne into every woman out there that's trying to do this for the first time on their own\nFirst of all don't be intimidated and don't say I'm never going to understand this to yourself if you are working with the right person who can not only know about financial stuff but it's able to meet you on whatever level you're on and can talk to you\nI'm In in plain English about what you're wanting to do where we need to go where are you right now where do you stand\nAnd just stay with you in that in that conversation until you understand and we move forward about what we're going to do and make good decisions I had I have yet to sit down with any lady that ... that I have not been able to\nSit with them at whatever level of understanding they have and we haven't been able to make clear confident decisions\nUp some of the one of the best I guess I'm compliments I get\nIs ladies telling me all the time this is the first time I've ever understood you know this is the first time somebody hasn't talked over my head this is the first time actually feel empowered you know so at least I've got other things that I've got to deal with but I don't have to worry about the money piece\nUm that's just that's some something that I Love to do you know it's a passion of mine and I think that everyone should have that level of confidence and understanding about their finances\nWell you know Tony it's not that complicated it's scary for people because they think that it is and chances are they've worked with people in in the financial industry before ... who has made it complicated yeah\nIn in the thing is is a lot of folks I mean Ted we catch ourselves doing this the longer you do something and become confident that it whatever it is I mean you go to the doctor and he starts talking about stuff and you're like wait I don't even know what that means you know it's because when you get in in a certain you know career field and you you know things\nYou start using terms in terminology that that are common sense to us and common place to us\nBut but not so much for everybody else and so I doubt I think we both of us even when you sit down with with single ladies\nDo a great job I think if I Will say we do a great job of something that is one thing is is really saying ... I'm not going to do that I'm going to talk your language I'm going to say things in a way that you say things I'm Blain things until you understand exactly what\nI've always said this there's a big difference between knowing something and being able to teach mhm\nI think there's a lot of people with a lot of knowledge that aren't good teachers right and you know again if if if we may be so bold as to to complement ourselves I think that's one of the things that we do really well yeah\nUse help people that are financial planners understand all this stuff\nAnd if you explain it the right way and you explain it using examples that very get right you know we talk about our fiscal house so we talk about building a retirement plans like building a house and we have it ... ... we\nThey get right you know we talk about our fiscal house so we talk about building a retirement plans like building a house and we have\nIt in ... we do this on our it just dawned on me you know we do a three hour retirement planning class we typically do it right here just state by her office in Inverness and if you would like to come to that is free ours are typically on a Tuesday or Thursday we used to charge tuition for it but we don't anymore\nAnd we do a deep dive where\nI personally think\nThis is one of the most valuable things you can do for yourself and your family has come to this class and I'm not just talking now about people that don't have a grasp on financial matters I'm Talking about people that think they have a a great grasp on financial matters right\nUnless you play on hundreds of retirements even if you're the one that manages all the investments and understands all that I think there's a lot to be learned in this class if you'd like to come to that call you can call the operator and leave a message and our staff will get back with your next week or you can call during the week and just get on the list for the next class it's nine at a triple zero six\nTwo oh five nine a zero zero zero six but we were talking ... in that class we're using a lot of\nA very approachable examples right for people to get it and you know you are we did one recently there were a lot of single women in there and they were given us the same feedback you know this is the first time this has made a lot of sense to us right\nAnd there's a different you just said something a second ago had you know even if it's somebody who does has done prior to retire at all of their investments in their own thing\nI'm there is a huge difference that people sometimes don't understand between accumulating money saving for retirement and now now I've got a teaching the Iliad I've got to start using my money\nAnd I got to make sure it lasts as long as I Do and I got to look at health care and taxes and inflation and\nAll the things that are going to happen to me that I've never faced before\nSo grades you know going back to your mom I mean I I Would recommend she come see us I mean you I mean uh but honestly\nYou really want her in and if you even if you don't know about money I think it's important maybe that you interview people with her so that you guys are comfortable with with the folks that you're working with it should be someone you literally felt like\nThere are taking your ... your mom by the hand and guiding her through her through this and not in a way like don't you worry about it we're going to just take care of it for you in a way that empowers your mom so your mom knows what she's doing and why she's doing it and then it makes sense to hurt that is important because\nEven if you think you're working with somebody I'll say this titled him even if you believe our hope you're working with somebody that understands that all quote unquote and has a plan for you quote unquote\n... if you don't understand what it is I when as soon as you retire or soon as this decision and this money gets foisted on you\nYou're gonna wake up in a sweat in the middle of the night is going to happen from time to time I I Can't tell you how many people say oh my gosh I Hope this doesn't apply to me whatever hurting the news and whatever the economy's doing and whatever the president's doing and whatever this is happening\nSo you don't have those panic attacks in the middle of the night when you understand what's happening\nIt's when it's the unknown that scares the devil out of you know so and and I know this is scary and I'm not making a lot of this I I care about this deeply because you know your mom should know your mom should be at least resting and the fact that she's got that cover and they will not worrying\nIt I Would say for you ... you know you said I don't know that much about this either get it I Know I Would say you know fix that before\nRight I I Would say for you ... you know you said I don't know that much about this either get ...
