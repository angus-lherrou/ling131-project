I tell you maybe all of them are having now is because of the a disco age and uh it was a\nYeah live through that area to write [laughter] maybe it could be that got them shoes and the bell\nBottoms and crystal ball and drugs oh man I just it was the drugs that are now were\nYou know something it's not it's not right there for a member Henry because you kind of touch on an interesting point if you go back\nTo the late seventies early eighties and you look at places you know like in ... you know north a studio fifty four\nOr you know I may be coming back down towards our Birmingham they used to be a place in Hoover I Want to call it think it was called a two thousand and one ... honesty or something there was a multi use facility a type of a nightclub and had a\nA dinner theater in it in a honky tonk and just go and you know I think sometimes that you know when you look into things like the accusations leveled against Kavanaugh doing that also have to take into account the context of the times I mean do you remember when we all went through that urban cowboy\nPhase them you know you had a there was a a bar in downtown Birmingham call Cassidy that that had a a a I'm a mechanical bull and guys are run around wearing cowboy hats\nAnd their boots and some of us still do it but I think you also have to remember that there was a period in time where that kind of a I won't say free loving mindset 'cause that was more of a sixties thing\nBut we did go through periods in our history where things were a little like we've talked about before how programs like oh in the family could never make it on the air tonight will and grace can but all in the family can't\nAnd I think if you start to to use the contacts of what the society and the culture was doing in thinking behaving like in that period of time\nKavanaugh's actions even if they were even remotely true are a little bit less in from that perspective or am I just wrong about that\nNow it on the head I I'll tell you what most people especially those who are joining in on the rampage to undo Kavanaugh knew that he lived through they would probably just laugh\nYou know they were just blow it off but now they use it as a weapon\nAnd and uh that sadly most of the things are going on today ten years from now Twenty years from now are going to be used against a lot of people especially those with their Facebook pages and all their ah stuff on the Internet that's all going to be a weapon against them in the future\nNo you know that you know you make a valid point\nAnd you know I I think it's very important to ah to again do you remember that context because you know culture kind of ebbs and flows and and there's there's no justification for an assault if that's what actually took place\nBut just you know going to a party where people are drinking and their disco dancing and they're doing whatever you know and then some of the bizarre clothing that was born in that time and they're looking at the sixties where the ah free love movement and looking at things such as a you know Woodstock and and what took place in these periods of time and you know almost everybody\nIf these were the ah free love movement and looking at things such as a you know Woodstock and and what took place in these periods of time and you know almost everybody in this country this roughly our age that live through that period of time\nProbably engaged now can be considered a least politically speaking questionable behavior\nThey're either eight and as he is and yes and then how many of these people that look on the left in particular that are chastising Brett\nKavanaugh or go with the heat newsroom one two or three or the going off to some nude beach in Morocco or wherever they might exist ... and I'm just ... the double standard is just not only is it ... but it's very frustrating\n[laughter] yeah and uh I Want to reiterate on the use of a weapon of all of their social media\n... people and I think that it's got to turn around the people who were using the media to go after people and if any of that sound you're going to be chastised later on for being fascists\nAnd and and you know participating in fascism 'cause that's what's happened and they just don't know they're doing it right or even have any idea how deep they are in the brown shirt movement\nIn restaurants pulling people out all that is what happened the under Mao and under or you know you're going back to the ... Rouge there is this me\nRedoing of the of the cultural a landscape in these countries to go along a and changed the language deliver change everything and the trees now have made a hundred percent turnaround in some aspects\nAnd all that those people are a lot of people that were in that the young people that were told to join join in by mail and all the rest of them they're the ones who are being chastised now because they were the ones who engaged in that behavior\nThat behavior like I said again we're we're in the middle of that now and uh I guess you didn't get to watch the dancing with the stars last night Ryan\nA and I'm not no wonder\nWhy we're having an athlete and delicate conversation [laughter]\nYeah a matter of fact I've I've never seen it in my life ...\n[laughter] I haven't either believe it or not but my wife watches it she likes it\nBut you watch the view Henry no dog she records it for me and then she makes me watch it because you\nKnow he records it for me and then makes me watch it\nYes she does she'll she'll say okay I got a snack and we're going to watch or you know I have to watch it with her she loves when I get a fury aged ... she just she just insane\nResented the definition of a ...\nYeah and she loves it so you know hey but such is great but after her [laughter]\nBut I ... didn't they guy wait a minute I wanted to ask you um recently as anything else\nTeacher in a teaching a bunch of judges on the Supreme Court in West Virginia and the uh um\nPDAs presidential alerts which are set out at the direction of the White House and are activated by female\nRoles outlined in two thousand and six law stays the White House can issue presidential alert only if the public or in peril or during national emergencies such as\nA Supreme Court confirmation\nThe alert cannot be a personal message on behalf of the president\nSo nothing's going to come with that funding little sound and then the president saying your big like the wireless alert system actually lost in two thousand and twelve but a group of New Yorkers\nIs suing to be able to opt out of the alert claiming it infringes on their First Amendment rights well good luck with that is the message going to say 'cause I think that would be great wouldn't it\n\nLet's just deal with that for just a moment shall we not sure if he part but the first Amendment rights\nThe first amendment does not protect our rights to say anything we want to say it is designed to allow us to motor\nAnd belly ache about government without fear of retribution from said government\nThat's all it is\nElse that too many people that run around screaming well abortions that constitution\nThat's all it is\nSomething else that too many people that run around screaming well abortions that constitutionally protected right\n\nFishing is constitutionally protected right\nSay whatever you want to say on TALK radio the same now and I worked on white but today around quarter after one local time or shortly thereafter you will be receiving a presidential alert that apparently is going to have the face of Donald Trump coming through your phone\nIs going to look like the old Batman show\nWith the ... yeah and then maybe signing up to the sky\nYeah and then you're fungus ma'am mhm pal yeah you'll automatically you mhm All right\nLet's get out to a that's got to the phones and we'll talk to bill hello bill how are you\nA good morning yo Michael I was listening to your show the other day and uh somebody called up about the was Ford's connection to the city I have you done any research on that you should up by now it was\nLike you know I've looked into it and I whenever I been able to find I can verify the veracity of any of it so you know it's not and we always try this program to you know document\nOur sources in you know reveal our research and I'm not found anything you know beyond some accusations from people like you know Alex Jones substantiate in that although you know I Can't rule it out I Can't\n... Michael Savage\nYeah I understand but Savage says\nWell this dynamite have use common sense of best for you were talking about it this morning for instance where she is in St for college down the street is the CIA a facility and she's a psychologist\nAnd uh I understand there that she teaches a lie detector test and how to avoid that\nUh the the the the test as such now that's very rough on a ... or father or her brother her grandfather all CIA people that's that's the deep a swamp my front\nIf it if it was proven drew it absolutely is\nWell it it's been proven that it ought to do is doing for just a pulmonary a little research on her the FBI or any good detective for goodness sakes [noise] and uh you'll you'll find out about her background the gentleman who just call up or boyfriend\nAnd that refuting yeah what you said about as I documented now but it's got revel in conversation\nWell like I said most of the stuff that I have found for example law she apparently according to one report called the millennium report says that she currently heads up hey C. I. A. undergraduate internship program and the problem that I have\nIs that you know we can we can discuss this kind of things and put it out there but without some kind of you know verification you know I run the risk of you know delivering speeches evidence such as Ford does during the hearings\nWell why isn't the New York times out of business they should be one of the ... why don't people bring lawsuits why don't we have a now that's a different question why don't they\nThey are what what what's wrong with starting a conservative ACLU an army of conservatives were Eikenberry crazy lawsuits like the ACLU\nWhat what what's wrong with starting a conservative ACLU an army of conservatives were Eikenberry crazy lawsuits like the ACLU\nAnd again I'm I Am awaiting an answer you know we talk about these things on the air as frequently as as weak and vet them out why there has not been another organization I think primarily because conservatives don't rolled out why are we talking over the course of the last couple of weeks how would like to say many in the conservative movement man up for just that reason\nWell I'll tell you one thing if we don't wrap ourselves around the country during your ad that's what's at stake here it's I don't know I completely agree with that\nYeah we didn't win the second World War by Mr nice guy if you watch a private Ryan did you see a few New Yorkers and people from the hell's kitchen south Philadelphia areas like that what they do the Germans they shot him\nA ... or whatever and I share I share I share your concern\nOkay thank you thank you ... [noise]\nWe have to walk the line here and the reason that we do that is that if we go out of our way to make comparisons without the benefit I'm very stark proved\n\nIt calls everything that we talk about it and the question\nNow going to bill's call\nTheir stuff all over YouTube and the middle of the report and literally dozens of others\n\nGot one here from what's it called earth and the necklace dot com\n\nPeople to realize that when we do our research and when I say we mean you for this show where we're going to sources\nAnd news sites that have are established\nAnd yeah we do go to some off the wall places but you know I I hate to bring him up God rest his soul but we're not Josh coy\nWe we don't have the connections he hand so he had all these connections he had these programs on his computers to go into all these uh dark Web sites and then he had connections what what's the guy's name out in Colorado\nUtah about Hodges Hodges the Hodges um art bell type of people he he had those connections I mean that's why he moved out to Colorado for a little while but we don't have those\nIf we had those we could do more research in and out trust me when I say I am doing the research on it I got ... I got to tablets I'm working trying to get this stuff so I can get something together so we can do a show on conspiracy theories this this month\nAnd ... part of it um the what's it called a remote viewing is part of it you seen the movie ... who's their goats yes you know that's a ... a true story right right\nLooking into some and that happened at Fort Bragg rouse that at a compound near my old shop so there are stuff like that we're looking into for a particular show but\nWhen it comes to stuff about Ford yeah their stories about for that she um dabbles and um hypnosis self hypnosis where you can plant yourself in a situation under hypnosis and when you wake up\nIt well something else that has been a long time\nSelf hypnosis where you can plant yourself in a situation under hypnosis and when you wake up you believe it well\nSomething else that has been a long time policy on this program and that is that we would never use\nBlogs as a resource doesn't mean we will report on what they are contained contained within but we don't use them as validation we can't afford to do that\nWe do everything in our power to present the facts of the facts are no\nThis is one of the reasons we don't get turned to break that I Am so amped up about the cabinet all thing because we know we can prove this we know that we can prove what we've proven so far about Christine Ford predicated on eyewitness accounts and her own testimony\nBut I mean some of the ones that you know that that are reporting this freedom outpost dot com\nAsylum dot org the Trump times dot com\nShow far blast blog dot com\n\nAnd I like Michael Savage matter of fact we're supposed to have it on the program a couple of weeks ago but uh we ran through a little scheduling conflict\n\nBut there are people out there that will walk that fringe lung\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nSo we want ... it'll be ... do you do thirty seven ...

and\nPeople from ... eight six six five five one nine nine three three let's get back to the phones and we'll talk to any hello Eddie how're you\nGuys are they pretty good [noise] I was a wise man was stolen that's what I call for a guy ... bottom but there is no you're right that burger somewhere around but I Can't figure out how the lady I\nFelt so ... when it was probably ... years old Obama's college transcripts ... explain that to me\nI I've got no explanation I truly don't\nYou know why why the world you know does it take a year year and a half to uncover Russian collusion but then we can draw the FBI investigation to Christine for up in four or five days\n[noise] [noise] oh well that's just the oil was today that yes\nYeah I think you're right Eddie ... All right\nThank you my friend and survey you going to Russia now there's a story popping up that we got a follow up on that says Mueller binge drink during the day in his office and some FBI insiders are calling for an investigation into that oh really yeah\nMm So I guess this whole thing is turning into a scene from Charlie Wilson's war\nYeah and also there's a report that a two or three of his uh investigators\nHave also quit mhm yeah well this week yeah yep\nYep people they had it I mean people just like you know there comes a point in time and all of our lives where you know we can agree to disagree we can not agree to disagree but there comes a point in time where\nTruth matters facts matter integrity matters and when you are willing to forego your integrity your credibility your morals your mores your character just to prove a point\nWell that's that's a sacrifice to most people are not willing to make you can have\nYour own opinion you can be entitled to your own opinion but facts are facts and whether or not they're related to Kavanaugh or the Mueller investigation or any number of things going on in this country the truth is the truth and we and we might not like the truth\nBut if we are not willing to admit the truth in the face of our belief systems and we are willing to forego our character\nTo admit the truth in the face of our belief systems and we are willing to forego our character and the pursuit of that proves I'm Sorry that has a price that is just much too high to pay\n\nAnd now you've got this story came out yesterday the confrontation between Jeff Flake and the protesters in the elevator\n\nIt has been discovered that they were paid by George Soros that by the way is not a conspiracy theory most of the major news outlets are carrying that story\nThere's a course was a confrontation that inspired flake to call for the FBI investigation\nThere were three women that were harassing like in the elevator\n\nBut apparently the seemingly organic protest\nThe women involved came from a nonprofit called Center for popular democracy that gets its funding from George Soros this according to records\n\nAnd now I think her name is pronounced our ... is the primary woman that confronted flakes with allegations that she herself was sexually assaulted is the co executive director for the center for popular democracy a George Soros funded organization\n\nWonder what her paycheck is a month and he just went up she's got a raise then again she might be working on straight commission for every congressman as you can turn it was getting rentals call hello Randall how are you\nKnow they are stretched\nOut it was the most intelligent on you've ever already\nIntelligent or provocative compelling [noise]\nI have a soft spot in my heart for Charles I will admit that he\nWas one of my very first caller is one of my very first listeners any has been there for the entire last ten years so yes I Will admit\n\nYou know it's funny but if you actually Google his name there are media outlets out there that have referenced\nHim so yeah Randall I mean there are some credibility to your observation what's your favorite quote\n[noise]\nDon't do no time with no concubine\n\n'cause that would tell you that Brett Kavanaugh now is standing there is anybody in this listening audience\n\nThat knows how to put on the pursuit of a woman that's Jackie from bad summer\nAnd he has called many times do regalia lives with his exploits\nBut I Do like Charles I mean how can you not\n\nSo back to and can you hold true\nAnd mind altering a let's just go back to the CIA stuff\n\n\nSee I don't need programs like M. K. ultra to be mind altering\n\nSee I don't need programs Y. M. K. ultra to be mind altering I don't need the mind altering from that because I have this\nEvery day at a couple of minutes after ten when we're packing things up and getting ready every day I have the exact same for the exact same thought\n\nI've had every single day for the last ten years the moment I get off the air and it goes something like this what the hell was that all about\n\nAnd today is absolutely no different\nPhone lines are all ... nine three three yeah George shores is funding the destruction of America\nWe've got a Christine Ford working for the CIA or presidential ... which is going to prove once and for all that the White House is spying on you and Gail ... a mind altering program by the federal government utilized any confirmation proceedings ... and all\nThese calls these stories your conspiracies in so much more all on the next thirty minutes of the ... the all stick around ... coming up again and thirty minutes worth of egg arose ... break come back on the other side take your calls when they expect\nThey are going to deem\nAs a worthy\nNational alert moving forward I have no idea if there's going to be in the future a regional used for this either in other words you know hurricanes for example\nBut yesterday at one Eighteen local time there will be a presidential alert just testing this system\nSpeaking of what you just said with the weather and all that they actually the national weather service in conjunction I think is with FEMA they actually set up remember a couple of weeks ago when their test and um the sirens yeah and they were just testing certain\n... the city that's right\nNow they have it with your phone alert when people get the severe weather phone alert it's for a particular squadrons of the national weather service area right so it's not going to go out all over Jefferson County right when we go out all over Shelby County can be for your specific area of where your phone is\nBut that's probably oh I'm going to work

Jay be Pritzker he's a democratic nominee for governor of Illinois improperly receiver at three hundred thousand dollars in property tax breaks in a scheme to to fraud taxpayers and right next to it\nEnded up ... bad I Can't get away from the pop out you know I gotta I gotta watch what everything everything I'm doing if I go out and look for a bully stick for Stella\n\nAll of a sudden I'm

just got to put that out there what are you laughing at\nMe [laughter]\nVery true very true well I mean as you are yeah this Julie sweating to kick ass Christine Christine forward she didn't need two beers\nCourse Chinese to front doors she does need to front doors and that raises another question if you're in a small five hundred square foot apartment I mean this room\nIs probably what would you say a hundred and Seventy five two hundred square feet something like that yeah it's probably about a hundred and fifty four hundred and fifty five hundred square feet is nothing\nIn the apartment that she's going according to your previous boyfriend of six years says that she installed according to her to him he he never saw it\nAnd the apartment that you did according to your previous boyfriend of six years says that she installed according to her to him he he never saw it a second front door and Casey was ever accosted by anybody that looks like Brett Kavanaugh again\n\nSo in that are currents which Dorothea choose end I Want to know if there's a number one and number two on said doors\nBecause apparently in the apartment that supposedly she added a second door that she told Diane Feinstein she did there was no way to add a second door with the exception of next to the front door\nWell here's another question if she uses one of those doors is their role where she has to dress up in a costume and yell legs and make a deal and run through it\nYeah is Wayne Brady standing there with a microphone\nThat\nWe need to get into this big deal of the day yeah let's check on before it's news and find out exactly what the door usage wise you probably get a better story of Babylon be or the young in ... which is in Alabama where ...\nThis story just gets\nFunnier and funnier and it it at first it was funny strange now it's funny ha ha because it's so unbelievably ignorant\n\nProof of a poisoning young women or drug in young women the proof is in this so low cup\nAnd how close Kavanaugh was standing next to the punch bowl but why did you see the interview he was standing next to a punch bowl but it wasn't really a bowl it was something like something else that contained punch\n\nThis is from the a waterfall curls girl\n\nOh wow yeah but then we got this Illinois governor hopeful he's a billionaire he's a Democrat and\nHe has the fraud taxpayers a lot

ain't going to\nBe on MSNBC or CNN and be a contributor he's probably doing the right\nThing but he will never be remembered\nAs someone truly great especially if he decides to mess this whole thing up I kinda feel bad for the guy I must be getting old but Jeff Flake\nHe could do a little bit like Lindsey Graham is done rehabilitate himself in the eyes of red blooded Americans by taking a stand ... poor old Jeff Flake\nI mean how many Americans have seen the clip of him being cornered by the woman in the elevator and then he folds up comes up with is where we need to know a little bit more\nAnd he's put all of the American people Jeff Flake has put the American people through what we're going through this week we're talking about these things right now because of just like\nWell

luckily there's people out there doing a lot of work\nBrett Kavanaugh said he felt like he was in the twilight zone I feel like I'm In the twilight zone you know why because Mitch McConnell is showing fortitude Lindsey Graham\nIs an chained in the last week\nI don't know what's gotten into their Republican some Republicans actually making some stands\n\nI jokingly talked about the curse of McCain last week now I'm beginning to think some people are are are they breaking away from that just like I don't know\n\nHe's still under the influence or something that's kind of something that may be a little more a little different Scooter Libby your your going to Libya you're like why do I want to go to Libya\nWell in Libya there is this is just as just a reminder of how policies do eventually have real world consequences okay some rasa Libya never heard of a profit Libya as fun\nIs an ancient city on the Mediterranean coast there is a Roman amphitheater there the pink\nColumns or towering above the turquoise water is a world heritage site classed as endangered by UNESCO\n\nMe read the Senate's well here's what's happening to people are shooting it\nWith small arms fire they have a shot at it with more\nPeople are shooting it with small arms fire they have a shot at it with mortars\n\nShell casings and bullets still litter the ground the earth a year after clashes between rival armed groups locals local say snipers\nPosition themselves at the top of the amphitheater\n\nToday the ... around Seventy commerce forty five miles from the capital lousy early abandoned in circle by parched grass and weeds so why is this endanger it didn't used to be in danger big day\nThey're worried about it just being destroyed because of the craziness that isn't that country now you know where I'm going with it\nSince the toppling and killing of Libya's dictator Moammar Gadhafi in\nTwenty eleven so bravo has become a key departure point for illegal immigration into Europe\n\nSo what happened this causing an ancient historic site to be at risk and there's a place for more and more illegal immigrants to leave from that area and head to Europe\n\nThe toppling and murder of Moammar Gadhafi and who caused Moammar Gadhafi's government to collapse in Libya ... let me think\nUh you want a gas mask I\nYeah I don't know exactly who that would be\nWho could volunteer ... eleven\nWho would make that happen ... who was president who was secretary of state I think we're in such a ... I'm\nA ... ...\n... I Know I Know what the answer would be what would it be\nThat's nonsense and you should know better\nAs true I'm Sorry I Apologize this ancient Roman amphitheater is not in danger UNESCO doesn't know what they're talking about an illegal aliens are not using as launching point to stream into Europe now you're right it's nonsense\nBrock Obama was president Hillary Clinton was secretary of state and they made the decision that Moammar Gadhafi needs to be removed all during the Arab Spring\nThat just won't democracy over there they just want to say even greater dictator who actually had to stabilize the country\nAnd now it is a disaster\nBut we don't wanna talk about that either there are so many things ... all Americans have to do is look at these kinds of things\n\nBut it doesn't matter let's go to the United nations this is a story of at MSN dot com\nThe United states has decided to clamp down using sanctions on Iran correct\nWe yeah we talked last week about how the European Union was willing to work with Russia yes I said Russia and China to come up with a workaround\nThe European Union was willing to work with Russia\nYes I said Russia and China to come up with a workaround of us sanctions so they can keep Iran a foot Jay that gets keep doing stuff with Iran now guess what we get a United Nations\nCourt this is the story by Jan hit up and Danny kill the UN's top court ordered the United states on Wednesday to lift sanctions on humanitarian goods for Iran in a studying repeat to US President Donald Trump\nTear a un held his victory after the international court of justice ruled that sanctions reimposed after Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal put a rainy and lives at risk\nSo that when we're ... the last four ... Iranian lives\nAt risk owe us said the case was ... list and only about a few sanctions although decision is still likely to Raul truck huh it remains unclear whether the judgment will be anything more than symbolic because both Washington and Tehran have ignored ass EJ decisions in the path\nWhy do we fall and these ... that the United nations they're fine with a bunch of crazy people have a nuclear weapons and they're going to say hey you can't put sanctions though because it might put some Iranians lives at risk\nThis has been on the patio we should tell them that your number one in a not very nice way you don't talk about Roman symbol of discontent\nScratch my I got a ... if he knows big dive itchy nose we'll be right back like a cloth or something [laughter] Dallas your machine through Scott ... radio\nIf you're in the market for a new Honda you need to visit Honda Jazz they carry only the best the best we're talking about ... under just for the only Alabama hundreds you were to be a president's award winner for customer satisfaction for three strikes you're whether it's silver service tons of jazz for his top notch they carry over Seventy\nFive used cars and they have Honda certified unit that undergo a hundred and twenty five when in fact should still have ... warns visitor call Honda jak drove\nA three eighty five zero one zero zero\nStopped water damage before it takes a toll on your home basement flooding can cause major damage to your electric systems rotten wouldn't structure along with major health concerns basement water proofing and crawl space and kept solution is just another way Alabama professional services is here for your home abs use this top notch product installed by", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "03"}
