I don't know that they necessarily know\nThat they are refugees or that they are illegal in that sense\nOther than the fact that they are being sold the idea that they're warning here that they're supposed to be here because they are encouraged to be here that's why you had the photo journalist out there that's why you have the ah expediting of them traveling through various countries that have stricter immigration laws than we do those laws are not being enforced\nI think they're being sold a bill of goods because they are coming here in such large numbers and those numbers are growing I mean\nThink about just what you got seven thousand people in this caravan ... guy right now you post anything on Facebook that is like really\nWhat's the word I'm looking for insightful or informative Oregon funny how many whites do you get I mean most people have you get fifty school you get a hundred and that's kind of neat you get a hundred and fifty I'm a superstar or social media how in the world do you get seven thousand people marched together\nMoney I mean how do you explain that to me ... you know you've got a a a country that does not have the cyber infrastructure that we have here in America they they don't have nationalized\nOr or even regional newspapers\nLike we have here in America they've got very restrictive access to things like TV they\nAre for all intents and purposes is not a third world country at the very best Second World country\nSo how do you organize seven thousand people the majority of churches in America can't get seven thousand people enjoy service\nOr

perimeter turnout results in some states are sending Republicans renewed warnings on a so called blue wave just weeks before election day we are two weeks were moved ... beginning tomorrow\nMore than four boys three million Americans have already voted and results person over the weekend in Nevada for example and the cat a strong Democrat showing across the board in that state and a washer county where Reno is located and where Republicans hold an edge in voter registration\nThirty four hundred a nine Democrats voted in person compared with the twenty three hundred and sixty five Republicans on Saturday\nRegistration thirty four hundred and nine Democrats voted in person compared with the twenty three hundred and sixty five Republicans on Saturday\nAnd on Sunday when many polling places and businesses in the area or a close\nOne thousand and nine hundred twenty seven Democrats cast ballots in person compared to fourteen hundred and eighty three taking into account mailing votes after two days Democrats have roughly six percentage points or a six hundred vote lead there\nDespite Republicans built in registration advantage now over the years we have called ... and early data and the question for no other reason\nThat it rarely is an indicator of what turnout looks\nLike on election day\nWell obviously have a much better idea and you also have to consider the fact that we're talking about Nevada as opposed to the rest of the country by at one particular report is pointing towards Nevada as a possibility of there being a strong blue wave turnout however\nGetting out to the polls on election day is going to be a whole different\nSet of circumstances and so we will not really no based upon these numbers exactly\nWhat is going to be the turnout according to Jon Ralston the editor of the ... on the part of the Nevada independent\nWho has called a washer the a swing county says that never happens here\nHe noted that in two thousand fourteen ... had a double digit lead in that county after two days of early voting the results do not indicate which candidate or political party actually received the votes but analysts say it's common for more partisan votes to be cast their ballots\nEarly and that's an indication right there that uh it may very well be the uh the blue wave is showing up to do the damage that they're going to do early but that might not show up on election day\nWow it's a sad it is too early to draw definitive conclusion that this stage\nRalston says he cannot recall any instances in which early voting trends work indicative of an election cycles overall outcome however you do also have to remember we are speaking solely about the state of Nevada in this case\nSo let that be a clarion call to all of you that may very well be\nRead that you better get your butt talks stolen Cohen notwithstanding to the holy places this Tuesday week\nBut it's a little different in Florida though yeah 'cause their tallying up the absentee ballots right

billion dollars not I'm not a big lottery player not a gambler at all just never been one of my\nThing is that right yeah juicy did\nNot as I take a trip over to the job of July to pick up a couple lottery tickets just to play along just for fun just to talk about the what ifs\nSolve store the other day out to find it and other posts that are bringing back up again\nJust for fun just to talk about the what ifs\nSauce or the other day out to find it I'm either posts that are bringing back up again tomorrow but I'm\nThe guy was talking about how um\nThe lotteries being purposefully inflated to get more people into it\n\nWhat yeah yeah they're they're saying that they're they're inflating the the amount the prize amount to get more people to play it to put more money into the system\nMhm let me tell you something\nIs what I saw yesterday was any indication they ain't got to inflate nuts and I am not exaggerating I mean I'm telling you I'm not exaggerating when I say at the pilots station on the second exit going in the Georgia\nAnd we ran over there was at our ... we ain't got nothing to do it's a beautiful day we hadn't spend a whole lot of time together let's let's grab ...\nAnd just take it or a little bit of a road trip but if we happen to end up in a lottery state will pick up a couple of tickets which we did\nEasily easily\nA hundred people in line\nEasily\nAnd the gas station across the street the same\n\nPeople were parking in the middle of the parking lot and leaving their vehicles running\n\nNow this happens to be a truck stop is well\nTruckers couldn't even get in and out there were people everywhere\nSo I don't know about the need to uh falsely inflate the numbers because right now the lottery is at one point six billion a third of that was it the pilots station\nBut you know what's interesting your chances of winning the lottery all at one and three hundred million maybe we need to combine the lottery with election day\n[noise]\nI mean people were coming out and spending the rent money\nCast your ballot get a free scratch off\nYeah there you go\nYou have a hundred percent I I don't care what side of the aisle they're on you'll you'll have a hundred percent turnout even people who disagree with the lottery they're gonna come out for a free\nTicket but but ... isn't it interesting to note that you couldn't get into this park ... it was a line to get in a longer line to get out\n\nAnd people were coming out in droves to drop twenty thirty a hundred why do you find me a hundred and fifty dollars a lottery tickets your chances don't you

percent\nOf the money that is spent and I think about this for one second during a big a big lottery pay out like this but I jackpot sixty Seventy percent of the money that's spent is on scratch off ticket\nBut yet those scratch off ticket through there all the time mhm so what is the motivation because the scratch off tickets are completely unrelated to the jackpot\nSo what is the motivation for buying the scratch off ticket yesterday for example as opposed to the day before the month before the year before it's the mob mentality people get their they're excited about the one point six

district\nOld money boys just a San Francisco and northern\nKill let me ask you a question David that that has been one of the mysteries to me is because you get you get a conservative I myself I Am my family in the middle class family\nPublic schools that you know the whole nine yards public university\nAnd and I'm supposed to be quote unquote the friend of the the rich and all this but you have these folks who are supposed to be liberals they go out and tell people\nWere going to get your stuff for free we're going to do all these things\nShe doesn't do that but but there's but there are so

she really believed that she would destroy the whole system\nWell if that gets into you know what a chameleon is some fake yes and uh you know they're in the south are like well you remember a Lincoln was a Republican so the south were hard Democrats for almost a century it right\nRemember Lincoln was a Republican show the south were Democrats almost a century ... Franklin Roosevelt get it all turned around\nAnd uh now Republicans are trying to hide Abraham Lincoln or you know they're actually trying to get rid of the money and get rid of Lincoln's face all over America\nWhere does that I haven't seen that I mean I've always believed to be with that thought Lincoln was not exactly as great as you've been billed as but I didn't I was only aware of the Republicans were trying to get rid of Lincoln\nWell shoot out here in California that the Republican Party just what three years ago or so I think it was at the end of ... anniversary of the civil war I guess hundred and twenty five years or\nSomething yeah I don't know if I Would guess\nYeah and and the head of the Republican Party in California was trying to to basically banish Lincoln\nBut uh I'm telling you\nBut uh I'm telling you and I look I'm going to give you I'm going to try to compromise the newly genetically modified super strong version\nIs bad for you\nThey can they had in the

a stroke let me say this I Would say this I can pass a drug test I I Know there's no doubt I'm just trying\nTo tamp down the uh\nIs wonderful was great it filled with everything for everybody\nI didn't save face everything for everybody I say they fixed up for me when I was doing [laughter] ah\nMy restless leg syndrome em on your opportunity was hey okay\nDid a cure for good no a big ... the crazy thing is\nI mean I'm being serious when I say this but if they would've left me alone and let me continue smoking pot right I Would have never got addicted to lower times\nMaybe\n... noted there no because I had to get off the marijuana mhm to get a good job okay so I ended up having to\nGo to the doctor and the doctor had to give me lower tie ups to take care of my paying that I was ... when they left me alone let me keep smoke them apart I'd have been fine K we couldn't kill you or do you\nMiss their lack any drug not just the legal once legal way any drug there are probably side effects\n[noise] Oh yes there is getting high is very much a side effect\nPossibly possibly negative hill side effects that\nAre that you know I don't know what that says from the doctor we can establish causation but what we can say is it recreational\nMarijuana users are at a higher risk in terms\nOf strokes now this is\nWhy how I get off over there trying to do a public service announcement trying to look out for my friend\nBig day gets me sidetracked I Want to ask about this one\nRemember when you and I were in school and we had to study the Salem\nWitch trials now most of us studied the Salem witch trials and we were told a couple of different things it depends if you went to school early enough you were just told that it was the Puritans\n\nPeople who were basically crazy religious folks who decided that they had which is among them who were just purely young women who were unjustly accused and the patriarchy went after\nHim and put them to death because they were Puritans and there's no such thing as which is\nThat's one version as time when you\nWere able to have that talk to you in school rolled in with\nThe book or the the play the crucible which was about the Salem witch trials but you were able to study McCarthyism which was McCarthy Senator Joseph McCarthy saying that the ...\nTrials but you were able to study McCarthyism which was McCarthy Senator Joseph McCarthy saying that the government was being ... by communist and everybody's saying you're crazy person looking for which is there's no such thing as which is and\nThere's no such thing as the communist invading the government and you are\nOn hands and then we find out what forty years later when the files from the former Soviet Union were released and we find out that Joseph McCarthy was indeed correct which makes the whole play the crucible and what you and our tone school\nBunch of hooey sorry I Know that upsets people over you know the old AOL dot com or we had a little ongoing dispute about that but that's just factual okay I'm Sorry turns out McCarthy was way way way more correct\nThen he was mistaken\nSo we learned that which is we're not real right Christian people around the world talking about\nThings like demons made fun of\nCatholics talking about ... made fun of people talking about spiritual warfare made phone up there's no such thing as which is you're an idiot Scott you know there there were witches those bunch of Puritans were just crazy so then I have to call a timeout\n\nAnd just ask the question of this has popped up before because the same type of things have been done to Donald Trump\nI'm looking at the video\nA group of sixty people gathered at the cat lend cat land books in Brooklyn New York at seven pm on Saturday\nThey gathered there to watch now want you to listen to what this is so ... is is this true or not to watch a group of which is cast hey hey put a spell\nOn Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\nYou can watch the video if you want to I may I may make a note might put it over at Scott Base in dot coms or you have a link to it\nAnd we put a a which is to website\nGot it okay the crowd of bystanders which included protesters wearing antifa garb\nAnd born again Christian who were counter protesting stood outside the bookstore as several which is performed the heck seeing ritual owned the recently confirmed Supreme Court justice inside\n\nNow some of you want to say Scott you know there's no such thing as which is\nReally\nSo am I have to question these people who are sitting there which is they say there which is we now believe that boys who say there are\nGirls are girls am I not supposed to believe that these witnesses who say their wages are which is personally I Believe there are people who work in dark magic I Believe there which is I Believe there are people\nWhich is personally I Believe there are people who work in dark magic I Believe there which is\nI Believe there are people who tap into demonic dark forces Scott you're crazy I don't care what you said you can say I'm Crazy I think the bottles clear about it there are people who are which is it's evil is darkness that's the way it is\nBut my question is historically\n\nWhile we're we're all told there weren't which is\nWhen there are people all over the world who claimed to be which is\nThere were people who ... who were which doctors there are people who were involved in ... there are people who put heck ... trying to put Hicks his own people all this stuff is around you know going on around the world now we have people publicly putting Higgs is own\nElected officials or appointed officials\nAnd I'm Still supposed to not believe these people are legitimate was not even\nPower there are ...\nI don't know what are they doing so we're there which is when the Salem witch trials happen\nOr does which is just start popping up you know year before last last Thursday is that when we're just started last Thursday there weren't any before it's crazy stuff I don't know Brittany ... she's like what the heck how are you you're doing good All right\nYou believe in which is you know any do you do\nAnd they're good riches right of course not over there by [laughter] which I always wondered about the good which thing to let's go to the phones but you guys way yeah Mike welcome to the program things were listening\nTo morning good morning I have to say that I Will side with a big day on the stroke thing yes as\nOr probably a seven year period back in the seventies up until I was about twenty five twenty six yes uh you couldn't put the dope that I spoke to in a full size\n[laughter] and Maine\nMan all my buddies you know war with the whole time yeah and as far as I Know none of us have ever had a stroke or that's what forty years ago\nAnd it may be stronger now but I guarantee you smoked up a enough of it to make up the difference\nIs somebody should have killed you I mean ... been killed off by now I'm just telling you they are yeah\nYeah I mean we we should look like the walking dead from strokes", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "year": "2018", "city":
