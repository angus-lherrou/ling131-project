proud of it but the morning hers Roxanne went through a rather nasty divorce just what it is what it is\nShe was somewhat reluctant to expose that on the air because she did not want to be judged by people because of that failing and all the horses I don't care what the impetus of them are they are failings\nAnd they are tragic and they are painful and they are hurtful and I don't care and the best of circumstances it still that that particular there's children involved Roxanne decided one day to go public with that on the air she was terrified mhm she did so explain\nHer own shortcomings at our phones exploded with support from people that had been there and we're so unbelievably moved that there was somebody in ministry and that's a darn big church over there that can somebody in ministry understood their plight\nShe offered them grace through her confession and they were turned it back to her and lives were saved hearts were healed and faith was restored vats powerful celebrates you for doing something very similar\nI appreciate that it's very um nerve wracking I'm I was nervous just coming on today simply because even in the book or what we're hearing back a

the book\nAnd he called me after he rented and he said um I just needed to talk with you I just did not wanna she joined email he said I was going to scan your book and just give you a little polite reference and just move on he said but when I read the first page you had me hooked\nHe said I could not put it down he said I sent my family to the movies on a Saturday Night and I told them I'm going to sit here and I'm going to read this book I'm going to finish it tonight\nAnd he called me and he said I just want to thank you for being so transparent he said you share things in this book\nThat I don't think any other person would share because of afraid of what people are going to say what people may think about you he said you just through all that to win and he said I applaud you and he said I thank you for that because we needed somebody to actually be real with people to let people know that\nYou have been where a lot of people are today\nSo I'm just sharing next door to let you know this book is very transparent and lay my whole life out there and it's\nProbably going to be used against me\nI have seen instances here recently where my past is being used against me and I just have to live with that because I Know that I don't know for the people that using it against me I'll live from our heavenly father who not only for gave me but we are stored me and he kept me in a place to where I could to ministry\nWell you know I've said this many times before and I'll double down on it if I Am an alcoholic and I am looking to come clean\nI don't want to talk to that

somebody who's kind of out in the ... and because of the your your relationship to your church the fact that you're a pastor the fact you have a flock\nWhat are you hearing in the streets are about the way people are responding to this if anything at all\nI think this is just a sign of division and it happens everywhere and there's always been division we social media twenty four hour news everyone now is able to access it\nMore which means that everyone has the boys before when all you had to do is watch television you just watched it you form your own opinion and the only people that heard your opinion are the people you had lunch with out on the job\nNow because the Facebook because a pod cast calls of social media\nEvery one now becomes a contributor right and so we're able to take that and run with it so then all of a sudden someone comes up with a great statement it doesn't matter if it's true or not if the appeals to your opinion\nHey that and run with it so then all of a sudden someone comes up with a great statement it doesn't matter if it's true or not if the appeals to your opinion it gets shared so much that the more shared now all of a sudden it must be

know you know we've talked about the past that you know that you and I ... when we would we would finally stories and James and I talked about this as well one of the underlying well kind of rules we had\nWas that we would never use blogs\nAs a point of reference for any political point now we'll let blonde or come on and do it but we would not use ... bloggers opinion to substantiate a political viewpoint we one of the heart or ... dollars that are sort of material\nI don't think enough people realize that when you put any kind of a post on Facebook you are in essence blogging yes and you bear a responsibility because you're not only blogging you're broadcasting and how many people do we know used to give him a great read it all the time that\nHave you know four thousand forty five hundred and five thousand friends loosely on Facebook and yet there are talk radio programs in on some of the smaller markets they don't have that many listeners ... but they have that kind of power and influence\nPeople don't seem to understand that if you have a an active Facebook presence or a Twitter account or whatever you bear some responsibility for what you put out there\nWell the national media is also contributing to this because how many times I'm going to use and cold or a friend of the program I'm gonna I'm gonna use her as an example how many times\nHave we seen Ann Coulter tweak something and then all of a sudden you see Fox News or CNN reporting on what am culture sad about an issue\nSo it's almost like when we tweet or say something now all of a sudden that's becoming the story right and it's what people say about the story that becomes bigger than the story itself\nYeah we saw that in the presidential alert thing yes yeah one woman said that her phone had been raped\n[noise] opinion has become fact now\nYeah yeah and well if you think about it from this perspective it's like everything in the narrative has become Common Core yeah you know who wants to cook it could equal five if I feel like I'm a five if I feel like I'm a five that day yes and in common core map that is the kind of questions we're dealing with inside\nShould have their own

in this particular our so tell us what's going on in your world\n[noise] you know I'm just shocked at how to pray for the last ... can get every day now I guess token negroes okay for all of us to use and racially profiled black people are falling level\nI specifically that black people that are conservative you know I find it interesting or support Trump\nI I find it interesting that the left is a really all about it all\nThere are conservatives you know I find it interesting or support Trump I I find it interesting that the left is a really all about it ... the diversity ... unless of course it has to do with diversity of thought\nUm if you don't tell the laughs wine and you'd like to leave the plantation\nAh the laughs plantation ah you will be insulted you'll be threatened you'll be harassed you'll beat demeaned a and the left even pull out their race card by calling other uh blacks or that support Trump token negroes\nYeah that that's what caught my attention this week\nWell you know that on top of things like ... you know Hillary Clinton so you know what I'm saying and I'm paraphrasing that the days\nOf civility need to be over and uh area code are coming out with you know when the Republicans go low we should kick them\nAnd the tolerance the law the acceptance is oh it's so palpable and then of course you've got antiviral raising cane across the country and specifically in Portland, Oregon as the police than down there and allow you know that I'm mob of an art gifts to run wild and that shouldn't work\nMob yeah don't use that word mom now CNN's like no we can't use the word mop they're treating it like a four letter word well what do you call a bunch of\nThoughts with mass over their face and Billy clubs you called them up right I Know that the left believes that they own language I I Would like to know what kind of dictionary they use because Webster dictionary doesn't seem to be sitting there description of anything\nThey must have their own progressive dictionary that they just haven't shared with the rest of us\n[noise] so what do you make about some of the chatter that we're hearing in response to Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation\nAbout the the Democrats are now talking about the possibility possibility of overhauling the constitution or packing the court which is something Franklin Roosevelt tried corps we're hearing the I word as well\nRelated to I Kavanaugh's removed from the Supreme Court the possibility of term limits on the Supreme Court they are they are literally take him or at least attempting to take the constitution and shredded and turn America into something that you know it would be a shell\nOf its former self it would cease to be\nAmerica in philosophy at that point in time though I realize that many of their attempts and and their their desires their goals would be unbelievably difficult to achieve\nWanna walk all the ... you can take us wherever you go to the super ... or ... it's like having your own personal news anchor in more\nThat's not creepy and all your home town got an countries\nTo be a super station one on one building one [noise]\nLiving it up\nYour God and country superstation one on\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise]\nHey Iraq about having a conversation where Megan bars ...\nDot com talking about some of the a progressive silliness that we have to deal with\nIn this country all across this country you know make it I Want to get your thoughts on something else a story\nThat I had not reported on yet but this happens to do with a I don't know if you saw this or not these are this group of girls recalling the mean girls in Pennsylvania have confess to targeting a boy with a false sexual assault allegation because they did not like him\nAnd we're seeing not just what's going on in politics today but so much of what seems to be coming from the left and this is a course on the Capitol Hill's meals on Capitol confirmation that now these girls have been accused falsely accusing this boy and it's basically just completely up ended his life\nThe people do not understand in this country that much of what we're seeing foster from the left is legitimately changing the fabric of the culture in this society as a whole\n[noise] well politics is downstream from culture and so you have the left who is now weaponized sexual assault allegation a and\nYou have the left who is now weaponized sexual assault allegations are and have convinced\nA a through their actions\nAre that these allegations can be used as weapons as you just point out these five girls the mean girls in Pennsylvania but these mean girls in Pennsylvania or just a microcosm of a much larger movement a and I refer to that is feminism to oh\nI'm I wrote about this on ... dot com actually I couldn't believe I had to look back three years\nUh it was I thought it was last year it was three years ago um about the watershed moment\nUh they refer to as a watershed moment for title nine now you remember the I'm sure you remember the um the genesis of title nine that was simply well we want girls play sports right so you know they do the title nine thing and then I you know we've got girls' soccer and we've got girls cross when we've got girl's bathroom we've got you know girls sports all across\nThe country well what the Obama and Biden did\nI'm back in two thousand I was fourteen or if they put title nine on steroids and they basically threatened colleges that if they needed to treat sexual assault allegations are as civil liberties violations I'm\n... and so they weaponize their sexual assault allegations but then threatened to the colleges that if they didn't have a title nine I'm kind of jury by meaning you had to hire more title nine administrators to deal with this one in four\nGirls are raped on campus claim which was a bunch of poppy Koch um but what they did was weaponized title nine\nUm and so you saw many women\nAre there were over a hundred cases throughout the country of these allegations on campus many of which turned out to be not true but the presumption of guilt was placed instead of the production of innocent\nInnocent was placed on the accused many of the cues where young men we saw this in uh the University of Virginia for example where the gang rape allegation against the fraternity was complete bogus\nBut uh you know the fraternity got lost its chapter and many of the men got their lives ruined a we saw this at Duke lacrosse uh the Duke lacrosse team we saw this at Columbia University where the feminist smarter strapped a mattress to her back and said she was raped by a fellow\nColumbia student and she turned out to be an absolute liar um but when you take these allegations to the national stage like they did with Dr Christian forward it with specific\nA political theater and they did so with intent or they want it to create a martyr out of Christian for but more importantly they want it to use and ah Christine forward uh in order to uh convince\nA many women that were watching that a simple allegation was enough to be believed\nYeah because ...\nWell right and that's that that's why I say what politics as downstream from culture so where do you think that these five a broad in Pennsylvania got the idea that they could use a sexual assault allegations destroy their wives\nWell you know looking back at things why did withdraw you name a lot of folks might have forgotten\nThat on the prosecutor you know Mike knife on in this situation\nAnd of course you know his wife was eventually ruin as we found out he was completely full of it as well\nBut I Do find it very interesting that many of the strategies that we are seeing from the Democratic why after politicians themselves have more of their way into ... and into society and the case of the uh five mean girls in PA\nThe Democratic laughter politicians themselves\nHave more of their way into culture and into society and the case of the uh five mean girls in PA as you point out not really take into account not only the fact that they were breaking the law but the fact that there are ruining the life of a young man and this may very well be something which trails him I mean what happens if this young man\nDecides to run for or gets nominated for the Supreme Court twenty five years from now or thirty five years from now now we've got these allegations of sexual misconduct going all the way back to two thousand and Eighteen\n... right right exactly you know I had a conversation with a guy a last night and he had thought that you know Brett Kavanaugh was guilty and I said based on what I said you know what to do you want me to go back into your high school yearbook would you like you know ... are you telling me that you're a saint\nUm you know what you want your son or would you personally want to be accused of sexual assault or based on something that perhaps happened thirty six years ago um and and when you start talking through that's\nThe situation I think people realize the severity of these allegations and the threat that that would pose to ruin someone's life but you know as Stephen Colbert's writer\nTweet it out and then deleted it she said well Brett\nKavanaugh's life was ruined that mission accomplished basically\nRight yeah that's about the politics of personal destruction this isn't about the protection of when this isn't about sexual assault or this isn't about the empowerment of women this entire woman's movement this feminism she loves it meant is about the destruction of that um it is about um\nIsolating and isolating the target\nAnd destroying the targets and the target is male\nUm it that that the core of Simon is I've always sat next to this cheaper for as messengers and as this deep seated hatred of men of the quote unquote patriarchy I've never seen such a movement that wants to just um claim victimhood\nAh we've got more victims now than I can count on and that's why it's always chose never to be a feminist because I saw many Simon is a around Bill Clinton that chose to look the other way and sort of stand alongside a it has many victims including Monica Lewinsky\nWell I find that to be unbelievably troubling in so many people don't understand exactly what they're tampering with and the fact that uh you know this is a this is a trend in this country with which is going to dog eyes\nFor I'll even her how many years and and and maybe even generationally speaking\nBecause you know we've got into these deep conversations when I was doing a TV program early this week talking about the practice of\nLynching of African American men back in the forties fifties and sixties and the deep south and by estimation which quite frankly are probably low even about the N double ACP\nUp to twenty five percent of the young black males that were hung from a sour apple tree in the deep south\nWere hung over accusations of sexual impropriety and or assault in the case of Emmett Till Fifteen year old boy whistles and a white girl but this narrative of the women cannot fabricate things is it it's historically accurate and it's a miserable and they and people don't seem to understand\nThat you know we lost a chunk of a generation over just said accusations\n[noise] All right ... exactly and and it's because these accusations are now used as political weapon um it's the end justifies the means a ... that's how it's always\nThese accusations are now used as political weapon at um at the end justifies the means a ... that's how it's always been with a lot uh does all women not eat all the air it is a is gross and [laughter] 'cause I don't want to live in a world\nWhere all within our speech believed uh and I don't want to live in a world where all men or ... or I Want to live in a world that we've been living in over two hundred years which is an option of innocent a and due process\nWhere it goes back it goes back to the the concept of trust but verify and Patrick ... what we're trying to do with the confirmation or bread governmental\nWith a registered Democrat doesn't understand that um they might choose not to understand it because again the whole um system is shifted towards their power\nDo people that voted for Democrats cause I I I have\nIt because again the whole um system is shifted towards their power\nTo people that voted for Democrats 'cause I I I have to think the politicians understand this but the the rank and file do they not understand that there is a cousin ask relationship between the census and the electoral college\n[noise] no I don't think a lot of people did really understand that I was a you know I really started to understand that so when I started writing specifically about voter fraud\nUm I did not realize I just assumed that the sun's included the citizenship question you know uh but it does it [laughter] so now I\nNow at ... ... it's going to a unless of course these you know a hundred and twenty three different organizations that are filing lawsuits ah should win in a court of law and what the many judicial activists\nOr that the Democrats have tried to stack and the court a specifically like the Ninth Circuit I mean we'll see how these\nLawsuits right and right\nLet me let me ask you a personal question Meghan you know I've been friends for a long time so I I feel it ended up being a little satirical here but I just want to kind of really break this down to the ridiculous\nLet's assume for one moment that you go out with some of your girlfriends and you're going to go dancer and are going to go to a concert or whatever\nAnd during your your night with the girls you get asked the dance by you know and attractive young man 'cause I Know the German or perpetually thirty eight\nAnd you hit it off you have a great time maybe he buys you rely Beijing and uh you're really just kind of you know you're getting along really enjoying your time with this particular gentleman is it a legitimate question for you Meghan bars as a single young lady to ask this guy he's married\nYes\nOkay so what's the difference I mean it's an obvious question if he's married then he's off limits well if you're not a citizen then you're off limits\n[laughter] that's a good analogy is a good way to play but I mean it but it's true\nYeah as as American that single women Ohio we have a right to know who's around All right we have a right to know 'em who's resigning here legally or illegally uh it it became why because it impacts as\nA personally a and financially or and I have every right to know whether or not this dude as married or whether he's single and actually that's one question I always had to ask [laughter]\nSure it is because of the obvious question\nYou just don't assume by virtue of the fact that he asked you to dance that he has the right to ask you to dance just by his mere existence in a nightclub or wherever it happens to be\nThe same thing with your your your existence here in the United states do you have a right to be here do you have a right to ask me to death I mean it's it's so unbelievably basic it's mind numbing\nAbsolutely and you know and you and I have talked about this before there was a financial advantage of course for illegal aliens to\nTo reside here ah you know they're given\nQuite a bit um ... there was just a study published about how much Americans spend on illegal alien birth a three hundred thousand illegal alien burst ah happened or just in this past year you know he did announce it costs a miracle\nTaxpayer about twelve thousand dollars per birth I and then beyond that um you have I Can't which you and I have talked about and I've written about\nA which is the individual tax identification number that illegal aliens happy 'cause they can't have Social Security numbers while what under that number they can claim up to twenty dependence and that was twenty and and claim childcare tax credits so\nEach illegal aliens and get back up words towards twenty thousand dollars\nIndependent and that was twenty and and claim childcare tax credit so each illegal aliens and you get back up words towards twenty thousand dollars in tax refund\nUp based on a these twenty exemptions but they will claim\nAnd those dependents that they claim don't even have to prove they exist yeah ...\nYeah we don't we don't have that luxury as American citizens Julie we can't we can't work the system like an illegal alien camp a week and I think have to claim only ten dependence approach towards ten and we have to provide Social Security numbers for every dependent\nYeah you're absolutely right it's it's mind I mean I mean every time I talk to you I just get this headache my frontal lobe Megan appreciate it so very much unfortunately amount of time travel is sort of how they can find you learn more about you and all the respect of places a\nA Reagan they've

T. I. Q. C. A. P. G. N. G. A. F. N. B.\nHey that's that's what I was thinking I I mean I was just I just wanted to make sure 'cause I don't want to give out fake news that we want to make sure that there's there's there's ... it's not just a oh\nGee B. T. Q. you got a bunch of teas and the season the peas in in in jeez in their right\n... have a who's coming what did they go swimming vowels and they're so we can actually say the word very vowels yeah

okay I won't tell you the story of yes number one\nWhen it comes to politics and stuff I'd definitely want to know what to other sources 'cause you know that that's who I go for about politics okay yep yep\nYou still got that pulled up of what she said I Do okay let's break it down number one she's just telling you who she's going to vote for that is true okay no problem I have no problem with that I don't really but then the rest of it if you look at it [noise]\nThat's right All right so that's my that's my two\nSided with Jennifer let's start with the application process to college and for scholarships and let's go ahead and do that first were you cannot no\nGender and race\nAnd let's just base it on your your scores and your grades and if we start there a lot of this will start working its way out\nDo the job market that'd be a good starting point\nBut is it to a standardized test depending on your race aren't they great it differently because of your race I Believe I read\nIt is going on over there are points given too so that's one of those standardized test should not know your rights either\nYou're right great point why about in\nYet so you shouldn't know anything about the candidate nothing zero not at not not where you live it cuts on tight it's like if you got a candidate who lived in that same yeah Hitler's you're going to automatically assume that they are well off\nThen they come from a good background and if you come from the Alabama oh let's just say you know that I think they don't have a lot of money so you already thought a prejudiced about this person\nAbsolutely absolutely I agree and that'll get us closer to where we should be the whole time\nBut the wealth is never going to let us get there anytime you try to ... ... it's it's weird juniper because I've been there we've talked about in the legislature fixing state hiring or or college applications of taking out\nThe ability to know what someone's races and they go crazy on the left when you're thinking wait a minute I thought we were supposed to not take these things into consideration\nOh no that's not the way it works\nIf we want to really truly me I'm across the board fair that would be the only way to be fair because then you're really hiring a person\nIf we want to really truly across the board scared that would be the only way to me because I really find out\nWho they are what they are what they stand for it yeah ... yeah I get a job at a person that you're really deserve to be there\nThat would make a huge difference it really would outweigh what I have a good day I'm going to try to learn about the big guys go put me in a bad mood just a second Taylor Swift I sit outside\nWas part of the Hollywood crowd correct and you went crazy crazy I Know but it sounds so much better than you were\nNot offended no I just said you know you were a defensive because she's ... and I should have known I should not say anything about a musician 'cause that's

say you know bill\nSo you know I think there's a thing you know you've reached middle age when a basically all new music just crap\n[laughter] car thanks for calling I'm middle aged for most of my life car guy and I'm being serious is the heart attack I've all I've always liked ...\nLiterally the first twenty seconds of a lot of music and then after that the songs that somebody like big guy would say man it was awesome it was a ballot did was they did ten ... ten minute phone I'm like I was nine and a half it's too low\nYou know I could not identify Kanye West's song from Taylor Swift song to be honest\nWith you [laughter] I just you know I don't listen to either of them right but I I Will say this\nYou know when Michael Jackson was up and running\nHe bought the elephant man bones for what a hundred thousand dollars\nAnd his comment on on that was it cost him a hundred thousand a bomb but it got even billions of dollars worth of publicity right and ... you know big day you know enough about it that you can comment on the quality of Kanye West music\nGiven the genre how many people are there out there that can do just as good a music is Kanye West can that we've never\nOf a lot a lot okay okay so you know ... music may or may not be a better product than a lot of other people out there but we know ... night so\nKnow Tom Gage music may or may not be a better product than a lot of other people out there but we know ... night so at some level con yeah he has a very good understanding of self promotion right\nHe does now that he's had enough he said enough\nPublicity in the last ... there's probably worse untold millions of dollars\nRight and you know George Bush hates black people oh Taylor Swift shouldn't be getting this award beyond say should\nEt cetera et cetera and now you know he's on the make America great with Donald Trump that may or may not be all self promotional guy guy or you know we have to understand that he's very good at self promotion otherwise we wouldn't know who'd Kanye West was now\nWell I tell you how do I take that back ... because we would because of the ...\nWell again you know\nThere are also noticed self promotion yeah they're good business I think\nThe big thing to me about Kanye West right this minute\nIs he represents the possibility of independence thought for people that are supposed to their minds are supposed to belong to the left and they're not supposed to think independently and that's why he's such a big threat right now\nAnd that's the reason we hear so much negative about him\nFrom the media et cetera et cetera I mean that's a serious threat to them oh my gosh if people start thinking for themselves the left it just completely fall apart you know\nWas that that is that is why are they um while the left\nIs so fascinated with Kanye West right now is that there is a tremendous fear that the millions of people who follow him regardless if they think he's crazy regardless if they think he's doing it for marketing reasons just the simple fact that he says\nPeople aren't going to tell me what to think I I I think he actually said something about they're not going to\nUm keep me on the plantation something along those lines and that is a monumental threat to the political left in this country because of that ... vote in the African African American community breaks down by just a few points\nThey're done across the country they are done\nOkay suit you only like twenty seconds of it that's actually perfect that's about all that's about as good as they got twenty seconds that pretty much All right I'm Rome thirty seconds or let's go to the polls Henry welcome to the program thank you for listening\n... that live below twenty seconds but\nNo it did not I mean it's like ... just of the music before he even start ... thing and that's usually what I said most of the time music is ruined when they start singing Scott but he's the one hand me what's going on but he had heard from you in a while\nWell I've been most of that just had this time why that's why I'm but I'm Glad I'm Glad to be busy but you know I Do miss calling in your survey I tell you shouldn't you just need to learn a little are strong and that sort of a day to do the sarin gas just destruction not\nMan [laughter] that would help my show growing leaps and bounds [laughter]\nWhile you're willing to have to explain to your beliefs as often you just be sexy and that's\nAll that at all their lives are coming in here just in my my chip 'n' Dale outfit just mad sex it up a little bit\nOh I Am in my head but you just take a dollar bills [laughter] you know you moved up when the ten dollar bills ... ... yeah\nYou know your nose was state that bad you know I consider fun job but one of his kids weasel\nThat's a good boy big day was fine with that ... like some sort of I call or\nTwo on now is a genius at like a bird from a ...\nWell you know what and when your neighbor kid results you're really put something on them\n... is it [laughter] well you know what and when your neighbor's kid results you're really put something on them [laughter] and uh as long as you don't send them to public school you might be okay\nWell what did you go to public school you're ready bill spin on it with a with a name like that so I guess schools pretty busy [laughter] but um you know I said\nSomething last march or April I said the Democratic party was done at least in one way to do today but I'll tell you it's done I Believe that was done that and the Republican Party and far behind if they don't get their act together but more so than anything I said it was going to be a ... and this is why because I think\nWest to say and the same thing that I saw back in two thousand and ten I'd just been putting together\nThat slowly but surely if you paid attention to the to the poll that are slowly but surely Democratic Party has been losing sight been siphoning off the uh the the black caucus\n... not the one in Congress but the uh the the people that vote for the Democrats have been slowly being siphoned off by the Republicans because\nYou know they don't often like just like all other race just don't think they're like no and they have the dirt and the individuals just like anybody else\nAnd I wouldn't notice I guess it was I grew up in a in the projects at at one time I had to take a you know we were living there with my parents there for a while myself in Reno heard all these words no word should be banned\nThe person should be banned that uses words\nAnd it's such a manner to hurt other people but reject this ... you know what the left control even our speech come on when it's just kind of stopped when are we going to start fighting back and that's why the Republican Party has got to follow the Democrat Party not far behind because there's no fight and now you're witnessing how\nPeople rallied behind de leader that fights\nAnd wind up getting we're going to recognize that cause even Kavanaugh messed up when he went to the wall Street Journal and\nMade and did they did the apology editorial that that bothered me greatly you're\nAt it it made me mad because here we are on a wall and a child when I was putting his passion you know what men ... media but he was the worst choice that are as long as ... as far as the judges on the Supreme Court\nBut it was a political genius because I don't I you know I'm Mike Michael how it would disagree with me but I actually began to think that\nHe picked them instead of Amy ... just because it was a bushy and he could get except for what he could what he did add up I'm somewhat everybody to stand behind him these are a bunch of wean east\nLike uh the the leader of the Senate or McConnell I come on\nHe has not who everybody thinks he is he ... he is a much mouth spineless politician who has no backbone whatsoever but you know why when the Bush power base\nAnd that's what guided cabin and the into the into the SCOTUS that's what did it it was the best you\nKnow you might make new friends you know it's\nAll right well you have a great day and I'll call you back here and I\nDon't know about a couple of days man Celia or tomorrow or whatever the ah no but he's right about that if the Bush if the establishment the the the Bush family side of the Republican Party they would have more they would have been happy\nTo jettison ... Supreme Court nominees but Kavanaugh was one of their guys\nTo jettison one of Trump's Supreme Court nominees but Kavanaugh was one of their guys\nSo it was easy for them to begin the weak side of the party is the establishment sad and\nTrump made a brilliant choice he got to have any new they wouldn't throw under the bus he knew he would be tough he knew his supporters would be tough\nSo but now the problem is how will he really be as a justice I don't know let's try to go through these\nPretty quick if you all we'll every body and welcome to the program\nHad\nLost their good Murph Murphy welcome to the program so say you're telling me I Can't talk about the United negro college fund\nWhere you can if that is done good work historically\nA lick the thing about how to build on what Clark was saying a lot of these people in the music industry are doing what they're producers in record for the you know people tell them to do they dress the way they tell them to dress they sing what they tell them to saying it\nIt is it is the ... and we forget that sometimes because we say we grew up 'cause I've never really been a music guy but we grew up with this image of\nI don't know think of some old guys a Johnny Cash\nOr you know writing songs who was the coal miners daughter Loretta Lynn writing songs about their life and they how they feel and it's got something to do it but so much of\nMusic today and probably was the end is entertainment it is and you decide someone else decides to look at the boy bands the boys wearing socks bands\nThey just pick some good looking kids come up with a good rhythm run 'em out there and market the heck out of them they make a few million dollars they burn themselves out then they go get the next set of four boys and put 'em in little suits and they do the same thing over\nI'm the I'm telling you that might not from someone who's not emotionally involved a vote ... to talk about music and I know nothing nothing about music but I Know about the theater\nAnd I know about marketing and ...\nAnd then all of this is entertainment it is how it's cooked up it's how it's presented and Murphy was making the point they they wear what they're told they seeing what they're told they have all kinds of people working for them to make sure they're imagery is the right way do you know how they treat\nYou she tells you that I don't see where to go\nIt was that\nAnd that had hard on the rich from begin ridge route their own around the president wearing the cowboy hat rather who are any anybody on that picture I don't know who the ball here to do to ... go ahead ...\nWell I mean I was just that was the biggest thing and that and you know Tony west I think at this point while he may have you know quote unquote broken free of the plantation as far as thinking I think he's mostly reacting ... is\nA legit newfound freedom of thought so he's not really committed fully into the realization of where he is compared to where he was from and [noise]\nBut you're absolutely right that is this people thinking for themselves or at least acting like they're thinking for themselves as a very scary prospect to ah the left and to the people trying to pretend like they're in charge\nYou got it Oh absolutely thanks matter of fact priestly anybody ... you know ...\nHelped me was that was that was the man is the modernization act\nThe charge you know absolutely ... appreciate what you're\nGonna you know ... there'll be what about what that would only known as the modernization act I don't know but I think the other ... that was during the ...\nOr ... throat John\nOh behind beyond rich yeah I think that was a bar Miller from ... really yeah you know if you remember the ... the movie they just come out and not only emerging I Do that as a song you probably like the whole thing do what you actually do like the whole thing that\nGoes I have not changed that the vast majority just because\nI Want one so I I'm surprised that you were about music ... blue am all the politicians\nI I'm a I'm a moderate God or\nWas behind the Christine Blasey Ford stuff from the beginning I think about what that means we were told Christine Blasey Ford would just like\nOh I just I'm I'm I I I didn't know how to get in touch with anybody and ah I just wanted people to narrow\nAnd vote YDF Chuck Schumer's machine was actually\nA part of this now his claim is that Chuck Schumer\nHis machine was involved in the operation to leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter to the public caught and said I Believe the Schumer political operation was behind this from the very beginning\nForeign wrote democratic lawmakers in July accusing justice Brett Kavanaugh of misconduct more than thirty five years ago during the Senate committee hearing in September Ford says she does not authorize the letters released despite being made public\nHere's the interesting part and I want to get you up to speed own one person you remember a individual named Preet\nBharara and you're like Preet Bharara I've heard of that pre ...\nWas the was a a U.S attorney\nIn New York I think in Manhattan\nAnd Preet Bharara\nWas one of the people who did not turning on his resignation when Donald Trump was elected\nPresident\nAnd presidents have the ability to appoint knew U.S attorneys right that's just the way it is and everybody pretty much says look I'm resigning and or because the new president is going to get to\nA point where\nHe served as us attorney in the southern district of New York for two thousand nine to two thousand\nAnd Seventeen according to ... he had a reputation for being a crusader prosecutor he was one of the nation's most aggressive an outspoken prosecutors of public corruption but he also he became famous because he refused\nTo follow attorney general Jeff Sessions requests for all the remaining forty six U.S attorneys appointed during Brock Obama's presidency to\nResign so pre didn't resign\nThe horror did
