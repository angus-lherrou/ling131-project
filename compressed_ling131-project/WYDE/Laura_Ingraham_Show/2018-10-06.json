Kentucky and so we went up and and uh bought a ticket went in to see him you know and a\nHalf for about twenty or thirty minutes based show uh some of the neighbors in the hood sorted out now a lead written bags get up and saying [laughter] so and ah he didn't play no chance was very first you know and and then a\nA need to know the song and manage fat out again so I think he's wanting to put us in it's put a stop to it [laughter] and that allowed me to come on up and he had no idea how little Ricky Skaggs was when he called me up there on the hour six years old and uh\nHe called me up and I walked up to the front of the stage and he just went down and grab you by the arm it for me [laughter]\nHe was so strong\nAnd uh so got me up there and said why do you play their voice and I said I play the mandolin and so he took his big at five mandolin off which was about the size of a of a guitar for me you know right before the the six year old terrain\nAnd put it on me and and that rats strap around at work which fit me you know and uh and away we went and I I signed a song called ruby are you mad at your man [laughter] they knew it you know it was a big Osborne brothers' hit song and so everybody kind of knew it\nBut uh that year then the next year I'm outside the sweat for seven years old uh here in Nashville a television show you find that on YouTube actually okay so that's a anyway that was that was my early beginning ... Stanley Brothers right after that\nUh you know got this shows that they haven't got acquainted with Carter and Ralph and uh\nAnd then you know I just kind of kept on you know kept on learning instruments them and and just trying to get better all the time\nWhat would you say is the most rewarding experience from your career I Know you've had you've had a long one and it's gone up fast because I as a child I remember once you open that door [laughter] and I remember a lot of your lawyer popular songs I'm actually song some of them\nAre different places but what would you say is the is the kind of the the pinnacle for you of your experience as a as a musician\nWow well you know getting I'm\nGetting to play with musicians that I've gotten like with both the hears a you know first Hornsby an obvious to records together and he's a master musicians loves this musical as bluegrass loves the last one we slice for sure and um\nYou know get into you know saying was very gift in the end of the ... and ... recording recorded song with him and um and then doing are you doing a song with ... wide I mean he was a you know he was he's a\nAh certainly out of the boss of artist you know a with a raccoon sewers and uh\nAnd I mean he was a you know he was he's a ah certainly out of the boss of artist you know a with a racket sewers and I'm a ... you know\n... who was it really gave me a shot in the arm I think when I come and work with her band I thank God gave her music or shot in the arm 'cause I I I kind of helped\nOr influence her in bluegrass than and I think uh you know a rose or send the snow and a lot of stable her Christmas record those two records that thank you know she did so just basically\nAll ... you know well yeah and I think uh I think you know\nMy you know me being in the band gave her the freedom to do it how she knew she could columns someone that knew that knew a lot about the music that help help guide her through it you know as well and uh she uh you know she was really great for me and and getting to work and her band two and a half years and she was ashamed to show me off\nYou know on on on on her record and uh\nAnd uh so that was a that was

the show today it's it's getting to be a big time of year for you and your industry you're a bow hunting and and a bone manufacture a and and call tell us what about yourself and then we'll we'll talk about new breed archery\nMy name's Carl null and uh\nLike I said I'm a native Alabamians afternoon ground a little bit but I seem to always make home here in Alabama [laughter] you know\nI grew up in uh near democracy Alabama has ... county ... county that area is a great and Iran yeah a grip on a small farms ...\nHad a lot of access to soybeans and wait so that definitely increased my hunting and getting bit and then a from their uh got out work for a a small company that had moved to Alabama and got a fire what go\nBecame an engineer sorted out out of the archery sad I mean as far as engineering I'll\nStill stayed in archery tournament shooting a that was kind of thing but\nIt wasn't gonna work and archery and then uh for some reason my passion drove me back to it and now just couldn't leave it alone always trying to build a better mouse trap and that sort of where I got started and then that's how ... it was really trying to build the the best of myself and just turned out that everybody else sort of like hey\n[laughter] good well you know I I was a ... a month with my brother and brother in law this past weekend and both of them are big bow hunters and they and they were talking I was telling them you're going to be on the show and both of them were talking about what a great product you make and we my family I have a shot in several years but we used to ... we've been shooting for twenty five years\nOr and they just had really positive things to say about your bows and I I guess before we talk about your product somebody who introduced you to bow hunting how did you get involved with that\nWell like I mentioned I I grew up on a farm just outside of democracy so it's pretty easy arm life a little bit um I think it's the catchphrase we just called it live and back in any way uh my dad obviously got me involved in hunting in general a at a young age out\nI was the end it got to you know go out after dad and kill something and then leave pretty well a guy that field dress a day they're right there you know an ugly and bring it home and mom was making breakfast while we were finishing up there and I will but\nSleep pretty well a kind of field dress a daisy right there you know what you you know bring it home my mom was making breakfast while we were finishing up the deer and now we butchered our own and then\nAh he had a boat on the wall or carbon man I wanted to play with that thing all the time he kept telling me as too much for you you know and so um [noise] as I got a little a little older I kept\nNagging him and I think he figured out a little bit and I was getting you know close to the teenage age and he was thinking you know I got to do something to keep them grounded so\nYeah I mean a boat and got very carbon and started teach me how to do on a little bit now I I'll be honest we probably did not know we were doing\nA show you'd be a little bit of age range I'm forty five so you know back in the eighties so uh yeah\nAnyway we didn't know what we were doing but we got out there and he he was determined to ah to give me a deer and believe it or not that the first year I deal with a boat actually feel the same way you would if you were on a a a man job or a shotgun honey\nJust of the woods and push one bombing and I got lucky in the same stuff for me to get a shot at it I don't know that also\nYeah so I was so thin that fourteen out well I think I'll start the report came right around there I'm Alice who is coming from that point or has been a major part of my life I now hunting and generally as but for some reason it's my passion\nSure and you know you travel all over I I've seen some videos tell us a bit of a I mean do you go all over the country but wanting or maybe all over the world\nWith well with me and my family are able to do with the with our with our cattle herd and\nAnd being just being a part of the agricultural community mom my dad was with foreign credit for forty years and and I'm I'm going I'm twenty [laughter] so you know it's been a a farm credit and an agriculture has been a big part of our lives for many many years and and it's been it's just a great thing to be a part of\nAnd to be able to help people expand\n... uh they're they're a production and and or just\nBe able to do what they do with a better\nA lender this focused on what their what their processes and with our\nPatronage programming and everything being able to give us some money back at the end of the year when we get done and and lower that affect the cost of borrowing money you know it's just a really great to be a part of their team and and\nSee and he's gotten figures running and and ah the combines running and right now it's\nJust a it's a fun time of year for us because they're they're able we're starting to see those all those uh investments come to fruition well\nOne thing I I like about your team as you you have offices spread all around the state\nAnd I know when I give somebody the name of one of the loan officers there with Alabama hack credit you are going to take good care of them and I get constant feedback from people saying hey they're Williamson Selma made it easy to work with ... you know made it easy to work with that sort of thing so\nI I mean you all do a fantastic job of making these ... eighty and your gas here in Montgomery our top notch man their top not\nIn operation a job than it is in a way I we take for great pride in what we do because they have what separates us from everybody else you know because when you come in not only\nDo we gonna treat you like any by where we don't treat you like to any other customer but you're going to become a stockholder Ryan or if you're an owner and in in then from there\nWe just build our relationship and and it's it's really easy to be able to to keep going on that along the way when we do meet that person and they bought a piece of property and then they want a tractor and they say you know will forever skin we do a tractor and yeah we can do a tractor\nOr can we build a lake yeah let's build a Laker fan and they want to build a large and yeah absolutely let's go build a large so we become that uh that Linder for everything that they want to do to to make that uh you know a lot of people just really want to be out there in that that goal of theirs to\nHave a place in the country under a tire or have a place where the family\nThat's way way become part of that dream and yeah and it's really really beneficial for for us to 'cause there's makes it fun\nI think the thing the thing I Love about you about your own as I said you were talking about being a being a shareholder is you know your your your borrowers have a voice because not only are they bought borrowers are also part of your party your company and so every body part of the team\nOr the patronage programs tremendous I had a guy called me of the day and he was complaining about rates going up a little bit as I look at you know back to patronage and explain it to them\nAnd you know you all been in that that ... percent range you know sometimes a little less\nA patronage and explain it to and you know your butt in that that one percent range you know sometimes a little less than a little bit more than that you know if you got a six and a half the interest rate than your effective right maybe more closer to five and a half by the time you get you get you patronage back is tremendous Programme\nAnd hotel which had been forced because they're part of the family explained it\nAnd that's right and you know every ... every loan a requirement is a year you become a a stockholder and do you have a voice in in college and the board of directors\nAnd if there's a concern that you have you have direct lines to either your lender the branch manager the senior lender\nAll the way up the line and and all that you you can get directly to those folks so you know any any time they see anything comes up we can we can focus on a need and make sure that we're handling anything that uh is is is needed by the borrower effectively\n... like I say you guys do a fantastic job and if somebody wants to reach out to you how can I get information about Alabama I cut it in general and then here specifically Montgomery\nOut at a in general best place to go to Alabama a critic dot com we've got a great website with a lot of information about our programs and what we\nCan do and here in Montgomery Ala direct line to the offices three three four two seven zero eight six six and even if you may be in another county will direct to call the ... needs to be to make sure we handle any requests that\nWay I Do a fantastic job but we've we've had travesty or known here not joke he's the bulldog man if he if he gets a chance at alone he's going to do everything he can to make that thing on again before\nBefore we get off the I get a real important question now did you use up all your eligible appeal nonfiction\nLand [laughter] [laughter] and I think\nWe need to lose weight you can you can\nBe good for the Malay the Indian on the phone maybe a quarter of a quarter I don't know but now we're uh\nIs is is stuff to was soon I Know they've got a lot of challenges up there and and those guys who got this you know we we will see them coming together yeah and uh you know it's uh believe me I Know those guys being in

ladies and gentlemen were with a house does radio network um your DJ Dale Johnson here with much behind the glass in her hospital studio of course ... is in Atlanta ga good morning gentlemen\nHey you're more than ... a lot to talk about in the news as usual things with your heating up man I'm telling you were a lot of things are going on and I'm excited about it is to bring it to you\nPay and we cannot way good morning Bobby ... a man that we're doing a survey looking good\nOh yeah it's a beautiful fall day going to be a little more and they're talking about maybe setting a record temperatures this weekend in the Tennessee Valley so\nAs the way it was here yesterday was Ninety two degrees here in Atlanta yesterday ...\nIs a you know just because the counter says the first day of full doesn't mean that the ah cool temperatures no to immediately show up although\nLooking in the long range forecast it looks like we may have a fall weekend next weekend all across the southeast so I don't know about you Bobby well yeah I Do know about you\nYou like this hot weather I prefer Dale and I we prefer the cooler weather so I Am looking forward to next weekend and you had to pull out your winter coat\nYeah you know about you but if you look\nAre there so I Am looking forward to next week in and you'll have to pull out your winter coat\nYeah you know about you know but if you look to ballot and look around the area here like I've been doing some driving around you know there's a lot of things going on on the outside exterior of some other people's houses you know a lot of people that were given their houses painted and things like that they're getting an extra push 'em and they got a little extra time right now because of the hot temperatures\nThat is true and you know a lot of these paints now\nThey are being formulated for cool weather the where the you know used to you know it had to be a certain degree before you could a pain outside but I'm seeing a lot of commercials and hearing things about these painstaking paint you know one is like in the forties and fifties have you seen those banks\nYou know I've seen them but I honestly have not had the chance to test it out but I you know as my experience you know we can still see you know when it gets below I think sixty degrees you know it might get that little bubbles into what our air pockets or you know stuff like that moisture gets into it things like that that I've seen\nWell they can come up with those uh uh what do we call them uh when it gets really cold you know what's those temperatures sub whatever sub zero temperatures don't have to worry about Bobby TBN out\nA lot of your\nUh he'll be in the nice toasty house maybe painting some inside it interior walls how 'bout that\nOh yeah you do that ... made a lot a lot to talk about here in the news you know I got a couple of things on the topics I'm On\nAll my exactly right those are to the top one floor in ... in a fresh coat of paint\nAnd then outside minds all the states not siding but its metal siding I guess you would call it right so I don't ever have to worry about the wood rotten around the house but uh it needs a good pressure Washington so Bobby get over here with that pressure wash\nRight oh yeah you know I take care of that either and let's get something done [laughter] so but uh yeah I Would say you just go on a huge going to spruce up\nAnd to sell\nThat actually and that is where people are doing that because if you notice any if you look at some of the numbers for the summer season you know home sales new homes and this and that is new home sales were down a little bit over the last two or three months people are saying in their homes and doing a little remodeling job is the reason why I brought that to attention\nWell that's true and Bobby what I mean you have across space by me\nNo I sure do and I always last year no not at this location you're on a slab yes I sure am yeah mad your cross pressure on negative slab\nYears wow mine's cross space well\nYou got some rangers are under the well the al ... and ... to me that's where I go hide one it's clean space so that's where and which means when capitalized across my so\nUh when I get in trouble that's where I go hide I mean I have to crawl in but there's enough for him to set up some place [laughter] and cry yeah shit some they go and that is that right under my son's room says who's crying or what's going on around here you know so oh it's just that it's just that hey that's what they say whatever we're Bobby right\nIf mom's happy nobody's happy but if they're not having nobody cares [laughter] and that's what happened but so\nBobby rent on time with that we're going to talk about some you'll never guess the hottest remodeling trends of two thousand Eighteen ... you know the first one is fresh go than fresh coat but yeah you're right I think so do you feel confident painting Matt\nOh yeah I can roll with the best of them but now my wife\nShe has a steady and she can do for tram the cut in and she is she is\nAwesome so I Do all the rolling with what is it the rover I use is a is it a sheep skin lambs skin it's one of those I mean it just gives you it goes only looked horrible within it dries is so ... lose while you ever used one of those type rollers Romney\nYeah you know about remember here on a show about the three I Try to go over there we talked about different in the paint brush a faint brushes in Brussels and rollers and all that and there is a big difference man you're exactly right and\nI just remember this a roller who is very expensive now the only thing is it's really useful you\nIt out now that takes a lot of effort to get all that pain now but when you're thinking well this was not a Ninety nine cent roller it's worth it to wash it thing you know 'cause this road rules actually between I think\nA lot of effort to get all that pain now but when you're thinking well this was not a Ninety nine cent roller it's worth it to wash it thing you know 'cause this roller was actually between I think Fifteen and twenty bucks\nI still don't think it's worth it okay I mean that's paying down the drain\nYou know and then this pill that thing off and Chuck it in the garbage\nI don't do it in the drain I Do it outside of drag my hose way down at the edge of my neighbors your\n[laughter] now that makes sense so pi I'm confident painter I don't want to [laughter] dude Bobby what about you\nOh yeah I can make the best investment you know a motel Matt right now I don't know if you've seen it as seen on TV that need a little spring oh my God just that and try that out now I don't know if you saw that\nWell these are seen on TV is ... my wife says I'm a sucker for those things because I just went and got something and boy it just is not working and I when I got it's called for wizard\nHave you seen answer lint roller no it does work for just a little bit of stuff but it self cleaning is what the cool thing is you stick it in this little thing and pull it out and it gets all the hair I have seen that well I got me a for was\nMy God [laughter]\nWell says a

another edition of retire with freedom ... hill this is my wonderful wife Tony joining me hello\n... year old Sony we've got a I think a really good show today because we're going to talk about some topics that um we find her own people's minds regularly ... and we're also going to bring up some things that maybe you're not thinking about but we think you should be okay\nSo we're going to talk about I Can't get no satisfaction or can I [laughter] so a little stones reference there we're going to talk about irreversible decisions\nSo or be careful when you're making a decision that you can't undo we're going to talk about reading the fine print in the financial\nWorld that is very important I if we have time we'll take some ah email questions from our listeners if you would like to get your question answered on the air go to ask freedom financial dot com that's asked freedom financial dot com we will uh answer your question on the air and we may also answer your question on the television show\nSo uh want everybody to know that uh we've been doing a television show for about a year now on CBS eleven AM on Saturday on Saturday thank you for that yeah\nUh but we've also recently added a the show to Fox at ten thirty on Sundays\nRight after Joel hosting yeah so ah about eight in ... so we used to joke about we used to joke about you know if you if you don't have anything to do on a Saturday Night you can always DVR the TV show in and watch the show on a Saturday Night so\nHonest honest to goodness had a family come in last week and they both said like at the same time we DVR your TV show cool [laughter]\nGo ahead [laughter] that's what you do after football\nSo I don't know I I might rather stick myself in the Iowa with a hot poker than ah\nI think it's okay though I think it's good yeah I think it's I think it's got a good a lot of good information actually won cool thing about it is we can use visual aids that you can't do on the radio so we've got you know some pictures and stuff yeah that help people think about the concepts anyway I Am digressing\n[laughter] she's your\nLet's get back to I Can't get no satisfaction so what are we talking about here I Can't get no satisfaction\nWell we found that people have\nKnow they want a high degree of satisfaction and return it but but it's kind of hard for people to really wrap their arms around that and achieve that for one thing the big question that everybody cares about is will not money last year I mean that is the number one big question is well my money last and\nThe thing the big question that everybody cares about is will not money last year I mean that is the number one big question is will my money last and do I have enough\nSo you know one of the things is peace of mind regardless of what's happening in the stock market\nOr around the world I mean so getting satisfaction from that I mean really answers the question do I have enough because a lot of times that we see\nPeople kind of maybe chasing returns trying to jump in the market and trying to eke out another you know upside potential as much as they can because maybe they feel like we're a little behind and we don't have enough of them are trying to play catch up\nAnd you know really it's about having the right dollars in the right thing in the market at the right time as opposed to just go in all in well I had\nI see both you know I see both things I see people that come in are\nYou know right now with the market's doing so well and have been for so long people are starting to forget what a real a market crash one correction looks like ...\n... and ah although if you think back to two thousand and eight just try to remember what that felt like and now imagine that that ... that that happens to you now and you're\nYou know instead of being Fifteen Years away from retirement maybe your five or four or three or two or one right\nAnd maybe you're planning on it being five four three two one but maybe your employer has other plants me have you know because we see this a lot where people get laid off and they were expecting to to work more and and that's that's a ... that's very challenging so I see people that are that are taking\nA lot of market risk right now because things are going so well and human nature we get a little greedy mhm right yeah we get a little greedy\nAnd uh and that's okay as long as it's money that you're not going to need to live on\nAnd then that in the next five to ten years and\nI Do also see\nA lot of people who are very concerned about the fact that the market's been up for ten years they feel like a correction has to be coming at some point they're closer to retirement than they were in the past and they're trying to answer that big question is my money going to last when can I retire yeah\nDo I have an athlete who I have enough in what happens if we lived through another two thousand eight what's gonna happen to me right if we lived through another two thousand eight and we say this a lot Tony but\nYou know we can't stop the market from crashing but we can stop a market crash from ruining someone's we're ... we do it all the time yeah you know I I think one of the most satisfying things for me\nIs when people come in and they are worried about the answers to these questions when can I retire is the money going to last is it enough and then we put together our retire with freedom plan\nThat goes through everything you know what are you going to do about how are we going to replace your paycheck how are we how do we allocate your investments if we've got money in the stock market how much do we allocate and how much risk do we take if we need income what's the way to get income and the most a certain way possible\nThat's not going to be impacted by a market crash\nYou know that gives people a lot of peace of mind how do we deal with taxes healthcare\nA legacy planning so one of the most satisfying things for me is when somebody says you know this is the first time I've really seen all this laid out and I know exactly how this is going to work and I can see that yes I can retire in two years or whatever the goal was and I can see that it's going to work and I can also see\nThe things that we can't control like stock market\nSo I can retire in two years or whatever the goal was and I can see that it's going to work and I can also see the things that we can't control like stock market crashes that sort of thing aren't going to ruin our retirement and that's you know in my opinion what a good retirement plan is about really\nTied what people are just asking what's on their mind is do I have enough yeah do I have enough money and will my money last as long as we do and that's what gives people the peace of mind knowing and seeing and they have a tangibly touched that\nSo so if you are like the families that we help if you are less than ten years away from retirement or you're already retired or maybe you're five years four years three years two years is getting closer and closer and you're trying to answer the big questions when can you retire\nIs your money going to last how do we do this in a way that's going to insulate you from events beyond your control that's what our retire with freedom process does\nAnd we are happy to sit down with you and walk you through exactly how to have the kind of plan for your retirement that you're looking for the kind of plan to answer those questions with certainty where you can see exactly how this was going to work\nIt's more than just a bucket of investments a diversified portfolio is not a retirement plan\nCome sit down with us and let a show you what a retirement plan looks like we specialize in helping people with five hundred thousand dollars or more plan for their retirement\nBut if you think you might be a fit give us a call we will sit down with you personally and help you plan your retirement nine eight eight triple zero six that's two oh five nine eight eight zero zero zero six\nTwo oh five nine eight eight triple zero six anybody that calls in the next ten minutes we will set aside time on our calendar and sit down with you and help you figure out the answers to the big questions for you and your family\nAnd you know Ted talked about a diversified portfolio not being in a an income plant we do talk about how about that a whole lot in fact people come in and actually quote that back to us when they come in but let me say this I I don't know if we've mentioned this before but\nHaving a diversified income you know ... diversified types of income stream is super important right I mean and folks don't think about it like that there is no just one stream of income coming in and like you did it when you had your salary\nYou had the ability when you retire if you put a plan together and to be able to diversify the different places you're getting income from there's a there's many different places and each one of those places and strategies needs to be maximize so\nThat you've got the ability literally to have your money last as long as you do and beyond them and you can last as long as you do your wife does you know and then you're able to ... you know possibly very possibly leave money behind your kids your grandkids are heavy care about because you've had so much income you've not had to rub your nest eggs so much\nBut you don't get an opportunity to get good at retirement plan it yeah\nYou never get good at it you never get good or resigned I Know you can cause you do at one time right exactly so that's one of the things I feel like we bring to the table is that the fact that we've done it hundreds and hundreds of times and we have figured out how to figure these things out right so [noise]\nAnd sometimes they're working with people who don't know how to figure it out\nI Would say that that's the majority of the time I I mean again it's not\nIt's the difference between working with an architect it's kinda like if you're going to build a house or do you just go to the concrete cells person and say how should I design my house my no\nYou gotta have concrete you got to have board you got to have all that stuff but you need an architect in the design of the ... so it's kind of like building a house you wouldn't build a house without blueprints\nYou shouldn't plan your retirement without blueprints either and so so I think what's happening for most people is they're working with a broker a banker somebody and it's kind of like the concrete salesman they're managing their investments there's nothing wrong with that that is a a perfectly legitimate thing to be doing is managing people's investments it's just not a retirement\nPlan and what we see every time that someone comes in here is they still have the big question on that chart brought all my money last will my money they're working with somebody but they've never answered the question how's my money gonna last well I'd be okay do I have enough is my family going to be taking care of something happens to me I mean there's a lot of questions out there that aren't answered\nThat's why this discussion ram Social Security is important right because it helps answers the answer that question so we've got to figure out how much is going out the door how much are you going to need then we look at all the income sources that you can count on and retirement and then we must\nTo answer the answer that question so we got to figure out how much is going out the door how much are you going to need then we look at all the income sources that you can count on and retirement and then we model\nIf we take it early what does it do to your savings long term if we wait until full retirement age what does it do to your savings long term if we wait until Seventy what is it do to your savings long term 'cause at the end of the day\nI don't think people care so much about which way do I get more money from Social Security but for the good lord calls me home\nAs they do is my money going to last ... sets so so so so a lot of times people think maybe in again this is natural you're trying to make a decision\nAnd so you're you're looking at that decision in a vacuum like what's the breaking what's break even point which way am I going to get the most out of Social Security you know well it sure would be nice to have that paycheck coming in now it would give me a sense of comfort all of these are human nature mhm\nBut what we really need to do is figure out how is this decision gonna impact whether you run out of money or not yeah and that's everything that's everything\nAnd we also had a software package or just in case we didn't cover every base we have a software package and a team of consultants that used to work for the Social Security administration to help us analyze these things because this is an important decision if you're trying to figure this out\nIf you're not sure is my money going to last when can I retire when should I take Social Security should I take it early is better to wait till till later shouldn't want if you turn it on while the other one weights all of these are things that need to be analyzed\nAnd it's important because at the end of the day it has a huge impact on whether you run out of money or not and there's a window of opportunity right now before you make that decision if you're close to it there's a window of opportunity to make sure that you get this decision right\nIf you would like to take advantage of us helping you do that we're happy to sit down with you and analyze not just your Social Security but your whole retirement planning tell you hear the things that are going well and these are the things that we think\nNeed to be planned for and you need to have a solution in place and you need to have thought through we will give you this detailed analysis at no cost no obligation to you if we decided to work together past that then we explain how that works\nBut this initial analysis is designed to get to help you get your arms around your retirement planning\nYou'd like to take advantage of that we do specialize in helping people with five hundred thousand dollars or more save for retirement plan for their retirement\nBut if you like to take advantage of this call now nine eight eight triple zero six that's two oh five nine eight triple zero six in Tony\nI'm also going to offer anybody that calls in the next ten minutes\nOr you'll get a free copy of our book retire with freedom so I've written a book called retire with freedom that tells you how to retire with freedom [laughter] and so if you would like to take advantage of that any by the calls and the next ten minutes that comes to see us we'll also get a free copy of the book nine eight triple zero six\nYou know another decision tab that could be an irreversible ... decision and is if if that's been made is electing the spousal benefits if you have a pension oval and how that happens we see that a lot so so let me say this I'm sometimes those decisions have already been made when that's come in here\nAnd uh so for for if it has been let me say this there's still a window of opportunity effects that you say not that we can go back and change the decisions delayed on\nWell you might be able to some did you have started taking it yet sometimes people have made the decision but they haven't turned in\nGo back and change the decision you laid on well you might be able to somebody you haven't started taking it yet sometimes people have made the decision but they haven't turned it on rush but once just turned on now we've got to fix it which we cannot bring that bell but we\nCan do some things and make some decisions and put some things in place that could really protect\nThe surviving spouse because it's a big question too is is my family going to be okay and what will happen to my family if I'm no longer here you know in my ... are they going to be taken care of and okay and this really answers you know the the decision you make around your pension and Social Security I'm really\nAnswers that big question not only am I may go as for me and her but you know at our we both going to be okay is she going to be okay if I'm not here anymore and I did something other than some kind of benefit left behind for her and how much that I'll eat behind for her for him if she's got it\nYou know Tony I I find that this is one of the most concerning questions that people have\nIs my family going to be okay if I'm not around it and and the the the family has the same question particularly the spouse a lot of times like you know am I going to be OK if my spouse isn't here right\nAnd usually in most couples one person passing away will have a significantly higher impact on the one left behind benefit was reversed right it's usually not the same financially I'm not talking about emotionally\nA U.S you women do way better without as men than us men do without you women [laughter]\nMaybe it's the truth you guys are like [laughter] totally got that your golf around my back [laughter] and we're like wait a minute why don't we do we care about ourselves\n[laughter] where's the can opener\nRight so so financially though a lot of times it's the reverse of that yeah right yeah\nAnd so it's it's it's really concerning for both people it's concerning uh for typically the husband again this is not always the case may be is the most common scenario is typically the husband is very concerned about is his wife going to be okay\nAnd his wife is concerned about the same thing yeah and I are going to be okay 'cause a lot of times this topic the whole thing about money and investments and all that\nUh is is usually intimidating to people who haven't paid that much attention to it and now again let me let me be clear we've got clients where they'll come in here for view\nAnd we I Can't keep the men awake [laughter] as the women are the ones that do it all the men have no interest absolute so that is absolutely right now real scenario ... it's not the most common yeah\nIt's more commonly as the other way around right right yeah and so that's a big concern for people\nIn this pension thing so so why tell why is this pension things such a big deal well\nIt's a big deal because I mean we I give\nYou know I I actually that like I didn't know the answer and I'll tell you I'm acting ... I'm I'm playing the straight man All right go for ...\n... decision as important as huge just like the Social Security decision is huge because I got many stories about this topic in particular but we have a current family that we help now at still hear\nThe they came in five years ago six years ago something like that okay [noise] um he had already elected a benefit for his pension that was just ... nothing left behind for the spouse okay nothing left behind for the wife couch because\nHe's much healthier than her um she was a couple of years older than\nAnd for the spouse okay nothing left behind so the wife couch because\nHe's much healthier than her um she was a couple of years older than him but just to [noise]\nUm and that she was more unhealthy show where okay yes she had some health issues and that they both agreed they both agreed they made the decision together that there is no way she'll ever outlive him and this is the best decision possible for them\nSo they already elected the Social Security decisions and they'd already elected to her Social Security was very very small her her ... her piece of has a very small guy\nAnd then so they had great income while they were both here\nAbsolutely great income [noise]\nUm unfortunately about a year and a half less than two years later\nHe passed away and but he came in first and and was saying we made these decisions because we know this is going to happen and and you know I'm going out with her and this is going to be fine and we don't really need to think about those things we want to think about some other things and plan for some other things\nMake sure you're putting all your money and diversified\nTo make sure you're putting all your money and diversify the ts yeah\nThat that that's not an income plant right that's a bucket of investments but ... so the fine print ATS have fees as well in some of them more than others you know we talked about um [noise] we talked about annuities\nAnnuities are one of the ones that you definitely need to know what to ask there are a lot of different kinds of annuities now we've talked on the show plenty of times but\nWe don't think of any of this stuff cash stocks bonds annuities life insurance long term care gold silver real estate and I don't care what it is we don't think of any of that stuff is good or bad\nAnd we're very aware of the people out there are very polarized and opinionated about certain things or you should always do this you should never do that\nI think always endeavor is usually bad advice for somebody\nMight be great advice for some people in terrible advice for others so\nWe just want to think through what are we trying to solve a problem or we solve it are we trying to get income that we know we can't outlive are we trying to make sure that it's not affected by market crashes or is it money that we're willing to set aside and grow for the long term in which case we're willing to take more risk is an emergency money is it I got to buy a car in three years\nYou know are we just trying to figure out when can I retire you know what can I can I get outta here it is\nSo so annuity there's a lot of polarization out there about annuities are I don't I'm not polarized one way or another I don't think they're good I don't think there are bad I think they're a tool that you need to know what you're doing and so there are a lot of annuities have very high fees and then take a lot of risk that people don't realize they're taking\nSo and also they come a surrender penalties and that sort of thing now ... what can an annuity do well well\nYou can get a you can have if you put the ... in in the right can you can have income going up by eight percent a year for every year you delay you can have the income last for both lifetimes like a pension\nYou know so you know you're not going to run out of money but you also need to understand what the surrender penalties are and all those sorts of things so they can they can make some sense\nBut there are a lot of different kinds into frequently people sit down with us Tony and they think they've got typically they think they've got a fixed annuity and they've got a variable annuity where the fees are three or four percent\nThe income is only going to last for one person's lifetime not for both of them that's alive and if the markets crash and something happens to them the money that's going to be left to their kids is gonna\nIs the is going to go down maybe even cut in half of what they're leaving behind in in it was explained to them very differently than that yeah they thought the money was protected they were getting guaranteed growth and it was going to be for both lifetimes so\nIt's very important you know\nThat if you are doing anything in the world a financial planning you understand not just what it's going to do well for you but what are the gotcha Smith a limitation what are the limitations and it's not look nothing's perfect\nYou know if we put money in the stock market for somebody's plan in the market crashes that money's going to go down if we use an annuity for somebody's plan and and they need all the money back out six months later they're going to pay a penalty to get it right yes so these are all things that before we do them yeah\nPeople need to be super clear on it in and it it shouldn't be their responsibility to have to go through and catch those things in the final\nBe super clear on it in and it it shouldn't be their responsibility to have to go through and catch those things in the fine print exactly the person that's working with them should lay all of this out and say look nothing's perfect\nEverything we do has benefits and it has drawbacks stocks and bonds haven't annuities have life insurance long term cash cash\nHave everything has pros and cons here the problems we're trying to solve here's the way that we should segment the solutions to take care of the different problems but oh by the way\nEvery single thing that we're doing here we're doing for a good reason but it also comes with risks or limitations or a you know less liquidity or less growth or we've got great growth opportunity where we're taking a bunch of risk all of those things\nBut a good plan cat if you put a good solid plan together for ... for for a family the thing that we can do is we can take different solutions not just diversified portfolio but does diversify the solutions yeah and marry those together in an effort to get all the benefits from each of those strategies\nIf that sounds logical to you that all good plans should have different strategies is part of it if we're trying to solve different problems and you've been wishing and hoping that you could actually sit down with somebody\nThat wasn't a one trick pony trying to get you to do one thing versus another and they were very open about all of the benefits but also the drawbacks the fine print\nThere's nothing perfect out there so we don't try to pretend that there is we just want to make sure that if you're doing something there's a reason for it we've created a plan that we've collaborated on that you understand what we're doing\nIn that you've been involved in the decision in your clear on what the limitations are so that if the limitations raise their head\nIt's not a surprise\nIf you want that kind of straight talk and\nClear explanation of benefits and limitations around all of this stuff as it relates to retirement stocks bonds annuities life insurance what's the real scoop we will help you do
