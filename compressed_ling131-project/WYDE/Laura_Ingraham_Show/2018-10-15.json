I Can't tell us all over the edge off a little ... of the ... ... ...\n... from the bully and\nAll of a lot about that all want to make it a little child well there's a lot of times I'm sort of schools don't wild animals look close all over the last ... last of the ...\nYou for him over the weekend Donald Trump had a similar question posed to him about Chicago ... and his response to that basically was that the city of Chicago has the mechanism between the streets up and then if the police force\nAnd I know that we can get into debates about the militarization of police the heavy handed tactics that police but many years ago when after a Rudy Giuliani was elected mayor of New York\nHe changed the uniform or New York city police officers specifically\nThe mayor of New York he changed the uniform or New York city police officers specifically the Port Authority officers and how did I put this without getting too conspiratorial in the minds of some these new outfits were very\nWhat's the word I'm looking for um aggressive looking if you will ah they he start addressing them up well like body armor and making them look menacing\nAnd I think that the answer ultimately is ... perhaps in the short term I don't know if it costs for a curfew in some areas but certainly a heightened police force in presence in certain areas the promise you run into very frequently is number one you don't have a a whole lot of people that are appealing to that career choice\nBut we also don't have in in many cities Birmingham you know the one where you have the budget to hire\nMany other officers as well I don't know if it's the or ... or ... you know the the National Guard of a state guard or whatever the case may be and that's already short term approach\nBut I think it starts there and then you have to get into discussions about economic opportunity education et cetera et cetera because at the end of the day\nWhat was that the you know the the uh the uh the the line about a idle hands with the devils workshop and I mean there's a lot of valid you know ... for in terms of that observation and you have people that are in these areas where they have no money they have too much time on there have they have no education\nThey're frustrated upset pissed off confusion scared and they lash out to one another they see the only viable option to get out of these communities as selling drugs or playing basketball playing football and there is just a lot that goes into that conversation\nBut in my opinion in the short term it is a very strong police presence in our street and to some degree I don't want to do martial law on you but it was like a restrictive response to the movements of some during certain times of the day and days of the week\nAm I in my old went insane that I don't see an option in the short term\nMogal had initially when I was growing up and they instituted a curfew it was during the week it was nine o'clock and on the weekends ... right and if you were caught if you're a certain age and your call out after curfew you go to jail\nYou got picked up with the juvenile right and you said there to your parents pick you up you know so maybe they need to do that I don't know\nWell you know how grandma used to always say nothing good happens after midnight and there's a lot of truth to that\nWhich in our ... speaking of which is a live this war and just released her DNA test she is anywhere between one thirty second two one five hundred and twelve Native American\nNow the result of that well the result of the tests are really accurate according to the Boston Globe because the DNA database with Native Americans very small because Native Americans were very\nWere formed and made into such brilliant men number one classical education number two a cheater numbers sleep morality\nSounds to me like parochial schools but back then it was a tutor which today is goes by the name of home schooling\nYou know and you'll hear people when I go to work I have to put a roof over their heads I had to give a ploy okay\nListen\nIf you can't afford to live where you are\nMoved to a place that you can afford to live\nThe most important thing that you have to do as a parent in your life\nTo raise raise good\nFor a\nUpstanding members of society that\nDon't go to the president is when they're in their twenties your number one responsibility as the rearing of your children everything else comes after that especially if you're a mother no I'd gotten dad got dumped out\nMy uh my views towards ... women ought to do in their lives and a lot of it's been tongue in cheek\nAbout when we had mom at home mom and dad at work our children received a lot better upbringing than they do apparently now setting up to the Scott back pervert what state was that when something bad\nWas it Vermont or best Vermont and like ... yeah\nThose those people in Vermont were that the people that got kicked out that were the ... foot Boston\nAnd like ... yeah\nThose people and we bought more that the people that got kicked out that we are team ...\nFoot Boston and that says a lot so\nYou know look if parents aren't going to look after their welfare if the parents are going to go to the PTA meeting if the parents aren't going to go into their second and third grade a little meat the teacher thanks to see if it that teachers are pervert or a whack job or not this is what's gonna happen Mike\nHopefully we're going through a a cycle of a more conservative stuff more after this mid term our culture or our society to be a little bit more on the conservative side and we can lead somebody's scum bags oh\nBut I'll tell you what you you have everybody afraid just say the things that you would I say and James says in in in society\nAnd so these perverts skilled bags that look class liberals just claw their way to the top of whatever institution there in and make the rest of us\nEffort it's time to change that because that's what\nConservatives have as much weight to live in this country as state you're paying their liberals do\nAt our views are just as important as everybody else's Scott pinpoint why what times that I that that's been going in to your children's heads you're no man's it\nI hear you Jim and why we have gotten so into the gutter with this information is beyond me\nI'm ... and you wonder why you hear the stories you know eight nine year olds raping six and seven year old\nBecause when they put out and said right now is trying to climb up\nI hear you I don't disagree it makes it makes me sick and I'll tell you what\nIt sounds good right and of course I guess that the money in parochial school everybody knows that but it's a good thing that these teachers they Vermont did not have to run in to our parents by the game of Jim from Marshall County is they're teaching career ended quickly\nI hear you my friend said you have real like there's like Mike drop like their fellow\nI talked to you soon eight six six five five one nine nine three three is the number of ... what is not what ever is on your mind and let's get the corn ... take our break this hour however cork how are you\nNow how are you doing oh just wonderful wonderful\nGood deal so on mouths on leaving Auburn I guess the holdup is like the buyout or something\nWe don't know if he's being asked to labor is being bought out but there's a lot of chatter on line ... those conversations are taking place now that is purely speculative on my part but uh and I would not think anything will happen before the conclusion of the season but many of the ... faithful um had enough\nWell I I spent seven years there and I would like for them to do well\nBut my ear is not predicated on how they do in football but I can imagine for the people that are that way the level of dissatisfaction has got to be extremely high now I Know you watch the Sopranos right\nI've seen it many times yeah so remember when the ladies at the nursing home wouldn't talk DePaul his mom and\nYeah so remember when the ladies at the nursing home wouldn't talk to ... mom and he had a couple of guys chasing the principal through the hospital right you need to\nGet a God's ... poly screwed down there to the athletic center and run him\nOut [laughter] [laughter] oh Clark\nYeah SALT I hear ya I hear you my friend\nDid you see the kid got kicked out of the football game this weekend in North Carolina I did not\nSo he wore this was the the patriotic football game or something\nLike oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I did go ahead\nGo ahead on the Trump Jersey yeah what are the number forty five on it and that's I mean you know I saw a picture of the Jersey it was a football Jersey that said Trump and uh had a forty five on it and apparently members of the faculty complain so the principal told him that he'd have to remove the Jersey or leaves\nAnd apparently he did both and uh she's no longer the principal now right\nI just I don't know is this really where we are now because I'm thinking it Ritchie Cunningham had a war and and I like Ike buttons to school they would not have thrown him out\nOf course not yeah I mean have we ever had this before where you know you show support for the president and you get that much pushback\nNot that I can recall car because there was a time in this country where our educational institutions would celebrate young people paying attention to the political process but now everything has become polarized around Donald Trump and I don't think it even has anything to do with Trump\nI think it really has no matter to do with the condition of the countries in today you have so many people that are disenfranchised from reality they are upset about the ... the condition of their worlds up their lives and they need somebody to blame in Trump is convenient\nWell yeah I I think it's all about not having Hillary as president and ah the socialist utopia that we could be right now is that it happened right\nNow anyway I just I don't know I thought it was extremely interesting that we had gotten to this point oh or something like that you know or somebody actually think about doing something like that\nRight now you're exactly right\nWhat man you got to be close and I don't want to get away with that\nRobert ... very much y'all take care you too Bye bye if people pay attention\nTo the facts of this administration\nThere's there's nothing to be angry or upset about when it comes to this man has moved share with you many times before prior to becoming president of the United states Donald Trump was\nThe darling of the left everybody in New York law dim everybody and the Democrat Party there was a recipient of his a fundraising efforts in his contributions and donations loved him\nDonald Trump is just convenient and frankly if it had been Rand Paul\nOr it had been a Ted Cruz or anybody else that stood on that die as early on in the debate season if you well\nIt would have been exactly the same ... perhaps even worse because this is not so much a matter of anti Donald Trump as much as anti Republican anti conservatism anti anything\nPerhaps even worse because this is not so much amount of anti Donald Trump as much as anti Republican anti conservatism\nAnti anything that's not the Democrats and liberal liberals for the most part are ... and that's what it boils down to they have tiny little lives in many cases they have no direction you know people we\nAre we are as humans we are born to serve one another we are born to be supportive of one another we are born to have if you want to steal Rick Warren's line a purpose driven life when your life has no purpose then you have to direct that anger and anxiety somewhere else\nFor those of us that are conservative Christians you know we we have to and and and the sermon that I heard yesterday\nThey the past year was talking about being patient in life we have no patience for anything and in a world where the lord or or heavenly father or master creator does not exist or your perhaps your agnostic\nThere's nothing left to hold onto other than your anger other than your your discontent other than your confusion and your fear and as Christians think about that for just one second\nThroughout the course of our day and not just treat him as he is I'm a grandfather Lee vending machine in the sky for fair to dispense mercy grace and material goods to us through our prayer but that we pray for one another as we are called to do if everyone in this country today\nThat presents themselves as a Christian took thirty seconds out of the day and simultaneously prayed for this nation for its leadership but for those that are hurting particularly on the left I think we would see a remarkable response\nAnd it'd be powerful and it would be exactly what we as Christians are called to do [noise]\n\nW. ones ... there'll be ...

their oil a followed a couple of things first was what you were talking about forty ... Marshall ... that that was really good I\nHad a good sermon that our church service yesterday morning or a pastor was talk about some little sim was he was saying you know those of us who practice our religion in this country we're proud of the rape all day so openly but what if you brought in somebody from a foreign nation that hadn't really been exposed to religion to Alabama over the weekend\nI'd be on Saturday you take him to the college football game or maybe that's the political science see people being like crazy things you asked about that stuff you know just kind of like Robert rather side but if you took them to a church service on Sunday Morning keepsake people super salty and they would wonder well what do you really excited\nAbout what are you really have very very good point with\nThe politics or football not necessarily the arm and also I think one\nOf the law that half ethical too tired of it ... it was all things\nI was thinking about the policy that you had a or you went on topic it was found to be pretty passionate himself he was saying pretty out there and stuff like don't bring the other side of the poles maybe we need to ... political\nAnd I just think people are getting really turned off about ... found that stream is\nWhen you say that kind of thing you know what are you on TALK of others out or some might disagree or whatever they don't want to say if you're being that extremes\nAnd you know I just make a lot of people are being really turned off by that nowadays I I hear y'all are going to be changing format\nYou get a couple of what I just think maybe you know people desire to get away from like extremism happier reason for that\nWhenever there's all kinds of things going on in the world around us but the reality of it is Jesse that we need to always put the Lord Jesus Christ first and everything we do and the uh the observation that you may comparing football to our enthusiasm about the message of the lord has salvation\nAs far as I'm concerned spot on and I think the people in this country you realize but go ahead ...\nThat are affiliation politics sometimes for our religion or actual ... you\nKnow I I don't disagree with that and you know and if we you know we have our war eagles and we have our role tides I don't remember really great you know battle cry for the lord and salvation perhaps we need to develop one\nThere's another country that went to that type of extremists linked in the past couple of decades voting a one party above all well and that's true and I fear that so many\n\nOh oh come on and that's and I hear that so many one party or the other one that go on line all they want to go where they're going to ditch we may not be able to get out of\nWell you know what's interesting is that in the past when this country has been what most of us would define as successful you know low unemployment or\nYou know high economic numbers great a great GDP Growth et cetera almost every single time that's occurred in this nation's history\nWe have been kind of in a sense of in the middle and that's kind of one of the things that's so interesting to me about Donald Trump is that many of his ideas and policies and programs are really more\nCenter right than they are hard right and the same thing seems to apply in almost every aspect of this country's history is that even Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky aside\nBut even in in his second term\nHe went more towards the middle and most ... politicians they run on the right or the left but they tend to govern towards the middle\nBut we seem to be struggling with getting back to that middle ground in this day and time so your observation about the passion toward sports versus the passion tours ... recalled that it was Christians is very accurate running operation at the calls of rain on\nYou and I would remind everyone\nThat certainly they said that Trump particular bigger I think it's a pretty at all\n... and I believe with all my heart thanks yeah see I appreciate the call so very much\nI Know I Try to say I get that loop holes and religion football was fun football was funny I I personally get a kick out of the back and forth but you know when the game's end in\n... lost again I get on with my life I've got ...\nI've got dinner and I make\nI got a wife to hang out with an a dude on the groom\n\nBut I also fear not unlike a football game\nPeople's passion for for the message because we can win a football game and man I tell\nYou what we'll talk about that when you know I hear it in Alabama talking or whoever wins the iron bowl we got bragging rights for a year\nOkay yeah I guess you could say that\nAin't doing a whole lot of rock and by the way but\nHow long does that euphoria enthusiasm last after we've heard a really great messaging a sermon\n\nHow many times have we gone and heard one to almost moved us to tears and then later that same day seemed forgotten what we learned just three or four hours before\n\nThe war carry that football passion will go to work the next morning with our Jersey of our favorite team on well shy the opponents that have lost that we work with\n\nWell when it comes to the enthusiastic teachings that had been laid down in the great serving the previous day it's almost like there's some form of Christian pensions that we're paying for sixty minutes or Seventy five minutes whatever the case may be\n\nChristian pensions that we're paying for sixty minutes or Seventy five minutes whatever the case may be\n\nLet me go out and we get our fried chicken or hit the Chinese buffet or whatever and get back to the house\n\nI have said that so many times as boring me not a matter right versus left but us versus that were being divided folks\nWhether its soul and ski or George Soros or Pocahontas or anyone of a number of people even on the right for that matter if we can't see it for what it is\nThen will never become the country Margot or not ...\nWe the citizens of this nation are the majority of the politicians that are telling us how we should be thinking but what is truly in our hearts I cannot tell you over the years how many times\nI've had callers that I've not mad and I haven't met the majority view that were just nasty to me on the air\nAnd then I made up in public and they're absolutely enjoy they're funny\nSummer twenty three and five hundred I don't remember it's been a few years since I last checked\nOut there you go it's not something I measure anything by Rob ... nor should you but you know is that\nKind of rhetoric where the biggest terrorist organization American and there are people\nOut there that believe that gun toting white males American gun nuts\nNow what purposes that serve\nThe expression that all negative emotions are rooted in fear\nIs absolutely unbelievably accurate\n\nSo if we are and I I'm not suggesting by the way that this guy this brown is necessarily fearful\nOf white males 'cause he has one but that's the narrative you selling that you should be afraid of American white male gun toting nuts [noise] now how many of you my white male counterparts\nAre gun ...\nThat's a rhetorical question Robert White that's an awful lot of people don't be afraid of\nEvery white male in this building with very few exceptions\nAs American young not\nWasted around talking about guns as much as we talk about politics\n\nBut yet there is some absolute brilliance of thought in this building and some of the most relaxed laid back people you'll ever meet but the the cannon narratives that some ... are attending to sell their potential constituencies\nWhy would we be shocked that there's a violent protest compliments of antifa on waste in Portland, Oregon over the weekend because these people are legitimately afraid\nTheir fear has been ginned up there they are tantamount\nTo that mob outside the sheriff's office where the rub that wants to hang the bank robber\n\nWe ... we saw the same kind of social anarchy very vibrant sense and the deep south in the forties fifties sixties and some could argue the seventies\nIt is a mob mentality that is inspired\nBy mob emotion\nAnd it's quite frankly is very easy to manipulate\n\nIt even easier to get groups of people as opposed to one into what some salespeople referred to as the ether\n\nAnd people typically go along with the mob\nWe have all done this before you go to an event it can be a concert and it can be a political rally it can be a church event\nIt doesn't matter you're not\nIt can be a concert there can be a political rally it can be a church event it doesn't matter you're not certain how to get into the venue but what is typically right outside the venue\nOutline and you get in it\nOr there's a line that's getting that line we're going to get in and then all of a sudden you realize everybody's in the wrong line\n\nThe interesting thing about it as when you go to the grocery store you typically look for the shortest line but when you're trying to get into the game\nYou'll look for the longest one depending on who's playing ... and then there's that\nBut it it goes back to the doctor that mob mentality\nIf there's this group over here's upset we must be upset to why why we're not really sure but upset and this seems to be trending\nWhen politicians know this this is what we saw him a Kavanaugh's\nConfirmation oh by the way Brett Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court\n\nBeen there for a week as of today where are the impeachment people\n\nThey have been talking about drawing of articles of impeachment against Trump without having a majority in the house all impeachment proceedings must originate in the house of representatives\nAnd then if the impeachment of successful it is heard by the Senate for expulsion or exoneration if you will\nBut here we are awake removed whereas Christine Ford\nWhere the other accusers\nWhere are the articles of impeachment I'm sitting here waiting\nAnd waiting\nBecause there's not enough a motion behind the story to keep it inflamed or enraged ...\nRage is the tool of those that have nothing else\n\nThat many times gentlemen how many times ladies have you on an argument with your significant other\nBy simply being the loudest person in the room oh and then there's the mandatory door slam him\n\nAnd then all of a sudden the

sixth single actions on yesterday before I started listening\nA I had um I I Would try to talk to people and say can you not see this you know the news and everything can\nGet anything accurate couldn't get everything everything was just so just a fake and you could I could see through it but most people could just\nJust broadcast to him and then I started listening you know it just kind of bought all that in the open and I I kind of felt like I wasn't alone and all that [laughter]\nYeah oh I Know that feeling exactly and that's one of the reasons we try to do it because I Believe that

only person in the country who believes it\nYeah well I Know that that's what I was saying it just it just seemed like they just\nIt was constantly oh like a you know brown and you know he he handled at the cops and everything like that I'm for you know all the police area for you know mind getting shot of St Louis right man he did the same thing down and you know and then I tried to turn the guy\nFrom being Hispanic to quiet down in Florida yeah you know and he said oh that could have been my son and you know and to me everything he always did was just trying to create chaos and that's a

side is\nPro abortion that's and that's part of the big fight before you call me and tell me that is not watch the left and the Kavanaugh's confirmation right\nEverything was about abortion and that whole mess was about abortion that is their side economically one side says jobs the other side says\nI Need stuff from the government that's just the way it is there are literally willing to tear the play support\nTo be given something one side believes in rights given by God in those rights by the way\nFor my rights to be in place I Do not require anything from big days I Do not require anything from you I have a right God given right it already it comes with the package those are my rights owned the last\nThe new rights come at a cost to someone else universal healthcare call someone else in money yeah it's amazing in money or in service is\nA ... a quote unquote living guaranteed wage the cost to somebody else free college health care I mean college tuition comes at a cost of someone else if it call someone else something it's not one of your God given rights ... it's just not so we have\nTwo different sets a world government one size does have a limited government leave me alone will deal with our own stuff the other says we need a bigger government to do everything to make our lives better they there is not a lot of compromise between these two but if you're looking at it from some sort of moral standard\nThough right makes sense to me the right is\nSomething that you can balance and people can prosper the left is for something that will that will wipe out society it's an\nEvil evil I don't I mean when I was saying and you're saying and right and left it's really not right and left this conservative and heating it I mean [laughter] because I'm not a there's a lot of people all the ... that that I disagree with\nWell you don't have to be solidly\nOn the right there can be some things you disagree with but as much as you want to be independent big Dave\nYour belief system is solidly on the right side you just don't like it or just don't know where it or just do one at MIT it but your world view is on the right\nOf go to the phones again Anita welcome to the show thanks for listening\nAnd Scott thank you for taking my call just\nMan what's going on\nI wanted to add to your point about that right and left yes\nThere are ways to it as well and again that republic that out they are allowed to think outside the box and that's what I Am Sestak fastball for several decades right argues amongst themselves\nAte there too much Christian not and that Christians are kinda halfway abortion or should they argue amongst themselves and what they lay there and what they got a late and and that's why I get the care that you get out of the others but that that last time I stay in that it\nWhen he got to figure out a way they use United States to get the right to gather and focused and at that time and at that lab kit destroy it\nI agree with your data we we are very much a splintered side when it comes politically it part of that is because I Believe that a lot of different folks are actually thinking about the issues the left they have a different strategy which is\nBill argue about for the most part do argue after they win after they destroy the republic after they ... their new utopian democracy and uh\nGot it yeah thanks welfare maybe it was a coercive utopian you will be a part of our utopian if you might get a kill you [laughter] bird welcome to the program\n...

and Eighteen I Hope you're having a fantastic out there\nThat fantastic what fantastic day in the heart of God's Country thank you for listening\nTo the show I appreciate all of you and thank you for telling other people about this program\nBecause that is the way it has grown to the size it it is today because of you telling others and we have so many callers say that they do that we are people that I've seen do that mostly it's because the big day I just told him about Twain big dates commentary [laughter] what I Do\nGo to the phones really quick and then we got to get on to a number of different things including this controversy over the Saudi\nColumnist oh I thought we were going or about the journal may and we've been talking about how to learn is what about DNA\nThat is one of the mysteries of the world has been finally signed Lee solve yes finally turns out I'll give you a hint\nThat is many ... point zero zero don't don't let everybody\n... that we needed up for [laughter] car welcome to the program\nHey Scott how are you\nDoing man I'm having a fantastic day doing an award winning show here today\nThey go what's going on right you hadn't like lady on talking about the YouTube bum on CNN figured out prompted one yes and you know the the lip\nTelling us oh Hillary won the popular vote\nAnd you know the ... the lead telling us how Hillary won the popular vote we need to do away with the electoral college yes how did the house of representatives to [laughter] ...\nWell I mean is represented in the population for the most part and the Republicans failed the house\nYeah big time so you know the Republicans won the house of representatives they won the popular vote quite handily there\nHow can you possibly reconcile the presidential election Hillary won the popular vote and yet in the house of representatives the Republican smoke to laugh\nBecause well gold card that doesn't matter it doesn't matter and no one has to really think about how this works no one has to think about the fact that the house was\nPretty much designed to represent the quote popular both the house was supposed to be more of the\nDare I say mob rule side when it comes to government\nAnd you're just not supposed to think about that car the press has told us that Hillary won the popular vote even with all the legal illegal voting going on around the country and all we're supposed to do was realized that we should elect our president's base stone\nDirect ballot that's all you're supposed to know ...\nWell the only thing I can say you're a you know can you imagine somebody just went to vote for president and they didn't bother to vote for representative while they were there or somebody wants to vote for the representative didn't bother to vote for the president while they were there because something has to happen there where you had different\nResults and I I'm Sorry but you're just not going to convince me that people went and voted for Republican representative and then voted for Hillary oh I the only thing I can conclude\nIs their total focus to this point has been more so on winning the presidency when they cheat than winning the representative races\nWhere there's a lot of that Carl because if you are on the left and you and your president\nAnd you didn't you have really no regard for what the constitution says\nAnd you have no regard for a certain respect for how government should work\nYou can use the executive branch which is why I think there are so terrified of President Trump is they know what they have done using the executive branch they know how much power the legislative branch has just just granted the executive branch and they have used those levers of power\nWell they should they should and I understand that\nBut why is no would asking who has told these people in Honduras if you can make it to America They're going to let you in your meddling now\nThat's exactly right and in these journalists are not going to ask that question they're just going to make sure that you and I know that everybody headed to the border is fleeing poverty involve us\nWell I had a caller call and sorry Warren ...

[noise]\nYeah I got to run I got a robotic thank you so much\nSo you may have the um so our lives about Warren is making the news because the Boston Globe has\nPut out I'm sure that came from our senator Senator Elizabeth Warren focus has released a DNA test I Want to ask you a question if I came on this program and told you that I was I had a Native American\nAncestry\nI think I could make the argument that I'm skin tone or or whatever I can make it in Elizabeth Warren said that her grandmother or someone told her she had high cheekbones or something\nBut the controversy was because she has claimed her Native American ancestry to help land employment in different places hey I'm a I'm a minority therefore you should hire me\nFor this job that is how the controversy began people look at those both warn inside you're not any more Native American and Adams house cat is\nAnd Trump is Walter many many times calling her focus on is it is ...\nSo there's a story about any ... who works for the Boston Globe the story came out today Senator Elizabeth Warren has released a DNA test\nThat provides quote strong evidence I don't know who she is quoting in this article maybe it's Elizabeth Warren herself\nThis article is probably going to make me pay to get the rest of it I have to switch to somewhere else strong evidence that she had Native American and her family tree guess how far back\nSix to ten generations six to tea in generations so let's see we go back to\nMy dad his grandfather or my dad his father um his father\nThat puts me at the civil war his father goes back to the revolution\nIf I go back five I think it is Greg Greg Greg if I go back five or six I'm at the revolutionary war\nIn my family 'cause I go from\nI go for me to my dad and my grandfather to my grandfather's immigrant falls grandfather\nYeah I'll go six or seven generations back I'm at the revolutionary war\nCaptain Edward ...\nTo go back ten generations in my family\nI'm I'm back in Europe somewhere maybe\n\nSays an unprecedented move about one of the top possible contenders for the twenty twenty presidential election\nCBS Reports it responding to years of derision by president Donald Trump and other critics Senator Elizabeth Warren had a DNA Analysis done that provides strong evidence she does in fact have Native American heritage\n\nDid conclude that Warren's ancestry of mostly European but says the results ... listen to this listen to what it says\nHe did conclude that Warren ... mostly European but says the results ... listen to this question of what it says\nThe results strongly support this is a Stanford University professor Carlos de bustamante bustamante\nA prominent expert in the field of DNA Analysis determine Warren's pure Native American ancestry\nAppears in the range of six to ten generations this article goes home to claim that that measures would Warren's no narrative that her great great great grandmother\n\nOh see otherwise Sara Smith was at least partially Native American that would make ... make war on one thirty second\nI'm not sure that works but ever ancestor is ten generations back that could mean she's won\nWhat was the word quote shows strong evidence\nWhen you say there's strong evidence what does that really say big\nDay it says maybe not right\nYou you didn't say you had strong evidence that your great great great great grandmother\nWas what you said your great great grandmother was what role he's made for saying that they have strong evidence\nWas the reason I say on that as 'cause my sister found a pitcher\nOf my great great great granddaddy right and my great great great grandmother right as a pitcher yes it's a\nIrish guy and a black lady you're smart ...\nSo you got to pay the sad you got the Irish side only someone's skin tone\nThe ... I don't need to get rid of them I mean that's why I said hey I'll take it I don't mind it ain't no way that just the way it is look I'm just me I'm I'm ... right\nBut good old lived with Warren went and founder of DNA person to say that there's a strong chance now here's the part I wanted you to say\nThe b._b._c.\nThe news out there British broadcasting headline Elizabeth Warren\nDNA tests find strong evidence of Native American but\nSo they took that off the other article yes Elizabeth Warren\nThis is a people magazine tests prove she's part Native American how much you got to have one drop\nSo if I take a forward car and put put one both ... a night is from a Chevy then ... then that your car now has native Chevrolet ancestry that's about stupid\nJason welcome to the program\nHey Scott ... you know I'm listening to talk about this I've had a couple of moments have laughed out loud where you're talking about this DNA test yes so I'm going to tell you I Want you to consider me write it down I Am a source with knowledge good subject go I've\nHad a DNA test myself for Christmas along with several of her most of my family members from my mother and\nSo so ... so someone in your family what did you put into the national DNA database registry and y'all signed up for it willingly\nWell I'm In the military so they've already [laughter] yeah okay you don't matter nothing to lose All right\nSo uh so I went ahead and did and uh now now I Know that it's not strong evidence Scott I Know that my third great grandmother was known in the area where she lived as Indian eighty and she was a Cherokee I Know that\nGuy you know we're not even a test came back or didn't show anything about India as a matter of fact I was pretty much all European and it and it had and it said one percent other and when you go down and you read you know what is the other main really just says we don't know uh and then when you read about the actually have an article in there about\nWhy didn't my Native American ancestry show up\nAnd they they got a pretty good answer and the reason is Native Americans as a general rule don't trust the government if they don't hand over their DNA for samples to anybody because no matter who it is they believe it's the government's OK so DNA DNA testing companies do not\nHey for samples to anybody because no matter who it is they believe it's the government okay and so DNA\nDNA testing companies\nDo not have very much Native American DNA protest against the most and what they do have\nIs mix and therefore they say it just can't be a hundred percent relied upon so I Will guarantee I'm going to go out on a limb and I'm going to say Elizabeth Warren didn't use ancestry dot com or any of the other places because she needed somebody who would come back and say well that one percent is strong evidence of\nLeading the game or or how about this one how about that though ... percent off by a staff members who signed up for it and they kept getting back these negatives disease like\nCan't we find somebody who will say that I've got some Indian ancestry intern\nScott you you took the words right out of her mouth you know I knew that she has probably got more DNA test\nResults but actually the last few weeks [laughter]\nThan than than my family did they all got to for to test male off so I'm willing to bet you ... your your rod that she was a little disappointed at her result and so she just found somebody who would say whatever she wanted to hear and uh and you're you're absolutely right now she wants to cash that checked with Donald Trump\nNow so she will do you tell me she was ... she was spit out a book\nThat's what I and I and I tell you this I I Want to thank you for taking my call and I want you to just write it down and maybe we can get it focused on AOL dot com that a source was knowledge told you it was but one just got a bunch of tests so she got the result she voted\nYou got that ride bikes Jason great call buddy\nYou remember back in the seventies and eighties that India and they would come on TV and cry\nWith appear yeah how's everybody would ruin our ... yeah we did not listened in Alabama 'cause we just keep throwing crap out well I still say we knew that I Know the ... but it's been tried ... oh you had to stop in the old would you just won't be able to do what I Want to\nBe able to to get got it she's comparing herself to the Native American then was crying try some\nI mean you know she's been honest the whole time but do you get special treatment is what I'm telling you you missed out\nThat's why we ought to be talking about well then I'm pleased and start talking Martin Luther King Day off what do you feel the board it we all we already do that don't we know here we don't get all the you know we didn't get offered Columbus Day either so that kinda balances out yeah\n[noise] so you've got to know about the Christmas Margot welcome to the program I don't want to say yes
