broadcast\nSo I asked the question to me again and just you just ask it in parts of you want to but it's got to flush it out\n[noise] uh\nQuestion was basically what is your opinion on ranked voting a sofa for example say we we had a fourth party system\nObviously three of those you agree with more than the fourth time so in the rank to vote you would obviously have your first choice than your second choice and then your third choice\nAnd there are two ways that they can be counted one is each choice gets up points\n... and then your third choice and there are two ways that they can be counted one is each choice gets a points based on where you rank to like say for example first points to get the first place is five points second place gets three third place gets one time or to make them significantly different\nOr a win the votes of being tallied you could look at all of the first places if no one gets majority then you go to the second place as\nIt's known as a majority there you go further on\nSeveral things come to mind under that scenario believe it or not when the country was first founded and they were doing with the the Continental Congress it looks something like that whoever got the most votes was president whoever got the second most birds was vice president\nHere's where the problem came in and the founding fathers realize this literally I mean like on day one\nThat presents an opportunity to have to completely opposing parties in office\n\nLet's assume that we have that type of voting in place first off it it it completely eradicate the electoral college and we're right back to popular vote him the let's assume for one second that we did that exactly the way you suggest it\nWhile I'm not saying a the president or whoever gets first overall is president whoever second is vice president we saw the uh the running mates\nAs we have now so there's a the one party that's in power the executive branch okay so they're still attached yes okay we got ours we can leave it that way\nOkay because I was going to say that if you did it the way I originally assumed that you could theoretically have Donald Trump as president and Hillary Clinton is vice president and that puts you on TALK Trump literally and physical risk\nEven more so than they already is then there's the possibility of leaving office and all of a sudden the entire dynamic of the of the election changes because now you've got Hillary Clinton ascending to the presidency in this example\nBut you know the the rank voted that you're speaking of it it's actually been tried even in some communities as well the problem is again up as itself off for what I just described but also robbers itself up you know for corruption and fraud and the vote counting it all the things that go along with that\nBecause the second party justification for you and the second part of justification for me might not be the same justification and it just kind of muddy the water so the idea of the founding fathers was that the entire executive branch theoretically the entire elected a executive branch was like minded and everything that they thought\nAs opposed to having this amalgamation of different thought predicated on these little ... by\nUm you know these little um what's the word I'm looking for more segregated popular votes because that's what they become\nSo now you have a multitude of different votes from different parties as opposed to having a you know this this mandated for a philosophy versus that mandated philosophy it's not a bad thing to consider\nYou have all the west side of the schools what hops nice city\nOr late three blocks a polite fiction of odds for equal work late\nThen it has all the ... what's why although he liked to have a long a old Martin river so you got to ... or ... you will never have a Republican in that area very that's why this voice but there are\nNow is no reason people do it it's not because they bought the fast is the\nLast time the only I could be wrong you know this is just like you know everything you know honestly you know joking around with such as um ... as much as like\n\nHello I'm listening I wasn't sure you're finished yeah I I was I'm done I'm Sorry my phone's not worth it 'cause I mean that's I mean we can never get rid of that no matter what\nWell you know at the end of the day Rhonda and it's kind of where you know we're doing our having this conversation\nIs the process perfect no I mean quite frankly it's not you know these districts are drawn and re drawn by state legislatures in the majority party in most states actually controls the process stumped some states require bipartisan or nonpartisan\nState legislatures and the majority party in most states actually controls the process\nStumped some states require bipartisan nonpartisan commissions oversee line drawing and it varies from state to state to state and then and also the conversation brings us back to states rights the responsibility of state legislatures as it relates to the federal government we're kind of in a weird place in our history right now\nWhere we we have these kinds of conversations of what is the sovereignty of the state look like versus the sovereignty of the federal government and those two ideologies are constantly in opposition\nTo one another and it's it's absolutely not a perfect situation which is why people including myself often refer to the United states as an experiment you know the founding fathers knew all too well it was an experiment\nAnd then you can prove that because they gave us the amendment process and so it it can sometimes be very very very frustrating as these districts are drawn in a manner that does favor one party you know I'm I have no argument for you because you're spot on with that observation\nRight and that's because I actually ran for the city of terms ago right well I I Know how it goes but that here's a question I have ...\nI'm not worried about the twenty ... more worried about the only way for\nYou know you know when um the next term and the next presidential after Trump lucky to have to offer ... going to stay on half of\nAmerica First after ... you know is is there a light at the end of the things are going to go get darker\nIf you force me to answer that question I'm going to say that things will get dark again because if we use history as a barometer we have been down many of these roads before you've heard all the chatter about you know the possibility of a\nYou know ... enlarging the Supreme Court well that's not new FDR try that as well and so there's going to be this constant bipartisan ebb and flow between the right and the left\nWhat's really disturbing however is historically speaking the right and the left seemed to be going to further and further extremes\nWith each passing generation now there's also been some talk about whether or not Trump needs to abandon Mike Pence and the upcoming election and take on Nikki Haley if he takes on Nikki Haley as a running mate that changes that entire conversation and dynamic as well\nHave these days with pets and gets re elected I think the make America great again movement continues on not that it wouldn't under Haley but it might look a little different\nWell the pendulum you're speaking of do you think is the he go one way so far there's no coming back\nYou know I I Hope not because you know if it goes if it goes so far ... if if if the right goes as far right as the leftist going left\nThen we are in some form of\nYou know third world country theocracy\nAnd I don't think anybody wants to see that you know do I want prayer in school absolutely do I want prayer mandatory in school no you know I think it's the right to the right of the individual and you know to a lesser degree the right of the community to govern itself\nBut in a far flung hard right theocracy every decision that we make is predicated on the whims of whoever occupies the oval office we you know we have often in this country been the most successful wherever we did have been center right or center left and all those rare occasions just plain old flat center\nBecause when we're extreme rider extreme but I mean look at our church is as well\nRight or center left and all those rare occasions just plain old flat center because what emerge dream writer extreme but I\nMean look at our church is as well you know you've got you know the the the snake handling you know the churches on on the right you know the speaking in tongues and you know and they're primitive this and they're primitive that and you know there's a measure of ostracized seen people when you go to that extreme\nSo extremism has never flourished in any democracy anywhere in the world\nOr else you're right and like I said I Love your show people work\nLike you're on very much longer\nYou know right now and will kind of use the will still the term right I Will borrow it for a moment on the Republican side you could say the majority of conservatives or center right they're not hard right the center right\nNow a lot of people was that the see them more writer but I don't think anybody wants an extremist right movement in this country because that can be oppressive by its very nature it's just a different type of oppression\nAnd that's why you know so many of the Republicans we're we're so antithetical to the extreme is among the laugh 'cause we refuse to adopt that same ideology in our own political viewpoints\nBecause it's detrimental to the whole ... leader and he said it best a former comedian why doesn't everybody just leave everybody else the hell alone\nBecause what's interesting about our society is in our communities is that what we're left to our own devices without the influence of the federal government we typically get it right but you can't have a one size fits all identity\nYou know I I was talking I was talking to Dave a few moments ago and when we were talking not in the parking lot just about marketing and business and things like that and you know let's let's assume for one second you own a company that manufactures\nClothing for example for ... let's just say bigger people okay and you build your your bigger people clothing store in Birmingham or Atlanta you'll have X amount of a market\nAnd your company is probably going to thrive\nBut let's assume that are are closing for bigger people store wants to expand and we want to build in other markets it doesn't make any sense to build the bigger clothing for bigger people store in\nPoverty stricken Bangladesh why 'cause there's no bigger people there and I realize I'm I'm being somewhat tongue in cheek here but the point is is is is that your store and it could look like anything by the way to be successful\nThere's got to be a market for it you just can't superimpose\nA one size fits all ideology\nNow you guys know I have a background in foundation repaired waterproof talked about that a hundred times on the air\nAnd there's a lot of foundation good foundation companies in Birmingham in Huntsville and all throughout the southeastern United States but you don't see as much of that foundation issues south of Birmingham as you get down close your timid guy marine down towards the state line and the coach why because the soil is different\nYou've got lonely or Sandy or soils the further south you go as\nOpposed to the rich red clay is of north Alabama\nSo the process is different because the market has different that was the ideology behind the states in the original colonies so when we have this one size fits all whether or not it's\nIn our business practice or just in our business or or or corporate practice\nOf the nation a one size fits all policy or offering doesn't\nWork you're not going to build a distillery you know you know next to a Baptist church\nA policy or offering doesn't work you're not going to build a distillery you know you know next to a Baptist church\nYou're not you're not gonna you're not gonna take you know a a a a beer taverns for example and to you know a Mormon heavy community and expected to thrive\nBecause of the individuality of fought an ideology and theology perhaps\nAnd when the federal government visa V. healthcare tries to super pose a one size fits all idea\nIt always fails and this is why we have states in electoral college is we're not supposed to be one folks were supposed to be fifty individual communities that are essentially all moving in the same general direction the benefits the most amount of people\n\nNot again that's the best theoretical to a degree but that's the idea back when the counties the colonial days Georgia was Baptist\nThe Pennsylvania Dutch ... Pennsylvania the Catholics were in Maryland but we all have the same thoughts we all have the same desires to interspersed and commerce with one another and the big communal with one another we're not supposed\nThen that's a by definition a theocracy\nYeah I Know I can understand that what you're telling it to me that way but we can never go that way that that route that's doing exactly what the Catholic Church wanted to do remember when our or should I say the proudest in church at the beginning\nThe brightest and throw the Catholics now you're you're making two point simultaneously and they're both contradictory\nWell look what look what they the Protestants did to the Irish they literally branded their faces with giant ours when they rebelled against the army or the American army and in\nThe oil has to print on me All right [laughter]\nYou know and even though I disagree that oh well if you get a majority like in Nineteen Ninety four with Gingrich that you're going to move so far right we're going to happen see obviously I understand the way that you just\nDescribed it Gingrich scattered it wasn't hard right\nWell here's as far as this country is seen it since the uh\nThe you know there is there a center right there is right and then there's extremist right we've never been an extreme is right\n... exactly what it well I I Would argue that in the beginning when we were levels when we were a guard against the crown we were we were those people fighting in the streets against the theocracy and that was as far as you'll ever get\nWell I mean they weren't in the middle they were as far as you can get at that time they certainly weren't to the left when you lose rights every time they get a majority\nThere were some of the ... there were some a theocratic aspects the king ... third but that was not even a horn right extremism they had free trade they had commerce had ownership had private private privacy law um private privacy laws I mean you know even that's not extreme is right\nThe patriots did but the came one at all his uh and all you had to go his way or the highway put it that way\nYeah that was also that was the posturing of economics not so much the theology\nYeah yeah because he wanted his money back for one thing I mean what are they had invested so much in America at the time that he wanted as they used a stamp act and everything else\nAnd that's why the commerce clause was drawn I mean I'm not arguing that it was it was absolutely economic exploitation\nYet again again you know we're talking about the hard extremism of the writers were the state controls everything because you know something you don't step in and I've seen this with you before and you know you know this is true extremism to the left and extremism to the right or eerily similar\nIt's just what they promote it's different\nYeah I agree one hundred percent and I agree and I remember when we talked about the uh in the past but I I Would also argue that you lose rights\nOn the left but you sustain those rights when you went to the right and that's why we\nThink about it this way since you're going to attempt to go high article on me you actually sustain more of your rights in the middle because in the middle everybody leaves everybody else the hell alone is as the Randy was fond of saying\nWhat a profit was to read to you know down\nA say yeah but that was a that was born and you're a ... yeah but that but do you what the uh uh\nHindering him on I mean you almost made a point there and then you blow it we ... do [laughter]\nWhat does a a hen or a ...\nI mean you almost made a point there and then you blow it we ... do\n[laughter] yeah I just I just don't you why I agree with you when it goes to show for like we could end up with a theocracy is\nIt I I never I never I never ... Henry listen again I never said I saw that coming the point I'm making is we wouldn't tolerate the extremism to the right so why are people on the left tolerate an extremism of the left it's called a metal for or if you prefer an analogy\nI agree but you know what so good about going so far to the right that in the right party and the Republican Party we have the middle of the ground that we go to in our own party the conservative agenda which calls itself we call ourselves back\nFrom that geography but that agenda that would pose so far right there was no a check on the left do\nKnow that they know I and I don't I don't argue that I don't argue that Henry I got to go but I got a bunch of calls coming in\nWell does your foot in the electoral college and a a summation it was very good with with what I'm saying is that every one of them live throughout central all our government and that's the point we can't allow centralized government by thanks Henry operation\n[noise] God I'm through the ringer or right through the ringer hello ... how are you\nI'm doing All right ah I just got an email news updates from Fox Roger Day O'Connor has early onset dementia Trump gets his third appointments\nO'Connor hell is about to break my mum about what about you mean ... Ginsberg\nNow I mean Sandra Day O'Connor okay\nJack Jack Fox News I just got the email okay and that is that's big\n\nGoing into the midterms keeping and taking the majority in the Senate\nIs even more important now\nMy my off base on this I missing something here well I mean you know she's she's obviously you know retiring but Sheena she's\nYou know I'm not on the court curly\n... Linda she\nStepped down years ago really yeah I think she would start who replaced or was that Kagan ...\nWe've got sort of my our Kagan on the corn and Ruthie\nDarn it [laughter] I was just getting really excited or but still point is when it gets Senate\nYeah we do but now you're more are hot darn it\n[laughter] I don't I I ... you can hold out hope Trump's going to get another nominee I fully confident that\nYeah well I certainly I think so as well as I can learn but yes I appreciate it right\nYeah ... has been off the court for years but uh certainly you know\nAnd and it's true she has the beginning stages of dementia but golly no how old is Roman must be pulled us out here\nReal quick and see if we can say no to the other thing you see that he retired about ten years ago I'm not seen in a daughter here and I put it this way matters\nBy a hey look the west has called in hello Steve how are you\n[noise] first for me to try to agree with that because [noise] uh let me kind of go back a little bit more when you're talking about this pendulum situation that we got going\nBut\nLet me kind of go back a little bit before once you're talking about this pendulum situation that we got going back and forth and you and I will talk about this well we get into this extremism we're starting to see the right move even for the last movie even\nAnd I think the right moving that much further was because the lab has become so far to the\nNature of horrors of what are the chances every one has been asking ever since you got together on that radio station about the possibility of a third party\nIn the right moves so far to the right in the last part of the left to see the possibility of a legitimate third party coming in the middle\nYes [noise] this is probably something that [noise] because I agree with your question without knowing probably what you're going to hit [noise] feel like that a lab and in our life\nYes\nNow now let's not say also that I'm older than you and so I have to define what they've done that is not to be afraid that and not say our lifetime but in this generation how 'bout that\nOkay I have to admit they're I think we disagree I don't think a legitimate third party is going to happen during this generation I think maybe if I have the\nRent yeah let me let me let me ask you this now let me ask you this then define legitimate\nOne that's got an actual legitimate shot and claiming\nIt might be in the twenties thirties I don't know about me around in the twenties thirties by ... and it might be on the outside of you know whatever time I have left on this mortal coil\nBut I Do think you're going to see some pretty significant progress now by definition your definition of legitimate I don't necessarily know but I think I'm going to be enough to sway future elections for the two dominant parties\nI that I I'm just you know thinking about it I mean we're having hell bent\nOn the Republicans and Democrats that despite the fact that yes we have third parties none of them really have a legitimate shot at the White House I'm Talking about one that has a legitimate chance of like going\nFrom the electoral perspective you're spot on\n[noise] that's that's the one that I'm curious about and I have to admit I'm not certain that I Would see to get my grand kids I think they might but I don't think I [noise]\nYeah unfortunately Steve it's a coin toss it at this point in time I actually hope we do I don't know what that's going to look like but you know we're going to find out about two weeks is what the future of either of these parties much why\nBecause depending on how this thing ends up in the Democrats when they're going to go even harder left and the Republicans when they might very well stay in tread water for generations become\nVery well may be right well we'll talk about it soon absolutely I've seen a few days ago I\nThe vast majority of we the people are in fact proud members of this new emerging Trump's ... culture and mail you we feel better about ourselves and our country than in years\nAnd that has become increasingly difficult because of media bias and yet we must know what a candidate will do once elected tomorrow if it's still the economy stupid that should mean advantage Republicans Mr Crawford tells you why I'm Bill McCollum daddy's\nAll do you ...\nThere'll be ...

drag your kids your grandkids your neighbors everybody put them on the back of the truck and take them to vote nothing will that has gotten me I'm wound up I got to go to a caller Mitch welcome to the program\nIs all that is what I was\nI did this is not the appropriate joke reconnaissance question\nWas asked ourselves in Los Angeles at least the game from there we were winning this or that kind of desperate person waiting in the fall I wasn't either not desperate another thing is what does the target older son gets a little\nLess is to be important job and I don't think he can afford and ... for the U.S want her to be a really good point\nThere I Hope they think are on top they look at the mindset of the former now we will see are these people are nothing like a\nReally good choice I tell you other than when Robert De Niro goes out and you know drops the F bomb on national TV I never even think about him now I Know that I don't know about pop culture and I really don't care about

know\nWhat this is an accident that's the person we're not desperate where when we're moving up in the polls\nSo you say that my um my article that I fear this is Democrat staffers were supporters is much more logical than this person being a ... bomber\nWell you know like I said let's just see how this was very coordinated strategy a secret I that's what it was but yet the Hitler on the other\nHand he's they operation just about ... idiots\nThe ... one of the other\nDay operation ... pilot for the war idiots and they knew how the system works the bombs what's the secret service to be straight first so now but nobody was hurt\nI'm not sure anybody was going to get hurt bottom anyway I mean I hate to say that made it but the listening to some of the bomb experts and looking at the response from people\nUm if somebody didn't know this was coming I I I don't know how lethal not that that diminishes it Mitch yeah but I'm sure these things were really bombs now they might be made to look like bombs\nI absolutely agree it was for the shock value they didn't want her body they want is the ... the PR they want to take the victim Iran which we will ... because they're so violent now we're violent now this goes back to Trump's gee that was the key awesome each\nThat's right that's right now we got 'em out there we go to CNN what's his name out they're blaming Trump within a couple of hours that this was ... calls him saying bad things about journalists in saying they're all fake news in their enemies with people these stories Margot bomber\nAnd uh the one that we fear it's the far right terrorists that's why people don't trust the press\nBut you don't want to know where the NASA effort Kavanaugh everything's under scrutiny now 'cause where's the for sale at the bombs I mean you know\nI may maybe uh what's his name uh who's the but the porn lawyer ... ...\nAh that's why they didn't go off his genius put them together\nMay start make sure you mark ... sorry from the bombs on Facebook [laughter]\nThink Mitt or in the day he makes a fantastic point\nNo body\nNobody cares we we do want Hillary Clinton out there at every moment high rank lately Homer rub your mama out there at every moment\nHe can't even get a crowd together they have to fight the look of the crowd they had to make sure the cameras are positioned ... they have to put the curtains and squeeze the venue in so they can make it look crowded Joe Biden Joe Biden couldn't get a handful of people to come to intervene why are we Robert De Niro\nWho after Robert De Niro no warning on the route even thinks about Robert De Niro these Robert De Niro he goes you go crazy person nobody's\nFault because we said while he's at the last Oscars which was my mother go\nI haven't thought about Robert De Niro Debbie\nWasserman Schultz really she's gone been gone nobody cares it's unbelievable go to Keith Keith welcome to the program\nHey I'm a okay Paul\nYes yeah well I'm not but I'm just saying I don't know anybody can visit my house\nYou're either going to try and scare people or you can try and kill people\nYes well I Would think if you're really a bomb or you're trying to kill people\nWell make and and if people happen to a seal white you're scaring them well that's\nUm would you agree that I was pretty much ... own that it would not take five there would\nBe a a running heard of Republicans\nHeaded to the cameras to say\nViolence is unnecessary why is it the Republicans having to run to the cameras to say violence is unnecessary they didn't do anything\n\nWell but they couldn't help themselves\nI I don't get it but here's the thing you know I think those of us was a motive film of common sense can agree that this was done by the way it's done to shape the narrative and to change the news cycle and the two things in the news cycle you know it's always follow the money right Scott\nBest right most of the time\nAll right so what do you want to change the narrative from the caravan was not working out very well for um\nNope [laughter] gee whiz you think Cory Booker site called this thing came up right now\nCory Booker in is a um harassing a guy in the bathroom yet that thing yes\nWe're not that that that doesn't matter that was that's you know we don't even know that that's true\nCart what it does get it out in the news cycle\nIt does and then they'll come back in a week or two when someone like myself are you ask 'em\nDrew cart what it does get it out in the news cycle\nIt does and then they'll come back in a week or two when someone like myself are you ask\nA we reported it okay yeah it's been totally covered yes exactly right yeah so\nLet's get one step ahead here if you're going to set something like this up to change the news cycle and the narrative and make it look like the Republicans are the rye or\nThe Republicans are not violent they are full fledged terrorist far right terrorist\nOkay so if you're going to set this up what'd you take the trouble to have a pet see so it could look like that when we found out where they came from\nOh yeah you're going to have somebody that if we end up finding out where they came from they will have no social media accounts unless it's just a whole bunch of right wing I'm Talking about over the top no one is really like that crazy stuff\nYeah I don't know I you know I think that we're going to find out who did\nThis and a St Louis and we find out who it was it will have been engineered like the rest of it for us to find out the person they want us to find\nWell I Am looking at the picture cork and it looks like there's a picture that maybe Donald Trump on the explosive\nDevice this is one of those photos right beside the core dogs wives that ah somebody open the package and took a photo unless we unless we got this from\nThe law enforcement agencies which I don't think you're supposed to do NBC News article by being Collins says the image on the explosive device that looks kind of like its Arabic I'm appears to be a parody\nOf an ISIS flag taken from a ... that have been circulating on route wing corners of the Internet is twenty four team the printout appears to show a parity flag that replaces Arabic characters with the silhouette of three women in high heels\nI'm having a hard time seeing this three women in high heels and a middle inscription reading get her done which is the kids to stand up comedian Larry the cable guy that's what that's what's out there did you say get her done and there\nYou can see get her done and it if you get close up on it you know they made it kind of look like Arabic script or writing or whatever you call it yeah but you're done is there now you know I figure they could not come up with the Tea Party bumper stickers for rapid\n[laughter] [noise] no joke oh let me ask you how many conservative\nFolks do you know\nThat run around and [laughter] I mean there's just so it's so clear Shay even though it's not a good ... we don't say get her done unless we're\nJoking about something I mean this is just over the top\nIt is it's you know it's it's the theater that and you know who's good theater us or them they're much better at theater yeah\nI mean and this is pure theater\nOh you know we've all established that you know by definition bombs are either\nThings that have exploded or could explode and these are not we need to quit calling the bombs in just call him I don't know lefty props or whatever oh you know we need to come up with a proper name for what they are\nOh now I Know why I couldn't see it because the picture that they gave\nWhatever oh you know we need to come up with a proper name for what they are\nOh now I Know why I couldn't see it because the picture that they gave us is the it's like upside down\nAnd the the get her done part is only circle this on the\nOther side of the improvised plastic device so now now the okay get or do any\n... wonder about the George Soros device now what was the deal there George services houses so valuable my piano life means nothing if I get blown up getting it out of the house that's okay but if it blows up in the house this is a bad thing so\nYou weren't you know you were just keeping the guard shack or the place where the male is received from being blown up you don't you're not even close to the house ...\nOh so so George George this mail room is worth more than my life\nYes you take you take this very deadly scary devise and you take it out in the edge of the woods that's what all of us do\nOkay now you kinda gotta wonder why that George Soros supply Scott alone in place so it couldn't be inspected and the rest of them were getting somebody is you know we're we're never going to actually get on the fact that somebody's going to inspect it\nIt'd be really nice if we can know what was in um 'cause I you know Scott how much trouble is it go down to the hardware store and they're not even buying metal pipe\nThat they have to read at all oh I Know it's I mean it's fine that they can put an end cap on it all looks like an elementary school\nScience project that's made to put a a Coca Cola and what's that stuff you put in there the little ...\nBecame one of several years\nAgo they had an elementary school science project look remarkably like a bomb\nThat was caught me Ed Koch boy [laughter] ban on gay but now you got married we got a post that [laughter] I think that in the mail\nYour very races for saying that\nScott I learned that from this morning [laughter] did he say it was racist

know my thing is is you know I'll FedEx for a living and they've got all sorts of scanners and and and stuff like that to detect chemicals are things that looked like bombs or whatever\nAnd I'm pretty sure you know probably not the smaller post offices but the big ones like up in New York\nThey would have something similar so my thing is is that if this was a bomb or anything that looked like a bomb it would have been caught at the male level instead of being mailed out\nNo I I think you're right and I think that's part of the reasons why there is no the markings across\nThe stamps or not there are some people think that some of them were actually delivered that's a that's the theory that somewhat I delivered by courier which doesn't mean the courier did anything wrong somebody just got the courier to deliver it\nYeah and you know I think it's funny that it's been delivered to all the little ones that want to bring America down or they call for violence against conservatives and Republicans it's\nAlthough on that one of America's or they call for violence against conservative than outlook and it's all of them and my thing is is\nIf Republicans are the ones that right now or you know winning it it's a midterm election I Would think they are directed towards trying to take 'em out\nI don't I Can't disagree nice Tony appreciate the call but we got to take a break John

church and they were um trying to help the church or the or the last call was that they were supposedly on this and using the ... so that was trying to secure in a way that the board would\nBe able to manage it better and\nSo he ... he tried new helping certainly now because of the way in turn will make stuff up and they try to use it against though right and people try and isn't this the know anything about politics is that people try to help out\nAnd you know people who have to work every day and do their job and then people try to put them down but you know like the guy next to being in\nA while he's eight times as soon as they he's trying to do more for his knee and he's a punch him down for trying to do more by saying he needs to just stay in that space and that's the frustrating thing about\nUm politics as people tried to help and other people try and put them down and I laughed I Do for him to try\nYou got that right ... thanks Bob I appreciate you buddy nights with golf let's\nKeep on going Ken welcome to the program for listening\n... appreciate you appreciate the show Yes sir like fellow sometime but for the worst you'd run for governor so to a vote for

national ... magazine and [noise]\n... was it ... about an hour a mhm I received in our magazines sometimes lack of a national ... magazine and it endorses layers touch\nA postcard and I if I remember correctly I'm not a hundred percent sure because for most of these fine garbage but if I remember correctly I receive one from an already supporting Myers touch with the colored you know alright emblem owned by a postcard this one\nDoes not have the colored so you'll get has a black and White City okay and if you flip the postcard over is is paid for about ...\n[laughter] it is\nThe section that I don't mean to say the words that makes me very few rich I mean he could have said he's in it are a member of which are shorter than\nHe is going to be lifted the years that he's been raided a Bob in our age back when he was yeah right right right\nBut when you shouldn't be like something a mass deception that you're not right I mean he could have put on that um you know number out of been plowed for that I'd have been fine yes but when you put a card out it's the simulating something that it's not that is nothing but ...\nWill make clear that people understand 'cause we've got thousands of listeners up in your area so the deceptive male piece was from which campaign\nJoin in ... and and the extent and the\nPerson who actually is endorsed by the n._r._a. and that race was\nLast Dutch I appreciated nicer making it clear how great that you do to keep on rolling Toni welcome to the program\n[noise] hey man I really like your show up you I got\nI got two things uh one thing real quick and then a conspiracy theory for you\nIt's Thursday that'd be perfect\nThe R I or the first thing is a man I went to both of the Trump rallies or in Huntsville and the only type of violence or anything else that I saw was the protesters that were in a in that rally the ... they were protesting against Trump\nAre you telling me that the president of United States did not Tony he didn't ask you to go out and beat up liberals\nNot at all man let me tell you something these protesters they were the ones that were violent they were the ones that were trying to snatch signs as they were being escorted out everybody was being real cool and just kind of saying you know get them out of here we weren't even really paying attention to them so [noise] yeah man it's it's it's crazy but\nTony ... you or should I trust Steve Smith who was a former campaign advisor for John McCain I mean really\nAll you got to know is a bit Woody Harrelson play Steve Smith in the movies so that ought to\nTell you right there you don't trust the ... like anything else stony\nYeah the the second thing is real quick conspiracy theory for you or I think a a vet uh they they uh pike a bomb things I think that was actually sent by a left wing but that's already been stated here's my thing for the caravan it's coming\nTo me what is a perfect image of why you should build a wall\nSeven thousand migrants coming from these other countries into our country if I was a multi billionaire I would've sponsor all of these people coming to our border for a reason to build a wall that's just my conspiracy there and you'll have a good one\nGot a nice Tony yeah there are people saying that where the journalist the journalist who are supposedly you know upset that they're not enemies of the people they haven't known I've seen a couple of articles theirs\nThere were supposedly ... you know upset that they're not enemies of the people they have known I've seen a couple of articles there are some folks out there trying to find who's funding this whole caravan who started this whole caravan and uh there's some folks saying that it's actually the Venezuelan government\nThe the Marxist out there some of it started by the Marxist that were ousted in ... who were telling the Honduran people they have to take you in America 'cause they caused all your problems\nDon't forget some of these people in America who believe that stuff to keep on going Jonathan welcome to the program\n[noise] God man it's just another day rather be happy yeah yeah but\nI I'm going to try to break it down just a little day for a job and we want to figure out where this all started and we want to blame Trump but Chollet had nothing to do with the rising burgers show but nothing to do\nSick stamps or what it probably wouldn't even make the thing I get there but it it is there's some strange stuff and will hopefully we'll get to the bottom or\nSomething I hadn't is failing on it so that's right and it ... well it sounds like a how it's too much of\nA it just seems weird I mean you send a package of John Brennan at CNN and you do I'm a Wasserman Schultz address but you wreck [laughter] but now has a timer\nThey follow the by\nLet's go to ... I don't know we got a bunch of people and no names like Murphy welcome to the program\nAt you might've it's spelled it right but you're saying it's wrong it's our head or Rick ... silent\n[laughter] head or if you got it sorry our head Erich you get yeah ours got to be there I Gotcha sorry\nUh you know you're you're asking about uh the Soros kid tourists junior and air how he would have is a little op ed ready so quickly\nAnd I you know I'm just at the point where these people wait for this kind of stuff\nThey are just waiting with bated breath they have already in their mind imagine these grand things where they can become\nSome kind of you know save your or some kind of whatever for their cause and so when somebody does something or as horrendous as the Senate and despite the fact that they're fake uh it is really hearing this\nAnd you know any other person that should be a terrorist act but they're doing it to themselves so\nYou know who knows what you would call it but\nWhen the normal everyday person out there who doesn't know exactly what's going on\nSince the stuff they want to come to this shit and saves their their idols and they're icons and they want to defend them so they're they're ready so if if it happens they're going to shoot that stuff out there so quickly\nBecause we see it in the press we see it in a in these these operatives who are sitting in on the planning meetings for how they're gonna you know bamboozled list this time\nThey're sitting out there just waiting with bated breath ready to jump on whatever because they get their talking points\nThey are more prepared and they're not they're not going to miss a crisis that's for sure ... good point thanks body\n... so user\nSo I'm going to the he'll do Politico dot com Trump's loan balance with violent rhetoric\nBeyond his own incendiary comments he has done little to ... loose talk of killing Clinton and Obama this is from back in\nAugust Secret Service investigated Trump's butler over a Facebook post saying that President Brock Obama quote should be shot as an enemy agent Secret Service agents also interviewed a Trump campaign advisor I don't know this is who said that Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason\nIn December Trump appeared on a radio show warned that federal the federal government ... round up going gun owners like Jews and Nazi Germany\nThat's the that's that's violent rhetoric\nRefrain of paying the beauty and kill the beauty of grown increasingly common at Trump rallies what I thought the problem was walk her up\nBut this is political what else\nWith the he said oh one day back in August the second amendment people might stop Hillary Clinton's Supreme Court appointments with here is this oh this\nWhat else with the he said oh one day back in August the second amendment people must stop Hillary Clinton Supreme Court appointments what year is this oh this was back in sixteen\nWhen they were trying to say it was violent and have for violent hateful they reference comments from the Southern Poverty Law Center at the Southern Poverty Law Center say it it must be true there's no question is more violent hateful speech in this campaign than in past presidential contests\n[noise]\nGoodness gracious\nI'm Still I'm Still looking for the glaring evidence of the president advocating violence don't welcome to the program\nThanks for listening I don't\nI'm Sorry I had young sticker law that was\nFun I felt better on speaker I don't blame you\nI I got a a cutting in that earlier that the n._r._a. and know that the state Senate\nYes ma'am I stood race and the Johnny Mack more race\nYeah well I I'm up in Kenya were have a I don't know how you have to describe the the ... or the policy is going on a pair of that I caught the n._r._a. because the candidate\nThey claim you claim to be the Democratic leader has suddenly turned independent even though and he'd climbing he's changed his ... and now they say that he\nDoesn't demonstrate that but anyway\nHe doesn't know who would who would be I think I Know who you're talking about how they ... yeah ... who was the majority minority leader the Democratic leader in the album house of representatives\nOkay [noise] um but anyway he claims that he has the n._r._a. endorsement just go again are I guess they said they did not end do stick to slap\nAnd I asked that was several different people because it took me a while to get to the person that at the end All right have led to answer that question uh-huh [noise] uh so\nDon't understand this climate did they endorsed right I I don't understand that I don't understand\nThe outright lying and all the stuff that's going on and of course I think I Know that politics now that is correct but I think ... is the most corrupt\nOr win or lose in er which are way we look at it\nWell there's so much intimidation do now is just so much so many things going on that just downright around um\nHave you ever wondered why or for some people that no no I'm from a good job of room for the best person winning but sometimes it amazes me how much effort how much intimidation and how much how many dirty tricks people use to get an office\nThat's not supposed to be good for the office older you're not supposed to get rich off of it you're not supposed to be able to pedal your influence and power but some people it is no holds barred and ... most of the time I feel like for those people\nI don't want them in office I I don't even know who I was in the race you are talking about but when you go to such an extent to get elected you're probably up to no good\n... you you are so right there\n'cause I can tell you from being an officer didn't do anything but calls me financial\nHardship yes 'cause you
