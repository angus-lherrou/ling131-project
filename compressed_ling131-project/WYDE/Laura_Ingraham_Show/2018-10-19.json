hot and things are things are getting a blood sport on the radio this\nMorning ah yeah we got a little bit of that job and I'm just sitting back in ... normally it's may push the buttons but on what the color of their dinner [noise]\nAll right so we've had you on the several times now then and I want you to give us a real quick update if you don't mind just in the uh some of the battles that you've been fighting as it relates to the the Second Amendment another you've been in a lot of media\nAnd you'd be getting a lot of press out there really making a lot of great inroads with are both good and bad guy and good bad guy number two so what's going on\n[noise] well there's a lot of states are fighting right now the attempts at these red flag\nLaws and each state is kind of bundled up well many states have bundled these little these little gun laws together I Know New York for instance has um has a red flag part of their red flag laws that\nUm any a certified school of employees can deem a child or person or a risk to ... to society which would then mean\nThat um you know look a little Johnny for instance gets a deemed a risk so now the big Johnny gets his guns taken away and a big Johnny got about two to three days to get a lawyer to defend himself to prove his innocence\nUm and ah to prove little that little Johnny is not a risk and so the point is that these are these um attempts at restricting people's rights completely does away with due process\nAnd you're giving this type of authority to people who can be\nAn assistant teacher or a\nOr a substitute teacher anyone who is certified and that that was specifically to New York but other states have them as well so that's one of the things that were really fighting yes it's a it's a terrible thing for gun owners\nSpecifically to New York but other states have them as well so that's one of the things that were really fighting and it's a it's a terrible thing for gun owners and we are fighting a war fighting hard you know the other thing that I'm trying to expose the hypocrisy that comes from the left and there are many examples of that\nWell you know it's interesting because earlier today you know you would send me an article about top Bloomberg and the comments he made and the comments were made you know a couple of years ago and we have no reason to believe\nAnd you know that his position on on his thoughts about minorities have changed and it is kind of interesting very interesting quite frankly about how and pardon the pun how the left has weaponized the gun debate in you know even comments again about you know keeping guns out of the hands of minorities what does that all about\n[noise] well the way I see it when left is get comfortable with the conversation of race which they have and they're comfortable with it because they believe that there'll be authority on the topic\nYou can take us wherever you go through with a super station one oh one half on the radio on the Web on your phone rung of what the government at all of a surveillance camera your hometown God and country said superstitions one on what what do you\nWant to do when you open your heart to patriotism there is no room for prejudice the Bible tells us how good unpleasant it is ... ... people live together and you know Trump\nWe are your hometown God and country station super station one oh one nobody windy\n[noise]\nWhen I [noise]\n\nYeah Jo lock it I uh I didn't know you had hair and to this morning [laughter]\nI Would like them glad that they do I need those glad because I\nDidn't realize I had her either I can see Russia [laughter] from the studios there you\nGo wherever the conversation with Dan Ross the are the good guys bad guy\nAnd the reason I made that comment Dana I got a brand new glasses yes and I got magic glasses so now I can actually see so the guys are\nYou talking earlier yeah you you can't see a long far distance right that's correct I must say the same situation\nYeah whenever I go to the ah the drive through and wherever I have to take a picture of the menu and blow it up on my phone [laughter]\nAh ... how how's our friend Joe doing I'm doing good how are you doing this morning or good\nYeah we got Joe here James's here doing here got a whole host of folks\nJust kind of a languishing around the way we're all on a a\nOn a friday they ever got somebody's gonna I called and got a question for you and then I Want to talk a little bit I Would change directions on here after we talked to Richard because I Want to get your thoughts on that give you a little bit of a heads up I Want to talk about some of the ... going on in New York politics since you live up in that area but down let's get the Richards call first come on and Richard how are you\nThere I'm here Michael okay a stand up\nI work for them to have the elevator or west morning we did a couple of background checks everything was normal but about midnight Wednesday or we get one on the Egypt corn walked out didn't know what was going on and it will begin to look at it\nTop of the page they were requesting your identification number a driver's license or whatever or in the federal for\nWeed out what the heck so when you up and it changed enough when we just want to hear the call wanting and and then they requested from the examiner\nOn the fall but that is never been the case before this happened suddenly midday aunt last Wednesday and it's not\nA and a half an inch or continue to them I don't know where optional\nNow suddenly they're asking for your driver's license number there's an additional over ... ... exactly who you are just going out on these federal for that change happen without any kind of noticed midday last Wednesday and just wanted to give you a heads up would you be in his fault is involved a gun rights national you are\nAnd yet you're clearly has hit the gym again or was it just a one time thing no no it's on every corner now you have to actually put you in uh the photo top five day the government are they in their driver's license number pass\nIs it just a one time thing no no it's only ... you have to actually plug you in a photo topped by the government are they and their driver's license number passport number\nOr other numbers that are identify you very specifically we're in the past your ah your number which would be you know if you've got a delayed or whatever they give you a specific number or your Social Security number optional\nWould that change happened in the middle of the day this last Wednesday unit's gone out on the federal background check\nSo it was another layer that we have dealt with before and we don't know and I have no idea why anytime I see something like that maybe it makes me nervous\nWe should it should make you nervous because it sounds to me like a ... you know any any type of registration especially if they can tie it to you or a driver's license now\nThey all they have to do is look at your license plate and know if you're a gun owner and know if you're a ... a care specifically know if you're a concealed carrier so that that to me is very scary and and then we then then if if laws are passed in certain jurisdictions where you can't take your gun out of your house well now we got a a really\nTight situation where you could be carrying in your car and a police officer is told to look at license plates for that specific reason and now you're pulled over and now you're violating a jurisdiction\nWith your hand gun this this could it be ideas to shut down gun owners in any way possible and this stuff is just really scary wheat to fight back on this stuff and and push back on this is terrible but thank\nYou I don't know but that was just a heads up because it allowed us totally by surprise we didn't understand what the heck was going on and you know first you could see the changes in the form but until you actually check check check that box in the inner does all that information you wouldn't let you proceed with the\nOnline uh each it and then when we called and they asked the same information never happened before so let's see if we find out what's going on with it\nWell ... and Michael here's the thing about this type of thing that we're talking about is we had a case called Hillary versus D.C and\nThat was all about uh them trying to lock up guns in the in the homes um we won and so but what ... what's happening now is in New York City it's the same kind of thing where you you know you really can't take God out into the city you you have to keep their pretty much locked up in the home and now we're fighting that so I'm hoping that we have another Heller type\nA case a winning the Supreme Court in New York City\nBut until those cases go\nThat far and until we can win those cases the cities and states can create these laws and and restrict gun owners and they can tie if they can tied into your driver's license man that's exactly what I'm Talking about how they can read all ...\nAnd this and this was federal uh this this was on the federal homes not ... says what disturbed me the most right right well beyond death yup nice man\nNitrogen present because they're very much yeah we've been fighting for a\nFor national reciprocity and are apparently this is what we've gotten or keep his personal now Richard very curious as to how ... how that progress is\nThen a lot of folks do know that you actually reside up in New York before we part ways today I Want you to give us a little bit of insight into the New York politics what you're hearing up there you guys have got some real whacked out candidates running for office up there so what in the world is on the minds of most New Yorkers\nWell unfortunately we have for Governor Cuomo who's very far left and he's going even further left or right off the cliff right now and um we we have a hard time getting him out of office\nFree far left and he's gone even further left or right off the cliff\nRight now and um we we have a hard time getting him out of office we have to a crazy radical left wing senators Chuck Schumer\nAnd Kirsten Gillibrand who are a disaster the three of them together are destroying the state and they're destroying it for for constitutional loving Americans a New Yorkers and so so that's what we're trying to trying to get them to help out\nAnd we do have a a couple of good candidates\nAnd uh we're we're trying to vote in the Republicans are which we may have it we may have a chance on the senator side but a governor the governor racist not looking good for a for us real Americans us real New Yorkers so um and just to just to define the difference between real\nAnd a wealth fake uh we have upstate New York which is completely separate in ... mentality and in a ideology\nOr from downstate from New York Manhattan or New York city area so it it's almost like two different states however we do have a lot of liberals up here in I'm\nIn upstate New York but we uh we keep them in check\n[laughter] it was enough for you right now I'm not doing we had a a request\nYeah we had a a color requests for you to read the second amendment straight straight out of the constitution\nOkay and to what in I mean they wanted to comment on it door\nUh she made a comment like Congress shall make no law right infringing on these rights I can read it if you want\n... you know I you know obviously I'm always going to the constitution in front of me anyway let me just you know reads a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed I mean that's the power amendment\nThat's it it's short but what's the question she's asking\nI'm not a hundred percent certain outside of maybe she's trying to make the point that show not being friends\nI think that was her point is I can talk it wasn't quite go ahead\nYou know the one thing about the real well regulated militia they you know if the left just like to like to talk about that well regulated militia as being something you know regulated by the government which is exactly the opposite of what a real read well regulated\nMilitia it means well armed and trained as what it means\nYeah and it's the people because the minute the government is in charge of regulating the militia it's not a militia anymore it's a it's an arm of the government\nRight right there and unfortunately we are out of the time I appreciate your problem by today it's always a pleasure to talk to you especially on a friday tell us how they can learn more about Dan ... got a copy of both of your books\nBut he is a real hero he carries a club it's as we the people on it and you know you just um I I guess my attitude is with a lot to shower stuff out there in fact Steven cold there right now has kind of a fake children's book\nAnd it's a mean spirited anti Trump book it's like number one on Amazon and I thought\nThose of us who love this president who love this country we need to have some things out there\nThat ah that we can celebrate where we can laugh you know at so Donald drain the swamp is my answer to that it's it's a kids' book I really wrote it as an adult book\nUh humor book because I said I Want to write something that looks like a kids' book but adults will find it funny but because it's innocent because it's not mean spirited political humor it also works as a children's book so now I guess I'm I'm having to change my tune and say yeah it's a children's book but I think a lot of adults\nAre going to buy it you know maybe as a gift or or or even as a gag gift for their friends that do not love this president\nEric you know you you're a wonderful historian and you're well aware of the fact that you know every single president all the way back to Jefferson had problems with the press in their particular time in no time in our history have we seen a president was quite so vitriolic as this time around what do you attribute that to\nOh it's it's simple it's simple uh pretty much a everybody has played Patty cake with with the vicious\nA liberal press and I and I say this as someone you've got to understand I live in New York City I went to Yale University I Know\nHow these people thing because I was one of them until Nineteen eighty eight I had this born again experience and I really changed in many many ways and I began to see that what I had been taught and so on and so forth in college now but my parents 'cause my parents taught me right\nReally changed in many many ways and I began to see that when I had been taught and so on and so forth in college now and my parents because my parents taught me right\nBut I began to see that they have a completely different world view it's fundamentally anti American the things that are Rush Limbaugh talked about this on Sean Hannity last night brilliance a incisive read of how some folks\nThink and and I I have to say that I really have never seen anything like this every US President has has been playing Patty cake with the press compared to what we have right now and the reason for this but it really simply\nIs that Trump is kind of focused\nTheir hatred in other words in the past yeah they were focused on where you know they were focused on George\nBush but somehow he uh strikes a nerve\nWay no one else did he'll say the things that he'll call them out\nBecause the gloves are off right now and it's it's it's too bad really that we're at this place but if we're at this place we need somebody who understands\nThat and he was going to call them out on stuff and so you know as I say in the\nThe ... in in in this kid's book down during the swamp it's a bipartisan swamp let's be clear right because uh when when Trump or Iran or a couple of years ago he was against the entire Republican establishment George W. Bush George Bush senior\nNone of them came out for him I could go down the list\nOf all the Republicans that refused\nTo endorse him it was really a stunning thing because you have an establishment that is out of touch with the people of America and they're perfectly uh uh you know comfortable with that and so it's a it's a bizarre moment where we're living in but I you know I was gonna say I probably should tell your audience the plot of my book so they're not in the dark but it's meant to be\nGood humor and it's not meant to be mean it's it's meant to be fun and positive let me put it that way\nWhen I Know your observations are spot on one of my sisters was actually on the faculty of yeah you know and uh my ... yeah my producer James as a matter of fact one of my sisters worked on both of them one of them actually worked for Eric Holder's well the Justice Department years ago so let's just say that the holidays in our household or well lively\nSo you know I understand exactly what you're talking about but give us the plot of the book\nWell OK it all starts out this is all going to say I'm very familiar okay it starts out that all the cave people are upset because their leader is out of touch the king has moved to the middle of a slump\nAnd he only talked to the creatures that live in the swamp he\nNever talk to them you never comes out of the swamp and they're they're just really upset and what are they going to do well is there is one of the cave people it's kind of famous he's a builder of caves his name is Donald and they think if we go talk that Donald he kinda knows how to get stuff done maybe he can help the situation so they talked to Donald and and they say look\nThe king has moved to the middle of swat we never get to talk and can you help us and he says well tomorrow I got some time uh although down at the swamp see what's going on so he takes a walk down to the swamp and they warned him about the swamp creatures and the first one creature needing ... is\nThe lobby of saw Russ lobbyists or is is in the swamp\nAnd a lot of resources or you want to talk to the king well guess what that is not going to happen only talks to people who live in the swamp that's just the way it is now you want to live in a swamp maybe we can work something out in ... and Donald says I don't live in the swamp I like living outside the small\nI re he realizes that we've got a big problem here so he goes back to the people and he says we're gonna have to get drastic we're gonna have to drain the swamp everybody gas she can't even say that you're going to get the swamp creatures angry\nAnd he says will just what you've been angry for well haven't you well maybe it's their term so he decides he's going to take a shovel and go down the next day and how's he going to do it\nPreachers angry and he says well guess what you've been angry for well haven't you well maybe it's their term so he decided he's going to take a shovel and go down the next day and how's he going to do it they don't they don't even believe it's possible he says with simple I'm a builder I Know how to do this stuff I'm gonna did trench it's going to be the biggest bashed trench you've ever seen\nAnd we're going to get in Mexico to pay for the trench just kidding that was a joke and he says we're going to build the biggest best trench you've ever seen so he goes down with a shovel the next day and he starts to dig the trench in the swamp creatures come out and they are not happy there screaming that I'm not the swamp creatures if you look in the book\nYour your listeners are going to recognize some of these swamp creatures or one of them whereas half glasses he might be a senator from New York he cries a\nLot a\nCry and I can't think of his named Chuck Schumer could be I don't know uh there's another dinosaur that looks suspiciously\nWell let me just say it's a turtle I'm not going to mention names but it's a bipartisan swamp so you can recognize some of these creatures here right well I Want to say that these creatures are so angry and they say you can't dig here what is wrong with you we live here we live in a swamp and he says\nWell listen I can build your cave you know where we live outside the swamp and they said we don't want to live outside the swamp the people who live outside the swamp for an educated they're on cultured they're\nDeplorable well\nHe knows that uh this is not going to work he's just gonna have to keep digging so we dig the trench any notice is by the way that the green color of the swamp it's not a normal green color it looks like money and then he realizes\nDonald says holy cow this is money now I Know why the swamp creatures won't leave him by the king won't leave so he continues to dig and then the biggest bad a swamp creature of all shows up\nAre you ready for this yup it is it is the George Soros\nYes it's a billionaire Hungarian dinosaur the Georgia source shows up and they say oh now you've\nMade the Georgia source man and then all the people show up behind Donald him and say well not as mad as you've made us and they got their shovels and they're ready to pitch in and help them dig so they get big big big big\nBig dig the trench all the way to ... and the money flows out of the swamp the swamp is drain and every one of the swamp creatures including the king and the Georgia source chase the money to the horizon because that's the only thing they're interested in and the swamp is drained and everybody's happy\nAnd and people say but the problem is we want to talk to the king the king has gone what do we do a little girl says well maybe maybe we can McDonald our new king so they say don't you want to be the king and he says hey you are a free\nPeople now a team tells people what to do and they have to do it but a free people tell their leaders what to do and the leaders have to do it and they say oh you mean like a a president\nAnd he says yeah and if that's what you're looking for um your caveman and so they make him the first president and he moves into the castle in the middle of the swamp which used to be the swamp and everybody lives happily ever after it that's the story and I'm sticking to it [laughter]\nIt's a fable for our time obviously\nYeah it's got some ... go and do it as well I Love that I mean that is absolutely prize was not as just absolutely priceless so they're taking the book and and uh you know having life imitating art do you think that we're going to get the uh the trench dog\nDo you think we're going to get the ... the trends are yeah\nIn fact our second book this is a Donald the caveman book okay this is the whole thing we're going to do a second book called Donald builds the wall\nOr we're going to do another book called Donald goes to space this is I mean Donald a caveman is a folk hero and he's going to have other wonderful adventures and I think that I think he's going to he's going to build the wall whether Congress gives some funding or not\nAnd is a folk hero and he's going to have other wonderful adventures and I think that I think he's going to he's going to build the wall whether Congress gives him funding or not and that's what I Love about this president he understands when the people tell you to do something you got to do it and so\nI just think that it's going to happen I mean it's already happening but it's not happening the way it's supposed to happen but this is why I mean I tell ya market we gotta we gotta get people voting if we do not\nHold the house this is gonna be chaos all the stuff that he has a gun to do including give us this booming economy it's all going to go away and we're going to return to the horrors of the previous eight years I have to say that it's a very serious election and\nI I think that you know sometimes people think like well I don't know it's a mid term I don't care let me tell you this is the most important mid term unfortunately ever it we have to be really serious it's basically a\nA a ... it's it's about Donald Trump if you want him to succeed you gotta make sure that a Nancy Pelosi does not become the new speaker of the house that would be disastrous for America would actually be tragic it would be horrible\n... you know without the waffles all I can see that you are sick around job's going to hang out with us we got what our

tech or [noise] [noise] [noise]\nIn regards to the textbooks law class I don't think it's going to be a good thing because you're going to have half the class citizen do nothing and the other half plans because let's face it the black holes are there any possibility 'cause our tops you of racist\nArrest of what the law that you can only get half the class you know just okay listen to the other class of ... going back and forth\nYou know and that may be true right but I mean there are kids going to be in there that it will affect you know it's not going to work for everybody but at least they're making a concerted effort instead of just talking about it\nWell here's a question ... society molds the child does the parent to child I think voters okay we'll look good as the schools and it is in the black community cops or not\nI'll say not really respected so no matter what the school says child's going to go home parents want to say one thing and friends are going to say one thing and that's probably be it\nWell you know ... you know you know menu good friends and I and I and I'm going to push back almost say ... ... what's your statement is not a hundred percent true because ... not hate it in the black community in simple as though there are people who don't like him but there are kids that sit in those classrooms and I was one of them that came from those neighborhoods\nThat was I had to go with pure pressure but at the same time I wanted to be a good kid\nAnd like I said you may have a third of the class that you know part of what you're talking about and I agree with that going back to the environment but there are kids in that environment that won't out and I think it will affect is not going to affect a hundred percent but it may affect one or two and that's the start\nAnd let me give you a a real real quick I inner city example what I'm Talking about ... some years ago I'm In Atlanta\nThis was back in my um my uh remodeling days when I was doing remodeling sales\nAnd I often was playing this particular and I don't want to get back to my hotel room 'cause they'll still based on the Birmingham at this time and I think and I want to go watch the tigers play and you know this was back in the day when you know is run the streets or whatnot ... earlier than I Am today but I decided pop it in this convenience store 'cause I Want to pick myself up a six pack of beer All right 'cause I'm going home watching football\nSo I I go into the convenience store and it's a bad part of Atlanta is a very bad part of Atlanta but I'm always kind of people I Am not afraid of that kind of stuff so do I go on this convenience store and I turned around I've gotten a little six pack of beer and I turned around and there's four or five guys they're and they're black guys I'm just going to stretch a straight shooter with you and they basically said\nTo me hey you got any money on yeah now I could have got ... I was I was packing I could have bought a weapon could have drawn down could have gotten to a fight but you know how to handle the situation I looked at the guy that was the set it to me it was four or five of the guys standing around him and I said look I'm going to go home and watch all the tigers play\nI got twenty dollars in my pocket I Want to buy the six pack you let me get my six pack of beer get to that truck safely you can have what's leftover ... he looked at me he ... he led to his friends who went\nAnd they all went hey why not so I had a choice here I can get out with my skin ... my beer and my truck and go see them all the tigers play ... or I could have really amped up the situation and the end result would not been nearly as satisfactory to me\nAnd here's another person that conversation Michael you not knowing right in that situation it could've when they could have been meaning\nAs satisfactory to me and he's not opposed to that conversation Michael you not knowing right in that situation it could have when they could have been mean either way for yeah they do but normally in the black community but I made a rational argument right right you did you get the best of the the two but in a normal in a black community in those areas\nEverybody's always asking for money they ask you for a dollar\nWell you know I you know do you know I think they that they let me go a cause that at one of those are the other one they had to go to the space like\n... are you getting this guy right you know [laughter] All right we want beer he's got bear okay we're going to take your money Maria let's say you're ... you're right\nYou know again it could have gone to the tally different direction but but had I not do with it had I all may end up ... I was leaving without ... without a beer without my money anyway right\nOn by the way our last\nEight six six five five one nine nine three three I'll stick around Rick I'm right back where do you ... the room Nick Saban even stands up it's the Michael her show\nHey gang it's Michael here sunlight building services is here to protect the biggest investment of your company which is your building whether you're building a small boutique\nOr twenty storey banks sunlight is here to make your business shine if you've let some of your exterior maintenance go to the wayside suddenly building services can help you restore instead of replaced with top of the line last restoration\nPressure washing exterior painting and waterproof beans call to zero five\nNine four or five eighty nine twenty nine for your free W.

All right well see then I'd love to have you please come out is there\nI really have a a a a quick diversion here because I Want to talk to another one on the table and ... these guys just momentarily by rugby wall corners me in the hallway and I thought ooh [laughter] [laughter]\nI don't want to put anyone's or any words in anybody's mouth but I wanted to come in and just set your mind at ease when the um movie about Neil Armstrong was being promoted that it was coming out that first man\nWe heard I feel like we heard that it was not as patriotic as you would want it to be that the American flag was invisible or I don't quite remember the ... you know have a balloon or whatever that word is but\nThe hubbub I saw it last night and it's lovely than there is patriotism throughout and I don't understand what the controversy was about why it was said to to not to reflect the America's pursuit of winning the space race\nBecause that's basically what the whole movie is about and there are American flags through the whole thing and so I stopped in the hallway and civic news um\nBut what the whole movie is about and there are American flags through the whole thing and so\nI stopped in the hallway and said fake news\nUm well the reason I wrote but not because I have not seen the movie but I Am familiar with the uh the I'm concerned about what's got everybody all worked up it because there's that scene where they don't show planting the flag actually on the moon and when I heard the story the first time or what\nI don't know anything about the movie but is that a concern because it it it just\nAgain they're going to be flags all through the darn thing I have absolutely no idea but they're also seems to be this sense of that there was not a focus on it being an American achievement but it's a achievement of humanity but what you're telling me is that you've got a different perspective on the ...\nI did and I was you know kind of struck by it that the movie is telling I think two stories at once it's telling the stories of the Americans pursuit\nAnd then Neal Armstrong as the man so when he finally does make it to the moon\nIt really is about him the man and he's standing on the moon and he thinks back to his life and all but it took to get him there and he has some so much heartache along the way\nYup well we've ... we've got that story on our radar as well I I just don't know they haven't released it to my knowledge\nOkay well I was on those four years for releasing the information but anyway we'll take care and uh All right you got to be like next week 'cause I ain't going to be around the first three days but I thought the lighter\nAll right we'll talk to your third do you think art art now right by by\n... a lot of a lot of debate about the future politics in this country and the civility of it as well and the kind of parents back to the civility of we were talking about with a jar lock it related to this police training video in Texas\nAnd the civility there we're talking to a recipe wall with ... all the consternation the ANC stove or the flag planning on the moon\nYeah it was strange I went to see the moon movie last night first man and I liked it and the Americans win and it was good\nThat movie is not doing well by the way um because of exactly what you're referencing\nThat is what kind of frustrated me that um you know I'm frustrated them I'm not invested in whether the the film succeeds or not but it was made out to be somehow anti American or you know what I think in this in this\nXena phobia charged world\nWe seem to be in part of the thing that there was a press conference there was done by the producer of the film and I want to say is one of his creative writers or whatever happens to be French okay and she was there with him and her French accent talking about how a patriotic American or it was [laughter]\nAnd I said I think you know you remember back in the day when we had a freedom fries French fries and you are right and I think that a lot of people are kind of went on V. she order and thought you know you know she's a French woman what does you know about the American exceptionalism yeah it uh it left\nThe movie feeling sad because I was told the movie wasn't something now and again it didn't matter to me one or the other [noise]\nUm I felt like the the the filmmakers and the actors when they were trying to say it was a human story what it means is you know any great story really is about a particular character you know that's like why all war movies the ones that we remember most are the ones that about a particular battalion a particular\nSoldier um you know you can have like saving private Ryan has been a handful of guys it's set in World War two but it's about a hand right you got to connect\nOn a human level with the characters and so this movie really is not\nSimply about the space program it is about Neil Armstrong and all the interesting people that are part of that\nProduct going back to the whole thing that whole argument about humanity and again I'm all about American exceptionalism but when when Armstrong steps off the lunar module yeah do you know what he said\nTo me once to a small step for man one giant leap for mankind yes he references the fact that it was a a human success right right you know he didn't say it's one small step for man one giant step from America\nRight and it's clear that it is and that's it you know even in the movie that's the point that they're making is that the Russian ... had beaten the U.S at every ten beaten the astronaut set of return I guess the first in space in the first orbit and the first to do this so part of the reason of let's go to the moon let's have such a\nFar flung dream in this\nEarth orbit and the first to do this so part of the reason of let's go to the moon let's have such a far flung dream and this is dialogue and the movie let's have such a far flung dream that the Russians have to start from scratch and we're going to beat him to the moon and so\nAll the time in the movie it's we got to beat the Russians and it is an American achievement\nAnd then also it's a human achievement for this particular man not that Neil Armstrong if the reason we went to the moon but rather as America is trying to get to the moon we get to follow this guy from\nYou know his training and all the people who lost their lives and suffered harm along the way it was a great movie and so I was reading some articles about it after I watched it last night and that it isn't\nDoing wonderfully well at the box office but it's an undeniably good movie if you watch it and so it's going to hold up well it it is really a good film\nSo you're saying it's ... I think so yeah yeah\nYeah I I never I haven't seen it yet obviously I've seen some of the reports on it but I never really understood because you know you've got those people out there I think the numbers are sixteen million people that are still convinced that ever happened anyway sure and and they're the ones who are most upset he didn't wait to fly but it happened in Houston\nWhat's crazy it having watched the movie about how we got there it made me think we didn't go there because it is so impossible that we were able to do what we did with the limited technology every time\nI can still even want to you know mostly how we got there must be to realize you know this was an iPhone can yeah the iPhone three\nHad more technology than that rocket\nIs crazy it's like a little red wagon how in the world and they get there because it you know blast soften them as the capsule that comes out of the capsule then the capital out of that capsule and that even before they even went to the moon they had to make sure that they could doc one spacecraft one another in space and it went where I was\nI guess one of the the Gemini mission which in the movie they called ... which I thought was strange that was the French people okay must have been um\nBut even that like ... you're you're in outer space you're going a hundred and fifty thousand miles an hour and I'm supposed to believe somehow we connect this guy with that guy how does that happen I don't even know\nWhere you know ... you know that I wrote this book I Know in America and we talk a lot about just things that people might not know about this country\nAnd there is actually a story and they're about to the moon landing yes and a lot of people don't know that when they were the lunar module was about to set a set down there ... where they had picked out was to rocky and ... and the Armstrong actually was Buzz Aldrin\nKind of freaked out and then the Armstrong freaks out and they decide to move over there which you know moving to a lunar module was a big deal they were twenty seconds away Nineteen specifically nineteenth seconds away from running out of fuel that would've allowed them to put that thing down\nThat is the dramatic moment of the most uh really of of it's also dramatic rub it in my book [laughter] [laughter] oh weather\nAnd I don't think they said it in a way of seconds but in terms of fuel\nYeah and it is and I feel hounded your average yes you're dying you like yeah we can have come this far yeah and then run out of that they run out against the can't land it got to abort the mission that's exactly right and and a lot of the ...\nWhen they realized they were about to run out of fuel they were talking about a boarding the mission when they were ten feet\nOff the server yes even though I Would have jumped out on this side of\nHistory we know is that we know what we know what happened but you're just yes you're watching and actually I was alone\nIn the theater this was the the movie theater my collar best summer and went to a thirty show last night so\nNo you know what happened but you're just yes you're watching and actually I was alone in the theater this was the the movie theater my collar best summer\nAnd went to eight thirty show last night so it was a long movie who's like ten thirty eleven were finally landing on the moon\nAnd I know we landed on the moon but they're showing the image of the fuel and then you see the aboard button and like\nOh my goodness addict and yeah you knew the ending yes it's like a NASCAR where you know you've got the guy in the lead when he runs out of gas in the final lap it was going to even thinking about it makes me kind of tense up yeah you got to go see the movie\nWell I I definitely will because it's

bowling\nAnd maybe it is maybe I don't think about that that is when you say Scott if you give me a bunch of money I'm a crime you in the garbage can that's bully or Scott I'm going to do something really terrible that's bull and maybe if you just do it over and over but she\nDeserves to be called something and horse race wasn't exactly what she deserved to be called William welcome to the program\nMorning guys didn't want to\nI was just thinking about you earlier today and and I haven't heard from you in a few days that I was hoping you would call in and give us an update from the road\nWell without fail the road it is on an ... and if you see my daughter to say she\nWants to go shopping with her old man so she can spend some that he's\n... I was about to say 'cause she knows her push over ... daughter say oh shopping will you daddy is it's it's bad\n... which are not going like most daughters and most fathers didn't like right now she's Twenty one and I I I was like I said what do you want they want to she's well how about we go get a chance to go work out we'll go get some each and or do you do a little shopping yeah what do you what do you ...\n[laughter] oh I Need a new Law Order oh daddy\nYeah that's what it boils down to it but just back channel your point just one of your senses of what I gather on the road across the nation\nYou would have fallen down to it but because but back to your your point is one of your senses of what I gather on the road then across the nation now there's a lot of\nLatino or Hispanic drivers out there ... and a lot of these jobs are not for this immigration bill where I understand that\nYou know one of them are like what they're not taught people I'm third generation American or I might be first generation outlet that life on I came here legally art came here legally originally getting my green card walk off but I'm here as a citizen mail I did what I had to do a you know\nSo they so they see the threat did they realize how would you go to help\nYeah let's run from Texas or or ... or all and even those people I think that are here illegally really don't want any more\nBecause it takes away from me that are getting what benefits they get now even though they're illegal right right so there's ... either way it's not I don't I think I\nThink the news media is just playing this off but try to get more people answer you know you don't want the government chit to draw in more social democratic party I Know\nThis I think Trump's doing the right thing by putting the military down there I saw part of it which I'm a retired but I'm Glad I did but you know I'd be glad to go down their throat or draw my little government by for active\nDuty paycheck yeah absolutely you know but I I think he's doing the right thing if we can't get the boar bill ... he's the commander cheat watched one of the things he's matter to the military\nAnd he was tasked with say he's a doll being out of state stopping invasions\nYes stock in protecting the borders of the United states correct absolutely hate by going today we ... ... what what part of the it down there all what was the name of the general Persia was purging\nBlackjack purging when we're just going to get onto via\nYeah and you know we invaded Mexico got under a you know go get in a way it is about a first time we we just started a sovereign nations poor to protect girl\nYou got that right you're one of the people who knew about that I'm Glad you knew that story William\nYeah LA are you where you're from Blaine county [laughter] I'll have what Jennifer ... original [noise] okay that messes up my own story oh can I weigh about ... about gas by\nHow many people do Black Jack ... invaded may go\nWouldn't have known or a movie and you might be I don't know what movie would that be oh a movie that was a ... that was\nThat was kept in jak sorrow November OK okay are you getting my you know when you rely on movies and stuff for your for ah the knowledge yeah he's he's three as hard\nLike math Brian welcome to the program\nIt's got like ... like for let me get only absolutely will what will tell you I appreciate the fact that sometimes you can bring the warning bail on different items and such like that Yes sir well\nOne of the things you know what I'm curious about have you been telling people about the uh state wide amendments\nNo we're going to do that next week and no no one's really called and asked there's little there's a little concern on the pro life one which may be number\nTwo I came back can be role\nSo there's some confusion on that I Know that Planned Parenthood is sent some money down here to try to defeat that boat but will probably do some of the state wide amendment\nThe role so there's some confusion on that I Know that Planned Parenthood is sent some money down here to try to defeat that vote but will probably do some of the state wide amendment stuff next week when more people were ... and ... and election\nOkay well I just want to make sure that you're going to cover it because of you know evil ladies in white or apathy\nIt ... no you're right then and we have to realize that there are things we can do and we have to be active and we have to be out there making our opinions known or or or goals known\nAnd we're really bad to just thing somebody else who's going to take care of it\nAnd the mob\nThey are active and they are fired up and they seem to understand politics better than we do\nWill you you understand that we're also getting a lot of money and say because of amendment number one also I right\nNow which was one one day I'm In God we trust the ten commandments\nOh yeah yeah\nBut I didn't know there was a lot of money being spent opposed it added that where's that\nComing well it's it's it's it's coming in a you know basically on the groups that have been fighting all the uh a freedom from religion and things of that nature Yes sir so you're gonna use the thing is you're going to have people that are going to be coming out so we don't need to get challenged again I'm so we don't need to have to see on this on this election\nYou got it we're go we're going to get to those ... thank you for reminding me you had a great day now Yes sir thank you thank you for listening with keep on rolling who is mixed up in order the Mayo lady how're you doing good I'm doing very very well thank you for listening to the program\nI got a little convoluted yet in here just\nBarely out on that OK I'm hearing about all the illegal aliens coming over here and a lot of them being given the right to vote\nYou know what I mean that does that won't happen for a while but that's what the Democrats were like\nWell here's a solution they keep talking about redoing the voting laws and like you know and\nWe like to have everybody have an id\n... I was born here in Alabama I had to wait till I was Eighteen years old to get to that that is correct\nWhen they become citizens they should have to like Eighteen years to become\nA full time [laughter]\nI kinda liked that strategy\nAnd on top of that they ought to be able to have to wait till they citizen sixteen years to be able to own a car and drive [laughter]\nHe's getting better that's\nWhy I feel bad I mean they they they need to be part of this country and be here for over a decade before they become part of it and pay taxes during that time\nWere you know you kind of make this it's a pretty good argument they just have to follow the same path way to voting that you and I did correct\nThat makes perfect sense the problem is if they ever get enough votes in the U.S Senate or the Congress to say that illegal aliens can vote and that's what they mean when they say pathway to citizenship okay this is actually what they mean\nIs specifically it says in the U.S constitution the United states shall protect each of those states\nFrom invasion\nKeep going I Know a couple of people have been here I just got the I was going to call back you were the next person up whoever that was just dropped off the line George welcome to the program thank you for listening\nA current you return my calls are absolutely George\nThat guy that got seal the trophy or whatever\nYeah that's one of my other thing hold on the ... so what do we say his name was Chicago Chicago should Coby ... shows me show you the show goes\nWell anyway I was you know everybody's saying something about it or\nA faithful to see it will do this every day [laughter] it's a you know it's not like in oh for half the characters in the world it use you used to get through that class you're pretty much said uh\nYou know I Know there are so free agency and particularly Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is not a democracy gifts the rulers you get through or whether you're a journalist or wherever you are you might as well as targets\nOh the rate is not a democracy gets the rulers you speak against rulers whether you're a journalist or wherever you are you might as well as hard on yourself\nOr those actually ride and it was so funny about it Georgia's we're going to we're apparently listening to what turkey says and go to turkey and ride against her to a gym or wherever he says his name and see how will you do there I mean it's it's amazing\nWell you know just people people say\nYou know they want Trump to cancel the arms sales and all these people do this every day there's somebody incarcerated and thrown in jail and ah there was two one two three hundred a royals\nThat were thrown in prison and probably some of them got be headed in Saudi Arabia since this this new guy so I mean it's not a democracy you know it's not like you ... from them and and and yet you know that's an afternoon Saudi Arabia [laughter]\nYou know and and most of the countries in the world\nYou know all of a ruling class you face off against them at all\nI agree and I'm Still trying to figure out\nWhy could show he is such a big deal how did that become and we said this white day one or two when that started how did the show the story becomes so important\nTo the American and to the European news agencies ... he was it can be they was just a journalist\nIt was it was a world journalists that was coughing against the Saudis okay right and they don't they don't like this uh uh I mean you know uh\nBut you know what I'm saying why two American journalists care about\nThat it's none of our parents certainly I agree that really is a man of arts is I'm I'm Sorry man died in in the way that and all that but uh that's that's not any of our business really\nThanks George or\nYou know we talked a little bit about that in the last couple of days when you boil it all down if you say that\nThe Saudi friends knew and I don't know that he did but if we find out if America finds out he knew any had the guy executed for speaking of ... for actually advocating the overthrow with the government may I point that out\nThat's what the German newspaper says\nOkay what do you want us to do do you really I mean let's go to another country I don't know my makeup of country think of a country a country in Africa um la la la Uganda I have no idea what you've gone to governments like okay I don't I don't know\nSome guy goes out advocates overthrowing the government stands on a street corner and says overthrow the government\nAnd they kill him what are we supposed to do to them we're supposed to go sanctioned the heck out of them were supposed to go to war with them what are we supposed to do I cannot understand\nWhy didn't exactly it is the press expects do am I going to send one American military person over there to do something no you're going to not sell arms to the Saudis and enhance the power in the region of Iran\nPart of me is concerned that that really is the goal\nThat some of our ...\nPart of me is concerned that that really is the goal\nThat\nSome of our European allies some of our friends in the media quote unquote friends really like to see Iran empowered in the middle east\nThat makes no sense\nI don't know when the when asked these people in this national stage and then they go to the president and I think he's dealing with it as well as he can and ask him to the questions about what do you go to do you find out they executed a journalist\nHe can't really say nothing because so many so few Americans pay attention\nTo look like he's been terrible I mean they're making it sound like this is the guy at your local newspaper it's it's it was Robert at the north ... news and my little town that's not who cause Yogi was but they make it sound like it will welcome\nTo the program thanks for listening hey Russia down like oh\nYeah absolutely I think you are listening to the show\nAnd I listen to it all the time but hey I think I've got a good option for the whole okay actually helped three parts of the country at the same time okay [noise] yeah actually you dig it out to the coast to coast okay enough large enough shit\nOkay or am I quarter mile wide okay now what do you deal with all that dark you take it to New Orleans health fill New Orleans springs up above sea level it's back we're\nOkay now you go to Florida and gather up all the gators and put them in this come out and and you tell anybody wants to cross it take you can\nHave at it yeah [laughter]\nWell I I like a giant mode\nThat we can use for shipping and\nAh I yeah I think it's a win win and other than cost us like four hundred trillion dollars\nBut hey look how many people you employed\n[laughter] okay this is a jobs program in the ... and we're going to be alligators or shorts\nAt oh if you want them\nTo make it swapping beside it and we'll put sharks and we're bringing some salt water crocodile we're bringing everything else from around the world will put those in the age of ... and then in the marsh reports just up in the fresh water will put the gators in there you know ... and then we'll put big days landmines behind\nThat and then ended Harper's behind that yeah it'd be like a giant\nFrog or game if you can make it through all these things you need to get to the other side\nYeah and that's where all your sorry you got your snipers there [laughter]\nIt's a great idea thanks will resent you we're we're we're\nA bunch of extreme is there I understand that but it does a really good ideas frankly Mr Big welcome to the program except for the digging through the mountain range I that's probably not very cost effective Mr Big welcome to the program thank you for listening\nHey good morning I got to tell you do an intelligent show I Hope I don't bring it down\nYou know no no it is impossible to bring this showdown not because the quality of the show mostly because when you're at the bottom it is hard to draw\nYou got a couple of quick points to make always pay for the call him a wall and do any good and it will serve a purpose need just to spend the money they got me thinking what does the military do and they move to a new\nTerritory to create a new face the very first thing to do is sort of physical structures that Andre walls barbed wire they put up the fans they make sure the bad guys can't get in touch the first

talking to a guy and he was explaining to me that he was gonna be just trying to get his brother over here and eat them turn out all the hype working at the end on a cross the line almost I like to read it back to the ... ally\nCuriosity asking how long have you tried to do this I'm expected him say change only four months you said twelve years\nYeah guy made a fake and you know are still people are like twelve years do it legally I mean how is it fair to them you're let just let people cross the line and you know do what they were absolutely will\nOnly go like twelve years ago so a legal process it ain't right to let somebody to sneak over and do whatever they want\nThat that's absolutely correct you're right oh Mr Big appreciate your body ... thanks\nYou too thanks for listening that's a really good point if if there are now upwards probably past twenty million illegal aliens in the country big dive\nAnd somehow we grant one of these path ways to citizenship on top of twenty

border problem the immigration problem\nWould be shocked if the United states would adopt the exact same immigration policies the Mexican government pay as I used to have a copy of it I've got to show more you might find it interesting to pull it up\nAnd just read the some of the basics of Mexico's immigration policies or jaded strict in\nA if you had a an American woman that was dumb enough to sneak across the Mexican border pregnant in demand free hospital and free medical care for her and her newborn her family back here in the United states I might not ever hear from that woman again\n[laughter] I Know that stuff I don't know all the details I've also been told that some of the things that have made the rounds on the Internet um\nMay not be exactly right but America has one of the most lax immigration policies background I appreciate you but yeah the most lax immigration policies in the world and\nThat's just one of those things that Americans don't seem to understand about\nThe world doesn't work the way so many Americans think it works people do just wander into other coast\nThe world doesn't work the way so many Americans think it works ... people don't just wander into other countries in most places unless you happen to be the United states and frankly\nA European country\nYou know just wandering in in in demand things and stay in places and work and get taken care of and your children are taken care of and get healthcare et cetera et cetera that just does it happen\nIn the rest of the world now there is a story I found over a human events as Mexico's immigration law less try here at home\nAnd\nThis article was written back in two thousand\nAnd six\nBack in two thousand six Mexico and nearly the ports more illegal aliens from the United states are more illegal aliens day in the United states\nDoes it is a felony there'd be an illegal alien and in Mexico\nMexico has a single streamline law that ensures that foreign visitors that immigrants are in the country legally you have to be have the means to sustain yourself economically\nCannot be destined to be a burden on society you have to have an economic and social benefit to Mexico you got to be a good character and have no criminal record et cetera et cetera et cetera\nThat's why we're not as smart as we think we are Tony welcome to the program\nI was\nListening to your show today about illegal immigrants yes I'm for making our laws as strict awful but we can't just focused on\nThe border as we also got a thing about those that come here legally with a green card or whatever and then once that is up they just instead of trying to go up for this and they say\nThey are they overstay their visas yes I I agree\nAnd you know one thing I've always said was the reason why I'm so you know against you know so hard on this is you know in in the military I served alongside people from every part of the\nOkay and I talked to a few of them and I asked him a legal or and they said that there are still fight for their citizenship ... so we've got people fighting our military\nTrying to fight for their citizenship at the same time they said why it's so hard\nIs that all the illegals in this country you know and I think these people are willing to fight in our military they should be on the line I mean these people are given up their ally sometimes for countries that are not even a citizen [noise]\nAnd it was as broke we do because this was the fourth of July is used to be serious about it you know but uh\nI said I think for myself I don't let anyone tell me how to vote who\nWas

worth ... NO NAME welcome to the\nProgram noted pro grain NO NAME was on your mind\nYeah yeah earlier you were speaking of the number of illegal\nIn the country now yes their late ... now there are\nWorn a hundred and fifty four million and the current or not forty and they\nHave not seen that study um where where is that coming from 'cause the ... the what\nI Am referencing is an update above Lee I Want to say was Harvard I could be misquoted that saying they are now twenty million illegal aliens in the country because they were still claiming that ten or eleven million which is about a decade old\nRight or I read this it was it was an Internet thing of course Yes sir but\nYou know there's got to pay more than forty made in\nWay they're crossing the border it's an open border anybody there to kind of a like a micro\nWell that's how I got to the the referencing the report because I have said for years that there's got to be more than ten because you can't let hundreds and hundreds of thousands come across the border every year\nAnd and stay at ten or eleven million\nI'm looking at an article now where the president is being fact checked a couple of years ago by politifact which I Would not put a tremendous amount of credence in where he was saying I don't think it's eleven million I think is closer to thirty million and they're saying oh no you're totally roll\nWell he was as close as they were and here they had their referencing Pew [noise] like I said they were back on the eleven twelve million range which again is\nAt least eight or nine ten years old face NO NAME I appreciate you but thanks for listening about why\nI think here's the\nThe numbers are are probably hire president might be more right than some of the others let's get back to something that's a little bit Alabama oriented this is the article over at PJ Media that I like to touch on every so often\nYou listen to the show for a while or you followed me at all when I was in the state legislature I was one of the few guys\nWho actively opposed Alabama signing onto\nCore standards one of my greatest regret was\nAlabama signing onto Common Core standards\nOne of my greatest regrets was leaving the legislature without being able to kill all the common core when I still had a good bit of cloud as soon as I made it public that I Would not be returning that hurt me greatly and that's one of my disappointments\nIs not killing off Common Core\nPersonally I Believe if Alabama had remained with the standards and the way it was doing education at the time when we were\nActually improving education if the rest of the country decided to run their little carts off into the ditch we might actually be ranked one of the highest in education in the country if we had continued on the path\nWe couldn't do that we had to get on board with everybody else we had to do what the U.S Chamber of commerce said we had to do what the Obama administration said we could not be left out in the cold everybody else is going to do this new and great thing that was not proven anywhere in the world\nHad not been used anywhere in the world was not more rigorous standards was not all the dribble that we were told and people like myself are out there\nAnd most Alabamians agreed\nWith a few of us who were trying to stop this disaster this was an article about Paul or Bali yard from two days ago published at PJ\nMedia the creators of the ACT test you know the tests that your kids have to take and it's actually been kind of changed around through the years but it's your college admissions test and some of these things we're supposed to be fixed\nWhere you wouldn't be able to tell how bad the results were they were supposed to all be aligned and hooked up and and some of us said hey wait a minute\nIf you change the the test on the outcomes didn't\nYou're going to kind of say oh there's no problems here that is what that was the concern I still think that occurred\nBut even with that the creators of the AC ... C. T. test announced on Wednesday the scores for the class of two thousand Eighteen or the worst reported in decades math\nScores remember my ass remember hey what is Common Core math why why is my kids using dots and dashes and all this stuff why could not help my kids with math why are we not doing\nLong division what what are we doing as a parent can even help my child remember all that math scores in fact\nAre in freefall among ACT tested us high school graduates following falling\nTo their lowest mark in for teen years according to the condition of college career readiness twenty Eighteen the ACTs\nAnnual report the report includes ACT test results from all fifty states and the district of Columbia\nThe percentage of ACT tested graduates who met or some past the ACT college readiness bitch Portland\nNote the college readiness Common Core was called college and career ready\n\nSuggest you they're ready to succeed in a first year of college algebra class fell to its lowest level since two thousand and for the report declared that only forty percent of two thousand Eighteen graduates make the benchmark ...\nAnd for the report declared that only forty percent of two thousand Eighteen graduates make the benchmark down from a ... of forty six in two thousand and two ...\nTwo thousand twelve o\nO B. six years ago my little boy is in sixth grade\nI stated to the committee in the\nAlabama State Senate that my child my youngest job calls this policy decision that they were making at the state school board was making that we would not override that my child would be fully completely one of the children do the core\n\nIs down from forty six percent back six years ago now only forty percent the average score on the ACT math has dropped to his lowest in Twenty years twenty point five [noise]\nEducation community did do the children\nAnd now our test scores are even worse\nIt kills me I'm mad about it in one level\nBecause people wouldn't listen to common sense our state leaders wouldn't listen to common sense from the legislature to the state school board would not listen to commonsense they're not mad about it for what we did two children in general in this day\nAnd then I'm really ticked off about it because my kids had to\nGo through it my understanding now is there is a big effort to try to fix it are we gonna when are we gonna hear hey this was a monstrous screw up and you are we going to hear that\nMaybe we are\nWell anyone anyone be held accountable when he acted official who who ushered this the end who protected it to the
