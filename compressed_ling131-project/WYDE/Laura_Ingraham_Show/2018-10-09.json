gentlemen let me tell you\nWe have a lot of talk about today do we have a lot to talk about that yes indeed yes indeed yes indeed I Will try not to spend too much time on Brett Kavanaugh but as you know we are in what is known as the do or die faces right now\nI mean nobody called the ... and I'm calling that were were indeed do or die phase right now when it comes to\nThe Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation process\nIs accuser is yet to agree to testify says you need more of an investigation\nThe FBI is already had a preliminary investigation they cannot move forward him anymore investigation without a ... in ... and so that's basically all you need it\nEliminating investigation they cannot move forward him anymore investigation without more information\nSo that's basically all you need to know and the Kavanaugh situation will try to keep away from that as much as we can today unless we see some news that broke up last night that we need to bring to you because as you probably will know by now men do and fall asleep\nEarly because we have to get up early Dylan let me tell you the other day I had\nOne of my buddies had something wrong with the steering right as power steering went out on this car so she went to a car shop a garage that was out\nIn your area of town and so I drove our or no I think it's more a big days area you're outside of Huey town right but we drove to Hewitt down essentially so close to where you are so we drove all the way a too she retired and I realized\nFrom super station one oh one Huey town is a long way away you make that drive every single morning that's like a thirty forty five minute drive easily\n\nIt takes me twenty five minutes to get here including getting breakfast at McDonald's in the morning how fast are you driving doing any five area on the Internet thing that doesn't seem true\nWe were we were going about Seventy miles an hour granted his power steering was out so we were being a little bit cautious and I didn't time is on the way back but we drove all the way out there and maybe we took a weird on ramp or something but I just know that we got there and it said Huey town next exit and I was like wow this took a while I'm shocked that you drive this every single day\nWhat's happening all coming through\nA is a busy time it was like it was around lunch hour so it wasn't like a rush hour type thing but there are people emerging on and then getting off one exit later kind of you know like lunch hour ground\nWhere we are coming from Birmingham Sanford\nOkay so I went to the junction again on twenty fifty nine and then to your town exit\nThe words you're saying we're very confusing to me so I'm just going to say yes and we're going to go with yes\nYou got on the interstate yes sixty five nor yes and you got on the other interstate yes\nThey need to kind of cool okay\nYou ought to some weird because I like Fifteen minutes maybe twenty from Stanford I don't know\nMaybe we're just so drivers his power steering was also going out he could not make any turns he was great it straight line so the interstate was were great but or\nAnywhere off the interstate was a real struggle and it was like a newer car right so it didn't have the steering wheel or it could go all the way around and you could just essentially without power steering you could still make the turn at some point the steering wheel just said no we're not going any further\nAnd at that point it's like Mm what do I do because I'm going straight but I Need to go hard left and so we eventually got there safely he didn't hit that many things now I'm getting he didn't have eaten it had anything that we reported the police no I'm saying he didn't hit anything\nAlways\nBaffles me because Tim draws not that old [noise]\nLike he certainly does not out they crack and cocaine which is what he's referencing and this song like those are definitely those have been around as long as he has so I miss back when what when you were a forethought and your parents are like what the what do you miss your em I'm just a liberal ...\nOkay but the only one of the things that I mean I like the song it's touched don't get me wrong but less somebody wrote an Eighteen twelve like I'm just a little confused as to what it means [noise]\nI mean has anyone else seen the show nor does that was before tumor growth time eight six six by five one Ninety nine\nThirty three so it goes back when I was so okay I got a slang terms yeah a coke was a coke nope cocaine outdated you ... what you were doing when you were cracking jokes crack outdated you back\nWhen the screw was a screw Tim your region wind was all that blue you know\nAnd if you miss your down with that it meant you had\nThe flu what in the world are we going\nBack in the eighties hip hop now Tim I'm Down with\nIf you miss your down with that it meant you had the flu\nWhat in the world are we going back in the eighties hip hop now Tim I'm Down with that up in this could do like what am I about to come out and an oversized basketball Jersey and pants down to my knees and dropping R. and B. single that will shape the world forever\nHuh except it didn't listen on the side of the point\nWas yesterday we started a university today I'm becoming an R. and B. singer were just coming up with something new every single day of the week ladies and gentlemen welcome back into the wake up call running out this morning\nSo yesterday we were ah I went to a college Republicans meaning right I go to some of those occasionally they uh I'm occasionally political I don't know if you picked up on that or not but they had representative Gary Palmer\nCome speak which is really cool and uh for those of you who don't know Gary Palmer is serving Alabama's sixth congressional district Gary Palmer works in Washington and his privy to some of the most a valuable information\nAnd our nation right now he's privy to all of these classified hearings that are being had over the FBI and struck in Russian collusion he's on the oversight committee and so we were talking about all of that and uh it's really crazy so I go to Sanford university and you'd think a small Baptist school\nIn the middle of Birmingham, Alabama would have a greater conservative movement and I don't know I didn't even know we had a a conservative group on campus um\nUntil yes last semester\nLast so last semester and I've been there for four years now I found out that we had a conservative group on campus and so of course I joined um and it's shockingly small and I don't know whether or not it is just lack of advertising or lack of people want him to be political but we had\nA sitting US Senator come in and speak yesterday and I can't you not maybe ten people showed up\nTen people showed up which really makes me think\nOur people let's just say it's not the fact that it hasn't been advertise well let's just say maybe that's not the case let's just say this is just people not caring at one point have we reached in our country when a representative in Washington that talks to the top people\nRight he talks to he was there during the Peter Struck\nQuestioning he question Peter Struck alongside Trey Gowdy he was there what have we where we got into as a nation\nThat people want at least come sit and talk and respect those people\nI mean I did I'm not saying I agree with everything Gary Palmer did I don't I'm not saying I disagree with that or any anything Gary Palmer that he's a very interesting a politician I like where he stands a lot of issues but I Would be in there if Kamala Harris came to speak it Sanford university\nI don't agree with anything Kamala Harris says relatively maybe ... point one percent of what Kamala Harris says do I agree with\nBut here's the thing she's silly sitting United States senator that holds the power of a sitting United States senator and so I think you should go listen to those people's ideas especially if they're going to open the room up to a Q A and you get to ask let me tell you with\nGary Palmer sitting in front of us and nobody else\nQ and a and you get to ask let me tell you with Gary Palmer sitting in front of us\nAnd nobody else around like they were just ten people in the room and it's college Republican so half of these kids are shy and are just really political and don't know what to say and a lot of people are afraid to speak up I basically got to have a one on one question and answer with Gary Palmer\nAnd it's all just because I decided to go listen to a twenty minute speech seriously somebody else been twenty minutes on the toilet you know what I'm saying you can spend twenty minutes listening to a speech\nAnd that was directed at the listeners that was directed more at\nCollege students but it just baffles me I'm curious if that's what life was like in previous generations\nYou know like Tim McGraw was referencing I miss back when well I I have this theory that back in the day politicians were respected and more people showed up to those events and more people were involved in the political process so\nI miss back when people were involved in the political process\nNot as catchy but I'd like to submit that lyric the timber girl but I'm curious if that ever was a thing go and do you think it's always been this uh I I Believe the word is apathy right this political just I'm not really caring is it the right word here\nWe're going to figure it out apathy is a lack of hearing yeah\nYeah so is it political apathy of our generation there's change or as a political apathy benefiting from generation to generation to generation\nHonestly from every report that I've seen it's less of a thing among our generation than it was previous\nReally so engaged meant you believe is actually gone up\nFrom the EU reports that I've seen yes\nThat's a very interesting idea because if this is up this is pitiful like half of the people are on my campus I guarantee if you go up and you ask what are the three branches of government\nNo answer absolutely no answer it's it's very shocking and it's not something I I I don't\nTends to put these things on the education system right they tend to say oh the education system isn't teaching government therefore we have a problem and the education system needs to teach government I don't think that's the case at all honestly I think it's people really and truly not caring\nLook because I hate it when I see somebody that goes into a class right they don't listen to the whole time they don't give the teacher any respect and yet they complain when they fail the test\nIt's like at some point there's a there's personal responsibility the teacher can't take a hammer and hammered into your brain right they can only give you the information and it's your job whether or not you're going to take that information and\nI think that's what a lot of people\n... that's the case with a lot of people I mean people are given the information I mean people like Gary Palmer come to speak to college students\nLiterally outside of their schedule that he didn't have he doesn't have to do this we're not going to be the voting force that gets him over the edge you know to get him back in office he doesn't have to do this but he chooses to do it because he believes in the process so much\nAnd people just they don't care and some of them that show up they don't listen and then there was something else that was incredible last night\nWe were sitting there and so afterwards he asked for a picture right it doesn't ask for payment for speaking like he would if any other organization asking them to speak he doesn't ask for anything all they ask for is a picture so a lot of people go down there but there's some people\nThat just don't want to go down for the picture and I get it some people don't like having their picture taken\nWe asked for his picture so a lot of people go down there but there's some people that just don't want to go down for the picture and I get it some people don't like having their picture taken but this is rude about it too like it's the only for ... and he's like a can I get a picture of the aisle and they're like no\nI'm like okay alright are like what does that hurt\nI don't care if you're a die hard Democrat right I don't care of your as left as they come what does it hurt getting a picture with Gary Palmer\nIt really doesn't it if if you think it hurts to get a picture with a senator that disagrees with you a little bit on some policy stuff or a congressman and the gaze of Gary Palmer that disagrees with you a little bit on some stuff I Would\nPush you to evaluate your thinking All right we're going to go out to these phones eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three we're going to happen to Dexter on line one fixed or how you doing [noise]\nLaw and they're doing it for\nBetter now deserved extra how about yourself\nOh man I'm boat up like show dogs are ... and\nI knew it was Calvin moment I was going to\nA sort of weird I Know I Know you you're talking about are the people didn't show up a little town all thing we've all had or whatever\nYeah well he uh he came as ... as speak to college Republicans and nobody showed up really only ten people dead on Sanford stamp is\nYou know and people will knock you down but you got to keep up you know you got dumped ... yeah and a lot of people just don't care you know yeah yeah I'm happy with the U.S and you know and if you are happy with with that and you don't want to learn I mean the rotten out though\nThe construction field is wide open as a pocket knife yup and you know one hundred percent on\nHow to go to Mike ... live in\nA working hard a lot of paperwork with the ... a lot of people were there by you know and\nIt's just nowadays a lot of people do they were saying well you got to go to college you got to get a degree or there's a lot of people out here that are manager grocery store managers up different kind of trucking companies that have a degree that in physical education you know\nAnd uh [noise] that might really good money very but\nYou could get a job at it because you had a degree it didn't matter what it was saying it ... you know are they allowed the allergy or something like that mhm but\nBack like you were talking about Tim McGraw let's step back in the ice and stuff that's when technology really kind of started taking all yeah an old at the technology was good afternoon boat what black show\nYou know [laughter] ... what you can do very true\nBut you know a lot of people on end the politics because they're not thinking about future ... my dad used to always say that that might put it in a bank save it you know save and save it if I had a quarter for every dollar spent in the back I wouldn't have to worry about doing it I\nKnow yeah I I er I feel about one hundred percent\nAnd you were talking about gay Palmer gave Palmer is a British smart man he's good man you know there will be a ... country mhm uh\nI've I've met him before and talked to him in it and I mean he's saying straight forward it could be oh yeah I think it's really good representative and I think he's somebody that you could pay attention to\nA one hundred percent he's definitely one of the good ones and that's what struck me is that you know sometimes politicians you can listen to him speak and you can tell you know they're putting on that mask they're putting on that political mask and they're going to tell you exactly what you wanted a year and he didn't he told you exactly what he thought um and what he thought\nIs what aligns with a lot of the people who his constituents um ideology and I really appreciated that that a politician was willing to be so forward and not just pandering to people\nI I mean he's a tax person that I think you ... you know like like one in ...\nYeah ... ... and you know yeah very true but\nWe need more representatives like that and they face\nYeah very true that okay in yeah yeah very true but\nWe need more representatives locked and if they don't get out and vote your ... the guy in the way my\nThan Harry Potter and that's what he said he said look we have a team mentality right now you got to get out and vote we can't have this voter apathy where it's like oh you know we were doing good right now it's just going to stay that way he's like because if we lose the house if we lose the Senate it probably doesn't stay that way because we're just going to be stagnant\nUh for the next two years maybe until the next elections come around\nYou know a Trump doesn't do everything I mean Jesus Christ what what like jaded ... ... ... you know ... I don't not comparing him to it\nBut you know you're not going to find somebody just don't please everybody ... Democrats may first and complain about every day I mean that's ... yeah yeah\nThat's all there is to it and if we they people do get out and vote as young people like you and stand up you know and that's what next time they go low we go and say hey what happened\nYeah and that's what will eventually happen especially voter apathy stays the way it is right now it will just be a slap in the face to those people are like my generation who are just you know kinda apathetic to to go you know I I don't have any reason to get out and vote I'm not going to get out and vote once they realize the things that will happen to them\nThat's when they'll get a slap in the face with a lot of people I don't think realizes these are the people that are making decisions for you right these aren't just decisions that are affecting a far off land that will never touch you these people are deciding what happens every single day and your daily life and how government intervenes in it\nYou know like you said you you were talking earlier you were going over huge town you said you went through middle child mhm well that may feel there\nI'm just go hey you need to get out and explore your neighborhood a little more no more than one way to get all ... states or GPS\nYou know oh yeah ... ... and you need to find that ... short ... when the interstates do dance you always had a backup said well I can go through here and I don't have to stay in this lab an hour and ...\nYeah oh yeah which I Know I felt that time or two on sixty five here in Alabama\nI used to love the highlights from here to Texas in every interstate from Twain here environment ...

already been cracked huh so so the the master foundry people messed up\nYeah oh and and what you see is that even the crack that's a shame it's actually were they welded what was thought to be the correct where they actually have to open it back up and make that proverbial crack\nTeam it's actually where they welded what was thought to be the crack where they actually have to open it back up and make that proverbial crack larger no it rang you know it wasn't in service for years before in years after nobody knows they think it was forged that way\nWhen you know the British were coming oh yeah the British are coming against the British\nYeah and something else you know nobody knew there was no power of heirs ride that would've made no sense for what I said about most people were still loyal to the crown\nOur people are coming our people are coming yeah no jak yeah yeah [laughter] yeah that didn't happen\nSo much and was in our books just didn't happen but we will we won't canonize our culture but you know it's really funny is that the truthful stuff is even more fascinating and compelling\n\nBut nobody likes the unpleasant truth Michael I\nPay about eight six six five five ... nine three ... three pardon me in just trying to get back to the phones and uh\nAll right I'm going hello Jim how are you\nMy last on all this morning I'm\nThis adult you're reading it right before I came out and you read my little intro a and I was\nThis last week I was fixing to get on you because it's been so long since you've had me in any interests that I remembered you know it was before a James came out as an engineer or and so you put that I I'm up peas momentarily [noise] now\nI must admit before I make this statement that I had some other things to do I didn't catch the first hour the or the other programs you can publicly chastise me up but you made a comment based I guess I'm what your uh the guest you head out and said ah that\nIn it was his belief or whatever that roe v Wade will not be changed in our lifetime now\nAgain admitting that I didn't listen to the interview and commenting only on your commentator commentary so secondary commentary here uh that guy is just not in for their are Seventeen cases\nIn the appellate system that would have come in front of the Supreme Court in the next you know two to three years depending on what they are accepting their caseload are having to do directly with Rosie wait the I'm\nA ... uh what are you called out to eat out of Texas or the ... uh in for a requirement to inform a woman a\nOf the either informative show her that for the ultrasound mandatory before receiving an abortion or at a couple of Fundy cases that's just taxes Mississippi watched the D for the soul abortion clinic that they still have been a Jackson there's all these\nYou know now you're right but let me let me let me clarify what he said ... and when he when he was trying to make\nBecause Kavanaugh himself has said this is well\nWhat do we what the doctor was saying was that the case a roe versus Wade as as a federal law would not come before the court at the behest of the court\nAnd Kavanaugh has even said if they deal with anything dealing with the roe versus Wade what they would discuss is the necessity for volley that decision back down to their respective states and not making a blanket federal determination Arbor\nGotcha but see this is the thing and this comes into our discussion the ignorance of the populace at ... or the population at large okay\nAnything if you've got a construction since ... wrote five books on this anything that is not specifically delineated in the constitution as being the purview of the federal government when it comes in front of the U.S Supreme Court\nThey did a linear ... in the constitution as being the purview of the federal government when it comes in front of the U.S Supreme Court\nIt's supposed to be any return to the state that's correct now yeah now you look at the ruling that the Roberts Court which he if he had any intelligence would've just come out and said you know what this is in our jurisdiction and immediately send it back to the states you looked at gay marriage\nOkay I'm Sorry I don't see oh homosexual same sex gay whatever monitoring you want to use\nAnywhere in our constitution is nodding yes you should ever even be considered a on a federal level it's a state says she okay now what did Justice Scalia say about that particular issue what right does a homosexual\nWhat constitutional freedom\nDoes a homosexual not have a homosexual can get ... according to ... before the silly really homosexual can get married they just have to marry a member of the opposite sex\nBecause a marriage is considered to be between a man and woman it was considered that way by our founding fathers now if you go up\nI don't know the state of Georgia let's use them as well pick on California if the state of Georgia says we've got so many ... that we want to make a we want to make gay marriage and a legal in Georgia\nPut it up to a vote the people of Georgia of course were voted out and that won't be yet that's how it's supposed to go to Mike\nAnd oh by the way James don't you just love the smell of hobbies number nine\nYet I had been a doubt what the ...\nOut of out of the mayor of arbitrary\n[laughter] we'd been out a and I can't I'm not supposed to say specifics over you know or other people in here over the airwaves but James we just got a new trigger mechanism that we are upgrading the weapons with\nHey Jim I got news more yeah I

saying what bro hobbies\nOh has a nice ... to it [laughter]\nA highly fellows\nThank you Jim\nI'm sure what I'm thinking for anyway\nI didn't get to say but I\nHave a new trigger system in one of my weapons yeah ... ... con three of them are are are quite enjoy it ... okay it's a lot better than echo trigger my opinion but [noise]\nWell I just love and Jim ... and you guys go on military and is

recipe for blueberry muffin for me I Know and then the Lexus starts giggling yeah though I mean\nYeah and that real kind of a ghoulish giggle too you know wicked witch of the west side uh-huh yeah uh-huh\nOh All right we're gonna take a real quick break callers we're going to give to you on the other side but yeah this thing is just kind of going through it slowly but surely methodically trying to figure out exactly what this thing trying to do to me here 'cause I'm starting to feel like it's just watching by every mood you're going to wake up\nOne morning and just start stand out in your front yard ... will start saying one of us on a yeah can be like ... years yeah or invasion of the body Snatchers whoever\nYou know it'd be like one of those a protest run around one\nSide of the roses have uh the other side says no ... no ... no yeah that that's yeah that's that's the high intellect of America today see\nThere's a group of protesters there screaming black lives matter at Kavanaugh ... wearing this whole thing did he do something to black people\nOh yeah yeah yeah not you might go oh there's all the other one's not you might say for ed\nYou know what you know why because James does break them he likes the subject so some little Jay you like to ... you get it off turn up or the judge every now and then the for the last two weeks I think I feel like a lot of other callers that don't have the guts to call him\nThat this is the Jerry Springer news hour not just on your station and everybody else that you all over the jealous televisions it's it's crazy I'm thinking about cutting everything off for about two weeks\nPay Freda you're threat ... do you camp sure do you go camping\nI'm addicted to you guys can't go camping now I'm going camping I'm saying you should go camping with this oh yeah I can do that\nYou really get a bunch of them was to gather over just going to go camping that's actually a good idea yeah just get away from everything\nLike

you're camping those wild and crazy nice [laughter]\nHey listen guys I enjoy your show seriously uh\nI I'm I'm praying for another story but not a bad story and a half and then nobody but uh I'm praying for another Jerry Springer story that we can talk about and watch all of these crazy ... women and men stand in the middle of the road\nAnother Jerry Springer story that we can talk about and watch all of these crazy near where women and men stand in the middle of the road with pierced ears and noses trying\nTo protest against some lady that had one judge I mean one beer and some judge molested or give me a bright so you guys to James how good a buddy\nYou too man well if you want to Jerry Springer story I can give you a sad story I don't have it right in front of me I saw the headlines earlier but a a sixteen year old boy I think it was in the northeast he was falsely accused of rape and he hung himself killed himself the very next day his mother killed herself oh wow\nSo these idiots don't think false accusations\nDon't touch people's lives are taint ruin somebody think again\n\nAnd I'll find that headline and I'll put it up on the site so people can read it but yeah yeah teenager falsely accused commit suicide and in the very next day his mother commit suicide\n\nDo you think they care they don't give a damn pardon my French\n\nWell you know these are the same kind of people that go on Facebook and encourage their boyfriends to take their own lives\nAre the ones that schoolteachers in Minnesota that go on Twitter and say props for the first person that murders Kavanaugh yeah\nYeah yeah\nAll right who the course go mark how are you\nI'm doing great Michael and yourself just okey dokey\nThere you go so we were talking about people being overly engaged a while ago\nAnd I don't know\nIt seems to me that a lot of people are not at all engaged and then the people that are really upset are probably better to find is missing gauge because they're misinformed you know I grew up with a guy he lives in California now work for the federal government pretty much his whole life one capacity or another\nAnd he's very liberal\nAnd talking with him I realized three things one one big difference we have is he believes that the federal government is more competent to solve problems that individuals are local governments ought to be taking care of and number two he's very well misinformed\nAnd number three he doesn't like talking politics with me because it becomes real apparent that you know the ideas are indefensible when somebody comes back at them with reason and facts\nAnd uh\nI don't know I mean you know you start looking\nYou know that that the people that are all been out of shape about what the lives of the left global warming et cetera et cetera et cetera and I guess we're fixing to be the thing right now we're white males and uh I don't know what are we out today dominate the planet or something\nI guess I don't know but I you know I don't think it's that people were overly engaged a lot of times I think they're just the focus of their engagements improper\nNot make that's a good point it's a very good point\nSo switching topics real quick we saw the pictures of Milan on safari and that got me to thinking remember all this the foreign movies we watch only or kids Michael yeah\nNow what's the number one thing we learned from watching they used to foreign movies about the animals winter they most dangerous the big cats the leopards lines to Buffalo's wonder they most dangerous\nI Would imagine when they're hungry and\nThe big cats the leopards lives to Buffalo's wonder they most thing\nI Would imagine when they're hungry at night or early dawn when their wounded ah\nNow I think you really got to watch the downs right about now\nWell they're the the pond is for the Dems are coming out saying you know it's not over yummy take to the streets and get more angry more violent and some peninsula actually said violent so\nYeah they're winded right now and if we have some documents come out in the near future which I don't know may or may not happen I doubt it uh\nYou know I was talking with somebody just a little while ago\nThat knows something about federal prosecution's and he said look\nWhich have to understand here is the first thing any federal branch does before they start in any kind of indictments as they go okay exactly who is we're indicting and what are the consequences of a successful prosecution going to be\nAnd\nThere's a few people that you know absolutely positively they don't want implicated in this stuff and I said yeah and the people that you're looking at indicting or not Nineteen thirties mafia types that will say I'll do whatever amount of time I got to do I saying nothing\nThey'll tell everything they know and he said yeah you're right and that's the reason that the likelihood of Senate dightman says not all that good\nWhich is disappointing that we live where those rules kind of apply\nNo data point good point well they don't want to see Brock Obama indicted or\nIn a position where are you know us in a position where rock to Obama et cetera et cetera that Clinton's should be indicted when people start running their mouths so I don't know there's a chance that they just won't go there\nWell there's just too many people in the path way Clark and and you know even diamonds come down there will be indictments on the right as well you know we we can't exonerate everybody\nJust because they have in our next to their name but you know if there was an indictment brought against everybody in Washington DC there was guilty of something that they pretty much get everybody\nOh yeah yeah well you'll have fun with the rest of it\nWell do it ... or you're going or whatever are pretty sure the ... All right take care now to my my\nI Wonder since the federal government likes the give names to everything that happens like operations right I Wonder if Milan his trip was called like operation Jumanji or something\nLike that because she was wearing one of those hats the [laughter] the ... for\nYou but you but you gotta love a woman that goes on safari and pumps\nMm true story when I was in Haiti after the earthquake were sitting there and um the the first lady in second lady\nA team for a visit so Michelle Obama and Dr Biden game now Dr binds cool lady met her talk to her who she can be she gets off the plane and palms and her Secret Service detail hands her bag and she puts on some Chuck Taylors because she said I'm not walking around in the third world country and pumps\nI'm going to be comfortable you know that's a smart lady yeah oh yeah yeah\nAnother one of those news threads that has caught the imagination of so many people in the late ... who cares what Maloney Trump wears to the mall give me a break eight six six five five one nine nine three three\nYou're listening to the Michael ...\nIt's not right versus left it's us versus them the Michael hearts show those super station is coming to your home town go to one oh one W why do you you don't come pretty tales those guns at least one show\nHe would start earning point [noise] ...\nAnd how what am I what am I doing I think I'm stuck in the world where I've got to give\nYou something of value and then you give me something about you or me giving you something valuable\nHow does that are have been going you're living your power in all actuality just on Web so your computer you know you gotta take care of flop whatever or or maybe you know go back far enough for you maybe at one of ...

unquote leak from the White House\nBut if you're going to a big announcement with her I mean just just saying someone Verizon's not really a big announcement because we already know yeah\nBut if you're going to a big announcement with her I mean just just saying someone resigns not really a big announcement because we already know yeah unless you're putting some terms behind why there was on but that would say to me that he's either offering her are pointing her to another position\nSo\nThat's what I'm betting on well if he's offering her another position that also does not doesn't not imply that somebody is losing a position ... and wouldn't that be breaking\nThat would be break but\nWho would be losing their position\nI'm no Rosenstein doesn't make it a lot of sense but no that doesn't make a lot of times but you never know no not not not in the Arab Trump\nMaybe she'll be chief of staff ooh now that can be a possibility\n... ... ...\nOr maybe she's a special prosecutor for the fifty thousand indictments\nThat could be a possibility ...\nAs long as she continues or floral print dresses yeah things you'll be okay happening you know I think maybe Sarah Sanders was going\nAnd\nI Know Nikki Haley could not handle that press lumps are oh man\nI don't think she could Kavanaugh's bodyguard\nShe's definitely not going to be the fashion consultant or money

Want\nThank you [noise] well I Want to\nBut we will miss you remember the show you're going to stick to it but I Want to say well\nI Want to say first of all I Want to thank the friends\nJust you know allowing us to come out and talk to you this way on it has been an honor of a lifetime I you know I said I Am\nLeave the state Senate race and to serve\nReally been a blessing and I want to thank you for that but I'm most excited look at the two years look at what has happened in two years with the United states on foreign policy now the United states\nThey know that if we think we are going to do something we follow it through when the president for that whether it was with the chemical weapons in Syria whether it was NATO\nSaying that other countries have to pay their share I mean whether to the trade deals which is an amazing they get that the president means business and they followed through with that but then if you look at just these two years at the un one\nThree billion and the un by we've made it stronger we've made it more efficient\nSudan we got an arms embargo which was a long time\nGreen North Korean sanctions\nWhich we're the largest and generation done in a way that we could really work towards\nOn the Iran deal bringing attention to the world that every country needs to understand you can't overlook fall of the bad things they're doing you have to see them for the threat that they are um I think you look at the anti Israel bias and the strength\nAnd courage that the president showed in moving the embassy and showing the rest of the world we put our embassy where we want to put our and\nYou know all of those things has made a huge difference in the U.S Canada but I can tell you that I'm\nThe U.S a strong again and the U.S is drawing in a way that should make all Americans very proud and\nI Do want to say that it's not just surprising and I want to thank the family in general the first lady has been nothing but very very kind to me um I Can't say enough good things about Jared ... is such a heavy\nGenius that no one understands I mean to redo the NAFTA deal the way he did um what I've done working with him on the middle east peace of mind it is so unbelievably well done\nAn office in just a great friend and they do a lot of things behind the scenes\nThat I Wish more people knew about because we're a better country because they're in\nA sense of ministry and I also just have to say I'm certainly thank you to my family Michael at the same and um my two little ones I adore than entertain us you and you know they sacrificed a lot they put a lot of time\nAnd energy into it um but and they have a lot of heart and really wanted to make America crowd and so with that\nI'm not leaving until the end of the year my goal is that we make sure that everything is in good slate and um for the next and Vassar to come in but it's a great day in the United states and I'm proud to have been part of the team now\nI don't have anything he sat on where I'm going to go I think that um the main thing was I was governor for six years and we've dealt with a hurricane a thousand your blood at church shooting a school shooting there was a lot and then to come in and just to years of Russia and Iran and North Korea it's been eight years of intense\nTime and I'm a believer in term limits I think you have to be solved was enough to know when you step aside and allow someone else to do the job so thank you Mr President visited an honorable\nAnd that's I think you have to be self let's enough to know when you step aside and allow someone else to do the job so\nThank you for finding\nAnd I will say this um if are all in here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty\nI can finally she when are we doing it for this one so I'll look forward to supporting the president\nSo good that could\nYou give us a long list of accomplishments why would you have to leave that all your time is it is really a personal decision because you've been away from your family members or you know something else in\nMy family is very important so no there's no personal reasons I think that it's just a very important for government officials to understand when it's time to\nAside and I am again and everything I've got the last eight years and I do think that sometimes it's good to\nIn other people who can for that same energy and power into it and so there really is a lot of people are going to want to say there's a lot of reasons why I'm leaving the church and I want\nCan't win a blessing to go in to the un body\n[noise]\nEverybody's got to be ready all this day the night say of October a Tuesday in the ... says and I said oh if you're having a fantastic morning at the store to the program\nWe just went ahead and cut directly to the press conference with President Donald Trump\nAnd Nikki Haley Nikki Haley is resigning as ambassador to the United nations\nAnd I know the press was breath grossly hoping that she would have some sort of statement a there she was leaving because Trump was a bad guy that she was leaving because it was too much oppression she was leaving because what ever going to run against the president twenty twenty I mean\nWe've known this was happening for just a couple of hours apparently\nIn the press immediately goes with the she's going to run for president against Trump turns out that is\nNot the case Shiites says she has no plans of running in twenty twenty anti straight up said she was going to support this guy and then what she said quote\nThis guy in twins you just said look at the time when you got to know it was time to move oh she's been governor\nShe'd been and bass or to the U.S you've been doing that for eight years he has a couple of young children she says her family's very supportive\nBut I can promise you there are people who just say you know what\nI'm Glad to leave it's time to go I Know exactly how that\n... somebody else to say that but it's actually it's it's just time people keep trying to burn the Bush [laughter] just go to the polls we've got to a special gas too is ah been waiting patiently because of the press conference this is Mr\nPhilip Brown a friend of mine who was actually running for office in Jefferson County and you if you're asking look\nI Know Scott ... radio goes out to a huge portion of central and\nNorth Alabama why does it matter when you have it all just a local election in Jefferson County number one uh one of the largest if not the largest county in the state the whole metro area calculation sometimes and you know it's hard to tell\nBut are filled up like I said as a friend of mine and I think it's a very interesting dynamic going on in Jefferson County which I think is reflective of some of the changes that are going on across the country Phillip welcome to the program I Hope you're doing well\nScott thank you ...\nAbsolutely now you were supposed to be all last week but you get stuck in\nCourt and uh and that's a that's a somewhat decent excuse I'll I'll I'll take that I Would\nArgue or real I'll just go back you forgive me I had so much going on I just I just actually forgot to tell you ahead of\nTime I I I understand completely but you're running for circuit clerk in in Jefferson County that is correct but the interesting part is\nYou're running as a Republican correct correct that's correct and you just so happened to be a black man correct about that I Know and here's here's what I think is so fascinating about this because we supposedly\nIn this country or in this and I don't believe it's pervasive across the south but their story after story about racial strive racial division I I Know\nAnd this and and I don't believe it's pervasive across the south but their story after story about racial strive racial division I I Know you have been working in the Republican Party for years I think you were I don't remember what the official title is head of um\nI Am I Am the state chairman of the Alabama minority GOP\nThat's right that's exactly right and all this talk about\n... like Republicans are all white guys and Democrats care about women and minorities et cetera et cetera and you've been out there working for years and years trying to tell people look\nAt the political the differences\nAre really policy differences and they're not reflective of what someone looks like it's about ideas and and how to give people opportunity and and what actually works and what does it and so I find it fascinating in a county like Jefferson County where\nI'm most\nOf the county wide offices are are held by Democrats mhm and you are out there making inroads and and I hope you're successful so if you could just kill me a little bit about how your campaigns going some of the challenges you face a that would be that'd be great\nOkay well the absolutely out as you said I I've been I've been in the Republican Party has like I've been a Republican all my life but when the when I started getting active in the uh\nIn in the political scene of that that's where I have to take in my position at and and a lot of people asked me the question and of course they did it the prevailing attitude is how the black person in the Republican Party and just like you said our biggest differences are all policy\nIt doesn't matter who you are or what your race nationality or ethnicity or religion or whatever that is concerned um we we we're brought yet we accept and encourage anybody and everybody who thinks and and has concepts of conservative values like we do\nNow in Jefferson County that's a tough one because we have over the last three elections\nLast just about every race that we've run in\nOh we've been very fortunate to have a sheriff has been reelected several times oh we've been very fortunate to have one or two judges that had been reelected\nAnd um and this is the first time in Eighteen years that we we have a do not have an incumbent in the circuit clerks position [noise] um the the current one is retiring now and we I Am the Republican candidates and will be home in November sixth ballot\nAnd we've been we've been able to do some some incredible things and this is Scott this is something that I had been preaching since I've been active in the Jefferson County in the state of Alabama of politics and that is that relationships go a whole lot farther than political rhetoric and\nWhat I mean by that is that if you and I know each other Scott yes we may be on opposite sides of the political spectrum but because we know each other and we liked each other personally\nYou and I can sit down over a cup of coffee and talk about our differences and not get mad and start college or the ugly they mhm book when you don't know someone and you come into their circle and say hey you need to be a Republican or you need to be a Democrat or whatever it is\nIn all of a sudden people start throwing up their shields they start getting hostile because now we're starting to spout rhetoric\nThat by parties better than your party because kind of like you know an second and third grade when you say my my daddy can beat your daddy up and and I don't even know who your daddy is but by it's better than you\nThe block parties better than your party because kind of like you know in second and third grade when you say by my daddy can beat your daddy up and and I don't even know who your daddy is but by it's better than yours and that's the kind of attitude\nThat we get it I always encourage a people of both parties but especially the Republican Party get to do people get to know the constituents that you sir if you're seeking a position\nFind out who they are the I'd be teaching in minor high school or for the last six Seventeen year I've taught a lot of kids I've got to know a lot of parents in over here on the west side we traditionally think\nThat that is that Democrats and and I've talked a lot of politics in my class kids usually are very quick to ask about about you know what I Believe what was their parents believe it's a what I was told I'm not interested in making you believe what I Believe what I'm interested in doing is encouraging you to know why you will\nSo that that's that's the position I've come from and I've got a lot of friends on both sides of the political spectrum and many of them and say hey I may not normally vote Republican fill up but I voted for you because I Believe that you and I think that's one of the end of the day is going to win this election\n[noise] well that that's a ... and I hope you do when I Hope people remember to go out and support you in and I think it's important to note that straight party taking ticket voting\nIs what really decides or has historically decided over the last probably Fifteen or Twenty years in Jefferson County who wins the county has gone pretty strongly a democratic presidential election years is overwhelmingly Jefferson County voted overwhelmingly\nFor Doug Jones and and I and I'm always fascinated Phillip and you know this as much as anybody and that's why I'm asking you the questions when I was in the legislature we would ruin polling\nAnd we would poll in all communities across the state of Alabama with Poland um rural almost lily white parts of the state we would poll in urban inner city areas where the predominantly black and\nA black folks in Alabama would say well who we'd ask who do you think would be better for fixing education they would say Republicans who do you think could be better for stopping the crime epidemic they say Republicans who would be better for the economy they would say Republicans who will be better for creating jobs they would say Republicans\nAnd then we would say who are you going to vote for [laughter] and they would say Democrats\nAnd it is guys like you who have been on the on the front lines trying to say look it really is about values a Scott's not as bad as AOL dot com is trying to tell everybody has to do those kinds of things and I just think a lot of folks don't give the credit\nThat you deserve and other people deserve because it's a tough battle where where have you all been working trying to convince people that there there is a different way and the Republicans are not\nYeah their policies may be you know good but see they would apply them to you equally as they all apply them to white Americans so don't trust them\nYou get 'em in there they're going to reverse it and you could hear every election or the vice President Joe Biden\nOr you know if you vote and if you if you elect a Republican they'll put you back on the plantation ... the the the suggestion there's sometimes the outright declaration that ultimately all white people want to revert back to\nSlavery times and and the press you so if you elect them to office eventually that's what they're going to do and that's the fear because I'm like you know we don't know what the future holds right but when somebody plant something\nIn your mind you may have a good friend with somebody whispers in your year you know he's really not your friend he's ... he's ...\nHe's out to get you and and if you're not careful you start watching that person very carefully and you'll see some stuff that you might have never even paid attention to all of a sudden you go there yeah I can see it now\nYou're now did you tell me I'm watching big day by call\nOh yeah yeah and it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy because now he's looking at you looking at him right now you're both beginning to question who each other all\nRight no you're absolutely right and I know you don't have a lot of time you got to get back to work so the big question most people are asking and won't be asked bill brown is what the heck does a circuit court really do\n[laughter] yeah you know it's got a I don't know how many times I've got that question on the campaign trail lot of people don't even know what the circuit clerk's office they'll do that it even exists but the circuit clerk's office is the administrator\nThey drill lot of people don't even know what the circuit clerk's office does that it even exists but the circuit clerk's office is the administrative arm of the court says the court system does not operate\nWithout the circuit clerk every piece of paper work that has generated is generated by the certain clerk's office the docket the the orders from the judge the bleeding from the attorneys or the person uh every court filing is filed in the circuit clerk's office\nEvery dime desk collected by the court every dad this paid out by the court is handled\nBy the circuit clerk's office if you need documents of records that were that ... years and years old they recorded in the circuit clerk's office so that officers they they are very valuable office in addition to the fact that it is one of the three of election commission positions in the county\nThe probate judge the county sheriff and the circuit clerk oversee the election process so that makes this office of very important office uh I I think it's very important that we have a circuit clerk's office that number one is is he ...\nThe court system should operate at the speed of business it's a it's a\nIt's a shame when you go to the circuit clerk's office or to the courthouse to get paperwork and you have to stand in the long legged right for what seems forever because of their understaffed are they ... we have too many\nTechnological advancements that even if we can't
