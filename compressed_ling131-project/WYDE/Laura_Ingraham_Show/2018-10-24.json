they are showing disregard for those who are following the law\nWe simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected undocumented unchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully or the become immigrants in this country\nAnd one of the reasons that for President Obama made that statement was due to a report that came out Josh yesterday where are the department of homeland security had said that among the thousands of migrants heading to the United states some are gang members and people with quote significant criminal histories\nThe apartment spokesman er ... said that the caravan of approximately seven thousand in growing migrants wrong has some estimates include citizens not only a Central American countries but also the middle East Africa South Asia and elsewhere\nAnd yet ... administrations have pointed out to\nThe folly of opening our borders yet magically as Donald Trump has taken the reins in the oval office\nSuddenly and without notice their entire perception of the immigration debate has flipped on a dime to make absolutely certain that it is in opposition to everything the current administration stands for despite the fact that Donald Trump\nIs standing quite well in a precarious matter on the shoulders of both Bill Clinton and Morocco bomber\nPopulism yeah\nMae West not let those pesky facts

I'm Sorry one billion dollars I put too many zero's on that one billion dollars leaves the state economy so that ... billion dollars that didn't get spent on other things\nNow and now you have it backwards I I I understand where you going with this MIT only when the ... money only won the Turing me fuzzy no good to be okay so maybe your points just fuzzy maybe my point was yeah but see the thing is is with the way that the lottery was he was intended to be set up in Alabama the last time it was proposed\nIs that when the state lottery what we do is twenty percent would go to that entity right the entity would be contracted by the government in twenty percent would go to that entity in eighty percent would go to the federal government\nSo your math is wrong I totally understand that point you're trying to make you would have to bring in a lot of money but this is based off of lotteries that have been instituted in forty seven states so far and the returns that they have had based off of population data what are expected return is in that first year\nOkay so you're gonna have to go to other places and get real numbers\nAnd what are expected return is in that first year\nOkay so you're gonna have to go to other places and get real numbers all they might get twenty percent profit but you're going to have more like sixty or Seventy percent administrative costs\nThe fact of the matter is is the government gets about double what they would have gotten in sales tax but not here's the thing that money gets spent on sales tax\nYour local vendor your store operator et cetera et cetera\nThey get that money and they spend that money with their neighbors okay this is a bad tax is what it is now no it's not the other day whatever you're not that\nIt's not it's not a bad tax on not attacks because everybody doesn't have to pay it\nYou know one's forcing you to play the lottery where's the guns I mean that's the whole thing about uh when you talk about taxes there is a somebody putting a gun to your head there's government compulsion St bay the facts or go to prison there's nobody think play lottery saying if you were playing the lottery come play the lottery and some of this money will go it's not a tax that's a silly argument\n... okay whatever oh you're a tablet sharing a monopoly sponsored by the government if it's if we can have a lottery than I Want my own damn water okay one pottery\nYou have a lottery and the idea of gambling I mean this is just I mean do you keep making silly argument you think what Tom cars going to close I mean they run ads on the stage and like every other day you think we're going to close\nYou think any law that you think any gambling institution in this state that is private or is on Cherokee land is going to close no they're not going to close listen to the thing is the lottery is just an option\nAs soon as soon as wants to engage in that they can\nYou were stabbed pushing a monopoly that is sponsored by the government if you did this if you are if you are the phone company forty years ago the federal government would break you up because you were a monopoly\nNow the last thing is it's a bad dream y'all it's just a bad thing people want to be thinking about I can work harder occupied best by money not sitting around thinking I'm all bought a lottery ticket and you know one of these days I'm going to hit it big\nWell Clark there's no there's no debate the fact there are people out there that are that intellectually shortsighted to believe that but you know at the end of the day and I think ... point is if you want to drop two dollars a lottery ticket you have the right to drop the two dollars on the lottery ticket\nYou know me personally I understand the governmental argument to it but I don't even look at you know the benefit of the state of Alabama economically for me it's just a matter of hey if I Want to do this why do I have the right to do it because you can make the counter argument if a state of Alabama has made the opposite of a monopoly where they are restricting people from the right to participate if they so choose\nWell you know butler said nobody's holding a gun to your heads and like you bought the tickets they're kind of holding a gun to the head of the merchant selling the ticket if you own a small convenience store\nAnd that's leaving at the minority because there are multiple other avenues in which you can gamble the government would just be one avenue I mean it's the same argument that the previous caller made where he sort of it's a monopoly not a monopoly if you're going to take the ruin your life approach you can ruin your life in a a bunch of other places in the state of Alabama so why not open up something that\nAh forty seven other states have done\nI mean ... ... on with no basis\nBaylor person I\nTalked to them or if you break it up on his bat I Want to hear you I did hear private laundry and I do I like I have no problem with the private lottery instead of ... I'm not eating and has the government run I just I just sing into these stupid stupid stupid belief to say that we shouldn't be able to have the lottery 'cause it's a moral that's my whole argument [laughter]\n[noise] oh good lord\nAll right for every state out there that has authorized a lottery\nAll forty seven of them has any of them allowed for a private person can Baylor go back to Tennessee and have his own private Baylor lottery or is the lottery managed by and mangled and mangled by the government and they only allow themselves and do they choose to do it\nI don't know what the lottery legislation is and all the forty seven states that an actor that do you know what the legislation stipulates specifically in all forty seven states are you making a generalization like you're asking me to make a generalization\nGeneralization\nIs a big generalization because even the lotteries exist in forty seven states are different I mean right now we're\nIt was ... ... it's it's not generalization\nIs a generalization because even the lotteries exist in forty seven states are different I mean right now we're getting into basic legislative qualms\nI'm saying just let us have a lottery who cares who it's run by I don't care\nAbout what a smaller government but I mean what the government has our pockets will tell you what the government allows ... out\nThe government's not holding her hand that the government's not putting their hands in your pocket when you're gambling you are giving the government your money when you're gambling lottery it is not a tax that is a false city\n[noise] and it meant\nFor a lottery ... themselves out one minute a taxation\nI Can't hear what he's saying can could use that Michael [noise] could you summarize up there it was broken up on me to\nSay that better yeah they are\nAh sorry I'm outside my truck but the uh if the government is allowing you to do it they're only allowing you to do it because there's a profit motive for the government so if the ... if it doesn't matter what they spend the money on education or anything else or you know pay off to whoever\nBut for the government to authorize the state lottery that means the government's involved I mean the government is making a profit gambling period is about profit caring for the people hosting the gambling\nAnd therefore their money from the government ...\nWhere's that money go from the government the government going by new shoes as the government going by Gucci persist as the government going by this or that or does it end up back in the state in some way shape or form\nFive hundred dollar hammer and two thousand dollar toilet seats\nAre doing what [laughter] doing what I mean even if it's that which is a silly use for money where are those toilets seeds and where are those hammers going back into the state it's just an argument\nThat I don't know what I also think it's two different arguments that are simultaneous because you know what I'm hearing is you know where does the money ultimately go but I I kinda come down on the side of the argument of do I have a right to you know blow my money if I so choose the possibility of a benefit\nAnd so you know I think that if somebody wants to drop two dollars for the purposes of maybe winning a billion you know that that's you know a right that they should have a brother or not that money finds its way into government coffers are not you know these are again you have a moral issue and then do you have a moral debate and then you have a fiscal debate and their two entirely different debates coming\nUp or just on a circles y'all have a good day\nThanks more if I appreciate the call I mean at the end of the day you know what other rights that we want to be restrictive I mean why not just reintroduce prohibition\nMhm that's exactly what somebody told me in on Twitter I'm actually gonna read that comment from you brought that up that's a really good comment let me get that pulled up\nWell I mean you know excessive alcohol consumption is not good for you yeah\nYou know what about the state of Alabama regulating micro breweries which they did for a long period of time all of a sudden they deregulated and he got micro breweries propping up all over town and creating jobs and economic opportunity but if you're going to restrict this vice over here\nLet's restrict that vice over there well what about the guy that drops okay you know somebody goes out spends\nTwo dollars a lottery ticket this month and then that guy over there's been sick and a half dollars a pack of Marlboro reds\nYeah well when you when you were talking about the lottery specifically um I got I I read everything that everybody sends me on Facebook or Twitter so Baylor cook on the first name that pops up when he type it in shameless plug I'm Sorry but when they ... so I got a message from a guy named ... and he said\nSo many people don't intend to understand that you can't legislate morality I Believe prohibition\nI'm Sorry but when they ... so I got a message from a guy named ... and he said so many people don't and can't understand that you can't legislate morality I Believe prohibition as a prime example of course there are those self righteous individuals who think it's wrong to them\nIt's wrong for everybody it doesn't matter if you think it's wrong for you or if you think it's immoral or if you think it's a San or if you think it's this or that or the other it's saying do people have the right to choose whether or not they do that your morality dictates your choice it shouldn't dictate\nThe ability for you to make that choice\nRight because there is a choice and then there's a fundamental ability to make that choice they're two different things if you don't even have the ability to make that choice the morality in another itself is meaningless right you don't need the morality if you don't even have the ability to choose I don't need the legislator talked about gambling and the morality of it if I don't even have the right to make it we can't legislate\nPeople's morality and say this is this should be the government stance you should have\nRegardless of your of your faith regardless of your virtues that you should at every opportunity available to you and then you should choose what you do with it\nFrom just the basic perspective of individual\nLiberty of thee argued also becomes very spacious because you know back in the day when she was talking about introducing the lottery and the state of Alabama I'm more than one pastor made the argument that people are spending money on lottery tickets they won't have the money to tide\nYep that's a pretty gross extrapolate ... yup and\nSo it's like every special interest group makes the argument that if people spend the money over here mhm they don't have the money to support the cause which is most notable to me yeah\nI mean if you want to really take the extreme and go completely completely ridiculous talking about what's best in the state of Alabama Mm what was the last time you went to the beach\nOr it was cold last spring break where'd you go Orange Beach it was cold okay said\nHave you ever gone to a beach and let's just say Florida yes whether any available reservations in Alabama\nYes\nShould you be restricted from spending your money in Florida but Alabama has a beach in a vacancy know\nWhy that is what's best for Alabama\nDoesn't matter if you make in your personal choice the government decides what's best for Alabama right you decide what's best for you when it comes to use spending your money you got there but if but if you go to Dustin\nYou're taking your money out of Alabama when it can be kept in Alabama but then spreading a lot of beach towel in Florida but\nThat Alabama dictating trying to dictate where you should spend your money and that is not the state and or the federal government's role to tell you where you should spend your money there are only two things guaranteed in his right life death and taxes some taxes are needed but that's the only way in which the government should\nBe able to say the state of Alabama actually saw it that way some years ago when they introduced a thing called the consumer used tax ...\nWhere if you went to Florida and you bought that beach towel and you brought that beach towel back to the state of Alabama what'd you have to do you had to pay taxes on that beach towel and if you didn't declare that beach towel on your taxes you are in violation of Alabama tax law and\nThat should have been taken to the Supreme Court immediately because that's a violation of\nIt was it was it was a ... not because it was unconstitutional there was eradicated because I realize that people aren't going to declare the stupid beach towel but again it goes back to the fact of you know the argument has been ... I'm here in being made\nOf you know dollars expatriate in themselves to George or whatever for the benefit of the state but for me again I fought the fact of the argument isn't whether or not the money stays in the state of Alabama do I have the right to buy a pack of cigarettes a cigar or a six pack of beer and a lottery ticket if I so choose\nYou earn your money spent it how you want where you want\nDo I have the right to buy a pack of cigarettes a cigar or a six pack of beer and a lottery ticket if I Choose\nYou earn your money spent it how you want where you want on whatever device you want\nAnd this is something I Do want to bring up I Know we need to go to break but everybody keeps saying that the state is going to state is evil the state's going to allocate the money wrong if he goes to state blah blah blah blah blah which the state's not the best we have earmark programs now and Emma viable are ... it's a viable argument but the earmark programs in Alabama are just ridiculous I'll agree with you there\nBut let's take an example everyone goes Florida Florida Florida Florida Florida doesn't know what to do with their ... what ... what to do with the money they're in their state government is given right now the revenue the money to state government is given by the people let's talk about Tennessee\nSince the inception of the lottery in Tennessee the educational lottery corporation has raised more than four point seven billion\nFor education programs in the state more than one point three million lottery funded scholarships and grants have been awarded ascendancy students including the HOPE Scholarship\nThe wilderness grants and the governor's drive to fifty five initiative the dollars are also use the sports after school programs and energy efficient school initiated look the government's never going to be perfect but to say oh they may mess up with some of the money\nWell you know what a lot of states that exact situation would be legal\nOr with all wall\nBecause we haven't passed that kind of regulation for it's a very direct route\n[noise] well\nYeah and that brings the whole raffles situation and a lot of how many churches conduct rivals for the years ...

crap [laughter] I Know he\nDied early I met the oh boy oh so I mean you know kind of have their ... yeah well I don't know about that era that was what Nineteen twenty when he got a whole\nI stress just a joke I apologies rented out well\nYou know and the other thing is is that uh you're you're holding company for the states why can't say this because we don't have enough wind power dynasty up at the legislators they only wind they got its own hot a hot a money and put it in their pocket\nYeah it's also got bear for the\nYahoo they got ... he's making a lot of water he yeah he might be smarter and all of them [laughter]\nThe other thing is is that if they were smart enough we could build our own a operation instead of going to the to the gambling cartels which are the old\nMob ... running the show it's just like all these\nMachines I ... for the casinos they come from one central location that's the the the organized mob which I think that technical probably down from the um the federal government\nI'm In pretty pretty obvious is that's where it's coming from the do the research if you really get into it and don't be part of the status quo listening to reading everything you can um\nHey debuted come cohost my radio show with me all the time [laughter]\nYou didn't give me a car I put this out there there's a lot of footage phone out there and nobody nobody\nCould get in because you call this number and he wouldn't answer but ah it it's like murder and the rest of the month by the way he said uh oh my lord several times in a way the murder that's got to the Bible like\nMy number one spot eighty three eighty Wyoming I Love you had all that air or something else now that all day of Alabama\nYeah that that last city that you just talked about on the news about the the withdrawal routine of taking a shot at the Clintons or Nancy Pelosi it's all the ... thing yesterday it's been something like six hundred and Seventy five attacks against a conservative Republicans\nAnd uh the worst one was police he was shot almost killed and I mean he is suffering it's crippled because of it ... a ... and there's no comparison\nYou can take us wherever you go to with a super station ... half on the radio on the Web on your phone of what the government at all the surveillance cameras your hometown God and country said superstitions one oh howdy Whitey\nThe tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with a lot of patriots and type [noise]\nTrue to ourselves and our country [noise]\nYour God and country station\nSuper station one on one\n\n\n[noise]\n\nHey Roger by Joe Oculus driving off to work this morning hurt our conversation decided ... went on and say hello and get in on the a\nLottery debate how are you my friend I did\nWhen I did you do huh okay\nI got the Powerball or the ... or the ... ball twice I Won four dollars\nYou didn't win that's winning I mean\nI Want and I'm investing in ocean front property in Arizona huh I didn't you know ... and you know they didn't let me one yeah a lot of people don't play the lottery we we did we ... oh yeah I think they took that money though they they suppressed out they suppressed that when it gets [laughter]\nBlack people don't play the lottery we did we the oh yeah I think they took\nThat money though they they suppressed out they suppressed I Would [laughter]\nThat was the that was something I did they suppressed our tickets man\nWould have had to in in all seriousness you know we've been having this debate you know whether or not it's moral whether or not we have a legal right you know whether or not it's a vice and I think most people agree that it is but just where do you come down on the whole thing lottery know already\nLiar lottery we should have a lottery I mean the infrastructure in ... Alabama is crumbling three for three um\nEducation we you know ah education is filled and they said we need more money so why wouldn't we want to do it with sand at the end of the day that will send back and say okay\nIf lottery comes that grown folks are going to get to the point where are they going to spend all their money on lottery tickets and not going to work mhm so basically within the government the government is based on that take that from you and it will protect you from yourself mhm\nBut we're still going out and going across state lines and buying a lottery tickets anyway bingo so if we was not doing that I Would say okay but they all live when you talk to people a lot of them from Alabama and we'd given money to these other states so stupid this was a political issue and the people you need to get of their high horses\nBut it is low but is it is it morally reprehensible\nIs more represents we're probably on some level maybe not mine [laughter]\nIsn't that if you like it was a sarcastic respond [noise] it it it's a personal thing and\nAll it is fair ... at the top in the same thing that Christ said not to dictating down to the people oh I'm holier than you and so I can tell you what you should and should not do because I'm Better than you well that's not the case we don't all believe in Christianity I Know I Do specifically\nBut not everybody is a Christian does not a theocracy this is a democracy let the lottery happened the only arguments against that are failing and that's why it's been in students\n... you know again my argument has been you know bringing prohibition back into it you know the right to smoke a cigarette or you know drink a beer or whatever the case may be\nYou know if somebody wants to act the fool every once in a while you know sometimes you know we haven't even factor that into it sometimes it just feels fund the act of ... is that because you know when I went to see and I drove to Georgia you know we were like this is so ignorant we're not going to win this but that wasn't the reason we went we went to spend some time to gather to have some fine and\nYou know just to do something a little bit outlandish you know so while we blew forty blocks from the darn thing if I hadn't worked forty hours there you know I spent probably a hundred dollars last march [laughter] on a bully sticks first Stella ...\nNow these are you know bone dog treats if you'll think of it that way okay let's say you're bullying your dog medals in some no no you know it's it's a ... they're made from\nBowls literally you know ... off the air will talked about that off\nThe air but the but the point is you know we I think we have a constitutional right in the state in this nation\nTo act to fool you know to to to live our lives\nAnd if that's hyper libertarianism then it's just hyper libertarianism\nWears the same like I said I die callers I think it's real quick less check the politicians who are making the rules in Alabama and I bet some of them buy lottery tickets or somebody in the family a lot of tickets I promise you they how do the investigation that promise somebody in their family went across the state law and bought a lottery tickets so don't tell them everything well\nSomething else that hasn't been brought to bear here and you you danced around for a moment I like what happened last time I see them and brought this to bear who was one of the major major major groups out there the lobby against the lottery and the state of Alabama your beside the church\nYou know who was ...\nIt was the casino operators like milk McGregor\nWas the people from green track it was the people down to the Florida Panhandle from ...\nOh operators like milk McGregor\nIt was the people from green track it was the people down to the Florida Panhandle from ... it\nWas the people at a wing creek about the way is hiring I hear the casinos all across the the uh the state of Alabama the bingo machine operators that war lobbying against the gambling and let's talk about bingo in our churches for example ...\nI mean you know we're either going to call it a lottery or we're not going to call it a lottery going to call it a game of chance whatever the case may be but if people look and see that the biggest opponent two and a lottery of the state of Alabama was other gambling operators and also out of the state of what Mississippi\nBecause a lot of people that are sort of the fire about going out and bought a lottery ticket or sneaking off\nTo a Gulfport or Biloxi or anyone of a number of places where in fact it is legal ...\nI can honestly say my wife called her friends up in West Virginia and Florida and all these different places and sent it to a cash out okay head people take a picture right her name I'm back in the lottery tickets right and she played a lottery she played the lottery and like four different states\nSo people are doing it regardless and we're sending that money to other states breaking news CNN offices in New York have been evacuated because of suspicious packages just on cue of what we're talking about but I tell you that just broke on a P. literally it's not on the TV broke on ... ... you know\nIn the water also\nI'm telling you that it's not it's not somebody doing it to themselves as the Ted Kaczynski character in this dangerous this is the is unbelievable\nWe have CNN Center time water source residents Clinton residents and rock Obama residents mhm all under a bomb threats\nThis is what happens when you allow the rhetoric to reach the polarity point where it's to one side against another and you're literally any opposite sides boxing I said this is a hundred times if we do not bring this rhetoric\nBack to a point where we can a bipartisan compromise or at least discussion discuss issues then we're going to reach a point of violence\nAll right well let me ask you this we're talking about like the lottery but here today we gotta lock it in Studio Joe and I have had many very heated discussions over the years as heavy and half the caller is a great well that's the other half of us have dumped ... okay\nHave we bombed anything yet nope never we threaten anybody yet have you and I ever ever ever had a harsh word between each other no no\nBut has Maxine Waters come has Maxine Waters been sitting in Studio and how she said you need to harass every one that knows Michael heart and loves Michael are you need to harass everyone that love to lock it knows you're locking when you advocate for physical violence physical violence will be brought in return I'm not saying that it's a place\nThat the blame is placed entirely on that I'm seeing the political polarity and the disgusting rhetoric that we've reached in this country is unconscionable\nSo in other words those roosters are coming home to roost mhm because yeah you you're seeing the people out there on the left calling for violence against the right and now it looks like\nYou read the right is responding you ... you know whether or not is intentional as some callers pointed out the possibility and that is a possibility\nThat it is an object but now as we have gone to air today we have the revelation that multiple media outlets and a politician's homes are under threat of bombing attack\nAnd when I say you report you so I'm not just saying Democrats coming out and saying this rhetoric you report you so I'm saying that you read we are reaping the political rhetoric that we have allowed to go on in this country for so long I mean all of us sitting here have had a death threat or a violent threat right I think that is very fair to say why I'm probably going to have exactly have you Joe\nGo on in this country for so long I mean all of us sitting here how about a death threat or a violent threat right I think that is very fair to say why bother me exactly have you ...\nA to a point you yeah so we've had we've all had death in violence threats this the fact that we cannot discuss political ideas without the threat of violence or I don't agree with you so I'm going to take your life\n... where the hell are we seriously I don't have an answer for that let's also not forget a few comments that Trump made along his campaign trail\nRight up the rhetoric of heart okay All right oh yeah I mean are they able to program it taught me to shut up and a lot of different respect that it's not just coming from the left and everybody likes to say oh it's coming from the left and that's why people\nAre retaliating with the packages now it's coming from the left and the right we have reached the disgusting level as a whole I think it's going to continue getting worse I don't think of search and said you know\nI Want to go if you're going to continue getting worse it reasonable next eleven twelve days\n... this could be an apex we can be in the middle of an apex right now with all of the Ted Kaczynski ask packages being sent and for those you don't know Ted Kaczynski can you explain that Michael\nUnabomber yeah they're going to happen yeah crazy beard yeah uh-huh uh-huh spend a lot of packages to a lot of people killed ... people remember Ralph Lauren moody\nHe pointed out that three studies and research we catering to the average instead of studying the above average outliers that could essentially bringing average up and he said that we have seen as a society that cater to the average trickle the average down and settled in my opinion\nIf you ask yourself the lottery\nIs it going to bring the average us in America bringing average down that's the question thanks\nI appreciate the call Megan and it's certainly a a good thought no doubt about it\nI we are continuing to monitor the situation and like I said we have ... reports\nOr explosive devices in multiple locations we do not know if the a report that there is possibly wants that to the White House is valid or not we simply don't know because this is occurring in real time however it's certainly would change the narrative or whatnot if in fact we do find out the White House has also been a recipient\nOf one of these are very suspicious packages we've got a job lock and hanging out with us and big day at Baylor acting like a couple of our youngsters as not throwing spit balls at each other through a straw millennials\nYou want to go to ... sure I've got ... ... ... oh cool [noise]\nHey but I Do I Do have an answer that question I Do think I I Do like the points you made I think when you ... what was the exact phraseology she\nMisery catering down to the to the average or the oil average\nEven I think the I think there's two things you can think about their because you're not supposed to legislate the urge is supposed to legislate to all people right um and there's something to be said there because you're not catering down to the mine\nIt it's such a hard hard discussion to have because I don't think that you cater to the education systems different this is a really hard thing to talk about so you can and there is a problem with our education system that it is broken because students that could be progressing further are\nBeing stifled by our education system right now I don't know if the same thing happens with a lottery or a social program like that because the education system I'm correct me if I'm wrong but if you are not enrolled in the education system public or private\nUntil you're Eighteen years old your parents can be held legally line is not Eighteen I think it's actually sixteen sixteenth something like that but until a certain age or parents can be held legally liable right that is government compulsion to go into a program I don't see the lottery on the same scale because there's no government ...\nThe hiring you smoke or maybe that's not the correct way to look at it but I'm curious what y'all think I don't see it as\nCatering to a um\nCatering to I keep forgetting her phraseology catering to that group she was saying because there's no government compulsion behind it\nI think when we look at um society as a whole the bigger picture is when I was a kid the telephone was attached to the wall\nMhm okay and you didn't have a push button you had to do the rotary though and didn't push button K ... and then beepers game\nPoint is we have evolved yeah\nThings evolve human beings evolved in our education system in a whole lot of stuff as we go work everything evolves\nBut some things in our society has not evolved when ... when it comes to education and some of the thinking which would hold on to these old things ... and what people are having a tough time too easy bobbing in certain areas of our life I'm ... comes to education and things like that and we're learning kids are learning fascism alone\nPeople are having a tough time too is evolving in certain areas of our life I'm On when it comes to education and things like that and we're learning kids are learning fascism alone is lower now as we bobbing we have we're going through a transition of race and what we see is a a huge transition in the country today\nThat will fighting some people want to keep it the old way some people ... I've learned that ma forty years\nIs going to happen regardless and at some point the old school is going to go away and so you have to evolve\nAnd public education is geared primarily still towards the idea that people are going to work in factories which are not the modern work environment so I Do think education is a system where we have seen very little evolution perhaps say some people won't work in factories but is no longer a majority like it was at one point\nWell even the factory jobs or become high tech and a lot of them are not prepared even for that and\nI also think the ah the memorization standard that were held to now\nIs I'm kind of inconsequential at this point not talked about this a lot off air but it's this idea that your education is based on how much you can memorize that's not a modern education system because nowadays what's at your fingertips right out what can you search ... almost every American as a smart phone I don't need to memorize formulas I Need to memorize had an ex how to execute it\nBut I shouldn't be graded on the fact of whether I can remember the exact formula because\nOh what's ex plus why I can just asked Syria and Syria will tell me immediately\nAnd that's I learned that through my son right now my son is Thirteen Years ago and I'm learning so much because I'm teaching him a different way that I've been told\nTo because I used to say he was cheating when he used to get the computer out you know you pull up the phone he asked the phone so I'm like no dude you got to do like to do but I kind of set back or they still let them use it in school yeah though as like I say evolving and we don't we have not learned to evolve with our kids we not learn to evolve with society\nBut if you want to stay with the phone stuck on the wall with the rotary a doubt doubt now there you're going to be left behind ... so many people are being left behind because you know even when you want to listen to the lottery thing\nIs happening forty seven states have already done it ... so eventually it will happen when the old people voted out of office here in Alabama okay and the new generation comes and it will happen we can fight it all day long but even though he wants it with the south and we know we do we do you know it's going to happen\nI also think the state legislature should have no role and dictating what's taught in the classroom you should have a role in what's in dictating what's taught in the classroom and how it's taught if you're in the classroom I think having older older people that have no idea what's going on in the education system no idea what's going on in the modern work environment dictating that is just not the correct comes out\nThe difference in the education is that ... and you know I work with a lot of younger people Dylan who's an exception to the rule but as more operators have come in here and trying to teach them how to\nBack time stuff they don't even know how to count backwards and they have to pull out their phone\nTo be able to add it up to be able to back time something where I can do it in my head because that's the way I was tall ... I don't have to go to a computer yeah to be able to do that ... and I say you know and do and like I said is different than a lot of the other ones that I've taught\nHe knows how to do it in his head he does not have to look at a phone to be able to do that I was different between education and lottery lottery is it's gonna happen mhm and even a governor ... said she was pro if the people want to let it happen\nWell she was she said in fairness to her was that she would consult with fair and it fair that she before it too\nWell in that should be all up your alley because you're all about seeing what the doodle wants to do\nThe oily yeah ... where we go\nWell in that should be all up your alley because you're all about seeing what the ... yeah\n... where we go shopping when we go shopping if you go to Georgia to buy lottery tickets all yeah if I could just gets dealt with a drive I'd be in great shape so yeah we absolutely have to consult the best interest of the dog does it\nDoes bear think we should have a lottery man says yes okay interesting [laughter]\n\nI Love you do and that's the best sound bite we've ever had a\nBear says you as a quick break rather get outta here will take a car to outside banners hanging out with his big day taking up space\nJob lock it happens to be loitering y'all stick around Rick I'm going right back\n[noise] listening to them my goal hardship\nOn superstation one on one of you want to do [noise]\nWho says talk radio to stick to just the way you can find out about what's coming to what's going on for\nWhat you missed by following one oh one superstitious on Twitter for simply go to Facebook dot com and search for super station one oh one W why he\nYou can take us wherever you go to with a super station one oh one half on the radio on the Web on your phone kind of like the government at all the surveillance cameras your home town God and country it's super station one on one company Whitey\nSitting around the board your dinner table sharing stories were friends that's\nWhat we like to do here at our American story ... it'd be in each week night we bring you stories about American Love funny stories about first jobs in this day in history American dreamers in marriages and even the stories of music and acting legend\nI invite you to sit around the porch with us as we share our American stories\nOn superstation one on one point one W why do you\n\nIf we ever forget that we are one nation under God\nWould be\nTrue torso\nSuper station little one [noise] nobody Whitey [noise]\n\nHave a right to go back now\nDid you say during the break from the confirmation of a package I I'm not a hundred percent sure\nThat I just received a text message I have not seen an article substantiate in that yeah\nWell we have multiple suspicious packages all across the country CNN Time Warner\nHas changed the rules of politics and turned it from respectful debate and differences into emotion analogy shouting matches an ad hominem angry accusations\nThere has never been more negativity in politics and as November sixth nears the attack as increase to the point where they now become counterproductive but more one candidate attacks another without justifying that attack\nThe more inclined I Would be to vote for the opponent wouldn't you haven't had enough of this stuff\nTomorrow the demand for clarity about what candidates will do once elected I'm Bill McCormick\nW ... there'll be ...

I\nProbably would be expected from my [laughter] what I'm going to point out is there is a there is a line of thought\nThat is going to be put forward by the left and is being put forward by the last that I don't disagree with\nAnd you might be shocked into a explain explain\nThat it doesn't really matter if ten thousand people in a caravan across the southern border now at this point you're going to be saying Scott what are you talking about\nPart of me agrees what difference does it make and if you\nSay wow I'm willing to explain it the\nPart that agrees with what difference does it make its recalls ruins from\nBoth the federal courts bureaucrats\nOut of Washington DC ... by congressmen and senators has created this Web of naturalization quote unquote policy that is ridiculous\nYou show up at the border you say you're scared when you get process because you're you're you're seeking asylum\n\nApparently so far this year\nOver three hundred thousand\nPeople have been detained at the southern border crossing illegally and having to be processed\nThat number may be closer to four hundred thousand but over three hundred thousand people so when some leftist stands up and says\nWell it that doesn't that doesn't really matter\nThey have a point\nIn their point is if we're letting in because we still have a couple of months left three months left if we're letting in upwards of ... half million\nPeople illegally what's ten more thousand\nThey have they have somewhat of a boy basically they're saying you've already lost America you patriotic Americans who care about sovereignty and care about the future of the country you're already lose its way of God's shoot down we have seen fit for\nHundreds and hundreds of thousands of people a year to stream over the border wire you act and upset about ten thousand more\n\nNow you know my policy would be shut the border down period not one more person comes across that border illegally and I would have the full\nForce\nOf the federal government if I had to use military\nMore person comes across that border illegally and I would have the full\nForce of the federal government if I had to use military guys if I had to use National Guard people on the weekend\nTo right yes I'm going to say round up round up illegals at least the four hundred thousand who just came across the border this year\n\nI'm going to read that section from the constitution again\nThe United states shall guaranteed to every state in this union a Republican form of government and shout protect each of them against invasion\n\nAnd now finish and own application of the legislature or the executive when the legislature cannot be convened against domestic\nViolence domestic violence oh\nWell that's the end the ... maybe would that be people paying\nTo stir up riots see I think we've already been way too\nTolerant of the violent left\nIn this country but the constitution is perfect league clear\nThat the United states government should protect the state's against invasion\nAnd that trumps the other things trumps the other all trumps the other efforts\nThis these are this is an invasion of four hundred thousand people come into your\nCountry in a year it is an invasion\nAnd his rag tag army of sponsored migrants who burned the U.S flag after spray painting a swastika on it\nAnd then ran around or carried and hunt deer and flag have you seen the big Honduran fire if you say in that photo big guy so you're the one that's like\nFifty sixty feet long\nThirty forty feet wide I like it would have it a football game actually like would be on the uh down on the field on a football game they're using that as a teenager you know you see if it's ... it's really you know our song together you know the I mean what's the line straw rock 'cause they didn't buy no thousand dollar flag good\n... 'cause they all be pope and they all be they all be scape and\nViolence and poverty I would've said that in Spanish but I don't know how a ...\nDon't get me started on having a press one for English into for Spanish [laughter]\nWhich is kind of racist if you think about it because why is it not why do we not have more choices\nWhat's wrong with Farsi you know it's kind of strange three\nWe do and we don't have to round up anybody we don't have to force you know a deportation they will leave on their own or they will go to the states that are more accommodating and what will happen there is you start pushing people you know if every\nState starts enforcing this with the exception of uh probably Illinois California\nNew Jersey New York places like that right they were offered a low dose systems to the point where they will go bankrupt\nIn ... and then they all decided to enforce the law\nExactly and that's how that's how you ... you don't even have to build a border wall I still think we get built one but you wouldn't even have to because you'd have to you know you don't have to keep it open just you know for a flood of immigrants going back\nYeah they need to be a one way see of thanks to David I don't disagree that is I mean it's the truth and I have no idea\nI I've been called a couple of different times in the last six months by reporters in this state asking about the state law that is in place and we have in the administration now they would absolutely work with the state government to do the things that were in that legislation\nYou know I Can't tell that the state of Alabama's doing anything\nTo reduce the number of illegal aliens in the state of Alabama we can't do anything about California from here\nBut like David said if the states who are willing to do something about it did it you\nEnd up overloading those states who are forcing the rest of us to accept\nAny legal invasion and they deserve it not our job\nForcing the rest of us to accept any legal invasion and they deserve it not our job to subsidize the walls and desires of the crazies on the coast Bryan welcome to the program\nScott I'm it wouldn't be entirely impossible to say that the the Sears a bomb threats or might possibly be to try to take a little attention away from the ... the invasion come in\nAnd also it wouldn't be beyond possibility that some of these bomb threats were actually done by liberals to make it look like Republicans might be doing it in\nIn the recesses of my brain I vaguely remember sometime in the past there were some type of attacks on some\nDemocrat offices and all and I later found out it was actually done by some leftist Democrats\nWill look look at some of the threats that were made on the college campuses at the height of black lives matter um\nPeople were supposedly spray painted racist racist ... and the bathrooms in owned buildings and all this kind of stuff\nAlmost every one of those\nTurned out to be self inflicted propaganda yeah and\nI mean look that you can't say a hundred percent I Can't say a hundred percent but the odds are his three over the last five or six years would have to make you bet on the statistical probability\nThat did these things are self inflicted foray propaganda purpose\nYeah there is nothing that the left won't the odd ready to believe that I don't think there's anything out of bounds four\nAnd a mean mentioned this so I saw a George ... big mansion in New York on the TV the other day right and uh I don't understand why the police and the FBI can't go there when he's there in a rash team\nHe sent man's of dollars to Ferguson, Missouri to pay people to loot and burn stores and burned cars\nI don't understand why that guy's not being arrested can you figure that out for me I\n... no I Can't we were talking about just a few minutes ago when we're reading an article for sex them for the constitution\nSaying that the United states do guarantee a every state Republican form a government protect each of them from invasion\nProtect them against domestic\nViolence if someone is out funding a riot I Would think that counts exactly the same as stirring up or right\nScott if if I went out and maybe on the Internet you advertise for those two are due fiscal and bodily harm to other people and destroy property if I put that out some way I guarantee you my local police chief would be knocking on my door before the sun went down today\nI don't disagree Brandeis would call buddy at\nLet's keep on rolling on the only problem with that is so rose the way he\nDoes it mhm he does it kind of a\nHe's one step removed or to remove a yes he donates to the organization and the organization organizes the rioters and they say it and there's no proof oh don't forget also they hand out those sheets of paper\nAnd they say don't forget this is a peaceful protests\nDon't mind me tell you where when ... because of the controversy will be even worse\nThey don't forget this is a peaceful protests don't mind me tell you where when ... because of the controversy will be even worse but we have a history in this country of people showing up publicly and saying\nPeaceful peaceful peaceful peace\nAnd within just a little while that individual leading the movement\nLeaving that all heck breaks out but that person's on TV saying peace peace peace now\nThey're here or historical reports of that person\nKnowing the violence was going to break out after they left\nBut just just the idea of saying it would cause such a firestorm for the program that I don't know if we could even survive it 'cause I remind you all of the what is it the rice stagger bar don't remember what that was\nPaid off Hitler had been sworn in as chancellor\nOne month after that swearing in the ... fire was an arson attack on the rise tag building in Berlin the Nazis\nStated that a Dutch council communist was found near the building they blame the power owned the communist agitator Z\nAnd they use that as evidence\nThat people were plotting against the government and in response civil liberties were suspended and the Nazi control of the government was in ...
