I'm from originally and granted he had a farm in your ah you know that's been a lot of time in Iraq growing up in\nA mood immobile when I was fairly young dad working sporting goods and it all over so I've got you know I'm ... from South Alabama practice law both in Montgomery in Birmingham for I went to Marshall County so I feel like\nI've had a little bit of every bit of the state in me at some point in time and Alabama's home we're not even when I went to University of North Carolina right that is our is always come back to Alabama was how\nIt is it's a beautiful voice and we appreciate you how long have you been in the office\nHas only it's going on twenty months ah was appointed back in February of two thousand Seventeen which seems like forever ago many ways in\nA been a remarkable journey I'm a very er prosecutors basically kind of where I come from and so you walk into the role you know people look at the age is on the top top and so very comfortable there but what I think it's the most exciting is the way that we had the opportunity eighties office\nTo impact issues outside of public safety you know some of which relate to you know to landowners and those who care about our environment in the state uh and do it in a responsible way you know we've been engaged in issues that impact them as well\nSure and and more of the most pressing issues of weight as the waters of the United states rule will tell us about that are more and more the current I mean what's the current status of the law\nKnow we saw clearly with ah the EPA under the Obama administration would ah you know federal overreach is probably a limited term but yeah it's funny a justice clay at one time talked about\nUh the fourth branch of government and that's when some of our federal agencies believe that they truly are right I'm a much higher authority and then they really were and then what we saw with with\nWith the EPA is expansive definition of the waters of the U. S. so that we were limiting the use of land by landowners in in a proper way and\nSo we were involved in our office and being able to push back to say that he PA engaged in significant overreach in that area and we're very pleased that when\nYou know former a director Pruitt or was there that they rescinded that former Obama era rule and now are trying to be more responsible but I mean it you know like I'm a product of rural Alabama\nYou know clearly have family that has been involved in the timber and farming business for a long time those are conservationist I mean these are my I care about the land they want to be responsible with the land\nAt the same time we don't need to be burdened by regulation from from the federal government and so what I think that will see is an opportunity for a responsible\nRule come about it protects the waters of this country which we want to be able to do but also recognizes the ride of individuals to use their property and the inappropriate way and so I think it's going to be an opportunity for those that care about this issue to be able to submit comments\nA and they will come forward with a rule that makes a lot more sense for the only people the Alabama with people in this country sure who will actually issue that ruin and what do you think that the timeframe might be some kind of a A R met with a with the person ... managing budget recently that's responsible for sort of authorizing rules when they come out\nUh this is a significant issue in this country and so big deal now yeah and so I think that they will take their time and going forward with it you know the good thing is we suspended the other rule which was irresponsible and going back to what was at least a little better version but ah but I'm expecting some time over the next year that will see progress on that\nFront but to the extent that anybody is listening to the show that cares\nYou know you do have the ability summit written comments to to propose rules and so\nThose are available out there for inspection if somebody needs to be able to find and then contact\nIt cares you know you do have the ability summit written comments to to propose rules and so\nThose are available out there for inspection if somebody needs to be able to find and then contact our office I'll be glad that sort of give them that opportunity but ah we hope that folks will weigh in and that are really feel confident that the Obama administration will do some gave me the Trump Administration will do something that's responsible because\nYou know what we've seen from them it's in the limited time that President Trump has been in office\nThirty three regulations rescinded for every one that's been adopted and that's a very positive thing now some of that slow hanging fruit I don't think it'll continue at that rate but yet you know when we see what a you know the federal register which compiles all of this government regulations you know basically being reduced by force\nOr that shows that they are truly making a difference in that area but it but this is one of those rules that mattered dislike some other ones really and critical habitat that will also say\nRight well Dave says on the show off and that he is for responsible government or you know something this that and and we really believe in individual freedoms and individual rights and\nA lot of those things that the constitution guarantees we don't we don't need government making those decisions for us uh all the time and that's one of the things that I've read about your record I appreciate that are pretty sure that we have\nA somebody that's conservative this fighting for us for fighting for individual freedoms and laws and I I think that's a that's a big help or for landowners and it just for people in general for citizens in general it's nice to know that you've got somebody on our side it's not ... not trying to tell us everything\nThat why did they that's Caprio limited government is ... you know do we do military defense well probably guys are military I think we do law enforcement well knows that the public safety well\nSometimes on government gets involved in issues we screw it up more than we make it better it's why you know even this broader debate that we have going on right now are relating to social media and\nFacebook's in Google's in Twitter's I think if there's a lot that are calling for federal regulation of those entities and again I think we have to be very careful not what we do and what the federal government and the government is involved with right needs to be within the lane clearly needs to be authorized by the constitution\nAnd then we need to make sure that we're being able to comply with the laws in a way that allow for people to operate in the sphere that it allows for businesses to thrive and for individuals to exercise freedoms yes\nExactly right if we want the government to claim of our our neighbor's backyard and won't be long before they're trying to clean up our is right on the right phrase you know\nI'm I don't I don't know if\nI've shared this with our with our listeners before but I was job I think job and you may have been at the meeting but we were to were were really involved with al ... associations to great\nGreat great group and a great trade group but also a great lobby group for landowner interest Alabama they are really strong for landowner interest not just tumbling owners but any any landowners and I'll tell you there was a real right before the election and two thousand sixth in presidential election\nI've been criticized acts and the director was was leading a little tall\nAnd he was showing a map of the state of Alabama would probably happen if if you want to elect a ... and just factually the number\nOf new endangered species that they were trying to push through his a political thing you know they just won't and it just it was staggering because we know we have a timber sales vision in our company and what people have to work around environmentally now\nA a G I stayed at AOL dot us\nYou know go to Steve Marshall Dutch GOP and ah we just won't lend our whole hearted support and show up November six and vote for attorney general Marshall we need them back in the office and the attorney ... ... Marshall banks minimum wage job thanks so beyond me back Yes sir thank you have what a good guy I'm so glad attorney general Marshall was in ... it was a great visit with\nThe ... that really was and he's you know this is the land show and I know we get off on a lot of other subjects but you know all this impacts landowners and said oh sure in in our in our citizenry and uh you know he's a he's a solid guy he's the guy when it\nYeah and if and if you don't believe individual freedoms matter or you start taking away stripping away some of those freedoms on the periphery\nAll that translates into your land ownership and what you can do with your private property rights are all those sorts of things matter November six go out and vote for attorney general Steve Marshall and you'll stay with us we got a great gift coming up miss air and basically with the Alabama Kalamazoo association will join us right after this break [noise]\n\n\nAnd report the magazine for the American landowner house supporter of the land show with David ...\nGo away and report the magazine for the American land routes supporter of the ... show with David Johnny our publications ... vessels subscription offer exclusively\nTo land so listeners on this subscribe by\nLand reform dot com enter the code and show a check out and let's see they won your discount America's number one lane magazine fifty\nNine dollar value for totally forty dollar sixty six percent saving that way and report dot com laying silver check out for this was a discount and be sure to check out the report on\nFacebook if you love land\nHey everybody this day milk with land show are you in the market for your own piece of paradise let my good friends with Alabama at credit hill they provide reliable financing for central and south Alabama they offer a wide variety of loans and services to meet the needs of the diverse role and agricultural operations that our territory\nIf you don't need a farm but you need a loan for recreational timberland or even a ... Alabama critic and help you to\nThey want to partner with you they want to be your relationship lender they'd even a greater incentive out by critics supports the cooperative way of doing business so their members or their stock holders as a stock holder you might be eligible to receive a cash patronage dip it in\nLast year the dividend promote spoke about one percent of their loan balances wow you've heard that right one percent that strike cash back into your pocket\nSo if you're looking for a land ... for your piece of paradise take advantage of the cooperative system echo Alabama at credit today or visit at Alabama at credit dot com [noise]\nEverybody went back and listen to the last show with David John John in real excited when this is the perfect shows we had a great first just as good as equally been tested second guess immature and but usually friend\nOf the show she's executive vice president of the album McAdams association Aaron ... guys it's great to be back and I appreciate it yeah absolutely will tell us you know a ... you know there's so many things we can talk about and uh let's just go first into like what's on everybody's mind\nA specially down south Alabama this storm damage let's talk about that and how to go ... getting involved\nYeah I'd love to are certainly\nA hurricane Michael Wright habit I'm across the Florida Panhandle southwest Georgia in our producers and the wire grassy area and um I was actually down there yesterday um or or on Tuesday of this past week and it um it is devastating and in many areas certainly the southeastern corner of ... Easting county\nI'm In in it it really impacted uh the entire landscape down there um it'll take a lot of people coming together to try to repair damage um and then also just try to\nTry to face immediate needs down there and our hearts and prayers are with with those those family down there there's farmers down there and from the the cattle perspective specifically um it's been interesting\nYou would think that what the storm at that impact the allied death loss and cattle but we actually haven't heard that much at our biggest concern is actually infrastructure so a lot of our producers I was talking to a producer yesterday\nAnd they're scattered out and a lot of areas across across\nThe town that they live in the area community that live in\nAnd they lost thirty miles of\n... oh wow yeah so you know a lot of people are scattered out in different different areas you know not one ... a lot smaller pastors and whatnot and so to lose that fence to have the trees down to lose a Barnes Phillies hey that they've put up this summer for the for every winter feeding\nThere is and what not and so to lose that fence to have the trees down to lose a Barnes Phillies hey that they've put up this summer for the forever winter feeding\nGoing to be a lot of concern there over the next um next few months into the next few years and so um to try to address that we have set up a hurricane disaster relief fund or Alabama ... foundation\nAnd you can donate to that uh online at ... dot org dot org excuse me ... dot org slash hurricane relief\nAnd or you can write a check in Senate tests that money absolutely a hundred percent of it will be used to purchase supplies for these producers that were the hardest hit\nDown there and those areas and um the hope is that we'll be able to take the money that we collect and match it with our foundation funds that we currently have and so on that than we can get a pretty big chunk of money together in order to to ... certainly federal funding will come into play with a lot of these situations or disaster\nAreas that are named but we know that folks need to get cattle corral they need to get cattle traded they need to uh be able to purchase supplies and whatnot and so anything that we can do to help those immediately we're going to try to try to\nTry to do that and and help our members and help our producers down there\nOne of the things with me to see a or was made to see a few years ago will now but wildfires out in Texas and Oklahoma Colorado and all those or if it was how the Alabama councilman responded to that and did so many things to raise funds\nI Know we went to an auction where to warn towers ... auctioned off\nGo up and then just sending out there and so we talked about it on the show several years ago but\nThese farmers are big their neighbors even though they might not your you know quite Joni might not be touching Houston guilty but those count them under their neighbors aren't they\nAbsolutely um they they made by their ... and clay county or they you know they may sell cattle here there and maybe they feed cattle in other parts of the state\nUm maybe they talked to people in other parts of the country but you're exactly right or whether it was the blizzard in South Dakota where Alabama we stepped up and tried to help those folks Hurricane Harvey when that came through Texas um we we had some similar type of\nThing so we've helped a lot of our neighbors in other states and\nReally hope and now that it's us um you know hopefully some of that will come back and certainly we've got very very helpful folks here in the state and you're right producer cat um in helping cattle man is is not anything new at the farming community typically comes together when we have tragedy and disaster like this and\nI don't think this will be any different and I'm looking forward to seeing the results of it and just being able to help our folks\nBlush I Will listen do ... what are some other issues ... were dealing with rod no no no ... um that we had rental Churchill recently prices or repeal study in or get a little bit better and you know what what are some issues that you're seeing rooms but\nWell um I think right now we're in before the hurricane came we're actually in a pretty good position um as you mentioned cattle feeder kept prices have been pretty pretty good this this kind of\nRuined that we've had the last last couple of months I'm and we're we're about to get to the end of that quite honestly just season out of the of the of the market um it was a it was a good summer we we had\nYou know is a little scary at the beginning of summer a lot of people experienced a little bit of a drought then it started raining so I feel like the hey hey production was pretty ... most most producers I think got a pretty good ... put up\nUm you know a lot of folks are starting to to drill seat for winter grazing um and that that will be that will be helpful or going into the winter months\nUp um you know a lot of folks are starting to to drill seat for winter grazing um and that that will be that would be helpful or going into the winter months so I think\nAs far as the farm is concerned we're pretty good shape obviously we're watching a you know November sixth elections coming up so we've been actively engaged in that from the political standpoint\nI'm looking forward to seeing the results of all that and I'm with the session coming up next year and then dealing with some things in DC quite honestly uh we work out the at the federal level as well and unfortunately the farm bill to knock it pass 'em before September thirtieth so we're working through some things with that but I'm really want to be\nHonest I Want to take a minute to to come into our congressional delegation in our in our Senate a\nSenator certainly senator Shelby being the chair of the Appropriations Committee um we're already starting rates and the benefits of that um although the farm bill that passed there is a lot of our preparations budget said did pass that\nReally haven't been done in the timeline that those got done this year I'm In the past and so he has to be commended for his leadership is shining through and really get some things done in DC and so um I think as we get through this election kind of get through that our primary focus is going to be on the farm bill and seeing it to the finish line\nAnd I'm In Austin and also dealing with a transportation issue that we've been dealing with the in the cattle and the cattle hauling um segment of our industry and um that's something that we are going to keep working on but um it's it's just a lot of things a lot of things going on right now it's busy time of year\nOur professionals

to uh easy to to search through and then land think provides tons of great information to people who are buying or selling or or just want to know more about land ownership and\nRon ... the man he's he and his partner Tate a reading put this together and I when I have a question they run as the guy that I call it he does a fantastic job and uh and\nWe always look forward to talking to you about the polls question that comes out the ... cent let's jump into that Ron tell us what was the question this past month\nThe question was pretty sat on which we like to eat\nA chef or in general are just so we get people to engage we don't want to watch shows that are long drawn out ... ... ... different responses and so on but the question was pretty simple and that was it it's a buyer if you were looking to invest in property\nWhat would you prefer written specifically recreational property which you prefer something that ... or something that a war the picture up or one that you would need to customize to make your own yeah\nThat ... that was the that was that you know just watched\nWell when you ask for a simple question if Jonathan ... is right it is going to be a simple questions in some ways around but I was really surprised that the answer how did how did the responses go\nWell we got a I broke\nDown where picture after what Seventy and a half percent wow uh the respond that said that they would prefer extra for and then twenty nine and a half percent or a sorry the operation\nYeah well that that is surprising to me I I Would have thought that it would have gone the other way honestly I Would have thought more people would have wanted something that they can step right into\nNews yeah you know we were talking about ... it'd be interesting to to see the socioeconomic level of the responded because it was kind of been my personal experiences\nThe wealthy or somebody is that the more you know they they are looking for a turkey operation as as a whole row and\nThe wealthy or somebody is the more you know they they are looking for a turkey operation as as a whole row and if you if you like me and John and going to be\nClear that you can [laughter] to know drone right [laughter] well\nRun you are ... you have the benefit of having been a lamb broker or before you got into land flip and land thinking\nYou know I I very rarely show or property to somebody when they don't immediately start talking about what they're going to do when they purchases so that that may be a common thread that runs through some of this discussion\nYeah not make a year yeah like they show that they were dealing with a lot of different dynamic share everybody's situation is different or ... shot and the sale sell side of the of the nation\nI Am she ... she uh she all sides um uh she a situation where you know people like to make their own yeah uh and no two properties especially when we're talking about land uh our our our ally\n... and some people why turkey hunting and that's that requires a certain thought process some people like a duck on you know you don't have to have some water somewhere right uh you know you can eat during the Iran you got to have to watch\nA if you're going to have a ... a cab and a half hour motives it and and then there's also the ... the the fun part\nOf a project or we can sit down and we've got a clean slate\nAnd you can sit down and say okay what do we want to do with fish and and it's maybe something that you you you plan on doing over ... years or decades or they have to build a legacy for your family\nOr not something that you just jump right in though I think she will shift make our society is shifting to a more of a ... bad if it's a shared me more of the body sparing it kind of\nUm a philosophy where people do have the time to write a spin on it created that\nThat'd be good at it from the clean slate they want to just jump right in the ... it's ready to go when a and get after like they like they will shoot gas new show a bad results for a little bit\nUh I'm with the jobs that I read that thought they would be a little bit more black I Would say more fit you write a as opposed to to um or the extra for but I think a lot of that alters ...\nYeah it is it's not far fetched to say it generally property that doesn't have improvements August yeah I only got to be cheaper than one that's full of improvements that right um you know but then again you've got to pay for those at some point and some people look at it as a long term kind of finding a chi improvements over\nSeveral years show\nRight well I think that was really interesting question thanks for given southeastern wing group to the uh ability to sponsor that um and just real quick for our listeners um tell us about some of the neat things you just had a recent partnership with some ... who was from around the country tell us about that with ...\nOh yeah guys were on a mission in a way we're doing a great things right

Bobby tea while I've got you oh yeah now Dale last week we had it was it was comfortable for you and I remember that\nThat's right and Bobby kennedy was talking about it was a you know getting cold\nAnd then he said you know if you have that little warning light in your car about your tire pressure and I'm paying in poverty is not that cold yet what would you believe two days later My

things\nIt's really important and dance\nAnd every tire I had to add a little bit of air too but I didn't have that to you did Bob are you going to have to send me one of those things what was that thing you use the air ...\nYeah it sure was ... supporter but one yeah I don't know if you remember the first one that came out with your legs are getting into the twelve vote system of your automobile but now they made a rechargeable one and then that selling off the ... off the table as saying a Bobby\nA similar to the ship and departments and give it away to a map\nBehind the glass grab that guy that sounds good to me I but I had to\nTell you that because I was thinking about it is not that old yet and then the same thing happened to me two days later\nWell you know and you know I and you know sometimes met on some of these new automobiles if you don't take care of it you know I think he's making a beeping sound constantly you know every five seconds\nWell all mine didn't beat but he kept lighting up saying hey you you you you ... do this\nWell I have learned in my life\nAlways listen to Bobby he always\nYou know I I've just you know it's funny and I'll say is this part wasn't funny but Everytime I mentioned something to somebody such as like you just said you know you mentioned you mentioned that Matt and then I'm\nBobby ... then you it's not that code and then two days I haven't ... I guess it's worth recalling karma right so we hear a couple of people in the church and fall and older people that got into this and they and fall and then the bats a bathroom and I'm like\nYou know and and the sad thing is there's four or five I'm just like bam bam bam and two or three of them\n... it's one of the top as a top five top ... also another company called they eat Coby ISI obey eat eat I mean some of these the and the reason why that might be at the top ten in top five because that will a coyote Alexa\nOn your in your home also so that that's that's what makes these things and maybe one's got advantage of the other it will tune in to your your wife our systems are might hey it might even a you know connect to your refrigerator or whatever [laughter] you just don't know these days\nOr you don't then or are we were out of the place of the day talking to a gym about to lift and why was it now but I was a death row with a friend but um\nThey we got to talking about things and all that and we finished up and and I I ... I told her you know listen to the home shows the ... own show and\nThen he goes oh really is yeah it's a deputy chaotic as I said many all in one of the things as funny as refrigerators I said uh the now you got a fridge writer that Scott and screen on outside and you can call up recipes are and it probably didn't you tell me that that if your program it ride or whatever then as you put things in there it scans and tells you what's in there\nThat's exactly right and also tell you something has been voided in other words if if it's out\nDraw yeah so I saw said unless it's got cameras you can see a way if you're a grocery store and you forget what's in there and then I can I say I'm going up and down and go up and scans\nNow but I mean I have a question uh like Dale say he put something in the refrigerator and want his kid gets in each can he go back and see who ate it\n[laughter] I got to ah you could put a smart though that's a good idea or it was a record that's right and I was missing a chocolate milk last night\nIn jail was not happy about it is not happy\nAnd that's that purity chocolate milk you know man that's good stuff but so I told the guy and he goes like I said you know all the homes just everything's going automation he goes he says you know what the next refrigerator I'm ... and I go out and he goes to the one that you open the door and get your eyes out of the tray no water dispenser on the front and he goes I Want a simple refrigerator\nBecause they always break and I go well okay I understand I could do that so uh but the technology Bobby coming in with what you're talking about the ... and that's part of the smart home technology right\nOh absolutely here and I tell you the thing about these these smart thermostat they do save a lot of money I mean imagine saving twenty twenty five percent on your energy bills and things like that that really as it especially if you've got to you know pretty good size home I Try and things like that it

that's where you have to do some diagnosis or see how with the soil is and I will tell you that in my years of doing this\nI'm going to say Ninety percent of the time when shrugs woody plants are in

properly you can mortar whenever you wanted a guy I Would I Would never water in the middle of the afternoon ... especially in the summer when it's hot and it's windy and you're losing a lot of water to evaporation and then when movement\nBut otherwise you can water at night 'cause if your water improperly and really the only thing that you need to be concerned about uh is your lawn if a if you

about what he plans and your shrubs and your trees\nOnce they're established after that first year once they're stabbed leashed\nYou don't have to worry about in less we go for four or five six weeks without any rainfall\nThere okay fine by me I'm Sorry I interrupted when he was talking and and I know you have some questions so go ahead yeah go by\nYeah cannot once question I had a is that you know sometimes when you see a new subdivision being built and after about six or seven years\nI cannot once question I had a is that you know sometimes when you see a new subdivision being built and after about six or seven years some of the trees at the plant will get the root system will get up under the concrete and just break it up side walls or even the driveway and things like that\nWere not an amount and foundation and found an\nFoundation sure what other trees out there will have a root system that will not damaged stuff like that or is there such a thing there\nThere isn't there are some species that are more apt to have surface roots uh but but typically those we don't even consider using in the landscape anymore some of the ... the big issue way back when I started in the forties or so with silver maples and every body planted silver maples because\nThey were rather fast growing but because they were fast growing they were built brittle trees they also really likely to have surface roots\nAnd so they were terrible so we've gotten that you don't use those in the industry anymore I've started using some other there are some varieties of red maples that I've seen that do the same thing and I'm not sure exactly which varieties they are but they will have surface roots\nHowever if the plant that treat properly to begin with again you don't have a problem you're most likely not going to have an issue right yeah if you do have an issue it will be years and years down the road but uh if it's planted properly you're uh you're you're usually not going to have an issue but\nNow I don't know what the planted the tree is but I'm downtown Decatur of is to cook from Christmas control he you know always been a lot for the community planted the ... a bunch of trees but what are the great Myrtle is I think nowadays you know what's the one ... they grow out and it got kind of a brown edgy leave but then they split when they win because\nI go no real move your ear you know I don't know what all the parts of the ears are called but just lay out out are rarely lose one hair that every so many weeks where did you come from and when they tell you if you pull it out

I probably do that more than you are right\nYeah the ... the kids all say that I'm a girl and you're on the ... and the ... I'm a woman and you're the man that's right\nSo uh I think there's some truth to that All right we'll dip into our mail back if we have time can take some emails from our listeners if you would like to have your question answered on the radio or the TV 'cause we didn't have a television show now it runs\nSaturdays at eleven on CBS forty two\nAnd Sundays at ten thirty are these are both AM eleven AM and ten thirty I Am on Sundays on Fox six\nSo uh we have somebody the other day coming in Tony and told me they DVR does show so that if they didn't get a chance to they weren't there to watch it they came back and watch the lighter it's good for them which I thought was something that everyone should do right yeah I think that's a good idea for Birmingham yeah\nAnd so we're going to talk about um\nEmail questions while we're not going to talk about um will answer him and then we're going to do are getting to know your segment so let's jump right in financial warning lights Tony I'm going to hand it off to you now okay tell us about some of the financial warning watch\nWell I mean it's it's just it's kind of like this you're driving your car down the road and maybe the engine light comes on or maybe the oil light comes on you know those little idiot lights that come on that\nSay hey pay attention to me um so so there are some things that in your life and people in in their life financially\nWhich if we're trying to answer the question is my money going to last right which is the biggest question everyone has in fact I call that the big question [laughter] is my money going to last is our money gonna last as long as the both of us are we free to live as long as they went to um so\nDangerous on we would like to be free to live as\nLong as you might not know opening the reason I said that ... because all the time I have people come in here and there ... told him there as they're making less than Ninety two or eighty nine oh yeah that happened and I'm like out of it has to\nDie [laughter] he's given you okay you're done after this after that all bets are off\nYou know we we we do want we want our the families that we help to feel free to live as long as they want to [laughter]\nOh so you know we we we do want we want our the families that we help to feel free to live as\nLong as they want to [laughter] I mean what we ultimately have no control over that anyway we might as well make it as rosy as possible so I'm so here's one of them here is a here's a warning light that I don't maybe this'll be the dollar sign morning like you know there's all these little\nAre they called him oh geez what are those lights called I don't know anyway whatever those lights are out there ... there's one that looks like an engine which I don't even know what that looks like it was like a I don't ... I Do think they call them warning was so that but that was what were called them well but here's the thing I was saying I don't know what the picture of this would be maybe it's a dollar sign\nThe dollar sign morning like that should be flashing in your brain right now is that if you have no idea what it costs to find your lifestyle now most people\nThink they know this so maybe you are warning lights not going off\nMaybe your warning I and I got a few more thousand miles for I have to really change that oil [laughter] or I got it kinda figured out or I just know low tire pressure on them I don't even know what was her pressure I don't even know what that like it always confuses me it looks like\nA horse you with a bunch of stuff on the bottom of the different different cars but anyway but but my point is\nThat warning light for me sometimes for my in my experience\nDoesn't go off the way it should for people because I think people think and really believe they know what it's gonna take to support their lifestyle when they quit working and the reason they think that uh in my experience is because they've either got up there on some website they've gone to some seminar at work at their\nAge our department's put on and they tell they run some numbers that look all rosy and cool and\nBut they're typically way off and and and over assuming a bunch of things that I just don't think are very likely to happen\nFor them so you know you said it what's the big question that's on people's mind right is our money last here's another big question\nHow long do I have to work what happens if I get laid off or I'm about to get laid off and what's going to happen or can I can I retired when I Want to do I have to keep working so these are all big questions that people haven't in the morning like that you're talking about\nOr is this is one of the biggest mistakes I mean we see that people are making one of them is they think they know how much they're spending and how much they're going to need and retirement based upon like you said some rule of thumb or you're going to need eighty percent of your pre retirement income hogwash or\nThey have a budget weren't cheat or they have something they keep on their own they're even all that\nYeah so so I was sitting down with a family uh recently and they have a budget worksheet and how they actually use a quick and mhm\nAnd we had him do our lifestyle analysis ... which is quick and easy but it misses nothing right you can't hide from yourself make came back and they said we were off by twenty percent\nYeah and in and they'll even say everything every transaction downloads right into clicking\nAmerican Express card does that the other thing at all downloads into their butt\nBut there's a lot there's things that people are doing out there and leave and through the correct yeah it really does and there's a bunch of different ways people do it I mean I've seen it all you know there's gold bars in our basement there's different things that are happening that they're doing and they're not accounting for\nSo that's how people get in trouble and I believe that if I were to look at a warning light of financial warning light that dollar signs I'm going to call it how much is going out the door every year is so important\nIn let's take it back to the big question is the big question is will your money\nHow much is going out the door every year is so important\nIn let's take it back to the big question the big question is will your money laugh and it's everything that was ... so so the answer to this question which is how much money is really going out the door\nNot how much does the light bill in the utility you know the utilities and the groceries cost because that's one another mistake that people may may add up their fixed cost and then they go oh that's what we need to live on\nAnd then they said oh we probably spend this on restaurants vacation Christmas taxi also Hitler's fat ... which is off always [laughter]\nSo our experiences it's off on an average of thirty percent so the ... the couple I just described they have two quick in and all that so I Will say this if you do those kinds of things you're probably closer closer yeah but you're but our experiences even then you're typically all five Fifteen or twenty percent\nAnd that's too much if you're going to quit working so if you're working it's okay it or not if we're going to help somebody answered the big question will your money last ... quit arid yeah Kenya quit working\nAnd we allow them to give us the wrong answer to this ... this is another thing that I Want to point out\nI have met with so many families whose broker or banker ask them how much are you going to need and retirement they gave him the answer and the broker or bankers said okay fine in their base in all of their projections off the answer they got from a client\nNow I can see why you would do that because you're thinking oh it's your life you're the one that pays the bills you ought to know our experiences smart organized people don't know the answer to this question so our job\nIs not to her job is not if we're Dr our job is not to let the patient self diagnose quite ... yes so our job is not to let you are first while listener\nDiagnose your retirement or our job is to do that\nWell because Ted it's the first time anybody's typically plan their retirement and they never have the opportunity to get good at it you don't get good at something you've done ones right you're going to make a lot of mistakes\nYeah you you're not going to play on your retirement why do not ever going to get good at it now and you're done after that you don't\nIt's not like somebody comes along and says hey we plan my now that you've done years\nIn the well there's a difference between investing in planning your retirement because there are a lot of people that are savvy investors so when we say this you're never going to get good at it there might be people out there going wait a minute you know I've been managing my own investments for Thirty years I I'm good at it totally different thing please leave your that's the difference between growing your money\nRight so that was a couple of years ago the markets have been doing a great sense then yeah so he's probably feeling really good about that the ... to stay super aggressive maybe\nHarris people that are doing that now because we see this a lot so another warning sign is or if the markets have been up for a decade straight ten in all of a sudden you have forgotten what it's like ... to lose half your money\nAnd that's what I tell them you're playing the same game you did know late and got hurt so bad right same game you're doing the same thing expecting a different result is that\nWell and and I again I don't remember all the details but but I think I remember you telling me that he had enough money\nHe did that I mean wasn't limited super big lifestyle was out in the country it was it was it was going to be a slam\n... shoulder so the question is not how big of a bucket of money do you have you have\nThe the question is will your retirement plan work so that you can retire live the lifestyle you want and not round and worry about run out of money that's so for some people that bucket needs to be\nHalf a million dollars for some people that bucket needs to be two and a half a million dollar right everybody's different exactly but the idea of it and I was a we were on vacation I don't know if I told you this we're on vacation I got into a conversation with somebody I was up up ah\nAre getting some food at the at the little swim up thing or whatever\nAnd I've gotten a conversation where they found out that we did retirement planning so he goes yeah how much money do you need to retire these days I'm thinking for a million that's I've told her talking about as wide\nAnd this is you know we were in November where we wanted to somewhere and he goes I've told her needs to be three million so I'm just curious to know you know if that's the number\nI when I have no idea\nKnow that [laughter] and I thought well what kind of good medicines to write these days your doctor\nSo you know if that's the number now when\nI have no idea I Know that [laughter] they might think well what kind of good medicine is the right these days your doctor [laughter] and I should've said what do you mean you have no idea you just told me your retirement plan her I said yeah but I'm a good one [laughter] there's I don't know how much you and your wife need\nTo be able to retire y'all live here [laughter] right so so it's a it's all about the ratios of\nHow much money's going out the door so that was the first warning why now we have to know how much going out the door really none guess at it and I hope it's going to be less than it is now because\nGolly gee pres we're not just compared to how they looked at as we used to you know when we were first married we lived on peanut butter and tuna fish we can do that again\nYeah you can but that nobody data you really want to do that I might as well so we got it so we got to figure that out and then when we talk about things like this just a bucket of\nMoney it's these ideas a lot of times telling me that people have\nTheir thinking I've got to do this I've got to do that I had to do the other thing but maybe they're not based upon their actual neat isn't right you you know like the gentleman I was talking to they don't need for him to have a million dollars in savings plans\nYou know to to the two of them together got about one point for they've got a couple of pensions that are going to have Social Security if they want to retire tomorrow it will work like a charm yeah it's good but you know whether they decide to do that or not\nI don't know but the but the point is\nYou may be thinking well I've got to get this rate of return more I I lost a buzz so I've got to make it up or I you know I've only got X number of dollars and I need to have this number because that's what I decided ten years ago it was my goal\nThat as a warning sign that very likely\nYou've identified things that you've decided need to happen but they're not really based upon the reality of your circumstance right\nAnd that's what a good retirement planning does lays all this out for you mhm I said a good retirement planning I guess I should say a good retirement plan or good retirement planning [laughter] any effort anyway whatever [noise]\nSo that's what it does for you\nIs it lays all this out in a way that it's crystal clear and you can see it with your own two eyes here's how this lays out here's how much we're going to need here's how the plans put together you know my\nUh nine hundred and twenty five thousand dollars is plenty or my nine hundred and twenty five thousand dollars isn't enough and I need to work three more years or I was thinking I needed to work three more years and really I don't have to those are the big questions that are probably on your mind if you would like to get them answered we know how to do that for you\nWe've done hundreds of times we like to think we're pretty good at it\nAnd the goal is for you to walk away with clarity that you're looking for because everybody's trying to answer these big questions but

the big [noise] and you know what I was the head scoop [laughter]\nOh my gosh okay well let's get back to the topic at hand financial warring like All right\nSo so one of the things that I think is a big morning light is is doesn't have as much as it used to but it but it's still does is that people have some kind of mental image that their retirement is going to look like their parents retirement but there's a lot of difference between our parents' retirement and the retirement that were\nSome kind of mental image that their retirement is going to look like their parents retirement but there's a lot of difference between\nOur parents' retirement and the retirement that we're having today a lot of different things first of all most people\nThat retired that our parents age are not living as long as we're going to and that's just a fact we're losing a lot longer medical science is better than it used to be we're taking better care of our health ... ... our generation and the generations retiring today is going to live\nA lot longer no matter what their ancestors did or their grandparents are parents that they're\nGoing to let a lot longer if you're going to put up with me for a long time I'm going to last longer so that you are [laughter] I'm not a hundred and ... I'm going to get the last word and\nSo so the point of what that means that everybody is that the money has to last longer like so if if you're you're asking the big question is my money going to last well how long are you going to last\nAnd the the answer is you're going to last longer than your your parents did so planning for your retirement today is much more difficult and challenging than planet and your parents when they also here's the other thing I find\nBut we also were still working and we're about to retire and so that was ten years ago if that happens to us while we're retired and we are ... million dollars becomes half a million dollars\nI Know the money's not going to last no matter what my broker says right exact because now we're pulling money out mhm so so he got it he was like there's a difference between\nSitting there on your half a million and waiting for the markets to rebound seven years later which is what it took\nThere's a difference between that and we got half a million but now we're pulling forty thousand dollars a year out of\nHalf a million and even that the markets rebound our portfolio wall\nYeah I mean ... and ... and here's the question really I keep saying this but the big question that's on everybody's mind I don't care how much they have or how much they're spending or who they are\nIs our money don't laugh yup will earn money last please not just telling me pat me on the head and tell me my money's gonna last show me yeah prove to me let me see it let me touch it let me look at it\nAnd we all my money last even if we lived through it two thousand and eight right in retired all of that ask yourself this question\nIs your retirement plan going to work\nIf we have another financial crisis yeah because if you don't know the answer I Would strongly encourage you to get the answer and and the answer is not some Monte Carlo analysis or some platitudes from your broker\nHang in there it'll come back it always does that's advice for if you're not pulling money out of your savings and if you're pulling money out of your savings are you going to have to or you're going to happen to me it soon yeah that hanging their advice is potential suicide deer retirement when yeah if you would like\nAn answer to these questions is your money going to last argue protected from another two thousand and they would a financial crisis\nDestroy your retirement the way you're set up now if a two thousand and eight will destroy your retirement the way you're currently structured how do you fix it yeah\nHow do you fix that that's kind of all we answer all of these big questions is part of our retire with freedom process and we will do an analysis of where you stand argue overexposed do you have a plan in place it's going to work or are there is there a better way\nWe will do that analysis and show you the results in detail\nFor anybody that calls and the next ten minutes we do it completely free with no obligation now it does happen in our office right here in Inverness\nNow we do have a we had somebody recently told me that was driving through from another state we can do it and remotely as well\nUh but anyway if you would like to take advantage of this free analysis it will cost you a nickel nine eight eight triple zero six that's two oh five nine eight triple zero six we do specialize in helping people with five hundred thousand dollars or more plan for their retirement\nBut if you'd like to take advantage of this call now nine eight eight zero zero zero six\nComing up next had an hour then discuss that big questions not just the big question\nBig questions based on everybody's mind you do not want him to take [noise]\nWhy choose freedom financial group to handle your retirement because we provide objective advice and concierge service investments insurance retirement planning all in one location\nFreedom financial group to handle your retirement because we provide objective advice and concierge service investments insurance retirement planning all in one location\nWe also partner would follow fight attorneys CPAs do provide complete financial strategies for our clients we use a variety of investment men insurance products the custom designed retirement plan that can get classically or look at their future\nAnd we help you stay on the path forward for natural independents\nIf you don't want to do it yourself and what I've worked with a team the creative a natural strategy for your future give us a call two oh five nine eight eight cripple low six that's two oh five nine eight eight triple low six would you rather get retirement advice for someone who doesn't know anything about your more freedom for natural groups\nDo oh five nights a triple low six\nInvestment advisor services offered only if I knew the registered individual route eighty management L. M. C. A.\nW. M. and freedom financial group are not really getting companies investing in risk including the potential loss of principle [noise]\n[noise] now we're back\nSony let's ah we're going to talk about the big questions that are on people's mind and then we're going to do it getting to know your segment\nAnd and had these are questions that they're not just on everybody's mind but if they're not on somebody's mind\nWhen they're like literally in the red zone I call it ten years from retirement they should be and so you know one of the questions you know the big questions that you should that everyone she out there should be asking themselves\nAre I Know we keep sending the biggest question is\nIs not money going to last ... here's another really big important question that is probably on people's minds but if it's not it should be all my family be okay if I get sick or I'm no longer here that's and that's not just about I got some term life insurance and people\nDo not plan for that well enough yet in their broker and bringing it up their bank or whoever there's managing their money there's you know\nIncome gets lost all kinds of things happen and it does not cause half as much for one person that lives that does too I'm telling you that at a hundred percent\nOr so we go deep into this on the class that we teach Tony we do a class at just stay right here on valley del road in Inverness\nIf you'd like to come to this class I don't know when the next one is Anna in our office is the one that keeps that schedule and she just tells us when to show up and teach the same sort of need you know they they made it so so I don't know when the next one is\nBut we try to do them once a quarter I think we've got one coming up pretty soon you can call now and the operator will take a message an animal will call you back or you can just call during the week and get on the list for the next class but it's three hours of a deep dive into retirement plan it's fine it's foul planning is one of the things we talked about he is\nBut if you would like to come to that next class nine a triple zero six\nThat's two oh five nine eight a triple zero six you can call now you can call during the week\nAnd get on the roster for the next class we used to charge tuition for this class Tony ... uh but we don't anymore we used to do two nights but we've convinced it into one\nSo people are getting actually more information in a shorter timeframe but because it's less of a commitment of our time we don't charge the tuition anymore so I think it's I think it's one of the best things that people can do for themselves other than coming to see us is come to this class so if you'd like to\nCall and get on the roster for the next one and I can tell you when it is but the reason that came up\nIs widowed women as one of the most is one of the fastest growing poverty groups in the country you know and it's because people aren't doing exactly what you just said\nThey're not doing well they're not asking themselves well my family be okay if something happens to me\nMaybe the sauces wandering\nWhat you just said they're not doing well they're not asking themselves well my family be okay if something happens to me\nIn maybe the losses wandering but sometimes they're uncomfortable making a big deal out of what\nIf something happens to you I going to be okay and\nAnd and so sometimes what happens is they get platitudes everything's fine don't worry about it and then they don't really want to dig deep into it because it\nSounds like you're asking yeah it's like okay well I don't care about whether you're here or not I'm just worried about myself and it's not\nThat no it's it's and the other thing is is the more you know the more powerful and empower do you feel not just gee I Hope everything's okay nobody wants to fill that way so here's the so far let me recap some questions will my money less that should be on everybody's mind you know everybody's mind\nThe other one is is my family okay if something happens to me that should be on your mind\nI got a really good one right now because this really should be a thing we talked about earlier that you may be taking more risk than you actually have to take I think people should be asking themselves is what if there's a way\nWhatever what if there's a way to make sure my my us what if there's a way that I could take less risk and get all the things that I Want what if there's a way that I can make sure I'm spending all the money I Want to today and I can leave some money behind my kids what if there's a way that I could actually get all this figure it out and I don't have to worry about it anymore\nBecause there's a window of opportunity here to figure\nOut if if you're five or seven years away from retirement or even ten or you're already retired\nThere is a small window of opportunity to ensure that you've got a plan in place that answers the big questions so what if there were a way for you to feel confident that you've got the right retirement plan your money's going to last you can see it very clear\nWays but your retirement it's going to be rock solid\nThere's a window of opportunity right now to do that depending on where you are in the life cycle but if you would like to get those big questions answered we can do it for you and we will do an analysis that doesn't cost you a nickel you'd like to take advantage of a call now nine eight triple zero six that's two oh five nine eight eight\nTriple zero six we will sit down with you in person right here in our
