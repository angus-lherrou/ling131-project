fact that the uh the lady worked for a foundation owned by Soros\nWell Charles needs to be taken care of ... and uh the I don't know what we can do about him I I was like a hundred years ago I told

guy on a hot up on a high waving to the people down below that just got out of church to come up on those couches for\nAh prostitutes male and female so you know he he's the one who piles those up that are spiritually dead you know ... it's funny that you get so much from sellers a simple little name but is it but it you know if you get down to ... his\nName means funeral prior unbelievable and

it's something that a Republican did that was wrong I I don't know I haven't been here are any Republicans going and keep it in a\nA waters from eating dinner or not getting any gas at a gas station or or like Ted Cruz getting assaulted that whether he wanted to eat dinner I don't see this happening about Republicans isn't happening by Democrats\nBut the ... that of the blacks or you know Jim Crow laws over all Democrats Hugo Black Hugo Black was a Democrat and a you know the first thing you hear about this whole deal with Kavanaugh was he's going to take in a a pushback on federal law\nYou know they want to claim that the uh low is settled law I remember a time when shuttle Rob was separate but equal or ... you had the also the one where they were in prison the Japanese and the Italians and the Germans\nAnd two camps and that was settled law not react to or whatever that\nBall also perpetrator by Democrat\nAll done by Democrats and I don't understand you know the biggest mistake Michael was allowing Democrats to\nTo keep on hounding I'm the public the more ignorant that became the more they heard democracy our democracy we aren't out of democracy\nDemocracy is mob rule and that that the framers did not stand it I didn't have any affection whatsoever for the word democracy in fact the whole idea of the public\nWants to shed its way away from Chet away from democracy which leads to I could walk to receive which is Marlboro and what what what are we saying seemed to that risk than the purest form of democracy Michael what this is what democracy is is this is not we're not seeing\nWhether that's that was also through all that was also the impetus for the rise of Lincoln you know he was a dismal political failure\nEarly in his career but you know he was the uh the first Republican and this was a political party that was trying to turn away from democracy to what was referred to as a rough public and the government\nRight and they don't forget now Eighteen fifty for why was the Republican Party formed it was porn porn because there was such a thing called slavery that the Democrats were pounded and they ... they were willing to destroy a nation\nFor new democracy and their willingness to enslave blacks and\nHow you know even if you're really break it down Henry and you go back to the the slave holding era you know before women could vote ...\nYou can claim that much of the deep south was run by oligarchs\nAnd oh man you know that it's an excellent excellent example of exactly what we're experiencing because now you're going to the political class that you spoke about earlier that political class is democracy within about ...\n... and who is the world's number one oligarch right now ... ... ...\nWell yeah I Know and you know Michael ... the the Democrats are willing right now to destroy this country we keep hearing all was so divided the only people that are dividing other people that are can only exist they can't\nThis country we keep hearing all will show divided the only people that are dividing other people that are generally shift that can exist in a one nation under God indivisible they cannot\nWas liberty product that I'm ... and just as\nThey cannot exist and and they are battling that we take care of my brother and and then what's the famous design the only way they can exist as a fractured\nA book and I recruit from hearing all had a\nShepherd groups so they can pin on against another whether it's good for them they have no respect for the constitution the bill of rights and only only when it serves darn from one day to another look at how the FBI was the greatest organization ever now it's not\nA Bush to and that is so for the organization in the work was that that that goes right back to the way they were before they went after Trump\nThe only reason why they like the FBI or just like the FBI was because they were going after Trump and that you are I heard there's some\nGotta go gotta go gotta go okay asylum and just put a new article a Romain hanging up now Henry and saying goodbye All right well you have a good time arguing with ... ... and you just keep\nGoing by Henry appreciate your honor here however Ron How are you\nBoy he's long winded [laughter]\nOh yeah and I don't like hanging up on paper or you know I don't know it's just I I'm Sorry it's on me\nI'm you hit as something or mentioned something why'd you know black folks now have a problem with this I went to a predominantly black by school in Illinois are you calling from Chicago and this\nYou know a lot of um a friend so when this has been going on they will put his picture Kevin ... plus the pitcher of someone who was wrongfully accused of black and they'll say see the difference he gets life in prison or get skilled at all it's all free\nTickets are free from what that he's going to get you know nominated\nYeah but see that's the that's an apples and oranges comparison because if you go back to the civil rights era\nYou know what we have a ... is a political battle were back in the day it was their racial battle in the end of the reality of it is is that we're you know Kevin O's also facing congressman testimony were these young black men were not given that opportunity that was bigotry and prejudice predicated on false accusations so it's a different type of accusation all the way around\nBut at the end of the day you know I don't know but you can say capitals gotten off scot free either\nTrue but it's basically what it is it's reverse racism because these are the same people who are complaining that Trump just said signal out because he wants to you know keep an eye on all of them and found\n\nIn there to ...\nWell that's definitely an accurate statement mark\nSo once again if you don't teach history doesn't repeat it feels\nGood point Mike I appreciate the call I looked at one guy to was good Jerry in here who are Jerry how are you\nA very good thank you [laughter]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] you know your your people play that I like I like the\nBaggage Jerry British or the ... very much [noise]\n\n[noise]\n... reminds me of tales made to be aware that the FBI report has come out\nA source familiar with the our report has said that it shows no evidence corroborating the allegations of sexual assault\nOr misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh other specifics run the reporter not immediately available bought one outlet including Fox News is so that they are reviewing crude or interviews with nine people along with a sworn statement from it\nThe available bought one outlet including Fox News is told that the review included interviews with nine people along with a sworn statement from another this way beyond a\nThe original Senate request for interviews with four people though the FBI did not die in the ... drinking habits in high school what area of concern because the Senate did not formally request the information\n\nHow much she drank in high school\nSo the FBI only investigated what the Democrats asked him to investigate twice as much\nOkay\nSo they did what they were asked to do yeah with a little extra yeah but it's not going to be good enough no\nAnd if I ever run for political office enough not considered it up to this point let me just in ... state that back in the day crocodile Dundee would have had a hard time with me 'cause I ain't no cab driver\n\nWhere's the cab [laughter]\n[laughter] the owns back here which [laughter]\nRight over to [laughter] know watch crocodile

speak\nAnd that was the first one ... hot water and there's a ... just ... just breathe at least it makes a little ... for a [laughter] ... ... but you know what else is kinda funny about that is if you remember in that scene in the bar crocodile Dundee\nMeet say cross dresser he thinks it's a woman turns out to be a man and what was her name\nOr what did he referred to her as a Sheila Sheila Jackson Lee jobs are\nSaying that's a man baby [laughter]\n[laughter] uh my gosh yeah whole bunch of ... walking around\nA yeah oh yeah oh my gosh sorry about that\nDylan didn't mean to make an

Democrats that are trying something similar and even admitting that in the sense just for the purposes of congressional abortion meant that they want they're illegal citizens or legal immigrants that are acting as citizens\nCounted in the sense is and so now they're calling into question whether or not this guy who's ... nothing more than ... a glorified actuary\nThat you know the day he is going to be partisan because he doesn't want to count illegals in this country as part of their voting bloc it's very similar to what's going on in terms of the confirmation hearing that if somebody is being presented\nAs for somebody that might be antithetical to our own views or believes we find them reprehensible to the point of calling them out how\nRidiculous is that now it's even encroached into the Census Bureau\nNo I Hope the guy doesn't drink beer or through ice or play drinking games in college or perhaps at the yearbook\nA that has anything related or written to do with a ... a because that of course is going to be the ...\nThe next target of the Democrat Party is how can we destroy this guy's life and the court of public opinion uh but you know I talked about that before and I think it was years ago a on your show when we were talking about voter fraud\nOr specifically in Nevada and beyond and you know part of a this\nFraud or is the census by where are the Democrats are overly represented a in certain states because of the illegal population with in those states\nUh and so again this is simply just a power play by Democrats and that's why I always say there are definitely more of that than there are of them\nHowever the fraud is baked into the bread when it comes to voter registration rolls filthy dirty voter registration rolls and at least forty six states because those forty six states do not check for the citizenship or when you do not check for citizenship when you registered to vote\nOr the same with the sense is of course we should be checking citizenship as you say it it's a financial appropriations but more importantly it is representation or that the Democrats require in order to wield power\nOr the Democrats aren't for women they aren't for minorities the art for gays they are simply about power and what came what was so stark ah from these Kavanaugh hearings uh was the breach of confidentiality that\nDr Ford had originally requested that Dianne Feinstein sat on for two months if these allegations by Dr Ford were so incredibly serious why would just sit around them for two months if Dr Ford was such an important victim and survivor of assault why would you breach for anonymity\nA it is because the Democrats simply wanted to create more political theater in order to publicly smear presumably innocent guy and through the fence\nThat's simply wanted to create more political theater in order to publicly smear a presumably innocent guy and through the census\nOr what they are doing is simply increasing their power in order to silence\nReally the majority or the Democrats we'll we'll we'll we'll do their power against a political party but will not use that power to empower there'll be\nA because their base is fearful and dependent or we can see that through the Kavanaugh\nProtests are these screaming feminist miss interests are that are being well paid a to approach a Senator Flake in a elevators or to disrupt the hearings are without fear\nOr the Democrats would not be able to manipulate and exploit\nOr their victims\nAh like they did with Dr Christine Fort\nDo you find that even remotely comical that you know on the heels of the\nDemands from Diane Feinstein that we have an FBI reporter course inspired by a by flake basically holding his murder over their heads that now after she screamed about having this thing done that now she wants the results are clustered\n[laughter] no I'm not surprised you know so much for transparency you know less exposed doctor could being poured but not let don't expose the Americans to the truth of the FBI or three oh two they're finding\nA how convenient uh when she chooses to be transparent\nA and one more thing if I could go back to the census and illegal immigration I'm ... with the financial ramifications of illegal immigration I've written about uh quite extensively at Reagan babe dot com specifically when it comes to I ten\nAnd I think this is a good time for us to bring that up once again so we can understand the tens of billions of dollars we pay to illegal aliens in child tax credits every year or if you don't recall I'll give you a quick refresher\nI tend to similar to a Social Security number it was a ... to Nineteen Ninety six by the IRS but on the heels of NAFTA or and what it does is allow illegal immigrants\nOr to file taxes uh it's called the uh the item number acts like a Social Security but it's only given to illegal aliens or they use this item number to file taxes but here's the kicker\nUh each eye ten holder each illegal alien can claim up to ten children or to be twenty children but the children don't even have to be blood related\nThey don't have to prove that they exist so when you do the math basically every illegal alien in this country can get about twenty thousand bucks back from the U.S government or if they claim twenty dependence and again they don't have to prove these dependents exist\n[noise]\nI just [noise]\nYou know it's just it's mind blowing it truly is\nAnd and actually in the Trump budget that I can loophole was supposed to be closed\nA but some senators behind closed doors put it back into the budget at the last minute I and I cannot find out who's senators are names I cannot find out the senators names because they did so behind closed doors\nRight right\nAgain you know it it just before idols me\nIt was because they did so behind closed doors\nRight right\nWhere again you know it just before told me that you know you can't allow the the truth to seep through course you know Feinstein also\nIn the early days of the demand was asking for the FBI to investigate these four different witnesses to corroborate story afford the FBI went as far as to speak with nine different without a different people and get an official statement from a night\nAnd that's not good enough either and so it's obvious for anybody whether or not you are above that of a duck feather to realize that this was nothing more than a stall technique for the life of me why more people just cannot see through that\nAnd I guess you know some are I Know there's people out there you know Trump's numbers are continuing to increase\nIn the polls now is as looking like in states where Trump has endorsed the Republican candidate for the upcoming midterm their numbers are growing up as well Democrats are in trouble all across the country so maybe my observations a little bit incorrect but I'll tell you what I'm Still frustrated by those that refuse to see the light\n[noise] well yeah of course you know I I've said before you know you just have to kind of right off thirty percent of the population I mean they're just not going to get it or the rest of us do you\nOcean going yard but uh I I I can work on it yeah [laughter]\nThere you go hey we we can all go together will go to Costa Rica together or something for them All right Meg and I know that you've got a lot of

a lot of prayer um but as long as we have the truth on our side we will always win and uh what's unfortunate is the left or their their Patsy it in the press\nHave labeled an innocent man a sexual predator\nAnd he will have to carry that with him and rebuild his image a and but this is who the left is a they will search and destroy you\nUh instead of work with you because their fundamental transformation of this country and simply isn't cleats I as Brock Obama had promised us eight years ago and what that fundamental transformation means is the overthrow of capitalism and turning this country into a socialist state\nEarlier in today's broadcast RTE let you go ... James and I were talking about Kavanaugh getting confirmed and we both believe it will happen as well but we express some concern about the the possible\nSocial or civil\nAnd I made a reference than it might look like you know the day after we learned that Martin Luther king had been assassinated if in fact Kavanaugh is confirmed do you feel as\nI made a reference to that might look like you know the day after we learned that Martin Luther king had been assassinated if in fact Kavanaugh is confirmed do you feel as though there is going to be some and I don't mean you know political we know we know that's going to happen but in terms of in our inner cities do we see any unrest\n\n[noise] I don't think it's going to come from our inner cities now um I think it's going to come up from the well funded\nA violent communists left\nA that don't reside in our inner cities most of these are white kids that are taking gender justice classes at some you know Tony Ivy League university um I you know I ran into some of them actually at the women's march I mean there are wearing thousand dollar belts upbringing fancy bagels and pastries down to the protesters\nUm and so no I don't think it's going to come to our inner cities\nI but I Do think it's going to come to our streets\nIn certain areas whether that ATC or elsewhere\nOr wherever the college kids can get the mass transit passes a because that's where you normally the protests occur if you'll notice a most cities like Las Vegas since we don't have mass transit we don't have these huge protests and unrest\nBecause we don't have mass transit a Washington DC and the other cities do uh and so yeah I think there's going to be some violence\nUp but that really is to be expected\nA and until we shut down George Soros is five oh one C. three in this country or he will continue to undermine our country and our republic with violence\nYeah I think you're spot on with that begun a pleasure joy as always\nThank you so much hello to ah to Jodie and do your dad as well and we will talk to you probably some time during the week 'cause I have a few off off the record questions for you\nVery good I look forward to it and things so much will talk to you next Thursday or before\nAbsolutely megabytes everybody begging begging you luck and thank you\nBye bye so she's working on her podcast which might be a good time to ah mentioned or now that we're doing the same so there is going to be a podcast that is going to be put up probably next month or so maybe not even that long and it will be called basically I'm\nHard of America because that's the name of my pod casting company so to be a Michael ... brings you heart of America and then there's that so far with that real quick break come back with a side listen to the Michael archer right here on your position one on one of your ID\nYou don't have to agree with Michael heart you can choose to be wrong if you what do you still might go shall\nHey guys is Andrew from the line if you've ever dealt with a one real estate team you can find that it's hard to get someone that will actually\nPut into words because no one will take charge of selling your home that is why the husband and wife hope butler team are the agents to call you will have to people specifically dedicated to use\nDedicated to getting your home on the market and the top dollar or your local experts from Huntsville to Florence called do five six seven six two eighty seven fifty six and ask for your W why the professional drone video package from the whole butler T\nW Whitey welcome to the common October fest October third\nThrough this ticks join them for live music authentic German cuisine parking craft vendors the classic car show in so much more a special live performance by American Idol Brandon now there will be on friday October fifth at the comments that tall come celebrate the German heritage at Komen Alabama and see the crowning at twenty eight teams\nMiss October fest for more information is it common October fest dot com [noise]\nThose super station is coming to your home tone go to one on one W.

we're and forgot what it means to be a good people and have some kind of a tolerance for other people's rights\nBecause there was a group of people have we was in Texas that were demonstrating these young young kids were demonstrating pro Kavanaugh's statements\nOn their sons and they were greeted with an angry mob that shows nice to just really voice dissent but to actually ... salt Europe people's signs out of their hands tear them up\nAnd dumped struck pro Kavanaugh crowd stood there non violate got to their credit and but at the same point in time at some point\nHow long are we going to tolerate the left in in a way in the streets this violation of fundamental human rights by attacking people from really wearing a baseball cap they don't agree with\nA bike everywhere are great again signaling that they supported Trump or whether you supported Trump or nuts beside the point in this country hecklers veto should not apply in my actions should be greeted with scorn and yet we see politicians exploiting this\nMentality encouraging this type of violence people that should be censored whatever they do in the house or whatever they do in the center there are certain politicians they just need to be flat censored for their behavior of this cabinet case if this Kavanaugh case prevails against Kavanaugh\nAnd what will we will we will have done is rewarded mob mentality rewarded the hecklers veto rewarded as an attack that based on smearing slander and if this is rewarded by the people of America putting these people back in power that do this I mean the club butcher and\nAnd the uh the bookers of whatever the ... if that mentality is allowed to stand\nThere they're going to drag this country the less and less violence in the streets stands on challenged on accountable not people not getting arrested for being acting out violently in the streets at that stands\nThe rule of law is gone and we're headed for civil war in this country and if we don't wake up the left is going to drag us into civil war if the if the politician leaders\nDo not stand up against is if if like that and find a backbone to stand up against is what he should have

yesterday but\nSay say you're out and you decided you just going to have a little pro Kavanaugh rally you got your kids with you you go out of your outlook I just want to make it known maybe we'll get on the news I\nAm for cabinet I Do not believe in trumped up charges I Do believe that uh people can tell the Arabs or be mistaken and tell stories is that good enough so that makes some people feel better\n\nAnd you go out there and somebody is willing to attack or take the signs out of your own children's hands rip them or make a big deal act to fool basically threaten you and if you fight back\nGuess what you do get to spend a little time and the O.\nJ.\nDo you think that radical leftist ...\nNo\nThey don't care if they go spend a little time in jail they'll but they will be have

of the schools in this day both of them does anybody care who started nope does anybody care that the bully kid has been in three fights since the start of the year five or six weeks ago or whatever it is now\nNo\nIt doesn't matter so your kid doesn't get to play in the band your kid doesn't get to play\nOr football or that kid may have a quote unquote special needs they might have a behavioral disorder problem which many times I call butt whipping deficit disorder but I you know I'm not very uh I'm just not\nMerciful so it doesn't care your kid takes the brunt of it no I Know it's possible you're going to start it just like my kid could have started but we we don't try to deal with guilt we just punish across the board so what does that do that empowers\n\nThe bad folks because the bad folks know that you have more to lose you can't miss the ... you can't miss the next day at work because you ended up in jail for twenty four hours because you've got in a fight with a bunch of

we forgotten as a people we have forgotten the values that the country was founded on after so many decades of the schools being run by leftist\nEnd justifies the means\nBy any means necessary that's exactly right and they are doing it and if you I hate to boil\nIt down to the U.S but we are still in Alabama\nIf you were so own fire\nThat you have to protect the killing of unborn babies if that is one of the pillars of your belief system why am I really shocked\nThat they do not mind lying about\nBrett Kavanaugh ah I'm being serious about that\nNo you're absolutely right\nI mean we don't live so why you just destroy a conservative so what a conservative doesn't make it on the court they see this as warfare\nBecause the court is the place they have always won over the last few decades because of the makeup of the court and they know they have been legislating from the bench and they know that's how liberalism and progressive ism has taken a hold of this country that and the education system\nAnd it is an all hands on deck\nIsm has taken hold in this country that in the education system\nAnd it is an all hands on deck\nOne of them are also good for maybe possibly one more hit because I mean route and get no younger she no spring chicken\nI Know but you know she's pickled brother she lived to be a hundred and five\nYeah or inside your pickled anything to get it thanks Mitch I you ever get to see you here's the thing\nIf Canada or does it make it\nIf you get the lady what's the lady's name the um oh God it just it was right on with my thumb they very conservative lady that's who I think they're going to get next and ah she makes Kevin uh looked like I mean pretty squishy\nWell it just blows my mind that they all or dog and Kevin all for being a part of your and all that but yeah it wasn't it a couple of months ago that they said ... was to square and all of them because they had his wife go to ... you know supper\nOr whatever when he had to have a meeting with the female or whatever the which one is which wouldn't ... which one would you advise in this day in time would you advise\nYou were assigned to have a policy moral black pants\nFor more lack\nI don't know let's just pick somebody who's a leading guy on the attack against\nBooker Cory Booker right which one would would you prefer well I Know do you tell them\n... ... when I when I went out yeah and I was talking movies females and stuff yeah they had to sign a waiver before I talked to\nAbout it I don't blame you car welcome to the program\nToday so I'm economy ... so you're that Amy Barrett\nYeah if prop really wanted to make has explode he'd say fine you don't want Brett Kavanaugh andme economy ... will be on were reversing roe versus Wade and cabinet was going to be my new agency\nAnd open up their best to ... partner\n[laughter] go find out whatever you want to find out what may be funny\nThere so you know I get sure I get your to kill a mocking bird analogy I Do yes but you remember the road runner cartoon\nYes there is some of my favorites I think I had a road runner I might have been a road runner lunch box that went down\nWill yeah and you know we'll get into why they were your favorites in just a second okay there was always an elaborate overly complicated scheme and they constantly backfired on the perpetrator to his detriment right\nThat's correct now you know we have a natural affinity for the foot upon or the underdog right\nWe do yes\nEver since the election of Donald Trump\nWe have seen one road runner cartoon after another play out from the left the only thing where like in is the time we sound effects and explosion you know oh I mean this thing that we just had right here\nYou had an overly complicated scheme\nThat has backfired on the perpetrator to their detriment right\nI Hope so I Will not know that it backfires until Kavanaugh's confirmed hopefully tomorrow\nIt's not over till it's over your correct than this but I mean you know you start looking at what's happened with the polling numbers oh you know where they were talking about taking the house and maybe the Senate yeah no\nOh you know where they were talking about taking the house and maybe the Senate\nYeah no uh they have overplay their hand friendly here and they're fixing it learned what a backlash is again\nAnd it's just you know and I don't know I don't know if the reason I received this to be this way is because of Donald Trump have ramp things up and it's more obvious or\nBecause Donald Trump just does it fall into their stuff\nAnd maybe by his example you know you think that this is the way the last thought this was going to play out or do you think they were going to pay\nNo absolutely I think Booker and\nI'm trying to think maybe it was senator Coons both said something along the lines of\nLike we can't believe that this guy has not\nWithdrawing his own nomination or the White House is not throwing him overboard\nThey they are shocked and that's the beauty because hey\nJeb Bush or just about anyone else number one would not have nominated\nAs strongly conservative justices partially because they don't necessarily believe it and second\nBecause they would have tried to do the old even Reagan did the old who can I nominate that'll kind of be the kind of be good won't make people mad that's how we got Sandra Day O'Connor\nI'm going to nominate a woman not necessarily conservative woman but I'm going to nominate a woman\nAnd it's all going to be good she gets on the Supreme Court and vote starts voting liberal I'm no one realized how tough Trump or cabinet now we're going to be and that has shot them\nWell and then you got Lindsey Graham of all people rear end up on his hind legs\nOh yeah the the curse of McCain is wearing off but I think Jeff Flake must have been involved in some sort of a moody ritual and self where they removed his spine and it is it may be in a box somewhere but I'm thinking they may have put it through a wood chipper and it just does not exist anymore\nI personally think the Republicans should come up with a policy if you want to call yourself a Republican in your mail\nYeah its use them or lose them\n[laughter] so your brother [laughter] I used to have this little ... it was like a ... bag\nAnd it had\nI think the railroad ball bearings from the railroad Raj huge\nBig metal ball bearings and I would just have my my dad so in case anybody ever asked what they were born and so we just keep some extras in case any Republicans need any of these and they would have to fill it you know fill the residents in their mind some people got it so people didn't some people laughed some people acted shocked\nBut I always thought it was funny Jerry welcome to the program

on the cable networks surrounded by security\nWe we have no votes despair maybe one if I was a Republican senator\nThere should be security on me and my family and every other Republican senator at least three tomorrow because the left is insane and you cannot vote from the hospital\nThat could roll man but I'm telling you it is a dangerous time and the left is on hearing when little little

don't know what it is I thought he was trying to get a spotlight lady MSNBC or CNN have him come in and you know one of those kind of pay positions where he'll be the Republican conservative commentator on those crazy stations\nAnd um I thought he was Anglin for that\nWell here's what I Know of the twenty six times the McDonald's put up of a a nominee for a vote twenty six got confirmed okay anytime he's filed for cloture on yeah I don't I can think of one exception and that is\nIt's always gone through with the exception of the McCain vote would just go the phones in thirty three years some of them do but I mean this is it's a done deal everyone knows it's a done deal ever the media is like how are they going to vote we already know how it's going to go down it's\nThe biggest numbers the if you want to bet on this it's fifty three forty seven which is what I said a week ago\nAnd so high they say Hi can't maybe mansions a definite there he's there I mean in his state it's like thirty five points they've got about ... either is going to vote for calories or they'll go home and he's going to go home now he's not going to go home nobody's gonna throw away power and then uh Missouri they that's going to turn Republican because it is there's actually two or three states that I thought were going to go\nAnd it was going to throw away power and then uh Missouri ... that's going to turn Republican because it is there's actually two or three states that I thought were going to go Democrat that are now going to be solid Republican so I was wondering what the Democrats would do to rent it at the last minute chances of winning and they did it like every time they get so close just like in twenty sixteen\nHillary had everything taken care of\nAnd the last couple of days before the election they just totally blew it\nAnd I could not be more pleased with the Democrats I I was I knew they find a way to to to lose and not only are going to get this guy we're probably going to take more seats in the Senate we might even keep the house\nAnd so this might turn out to be the biggest blessing in disguise because anyone that watch the testimony of Cavanaugh I mean there's no way you can really watch that I think that this guy did it so\nI I think this is a good thing it's really expose the Democrats are who they are and I think it's neither party in a way that nothing else good so Feinstein did what nobody else in the ... good and that's unite\nThe disparate parts of the party just like you're eating earlier Brad Stevens I mean I couldn't be more never Trump and in fact I was going to work out off we we've got this thing locked up\nWell I Hope so and there's so many things that what you said that I Want a touchstone there's an

Adam welcome to show\nThank you for listening\nI think you got to think of one um when they carry called in yesterday I was just wondering why you didn't read them and say hey\nWhat is it that you can conclusively prove that you have an awful lot about 'em because we can conclusively prove\nOf what a doctor for there's a lot about but nothing has ever been brought to the table that judge Kavanaugh if I thought about anything into why is that people like anger Kerry and brand in and and you know and and the list goes on why is it that these these black man and he's black women\nVote consistently for Democrats win at the Democratic party\nSupported founding founder was the one who said we need to kill all all the black I mean it's the most racist but that just I only want there to stay in our way\nOh I've got I've got answers are both Adam Nike's one is I was so what about why didn't rub of inquest into what his cabinet all about\nI was too busy I'm accepting or taking my victory lap for what you what you have some way leads to the left who decided that both parties are guilty we're making progress so I just take my wins and joke him up and put put a W owned the chalk board and move on\nAnd the and keep making progress we're making progress the second one is it is a\nIs really a terrible thing that goes on in\nThe black community across America because what\nPeople are told is they're just told that if you remembered Alabama when the Republicans were going to take over the ...\nBecause what\nPeople are told is they're just hold ... if you remembered Alabama when the Republicans were going to take over the Alabama Legislature a black state senator\nWas doing robo calls in South Alabama that said if the Republicans got in charge slavery was going to be re instituted in the state I'm not making that up it is an absolute fact slavery was going to be back now\nOf course that probably scared someone who does not keep up with anything but it's always\nUm you're you're you're no longer going to get this you're no longer going to get that and the Democrats have created a situation where people are dependent on the government poorer schools oh poor opportunities so it is a a a delicate balance there\nWhere Republicans are saying we've got to get rid of\nAll these problems we've got to get rid of poor schools in the inner city we've got to make sure people are getting education is we want to push people towards\nTowards jobs towards employment and the Democrats are always out there saying if you if you let the Republicans when it's going to be bad for you is going to be bad for you they never can really prove where that's happened\nBut it but it's a tough thing and there's a lot of pressure I don't necessarily understand it but there's a lot of pressure and the black community to convince continue to vote Democrat regardless of what the facts are\nIt's always this fear that something may happen any comment on that\nYeah but if you look at some recent polling a Trump's actually made some pretty good ... ah inroads not primarily among African American men he hasn't really made among African American women but he is he's really gone up in those polls and I think one of the ... the one and twenty six teams because the turnout numbers for Hillary were so low among African Americans\nNow a lot of them weren't going to go out and vote for him but they didn't like Hillary enough they sat and it's not worth it so\nI Do think that Trump is one of the few Republican politicians that has the ability to end is making inroads in that community\nBut you know it's it's just been such a democratic stronghold for so long that you really would take generations to make any dent in it but\nWe have what's under four percent unemployment and the economy's doing so well at some point people are gonna look at numbers and just say hey this is working and maybe I don't like this party or what this guy represents but it is working as far as my economic opportunity and my community is doing better so I think long term that's going to be good for the Republican Party well hope\nSo that the other thing I think that's happened and I've tried to do this year after being you know drug through the mud having the press and attorneys for people and stuff say oh you know racism racism racist this racist that Trump has done a very good job of doing something that most Republicans on the national level and I guess on every level\nHave been afraid to do when\nSomeone comes out and says that Donald Trump as a racist or he's done this because he's a racist\nHe just bull bull through it and can and says that's just a bunch of who we\nAnd continues to reach out to the black community the Hispanic community reaches out and you just said look I'm doing this for everybody we're all Americans that's the law I'm not a racist you know and he probably doesn't say that 'cause then there would be the clip of it but he just bull through and I think he is beginning to win people over\nBecause he just he never towers down he never backs up he just keeps zone\nBeing Trump no ... wait a minute you keep saying that he's going to do all these things were two years into it whereas it he's the president of events\nTrump no and the broad wait a minute you keep saying that he's going to do all these things were two years into it where is it he's the president eventually people of every community are going to say wait a minute but none of this stuff happened maybe out of you know you've just got sick\nWhile I think that's why we have actual chance in the midterms to preserve the the house and now we're definitely going to pick up seats in the Senate for sure\nWe might even keep the house and if we do I think that's going to be a very good place for the Republican Party and we'll get major legislation through because winning a midterm election is ... is unheard of in that environment you got to go to Dale Dale welcome to the program thank you for listening\nHi Dale [noise] hey what's going to ah\nAh well they were talking about a Democrat or Republican and watch our child can about Yes sir\nI mean by like she she's showing that changed ... ... when the oil fire it was sad I've been asked to\nBig day for the first time since Donald Trump enter the political ...\nAre ... yes I find myself grateful that he's in\nI'm reluctant to admitted and astonished to say it especially since the president mocked Christine Blasey Ford and his ugly and grew to it this way at a rally on Tuesday perhaps is worth unpacking this admission for those who might be equally astonished to read it now let's stop right there\nWe played on the show yesterday Trump at the rally and Mississippi which has been headline after headline Trump mocks Dr Ford\nHey he did and he just stayed at the facts he stated them\nHow bad is it when you say what someone said\nExactly as you said it he said it exactly I guess you'd call it mocking yeah that means you've said something wrong or dumb\nOr inaccurate however you want to say\nI mean it sounds like he's mocking because what she said was so ridiculous I don't know what year happened where it happened and now that people are named set I was even they're always mocking or something I mean look if you can't produce a single fact you're marking yourself\nAnd the people that are saying this is a credible courageous person I mean just I mean get over it or any ... president\nViciously ferociously that's a better word ferociously defends\nKavanaugh and his family and the treatment that they have gotten and points out that people\nThat people are evil and they want to destroy others all that's accurate data that should've been the story\nOf Korea bookkeeping Booker for any of this stuff even happens said that anyone to vote for Kavanaugh is on the side of darkness and evil and it was like lord of the rings that solve their tickets a statement was well\nYeah we should all go watch word of the rings or um [noise] the lion the witch and the wardrobe yeah and when the evil bumps come the ... or whatever which one of them which group looks like the rallies that are going on and washing the anti cabinet\nRallies or on Schumer is sore on like lord of the ring the is the dark lord but he's not as intelligence\nLet's go to the phones real quick and see what people want to say here let's take them in order ac welcome to the program\nHey say hello I say All right\nI see does not want to talk I put him on hold to check with him John welcome to the program thank you for listening\nI don't have John either\nOr you say hey hey John ... came alive John welcome to the program thank you for listening\nMayor Goode is a scout out for each show very much like Mr rate for a minute yes are you might get written large\nSeveral times and you might again just a few minutes ago that Mr\nJones was fine so can you call\nAny body of a fellow that is for abortions offered a job well last night before the baby boy I'd like to ask you that question I'd like to have an answer\nGive John yeah or just because people believe different things doesn't mean that they're evil so and you're also if you're trying to win people over that are pro choice by if you're going to call them evil you're not gonna when somebody over so it's just not an effective tactic nor is it showing their\nSide respect I completely agree that you know a on as far as the unborn human life I mean I can answer that really just doesn't like to call people evil yeah no I don't [laughter]\nI mean with the exception of Cory Booker Kamala Harris those two people I actually think are they going to\nThere isn't really just doesn't like the ... yeah no I don't [laughter] I mean with the exception of Cory Booker Kamala Harris those two people I actually think are they going over the line I call him or you will all day long\nLast night we got a big day to do that will be able to see how you see you there\nI can you hear that\nI can buddy ... appreciate you listening to the program\nOkay it's a good program day like I just wanted to let you blame storming I\nThink you know Dr food if that's a real name and she does have a degree in psychology or close to their father and her brother worked for the CIA and that she trains or\nSome of the people in the CIA or a you know in in a a specialized interrogation techniques\nYou know lack of a you know a a\n... what does all kinds of things that are used by the military case why are some people say that captured in Russia or somewhere that she trains they react and even to the point that they can they can maintain their heart constant\nOr most people if you ask a question\nAre the heart rate will change and so she is a very specialized person but she came on that question and answer period\nAnd pretended to be kind of a person that but that was that was you know just to put out the minimum amount of information but just enough to a judge Kavanaugh in trouble\nWell they were actually I say I appreciate you know we've we've talked about some of that stuff and you make good points let me ask you about this Chris if it tells you mean thing her attorney\nThe or the Mayo attorney that was sitting to her left or right on the TV screens um wrote a letter to chairman Grassley which I thought this was give away we don't want to take get your opinion\nGrassley is reminding them hey hook the committed the Senate committee\nDoes not have your polygraph test results\nAnd does not have your therapist notes we need all that information\nAnd he's like no we'll give it to you after the FBI interviews are caught now my feeling is if you're seeking the truth and your client is honest and\nYou're only goal apparently is to keep cabin off the court you give them what you got\nAnd I say after they can from him interviewer goes then let's actually see I honestly after all this is over I really hope the FBI looks into this because here's what they'll find they're gonna find perjury they're gonna find coordination among leftist groups to commit perjury they're going to find that the allegations that he's credible witnesses were were faults\nKnowingly faults and I actually think they should start prosecuting people for it because if you're going to make these wild claims which is a legal you cannot you cannot accuse somewhat of a film the you know they didn't commit that is a crime\nAnd then not have the consequences is never going to stop so let's go I'm I'm all for an FBI investigation let's let's make
