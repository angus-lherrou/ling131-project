{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WYDE", "content": "W windy up and go W windy here in Birmingham\nW two three Seventy gay Birmingham W. B. J. C. H. B. to Birmingham\nAnd\nImagine having lived your whole life total dark and the one day someone yields your eyes all of a sudden you can see how would you respond today I'm troops for like weekend Alice ... describes the proper response\nYou can see how would you respond today on truth for life weekend Alister beg describes the proper response to being healed from spiritual blindness it's part of our series called a light in the dark as\nObserves in their response of the men and our staff to hear\nThe men answered\nHe says the man's chain of reasoning is pretty good for someone who's been a bad or all his life\nAnd presumably a stranger to academic and forensic argument this man is not in any doubt are tall as to what is taking place for him\nAnd so look at how we answers inverse therapy I'll paraphrase it for him\nHe what he says and then if I find this truly remarkable you were on belief\nIn face of the evidence\nIs more of a miracle than my cure\nThat you don't believe in light of the evidence is more remarkable to me than the fact that I can actually see because there is a basis for my being able to see namely an encounter with Jesus and you have seen what Jesus has done\nAnd you refused to set your eyes tell you that it's more remarkable he says then the fact that I Am now seeing individual\nAnd he jumps on the back of that and he uses their same form of argumentation pointing out we know that God doesn't listen to centers I don't I doubt on settle you if you are aware of the five and you don't know God and you're aware of\nYour sin I sound sixty six and a verse Eighteen if\nI had cherished sin in my heart the lord would not have listened the virus does not say if I had sin in my heart God wouldn't hear me know if I had cherished sin in my heart if I was committed to mice and then God wouldn't listen to me\nHe says we know that it's through God does not listen to the independent and he hears the cries of the ... but he does not listen to those who are willful in their own belief and in their sin\nSecondly he does listen to the godly man who does his will\nKind of Matthew six therapy three\nStatement seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things will be added on to you God does not listen to the cries of the ... but he doesn't listen to the cries of those who do his will\nThirdly he says\nNo one has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind if this men were not from God\nHe couldn't do anything\nKnew that was the case because they even in a miraculous events that we have in the Old Testament there is no record of any man opening the eyes of a man born blind\nAnd so with a simple logic and yet with a compelling logic\nThe men beats them their own game turns the tables on them and said you know you're the ones who will be starting off with a premise we know this therefore that we know this and therefore that he says let's do the same thing we know that God does not listen to the cries of they invented it\nWe know that there is no record of ever anybody having a man\nThe same thing we know that God does not listen to the cries of the and benefit\nWe know that there is no record of ever anybody having a man open a man's eyes therefore he says conclusion the action if this man we're not throwing God he couldn't do nothing\nLet's pause for just a moment because there's a lesson here for each of us in speaking to people concerning faith in Jesus Christ\nWe may think that the high point in John chapter nine is arguably the twenty five when he says I don't know about what you know but I Do know what I Know and that is I Know that I was once Blinder now I can see I Know my experience I Know what happened to me and our friends walk away from it and say idiot\nBecause they wouldn't be able to say that they've had experiences of different things in different places and so on\nWell then what are we going to do at that point you see well this man is convinced of his testimony but when push comes to shove under challenge reaches for him he is able to step up and say well let's just think about this for a moment and why don't we think about this today\nAnd have you considered that and do you agree that this this and this leads to the doctor and so his faith was resting in the experience of what Christ had done for him to this point\nAnd he was absolutely without any doubt concerning it\nBut that wasn't the beginning in the end of his argument\nNow what we discovered is that they feel the sting of this the stinging impact of truth hits them\nAnd inverse therapy for and they do the only thing they've got left to do and that is they throw him out\nBut you will notice they don't throw him out until they have given their own answer to the question with which the chapter began how did the chapter begin well remember with a disciples asking Jesus who send this man or his parents that he was born blind\nThe ... say well you know the answer to that question the reason you were blind is because you were steeped in sin at birth\nYou are a miserable center that's where you are\nHow dare you lecture us don't you realize that we've gone to school for this\nDo you understand that we have the legacy the historical background of Judaism on our side and use some upstart beggar from the streets here think strict come in and confront us\nTo see how how the challenge of truth gets under the skin of those who knows they don't know the very truth\nThey are encountering\nWe are not to be surprised when our friends and neighbors wound up eventually just throw out\nFrankly we ought to get thrown out a lot more than we do many of us and the reason we are not throwing out the reason would accept it may be because we are more represented by the fear of the parents than we are represented in the face of the main ones blind\nWe're ready to watch the questions well I don't know about that oh I'm not so sure about that well maybe you could ask someone else about that law and have the courage of your convictions\nHow dare you lecture us You're gone\nAnd they threw him out\nLet's just pause for a moment and think about this man\nWhen I was born in the story I I I just\nAnd they threw him out\nNow let's just pause for a moment and think about this man\nWhen I was born in the story I I I just sat for a fair while\nWhat incredible few hours or a couple of days however long has recorded here it was in the life of this man\nThat's not an invented story this isn't historical narrative\nThis is an encounter with Jesus there is one of the science that has been placed in the gospels so that as a result of seeing the sign men and women might believe that Jesus was a crisis son of God and then I Believe and they might have life and his name so this man stands as assigned to its\nOf what it means to be spiritually blind and how we need Jesus to make us see in the same way that he needed Jesus to restore his physical side\nWhat it means for him\nHe must have awake and do a fairly normal day I Would imagine a routine for him would either to be led or to go buy his routine path\nTo his place of begging and there he would sit\nAccepting the essential in screwed to the let's see all of existence in other words the mystery of life itself accepting the on answered questions factor headset thing they inscribed ability of existence itself is surely preferable to its opposite\nI kept pitch relating to the tyranny of intransigence on belief he says I think I'm In a better position saying I don't know that if I'm In the position of saying I've flat out\nDon't believe and I don't want to know he said I think this is the bachelor the ... and I think he's right don't you know when he closes and if I remain in the dark about our purpose here and the meaning of eternity I have\nNone of the lesser ride and an understanding of a few more modest roots\nMost of us feared that\nMost of our year end to comprehend how we got here and fly\nWhich is to say most of our eyes ache to know the love of our creator and we will no doubt field at eight most of us for as long as we happen\nTo be alive I tell ya\nIf I asked if he put his telephone number just right underneath that I had to call them yesterday afternoon sitting on my back patio and say hey John\nI Love your book\nYou know breaking my heart with the end\nYou're killing me with your and\nHave you ever considered this\nDid you know that Jesus John handmade blind men see\nDo you never mind the person next to you do you\nEven as you sit here\nCry out to him Lord Jesus

let your kingdom come\nIn this program you joined before is cold motions whispered I Want us to sure devotion for the best selling ... of all time morning and evening by Charles happens purging ... will be reading it for us\nAnd that's coming up in just a moment as I read the gospels Matthew there's one phrase the jumps up one phrase that Jesus Says over and over again that phrase is the king ... gone\nJust in this first gospel alone they're fifty poor references to the kingdom of God was obviously the main subject on the heart of Jesus and this was what he wants to talk to us about the kingdom of God he wants to know that he's coming ushered in God's king\nHe wants us to realize that there's been a regime change cosmic\nRegime change the world through history there have been more regime change is that you can even count with the things change the more they seem\nTo stay the same we've seen in Egypt high hopes up to the protests\nThings change the more they seem to stay the same we've seen it in Egypt high hopes after the protests several years ago about bringing down the Mubarak regime but since then there have been even more regime\nThe more things change the more they seem to be the same but when Jesus was on that hillside above the northwest corner of the sea of galley announcing the kingdom of God\nHe's telling us that there's finally are real change all through the gospels Matthew Jesus announces the very good news that there's been a real lasting regime change in the world not only is the old regime coming down the new regime is being raised up\nThe old regime as described in the Bible is the world a world that's in rebellion against its make her the new regime is the kingdom of God it was established to the death and resurrection and dissension of Jesus Christ\nBecause of what Jesus did we can know for sure that God's kingdom has come in his will will be done on earth as it is in heaven everything is really going to change when lord when is that going to happen\nJesus tells us it's going to happen when he returns and he tells us it's happening right now the kingdom of God is in your minutes Jesus said\nIt's within you receive it it'll come to you it'll recreate you what Jesus is saying\nIs meant to force us to choose sites which kingdom will you live by which regime will use or you can serve both you can't serve the old\nAnd play by its rules and still be part of the new the kingdom of God that's white Jesus Says repent for the kingdom of God is near Jesus is searching our hearts\nDo you believe a new regime is at hand if you do if you believe a cataclysmic change is coming and in fact has already come\nAnd you're going to repent of being part of this world's anti God rebellion you're going to submit with joy to the new king on the throne\nYou're going to want to be a part of his kingdom to enjoy the glory of its blessings their unimaginable blessings for those who enter the kingdom of God blessing that make the blessings of this world pale by comparison\nLord how can we get in on those blessings I think Jesus loves it when we finally ask the right question and I think this is the right question how can I be part of your kingdom\nHow can I receive your blessings\nIt's the right question because it's the first question Jesus answers in the sermon of the mountain Matthew fine who will receive the blessing of being part of your new regime Lord Jesus that's the question\nAnd the old regime money can buy a lot of blessings Caesar represented the regime of the world and his picture was even stamped on his money\nMoney makes the world go round material possessions power prestige those are some of the blessings that money can buy that Jesus Says this whole regime is on its way out the kingdom of God is at hand you can't serve both got and money\nIn first John to Fifteen through Seventeen there's a similar warning do not love the world or anything in the world if anyone loves the world love for the father is not in them\nFor everything in the world the less as a flush the less to the eyes and the pride of life comes not from the ... but from the world\nBut in them for everything in the world the\nLess to the flash the less to the eyes and the pride of life comes not from the ... but from the world\nThe world and its desires pass away but whoever does the will of God lives forever\nDon't love the kingdom of this world love the kingdom of God\nTo be included in his king\nIs in internal blessing beyond comprehension to be brought in and seated at the table with the king at his table in his kingdom to share his inheritance it's the ultimate blessing material blessings the blessings from this world are less than nothing by comparison\nThe question is who gets the blessing of being part of God's kingdom\nAnd Jesus has the answer and it gives it head on and Matthew five three through eleven you've heard this before bless it out of the poor and spirit for theirs is the kingdom of God Bless that are those who mourn for they will be comforted blessed that or to make sure they will inherit the earth\nBlessed that are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they will be filled\nBlessed that are the merciful for they will be shown mercy blessed that are the pure Hartford they will see God Bless it or the peacemakers\nFor they will be called children of God Bless it are those who are persecuted because of righteousness for there's just the kingdom of heaven molested argue when people insult to persecute shoot and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me\nDo you notice in the first for these blessings statements Jesus is describing the kind of people who will inherit the kingdom poor spirit great need not those who are spiritually arrogant but those who know they deserve nothing there sinners\nMolested or those who mourn for their sin molested or the me too humble themselves in the presence of God and no they have no right to demand anything and blessed that are those who hunger and thirst for the righteousness they don't have an themselves\nThe kingdom's been prepared for these kinds of people you and me and the door to the kingdom is the cross the cross of Jesus his death for centers is the door to the kingdom\nThe people who get in the kingdom are those who see it across as the best use they've ever received\nThey receive the redeeming death of Jesus with a joyful heart and accept all the mercy of has to offer because they know their need is so great the first four blessings or simply for those who know how to eat in the hour the doors been flung wide open but across\nAnd they are free to enter the kingdom of God by the mercy of God\nBut in his next three blessings Jesus is describing the character change that happens to those winter God's kingdom by God's Grace they will be merciful\nThey will be fewer and heart and what we're going to hear from ... in a moment they will be peacemakers again the key to understanding this is the cross this is the kind of changed the cross creates in the citizens of God's new regime\nThose who've received great mercy become or civil they show mercy Nancy\nGood friend who runs havens prayer ministry was telling my wife and me recently about something she just realized Jesus not only spreads the table but for us in the presence of our enemies he tells us to invite our enemies to dinner\nWhat makes a person like that where they treat their enemies as friends and reach out to them and invite them to dinner\nEnemies to dinner what makes a person like that\nWhere they treat their enemies as friends and reach out to them and invite them to dinner what purify their hearts and makes the peacemakers one more time it's the cross it's understanding what Jesus has done for us She's predator table but for us we weren't as enemies\nBut he invited us to sit at this table\nAnd he's made peace with us by his blood\nIn other words the cross as not only the door to the kingdom it's also what shapes the character of the citizens of his kingdom it's meant to do a mighty working us that will change the way we live\nIn one of his devotion that morning and evening Charles spiritual flushes out this idea he talks about gospel shaped people people who are pure and heart who live in the world as peacemakers\nMuch Seventeen\nLess that do the peacemakers\nFor they will be called the sons of God Matthew five nine this is the seventh ... the attitudes\n\nW ...

vitamin D back in your body you're most likely taking the wrong type or the wrong form of vitamin D the wrong way and maybe not even getting enough of it\nAnd Dr biggest while we started here by talking about you know why is this deficiency such an epidemic despite all the awareness and the products that you see on the store shelves containing vitamin D\nBoy that's a good point Seventy percent of us in this country are deficient in vitamin D the fact is is that your body needs vitamin D this is a hormone that should be there and it's not there\nAnd the statistics show that back in the seventies when we started getting cable networks and of course with the Internet and we're not going outside and most of us get no vitamin D from that what\nMakes your fast smelled the three formula a much better choice\nOh Chris first of all I put five thousand units of vitamin D three per serving in each tablet can actually feel the different second\nI use the right type of vitamin D

three seven four nine five\nSo how 'bout folks me what it really comes down to here as we're not getting the right form or enough\nVitamin D delivered the right way which is why we have so many of these health concerns that you probably can't put your finger on and Dr biggest I Want to start just recapping here that there are a couple of different forms of vitamin D and maybe explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf de formulas is different from what you put together here\nWell there's vitamin D too and there's vitamin D three and the two is the type of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body still has to be converted into vitamin D three vitamin these three is the activated form\nSo it's ready to go to work now the vitamin D three that I use my formula I think it's the best because I've seen the best results\nWith myself and my family with my patients plus I've worked with a lab where the people in the lab of taken this and they they test their blood every day to see how the deal is going and going up and out through the rough where it should be\nWhile so Dr biggest I mean who should consider taking your fast melts might have been the formula\nWell I Would definitely start with kids short development and the unity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong men men and women in their thirties you're talking about higher health immunity\nCardiovascular problems start to turn on but it's also the child rearing years and vitamin D for pregnant women is very very important ...\nPeople in their forties [laughter] that's the way you know you start to more of those aches and pains like you've never felt before you think you're getting older and again it's important for your hormones and to keep yourself physically active\nAnd of course when you're in your fifties you'd start feeling sick or you can't golf he can't play tennis you know you start becoming aware of your body and not functioning ...\nAnd then people over ... the I just wish that every senior citizen would go on his formula\nImagine living in your senior years where you have confidence in your balance and you're you're able to have the energy to get things done and I May of clarity you know this is more and more important as we go along because people are living longer but the quality of life is not

Democrat I think are going to make a play for that now what what does that mean in the long term I guess that that's that's another discussion for a different day but I I really wonder you when you talk to these Democrat act or some of these like I said democratic staffers for these people have been democratic politics long time\nThey were really worried about that scenario that\nYou know my job with a national policy for instance what happens you know I was thinking she was going to be speaker of the house again and you know that comes with a better position for me but now looking at this election is not so certain\nSo or you know I I I think that there's that element of doubt within the Democratic establishment it kinda says what you need to know about where the selection is right\nNow well I I don't you think though the problem with those Democrats that are currently in power and have been for a while it's not that they've stayed in one place and they they kept the same tone around all that they've moved further and further left\nWhat's going to be the effective if you bring in people like court has an and yellow and in in the like and they're even further left and who's in there having them being a moving further to the lab has that been their downfall yeah\nWhat was that was always sort of similar\nI was always I I thought a just a a straight a voter enthusiasm play that's where you you get the excitement that's where you get you know the sort of these antics you see in Portland, Oregon and and really you gin up the base legion up the base and you know obviously those are the effects\nBut at what point does it become do the you know the sort of a law of diminishing returns and start it becomes kind of a ... starts to a rodeo your own you know you're standing in the Democratic party if you find out that based too much\nThat's why it's happening here Democrats really probably weren't counting on this they thought they could keep their crazies in check they always have they have kept their they've kept their activist wing and check probably since the since the sixties I mean if you look at it if you think about it [noise]\nThey've been able to kind of nominate their guy the the the establishment guy but now you have that now you have\nFor better you know just lack of a better phrase it's the inmate's run any asylum and that's where you had any scenario so push further to the left\nI think they're kind of getting out of touch with the American people yet they they are the loudest voices in the room and that tends to me what dominates in these primary scenarios and you know and when would that that's your grass roots and that's the direction they needed to go to keep their voters engaged I think\nWell uh it just ... I don't I don't see how in the world that would work out for them it's been the way we see things trendy now I saw a few research polls earlier today that we're talking about self identified union members that they're just as likely to vote Republican\nOr as they are Democrat and and that demographic has been won't sign up for a while and it's because the unions you know they they tell their members who to vote for and it's always been Democrat if that's shifting what does that tell you yeah\nAnd I think the Democratic party what used to be sort of more of a blue collar\nWho to vote for and it's always been Democrat if that's shifting what does that tell you\nYeah and I think the Democratic party what used to be sort of more of a blue collar national party is becoming a coastal party it it may be still be blue collar in the sense that\nThe the blue collar types of California and New York in New England and in a lot of the many clinic they they will vote Democrat that's kind of want the identity of the party is\nBut you can't be a national party if you're just the coast and I think you know in our system in our democracy where you have an electoral college representative democracy we have house it's a set of seats in house districts and things like that it doesn't lend itself to adjust to a mass\nOf the popular vote element that's to me wherever the Democrat Party has got to really think about this that that they're not appealing to the blue collar union vote or that they're not appealing to the you know even though the farm states in any sort of way\nOr any meaningful sense there are for the big numbers are going for the big cities and I\nYou know I told the inevitably that may prove to be you know successful but for the time me and just the way populations distributed throughout all fifty states I I don't think that's a winning strategy and they need to address that\nYeah they've they've most certainly laughter the um the the blue collar Democrats and the blue collar Democrats states in the dust and and they finally picked up on that to where it used to be and this is just judging from the the the reaction I get from people I talked to is\nWe've always voted Democrat so that's just what we'll do any and all the way back in the sixties in the seventies it was like well the Democrats are for the working man or the Republicans are for the rich and wealthy and you still hear people say that today but they're realizing that that's actually not the case and the two parties\nHave switched in a sense on their messaging and who they're supposedly looking out for\nYeah and I would add this element to it I think the Democratic party over the last twenty Thirty years is really relied on the minority vote to carry the day\nThat's been sort of their bread and butter but when we found out in these last few elections particularly into twenty sixteen presidential election where they were all relying on African American vote to carry Pennsylvania to carry Michigan you know the city of Detroit Pittsburgh Philadelphia places like that\nJust are coming out the vote like they are like that wants to have had it I I what I think is going on there is that they they take that for granted I mean you know it is it's become kind of a political talking point today like to take the black vote for granted that ended up the Democratic party that is but I think it's true that\nThink the the get out the vote effort surely there I think it gets more\nGoing to win this district we don't really have to put resources and making sure we get to vote out or if they do it's as some kind of token gesture just to uh to show that they're there now for the struggle but I I\nThink you really need boots on the ground\nAnd the Democratic party just isn't doing that anymore they're they're they're they're taking it for granted and you know it ... that was a mistake you're twenty sixteen I think it's something that the we we ought to look at it for his first twenty Eighteen goes especially with some of this falling and and the way it's related\nAt some of these things because you may wake up on a November seventh and ... and some of those places that were supposed to go Democrat\nAnd the most just were there and people that come out the vote like they were supposed to\nYeah matter that would be an ugly picture for Democrats won one quick thing on the on the front of October surprises I saw a report and I can't tell you who was from Washington Post or whoever\nAh that mall are expected to release his findings not necessarily\nI saw a report and I can't tell you who was from Washington Post or whoever\nOr that mall are expected to release his findings not necessarily publicly but releases findings or what have you got so far\nBut the report was saying then it may be coming after the the midterms which would eliminate that being an October surprise right\nYeah so that's the idea now my fear is that just give it the people that are working for more right now and we know the politics of it what if what if the elites you know\n... at the eleventh hour or so the leaks and it really kind of throws a rich and what we think is going to happen that that would be one fear there's also the the the crazy possibility that they got something up to the Democrats and it's got something obviously they're going to play against Republicans\nWe're sitting here on October seventeenth us we're pretty late in the game for an October surprise and maybe that's what happened I'd say about it at least by the early part of next week is probably too late to really impact the electric is a big way\nNationally there may be something in some more corporations they could do that ... that would would change things in a way that would preclude Alabama from that but I\nI I don't think it's going to matter I think right now for a national sort of Mark Foley situation or or any of that\nAccess Hollywood tape or something like that we're we're we're probably ruin who are pushing the limits on that\nRight ah well speaking of Alabama or an October surprise is there is this whole ivy manic thing or are within the I've I'd be ... realm that they're trying to pin this Hillary Clinton ask\nHealth problem type thing on Kay Ivey that's the route that there are allegedly taking and saw a W. V. T. M. again in a question with Kay Ivey asking her about it and I obviously she like there's nothing to do that and it's absolutely ridiculous what are you seeing on that\nYeah it and you just consider or the started it started with Bill Brits Alabama political reporter which is kind of a go to plays for our democratic opposition research I think that's the story you start out that that's the first red flag with this but it didn't work for those guys that ran against turned a primary in fact it made her look\nSomewhat you know more of a victim and any any kind of a cat a\nCause a lot of people to sour on a on you know the Scott Dawson ah Tommy\nBattle and a bill Hightower so I I think it it just it it ... it bolsters IVs position I think if they try to do that and she plays it correctly ... I'll say this\nI had been probably to half a dozen Kay Ivey rallies in the state in the last two three weeks she doesn't seem to show like signs of this this deterioration that where your ear and about I don't know\nWhere they take this to she had some kind of a mini stroke two years ago it was a hospital do you think the people of Alabama I think well even if she did or three years ago I guess it is now that\nThat she could not have recovered it it'd be fully healed from that and be is a a capable governor ours ... maybe the Carter tried to play is that she tried to cover it up so we're ... must be more fire I I don't know I don't think it's going to work I don't think this is the last\nNo doubt about it Well Jeff we appreciate you as always I'll keep in touch buddy and we will do it again next Wednesday I'm Anthony Shadid me on there you go you may and Jeff for from yellow hammer news from Breitbart you can check 'em out if both of those ...\nAnd uh get all the stuff you can really here's what you do if you just want to reject for stuff you just Google Jeff poured Breitbart or ... or yelling and all this stuff comes up just pour central\nIs our number two coming up next Andrew big day P.

how they do the work\nI asked them how to test the capacitor how to clean a blower wheel and sure enough this guy was giving me pretty good explanations he missed one maybe two little steps but nothing a little training couldn't fix right\nNow at some point in every interview I Try to compare our moral compasses so sometimes I gotta get a little sneaky okay so here's the seventh question I asked him\nI lean in and I said how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need\nDid you hear that folks how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need now brace yourself folks because without hesitation he said I don't have a problem with it at all I don't\nHave a problem with it at all and the reality\nIs that he had been around and worked for enough other

offering you a job but I think you for coming in then I interview another guy same questions he's doing a pretty good job and when I lean in and ask him my little trick question how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need\nThis guy did hesitate to kind of dropped his head and then he looked back up and then he looked back down and then he said I can do it and if I'm being honest I have done it\nThe company that I worked for required that I bring back a certain dollar amount on every single call that I went on sometimes they didn't need anything but if I didn't sell them anything I was going to lose my job and man I got kids defeat\nBut then I got to thinking am I setting the right kind of example for my kids so I had to quit and now I'm unemployed and the market is flooded with heating and air conditioning technicians and it's been hard to get a job\nThat's an example of the type of competitors we have out there guys I told stories in interviews about heating and air conditioning companies training there technicians to jump wires on two thousand dollar compressors to sell new systems\nLike crossing wires over to break them and there are hundreds of heating

the department of energy they've done studies that have concluded that the average duck system in a U.S household\nLeaks twenty to twenty five percent of the era that travels through it\nOkay so there's two different kinds of duck luggage first there's supply leakage that's on the side of your furnace or air conditioner that blows the cold or warm air out at ya\nSo eight twenty to twenty five percent loss means that twenty to twenty five percent of the air that has created at your machine that's blowing toward your bedroom or your kitchen or your family room is lost on the way\nThat's like fives intends and twenties just floating up out of your dog work flipping through the tracks\nThen there's the other kinds of leakage return leakage now this is a little more serious because our returns sometimes go unnoticed because we don't ever feel them doing anything that's because the returns don't blow air out they suck air in\nWell returns are the worst leakers instead of blowing cooled air out or heated air out into your attic or you crawl space like supplies do\nReturns suck addict or basement or crawl space air in to your system and then blow it into your house and also pressure rises your house in a way that you don't want your house to be pressurized okay you're pulling contaminants\nWell what's the first thing wrong with that other than sucking Erin from those areas how about the fact that if you're a doctor works in the attic\nTemperatures can easily reach a hundred and thirty degrees sucking in a hundred and thirty degree air into your cooling system is like running your air conditioner your heat pump with all your doors and windows open\nYou want to know what else is bad about sucking an addict recall space air well in the attic and sometimes in cross race as to how about the fact that it's got all of that fiberglass insulation and it just take yourself a bright flash light up there in the middle of night sometime okay you'll see what I'm Talking about\nIt gets sucked into your returns and circulates through your heating and air conditioning system some of it lands on your coil and it gets you coil all clogged up and then when you're

I'm going to start your tune up now if you wanna watch that's fine and if not that's okay too and then he'll start the tuna\nNow his very first task is to take the top off of the outdoor air conditioning unit or heat pump\nNexus to get the leaves and sticks and mocking debris out of the system because all that stuff holds water and rushed out the bottom of your air conditioner prematurely\nNext thing you know your compressors falling through the bottom of a unit and you've got to get in the new one okay so something as simple as getting the debris out of the bottom makes a huge difference\nNow the next step in my opinion is the best we're going to use a semi high pressure nozzle to spray down your ... from the inside out because we've got the top off\nNow this is on your outdoor air conditioning unit right and it sucks air in from the sides and along with it\nGrass clippings and dust and whatnot so we're going to back flush it wash all that gunk back out of there and if you've got all that stuff stuck in your air conditioning system it's just like having a sweater on that baby now listeners if you were\nI we're going to go for a jog hot summer's day with a sweater on and destroying our mouth what would happen right our bodies wouldn't be able to release the heat and we'd get really really hot well\nThe same thing happens to your outdoor unit your air conditioner your heat pump if it's dirty it's going to overheat it's going to cause problems you're going to have a compressor fail you're going to have motors fail\nThe number one cause of compressor failure is dirty coils so we're going to get the outdoor coils cleaned up for you\nSometimes we even have to use a foaming cleanser to get all that stuff off and men is that a sight to see you're looking at a good forty five minutes just up to this point so you can see why I say these other maintenance is our drive by maintenance is right if they're there and gone and forty five minutes\nNext we're going to test the electrical components in your system all the connections make sure they're nice in tight make sure you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires because sometimes little things that go wrong with your air conditioning system and furnish\nIt can cause big things to go wrong All right\nYou may have a pending compressor failure because you've got a little started it's about to go bad\nYou may have a pending motor failure because you're filters all plugged up and you're not paying attention to it All right so we're going to check all of those little components every part of your system that don't cost that much at all to repair or replace\nNext we're going to check your indoor heating system or from is\nWe'll check the burners your pressure switches make sure your exhaust is venting out properly that would be important right we'll check all your hoses your drains your flame sensor\nAnd most importantly we're going to check your heat exchange or that's the part that is known to crack and leak carbon monoxide that we all know\nWe're ... we're going to check your heat exchange or that's the part that is known to crack and leak carbon monoxide\nThat we all know that carbon monoxide can kill you but did you know that the majority of people that survive a one time carbon monoxide poisoning event have life long side effects\nDo you see now why I say that you have to have these two naps and inspections every six months you don't really have a choice\nWe're going to check the temperature difference between the air coming into your machine and the air going out of your machine\nWe are going to check the duct pressure check your surge protectors your system sterilize or if you have them but you know how your filters look and advice you whether or not there's something more time or cost effective\nAt the end of the day\nIt's about making you more comfortable in your home and saving money All right so get it to end up it

sponsors\n[noise]\nHello everybody welcome back to another edition of retire with freedom had hill this is my wonderful wife Tony joining me ...\nYear old Sony we've got a I think a really good show today because we're going to talk about some topics that um we find her on people's minds regular ... and we're also going to bring up some things that\nMaybe you're not thinking about but we think you should be so we're going to talk about I Can't get no satisfaction or can I Do a little stones reference there we're going to talk about irreversible decisions [noise]\nSo ah be careful when you're making a decision that you can't undo we're going to talk about reading the fine print\nIn the financial world that is very important if we have time we'll take some ah email questions from our listeners if you would like to get your question answered on the air go to ask freedom financial dot com that's asked freedom financial dot com we will answer your question on the air and we may also answer your question on the television show\nSo I Want everybody to know that uh we've been doing a television show for about a year now on CBS eleven AM on Saturday on Saturday thank you for that yeah\nUh but we've also recently added a the show to Fox at ten thirty on Sundays\nRight after ... so about eight in ... so we used to joke about we used to joke about you know if you if you don't have anything to do on a Saturday Night you can always DVR the TV show in and watch the show on a Saturday Night so\nHonest honest to goodness had a family come in last week and they both said like at the same time we DVR your TV show called [laughter]\nGo ahead [laughter] that's what you do after football\nSo I don't know I I might rather stick myself in the Iowa with a hot poker than ah\nI think it's okay though I think it's good yeah I think it's I think it's got a good a lot of good information actually won cool thing about it is we can use visual aids that you can't do on the radio so we've got you know some pictures and stuff yeah that help people think about the concepts anyway I Am digressing\n... let's get back to I Can't get no satisfaction so what are we talking about here I Can't get no satisfaction\nWell we found that people have\nKnow they want a high degree of satisfaction and return it but that it's kind of hard for people to really wrap their arms around that and achieve that for one thing the big question that everybody cares about is will not money last year I mean that is the number one big question is well my money last and\nSaying the big question that everybody cares about is will not money last year I mean that is the number one big question is well my money last\nAnd do I have enough so you know one of the things is peace of mind regardless of what's happening in the stock market or around the world I mean so getting satisfaction from that I mean really answers the question do I have enough because a lot of times that we see\nPeople kind of maybe chasing returns trying to jump in the market and trying to eke out another you know upside potential as much as they can because maybe they feel like we're a little behind and we don't have enough of them are trying to play catch up\nAnd you know really it's about having a right dollars in the right thing in the market at the right time as opposed to just go in all in well\nI had first I see both you know I see both things I see people that come in are\nYou know right now with the market's doing so well and have been for so long people are starting to forget what a real a market crash and one correction looks like mhm and ah although if you think back to two thousand and eight\nJust try to remember what that felt like and now imagine that that ... that that happens to you now and you're\nYou know instead of being Fifteen Years away from retirement maybe your five or four three or two or one right\nAnd maybe you're planning on it being five four three two one but maybe your employer has other plans you know because we see this a lot where people get laid off and they were expecting to to work more and and that's that's a lot that's very challenging so I see people that are that are taking\nA lot of market risk right now because things are going so well and human nature we get a little greedy mhm right yeah we get a little greedy and uh and that's okay as long as it's money that you're not going to need to live on\nAnd then that in the next five to ten years and\nI Do also see\nA lot of people who are very concerned about the fact that the market's been up for ten years they feel like a correction has to be coming at some point they're closer to retirement than they were in the past\nAnd they're trying to answer that big question is my money going to last when can I retire yeah do I have an\nWho I have enough in what happens if we lived through another two thousand eight what's gonna happen to me right if we lived through another two thousand and we say this a lot Tony but\nYou know we can't stop the market from crashing but we can stop a market crash from ruining someone for retirement or do you add in fact we do it all the time yeah you know I I think one of the most satisfying things for me\nIs when people come in and they are worried about the answers to these questions when can I retire is the money going to last is it enough and then we put together our retire with freedom plan\nThat goes through everything you know when you're going to do about how are we going to replace your paycheck how are we how do we allocate your investments if we've got money in the stock market how much do we allocate and how much risk do we take if we need income was the way to get income and the most a certain way possible\nIt's not going to be impacted by a market crash\nYou know that gives people a lot of peace of mind how do we deal with taxes healthcare\nA legacy planning so one of the most satisfying things for me is when somebody says you know this is the first time I've really seen all this laid out and I know exactly how this is going to work and I can see that yes I can retire in two years or whatever the goal was and I can see that it's going to work and I can also see\nThe things that we can't control like stock market crashed\nRetiring two years or whatever the goal was and I can see that it's going to work and I can also see the things that we can't control like stock market crashes that sort of thing aren't going to ruin our retirement and that's you know in my opinion what a good retirement plan is about\nReally tied what people are just asking what's on their mind is do I have enough yeah do I have enough money in will my mining last as long as we do and that's what gives people the peace of mind knowing and seeing at the end of a tangibly touched that\nSo so if you were like the families that we help if you are less than ten years away from retirement or you're already retired or maybe you're five years four years three years two years is getting closer and closer and you're trying to answer the big questions when can you retire\nIs your money going to last how do we do this in a way that's going to insulate you from events beyond your control that's what our retire with freedom process does\nAnd we are happy to sit down with you and walk you through exactly how to have the kind of plan for your retirement you're looking for\nThe kind of plan to answer those questions with certainty where you can see exactly how this was going to work it's more than just a bucket of investments a diversified portfolio is not a retirement plan\nCome sit down with us and let a show you what a retirement plan looks like we specialize in helping people with five hundred thousand dollars or more plan for their retirement\nBut if you think you might be a fit give us a call we will sit down with you personally and help you plan your retirement nine eight eight triple zero six that's two oh five nine eight eight zero zero zero six\nTwo oh five nine eight triple zero six anybody that calls in the next ten minutes we will set aside time on our calendar and sit down with you and help you figure out the answers to the big questions for you and your family\nAnd you know Ted talking about a diversified portfolio not being in a an income plant we do talk about how about that a whole lot in fact people come in and actually quote that back to us when they come in but let me say this I I don't know if we've mentioned this before but\nHaving a diversified income you know ... diversified types of income stream is super important right I mean and folks don't think about it like that there is no just one stream of income coming in like you did it when you had your salary\nYou had the ability when you retire if you put a plan together and to be able to diversify the different places you're getting income from there's a there's many different places and each one of those places and strategies needs to be maximize so that you've got the ability literally\nTo have your money last as long as you do and beyond them and you can last as long as you do your wife does you know and then you're able to ... you know possibly very possibly leave money behind to your kids your grandkids are heavy care about because you've had so much income you've not had to rub your nest eggs so much\nBut you don't get an opportunity to get good at retirement planning yeah\nYou never get good at it you never get good at night on you because you do it one\nTime right exactly so that's one of the things I feel like we bring to the table is that the fact that we've done it hundreds and hundreds of times and we have figured out how to figure these things out right so [noise]\nAnd sometimes they're working with people who don't know how to figure it out\nI Would say that that's the majority of the time I mean again it's not\nIt's the difference between working with an architect it's kind of like if you're going to build a house or do you just go to the concrete cells person and say\nHow should I design my house right no you gotta have concrete you gotta have board you got to have all that stuff but you need an architect him to design the thing as so it's kind of like building a house you wouldn't build a house without blueprints\nYou shouldn't plan your retirement without blueprints either and so so I think what's happening for most people as they're working with a broker a bank or somebody and it's kind of like the concrete salesman managing their investments there's nothing wrong with that that is a a perfectly legitimate thing to be doing is managing people's investments it's just not a retirement\nPlan and what we see every time that someone comes in here is they still have the big question on that chart right all my money last will my mind English they're working with somebody but they've never answered the question how my money going to last well I'd be okay do I have enough is my family going to be taken care of something happens to me I mean there's a lot of questions out there that aren't answered\nIt and that's why this discussion around Social Security is important right because it helps answers the answer that question so we've got to figure out how much is going out the door how much are you going to need then we look at all the income sources that you can count on and retirement and then we\nDoes that answer that question so we've got to figure out how much is going out the door how much are you going to need then we look at all the income sources that you can count on and retirement and then we model\nIf we take it early what is it do to your savings long term if we wait until a full retirement age what is it do to your savings long term if we wait until Seventy what is it do to your savings long term 'cause at the end of the day\nI don't think people care so much about which way do I get more money from Social Security before the good lord calls me home as they do is my money going to\nLast absolutely sets so so so so a lot of times people think maybe in again this is natural you're trying to make a decision\nIn so you're you're looking at that decision in a vacuum like what's the breaking break even point which way am I going to get the most out of Social Security you know well it sure would be nice to have that paycheck coming in now it would give me a sense of comfort\nAll of these are human nature mhm but what we really need to do is figure out how is this decision gonna impact whether you run out of money or not yeah and that's everything that's everything\nAnd we also had a software package or just in case we didn't cover every base we have a software package and a team of consultants that used to work for the Social Security administration to help us analyze these things because this is an important decision if you're trying to figure this out\nIf you're not sure is my money going to last when can I retire when should I take Social Security should I take it early is better to wait till till later shouldn't want if you turn it on while the other one weights all of these are things that need to be analyzed\nAnd it's important because at the end of the day it has a huge impact on whether you run out of money or not and there's a window of opportunity right now before you make that decision if you're close to it there's a window of opportunity to make sure that you get this decision right\nIf you would like to take advantage of us helping you do that we're happy to sit down with you and analyze not just your Social Security but your whole retirement planning tell you hear the things that are going well and these are the things that we think\nNeed to be planned for and you need to have a solution in place and you need to have thought through we will give you this detailed analysis at no cost no obligation to you if we decided to work together past that then we explain how that works\nBut this initial analysis is designed to ... to help you get your arms around your retirement planning you'd like to take advantage of that we do specialize in helping people with five hundred thousand dollars or more saved for retirement plan for their retirement\nBut if you like to take advantage of this call now nine eight eight triple zero six that's two oh five nine eight triple zero six in Tony\nI'm also going to offer anybody that calls in the next ten minutes or you'll get a free copy of our book retire with freedom so I've written a book called retire with freedom that tells you how to retire with freedom [laughter]\nAnd so if you would like to take advantage of that anybody that calls in the next ten minutes that comes to see us we'll also get a free copy of the book nine eight triple zero six\n[noise] you know another decision had that could be an irreversible ... decision and is if if it's been made is electing the spousal benefits if you have a pension oval and how that happens we see that a lot so so let me say this I'm sometimes those decisions have already been made when folks come in here\nAnd uh so for for if it has been let me say this there's still a window of opportunity effects that station not that we can go back and change the decisions\nDelayed on well you might be able to some did you have started taking it yet sometimes people have made the decision but they haven't turned it on rice\nChange the decision you made on\nWell you might be able to somebody you haven't started taking it yet sometimes people have made the decision but they haven't turned it on rush but once you've turned on now we got to fix it and we\nWe can't honoring that bell but we can do some things and make some decisions and put some things in place that could really protect\nThe surviving spouse because it's a big question too is is my family going to be okay and what will happen to my family if I'm no longer here you know in my ... are they going to be taken care of and okay and this really answers you know the the decision you make around your pension and Social Security I'm really\nAnswers that big question not only am I may go out for me and her but you know at our we both gonna be okay is she going to be okay if I'm not here anymore and I liked it something other than some kind of benefit left behind for her and how much that I'll eat behind for for him if she's got it\nYou know Tony I I find that this is one of the most concerning questions that people have\nIs my family going to be okay if I'm not around ... and and the the the family has the same question particularly the spouse a lot of times like you know am I going to be OK if my spouse isn't here right\nAnd usually in most couples one person passing away will have a significantly higher impact on the one left behind than if it was reversed right it's usually not the same financially I'm not talking about emotionally\nOr a ... you women do way better without his men than us men do without you women [laughter]\nMaybe that's the truth you guys are like [laughter] totally got that your golf around my back [laughter] and we're like wait a minute why don't we do we care about ourselves [laughter] where's the can opener\nRight so so financially though a lot of times it's the reverse of that yeah right yeah\nAnd so it's it's it's really concerning for both people it's concerning uh for typically the husband again this is not always the case but it is the most common scenario typically the husband is very concerned about is his wife going to be okay\nAnd his wife is concerned about the same thing yeah and I are going to be OK I'm going to cause a lot of times this topic the whole thing about money and investments and all that\nUh is is usually intimidating to people who haven't paid that much attention to it and now again let me let me be clear we've got clients where they'll come in here for you\nAnd we I Can't keep them in a way [laughter] 'cause the women are the ones that do it all the men have no interest absolute so that is absolutely right now real scenario absolutely it's not the most common yeah\nIt's more commonly is the other way around right right yeah and so that's a big concern for people\nIn this pension thing so so why tell why is this pension things such a big deal well\nIt's a big deal because I mean we I give\nYou know I I actually that like I didn't know the answer and I'll tell you I'm acting ... I'm I'm playing the straight man All right go for it so tell the audience why the [noise]\nPension decision as important as huge just like the Social Security decision is huge because I got many stories about this topic in particular but we have a current family that we help now at still hear\nThe they came in five years ago six years ago something like that okay [noise] um he had already elected a a benefit for his pension that was just not nothing left behind for the spouse okay nothing left behind the wife couch because\nHe's much healthier than her um she was a couple of years older than him\nThe wife couch because\nHe's much healthier than her um she was a couple of years older than him but just to [noise] um and that she was more unhealthy ... yes she had some health issues and that they both agreed they both agreed they made the decision together that there's no way she'll ever outlive him and this is the best decision possible for them\nSo they'd already elected the Social Security decisions and they'd already elected to her Social Security was very very small her her ... her piece of has a very small guy\nAnd then so they had great income while they were both here\nAbsolutely great income [noise]\nUm unfortunately about a year and a half less than two years later\nHe passed away and but he came in first and and was saying we made the decisions because we know this is going to happen and and you know I'm going out with her and this is going to be fine and we don't really need to think about those things we want to think about some other things and plan for some other things\nMake sure you're putting all your money and diversified EPS yeah\nMake sure you're putting all your money and diversified ATS yeah that that that's not an income plant right that's a bucket of investments but ... so the fine print ATS have fees as well in some of them more than others you know we talked about um\nWe talked about annuities annuities are one of the ones that you definitely need to know what to ask there are a lot of different kinds of annuities now we've talked on the show plenty of times but\nWe don't think of any of this stuff cash stocks bonds annuities life insurance long term care gold silver real estate and I don't care what it is we don't think of any of that stuff is good or bad and we're very aware of the people out there are very polarized and opinionated about certain things or you should always do this you should never do that\nI think always endeavor is usually bad advice for somebody\nMight be great advice for some people in terrible advice for others so we just want to think through what are we trying to solve a problem or we solve it are we trying to get income that we know we can't outlive are we trying to make sure that it's not\nAffected by market crashes or is it money that we're willing to set aside and grow for the long term in which case we're willing to take more risk is an emergency money is it I got to buy a car in three years\nYou know are we just trying to figure out when can I retire or can I get out of here it is\nSo so ... there's a lot of polarization out there about annuities are I don't I'm not polarized one way or another I don't think they're good I don't think there are bad I think they're a tool that you need to know what you're doing and so there are a lot of annuities have very high fees and then take a lot of risk that people don't realize they're taking\nSo and also they come a surrender penalties and that sort of thing now ... what can an annuity do well well\nYou can get a you can have if you put the ... in in the right can you can have income going up by eight percent a year for every year you delay you can have income last for both lifetimes like a pinch and\nYou know so you know you're not going to run out of money but you also need to understand what the surrender penalties are and all those sorts of things so they can they can make some sense\nBut there are a lot of different kinds into frequently people sit down with us Tony and they think they've got typically they think they've got a fixed annuity and they've got a variable annuity where the fees are three or four percent\nThe income is only going to last for one person's lifetime not for both of them that's alive and if the markets crash and something happens to them the money that's going to be left to their kids is going to be\nIs the is going to go down maybe even cut in half of what they're leaving behind in in it was explained to them very differently than that then they thought the money was protected they were getting guaranteed growth and it was going to be for both lifetimes so\nIt's very important and\nThat if you are doing anything in the world a financial planning you understand not just what it's going to do well for you but what are the gotcha is my other limitations what are the limitations and it's not look nothing's perfect\nYou know if we put money in the stock market for somebody's plan in the market crashes that money's going to go down if we use an annuity for somebody's plan and and they need all the money back out six months later they're going to pay a penalty to get it right yes so these are all things that before we do them yeah\nPeople need to be super clear on it and and it it shouldn't be their responsibility to have to go through and catch those things in the fine print exactly the the person that's working with them\nBe their responsibility to have to go through and catch those things in the fine print exactly the person that's working with them should lay all of this out and say look nothing's perfect\nEverything we do has benefits and it has drawbacks stocks and bonds have them annuities have life insurance long term cash cash have everything has pros and cons here the problems we're trying to solve here's the way that we should segment the solutions to take care of the different problems but oh by the way\nEvery single thing that we're doing here we're doing for a good reason but it also comes with risks or limitations or a you know less liquidity or less growth or we've got great growth opportunity we're taking a bunch of risk all of those things\nBut a good plan tap if you put a good solid plan together for ... for for a family the thing that we can do is we can take different solutions not this diversified portfolio but to diversify the solutions yeah and marry those together in an effort to get all the benefits from each of those strategies\nIf that sounds logical to you that all good plans should have different strategies is part of it if we're trying to solve different problems and you've been wishing and hoping that you could actually sit down with somebody\nThat wasn't a one trick pony trying to get you to do one thing versus another and they were very open about all of the benefits but also the drawbacks the fine print\nThere's nothing perfect out there so we don't try to pretend that there is we just want to make sure that if you're doing something there's a reason for it we've created a plan that we've collaborated on that you understand what we're doing\nIn that you've been involved in the decision in your clear on what the limitations are so that if the limitations raised their head it's not a surprise\nIf you want that kind of straight talk and\nClear explanation of benefits and limitations around all of this stuff as it relates to retirement stocks bonds annuities life insurance what's the real scoop we will help you do that\nOr we will
