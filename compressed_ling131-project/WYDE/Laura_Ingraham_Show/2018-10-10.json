I don't envy anybody that's going to have to face that hurricane I was just looking at the reports about it um\nIt could be nasty oh yeah I'm\nBillions of dollars lost and um\nYou know I I was a sprint to call when your your previous interview you were talking you know politics is a game like you usually do you know America used to be United you stand divided you fall but when you start playing it like it's a game\nOr that means it's there's going to be some ugly winners and there's going to be a lot of losers\nAnd so when you start looking at this hurricane\nAnd you start looking at a F told you before about that book uh about disaster politics are called the shock doctrine where there are people who intentionally allow regions to fall apart so that they can buy up all the land to two cents on the dollar a year\nWhere there are people who intentionally allow regions to fall apart so that they can buy up all the land to two cents on the dollar\nA you know we're seeing that down there in Puerto Rico so you know Alabama's in target for that uh and the the idea that the politicians have known that global warming is happening\nAnd they've done nothing and they've made a game out of doing nothing and they've taken our tax dollars wasted it and\nYou know stupid frivolous Joan and uh you know military industrial complex fear mongering and they've done nothing to actually protect the country\nAre so you know I I don't envy or Florida or Alabama at this point\nSo that was written this hurricane Michael is from global warming\nOh yeah the ocean is getting you remember the the uh what was that Harvey just last month\nI Walk in my Bones Are come ... re jacked up so let's get right back out to it\nAnd we'll start with Brian Scott however Brian how are you\nA Michael I have something that you're going to be interested in after that a nut job from California who regularly calls in a Rush Limbaugh when he gets onto this a global warming stuff he uses a climatologist\nScientist at U. A. H. in Huntsville doctor Roy Spencer\nA he has recently uh put out an e book and I think I have the title right it's global warming myth for busy people are that close\nOr you need to look that up and um they're probably going to be some real good information for you in there and I'll bet you he would make a great interview for your show so you need to check\nThat out okay I'll do it okay thank you thank you Brian pre should it's a very much\n... that's good too but it was called hello how are you\n... you know can you hear me I can hear you just fine\nOkay for my covered it I think the Democrat Party the whole of the law I take that back ... percent of all as much law got the people and I could take it because anybody that make the ... the state and the things that they do\nOn a regular basis I promise you they don't believe in God because if they did they do it at all in the light that blondes before um\nYeah go with the law I knew he was going to get up on because I don't get we're all those you know and I like to get any warmer getting hurt\nBut it's um any ... go to any dramatic aspects of this way it's always heard about ... ...\nAre great and the FBI found the exact same thing out however corrupt they might be\nThough I mean that that's the thing is people look at what they say it you could tell a lot of the ... you can even eating\nCame up at me saying you've got to tell a lot of the ... you can even ate even get to that only\nRight on some kind of investigation no you're right you're right you know\nThey have you so traumatic or like that maybe he was that the situation and I felt threatened by new ... than me one day to day I Can't ... so that I feel safe or bought it\nI Know it's so true I didn't hear the life of pride in five years so now when you then made some macho fell\nIn life I wanted to make an accusation business do your cats but daddy malarkey\nI agree I definitely do\nAnd I appreciate the gods slimmer not love into well things are present it's a very much and let's get the Jason's going hello Jason how are you\nAre doing All right I just you know wanting to make the observation that\nEvery once in a long while you look forward to Charles Island\nHave colon [laughter] a couple of the guys [laughter] [laughter]\nYou for that now that you summoned him\nOr not he's he's busy this morning solving the hurricane issue I'm\nSure a there you go yeah he probably wrote the evacuation protocol yeah have a good day mark\nDue to our present didn't so very much hello Henry how are you\nHello Michael hello Henry ... that that storm is going to be rough on a lot of people ... ... is it is\nThat's your own little prayer term I Know the left doesn't think prayers work but why don't we give it a try and see how it works\nI don't do it every day and ... I Know I hear ya I'm you know it's funny that the UN and come out with that climate same a pretty quick right after\nThe United states was determined to be the number one exporter of oil and of course now we have to stop all that oil pollution or by twenty thirty they said right that or we're going to where you can't you won't be able to turn back the clock after that date\nIf you are if you go to get a gallon of gas and all of their programs are and are are put into place to diminish oil production and uh all the nasty pollutants\nTax on one gallon of gas will be forty nine\nDollars per gallon right so who would that hurt the most Michael\n... nasty rich people\nOr whether it hurts the people that work hard to make this country what it is today and every day and in the future hopefully will continue to make it\n... I mean that's one of the reasons that we have a\nA you know we've dismiss many of the agenda is on the United nations you know sustainable development agenda Twenty one et cetera et cetera you know then they sound they sound you know do you see on the outside but when you when you start tearing down and loosening the nuts and bolts you begin to see them for what they really are\nA wealth redistribution I hear you want that they want that money don't they yes they do yeah\nSan Francisco where a you're a dad whatever his name is calling from I you know what the new San Francisco treat is not an\nEasy Henry [laughter] I'll say one more thing I tell you what Michael on American aid code right I'm\nA matter of trust in the lord and when God tells me in his words that he gives me four seasons every year I certainly will put my trust and the board before any of the United nations\nI I agree Henry actually become a friend you too\nI certainly will put my trust and the board before any of the United nations\nI I agree ... from you too Bye bye Bye bye and let's get the AC regret the morning they see how are you\nI'm just fine how are you talking about of a nuclear power plant and as I understand in in the Tennessee Valley that was shut down several years ago and he was being restarted is that what you were talking\nAbout ... ... told yeah yeah we're we're we're not entirely up to speed on that if you can give us some clarification were wide open for\nWhat what TV I I'm back in the sixties and seventies you know they they had several a nuclear power plants that were started up and then I show some down a it was based on a um an estimate that uh the population in Tennessee valley we're going to increase a significantly so\nAre there was one over that you can Mississippi go yellow creek a power plant but the one that has been shut down and he's\nRecently been bought by another corporation is one scotch ... you actually see it on our Seventy tell you if you're going in the Scott's first cowbell pond take\n'em and um but it has never been completed so it's been real recently bought and ice going to be completed a lead Brown's ferry you know the answer is a really serious accident\nOr it consists of three um units almost like you know three plants are sending their side by side and you need one caught on fire a few years ago well it was back I think in the seventies\nAnd I'm almost kind of melt down there but to say you know the safety system or or the cooling system ah saves the plant from actually melting into the earth right\nIn contaminating an area between Nashville in Birmingham ah but I'm a scientist I also when I'm a doctor Spencer at home schooling you age he um he uh is a very very knowledgeable person about\nSo called climate change or global warming and a ... you would enjoy hearing them speak about\nAbout this subject but I think you you may recall a I'm a I think it was in twenty Thirteen I'm twenty four team there was a British scientist who was one of the first people who brought up the notion of\nOf climate change I I that kind of took accounting job a warming\nAnd you know he came out and said that he had like two days later it maybe right\nLied about the days or you know the increase in temperature the oceans and and so I'm a a lot of the people who are\nTalking about climate change or global warming they're not really scientific people um you know they they uh seem to have an axe to grind or something you know and they ah um sometimes I think they exaggerate the um uh you know the significance of any changes but\nA couple more mile an hour winds that you could be looking at a five\nAnd yet we've never had a four hit that region\nCorrect you remember Katrina got up to four mhm and then once Katrina hit it was a three but it's still had the the reins at all for 'em so this area and people got to remember so\nYou look at mobile so Frederick when Frederick ... Gulf shores it split the island and a half that well the the strip of land in half so Fort Morgan so I was separated from mainland at that point and then when Frederick made landfall on the mainland\nYou had some trees down which is fine but you had all those you know two three hundred year old law folks that are deep rooted they're not really going to go anywhere\nAnd same as with Katrina Katrina hit it took out some trees some old trees but it really didn't a lot of damage to the trees that happened Florida is nothing but\nPecan right it's just nothing but big pine forest there's not really that many old growth oaks in that area anymore unless you get near the swamps and and further inland but on the coast is more of those\nThey're not yell upon but you know they're the flimsy tall ponds that if you if a deer breaks win next time they'll fall over so these things are going to be all over the place mhm so I mean that they're going to get some damage and mainly I think the biggest problem is gonna be the storm surge coming in now going out doing our talking about it\nNow Sam tweeted that Fort Morgan starting to flood little dolphin now in this flooding the little right now but that's mainly on the northern side of those areas because as a storm surges coming in on the east side of this\nOh and this flood and the little right now but that's mainly on the northern side of those areas because as a storm surges coming in on the east side of the hurricane all the wins on the west side are pushing all the water for mobile bay\nPensacola Bay and all those sounds out into the Gulf so the north side of that area is going to get a little bit of flooding but they're not really going to get a storm surge per se so you're going to be some flooding on the west side of the storm but you're going to see horrible flooding on the east side of the storm\nAnd I know some people have in her class the week and a ... in Destin have come out the last twenty four hours and so I said this thing should move through pretty quickly that the panhandle is open for business so y'all come on down that's from them or\nWe are going to reach out to somebody in the region perhaps from the uh Destin E. M. A. or whoever we can get on the horn probably tomorrow to get somewhat of an update but uh you have to take into consideration\nAs James just points out Thirteen foot surge is the national Hurricane Center said that one of its berries is um has located waves or recorded waves as high as a thirty one feet\nSo the likelihood that everything's going to be a green lighted by the weekend along the cars and you know what the weather being\nThe way that has been lately I mean it's very tempting to go down there I Love persuaded get down along the coast some way or the ... this particular weekend but I just I think it's where it was ... at this point\nWell and you gotta remember also storms in the area\nFrom previous years and uh the boss leaning all we're talking this morning for went on there when ... ...\n... came right into that area destined Fort Walton Beach area the whole highway Ninety eight stretch the miracle mile as what they call down there and ... came in hit stalled went right back out into the Gulf spawn back up I think it hit is a two originally went back out spawn back up to three and came back in\nThey had to rebuild all the sand dunes right highly Ninety eight did not exist until they got bulldozers out there is a clear all the sand off of it some other emergency vehicles could get through\nAnd I think people need to realize how low that area really is and and I talked to a day about a St George island and coming out of apple logical or which is a charming little southern town\nThere is a a stretch\nOf highway and I really don't remember how long you go kind of over a via duck\nAnd that'll levels back down there were heading over towards I care a bell and the situation just as you get into care about proper you take a right across the bridge that's about four miles long it's not for miles south of Brits just you know how they span and they turn this is going over to our St George\nWell I'm coming out of apple logical on the evening after having dinner heading back to where I'm staying on St George\nAnd this as divide that goes back down and and hits that stretch of highway\nIt's raining I mean it's just it's a decent thunderstorm you know it's not that what you would call you know cataclysmic by any stretch but that the water the waves 'cause you've got debatable left and you've got the ah it's actually still bay on the right but it's got its ... near the amount of the Gulf\nBut there's water crossing the road in a rainstorm\nSo it is it is completely feasible\nThat the stretch of highway we're talking Ninety eight they used to be a great seafood place they're down around care about called that place on thirty one\nNo I'm Sorry that price or as a thirty one or Ninety eight thirty one goes down on the area as well and my ... I think it is the place or Ninety eight and I mean just old beat up restaurant apple pie\nIt's thirty one goes down on the area as well and my ... I think it is the place or Ninety eight and I mean just old beat up restaurant up on pilings you know the kind of place where you get like real seafood ... your house and oh yeah gone just completely gone after a while the hurricanes\nSo that stretch of highway it could theoretically white that stretch out and literally cut at least that part of the panhandle off from Appalachian coal\nBecause as you as you go west the sea level height begins to uh the heightened just a little bit it's not not significantly but there will likely be water in that region as well which is why the governor of Florida is suggesting people run away\nAnd you also gotta remember once again will bring a Katrina when Katrina hit Louisiana New Orleans\nMississippi got the storm surge\nAnd whose houses no longer there on the Mississippi coast\nJeff Davis as ALS get wiped out\nI did not realize that now that was the house we lived in with the widow yeah right there on Ninety eight that though I said oh yeah right the Mississippi Sound right not too far from the casinos gone I had no idea who it was a way Katrina was coming in they started pulling up all the uh the ropes and everything's tried to move the casinos up river right\nAnd all the trees right they're wiped it out\nThat's a shame because that's a beautiful little house All right quick break come right back rather side taking your calls as we continue to monitor hurricane Michael what we're going to have here is rain rain rain and then cold\nAnd cold bought me to our definitions gonna be a fifties sixties and seventies but it is going to affect our neighbors to the south and probably all the way up in terms of heavy rain all the way as far north as men gum or a quick break come right back to the microphone archer\nIt's not right versus left it's us versus them the Michael hearts show\nThey're seen here class of water oh you don't drink tap water too much of a chemical taste for you when you cook what you believe in it but you don't drink it because of that growth chlorine taste em I write that bad taste is caused by a lot more than just scoring\nWhen people jumped prescription driving down the toilet when pesticides in a more among seep into groundwater all of\nThese working to make that bad taste you hate so much that you can keep your waters said in chemical free with the Hague water purification system existence aren't patent customized self cleaning whole house multi stage water filtration systems and all of that\nAnd say hey systems are the most effective water filtration you can get giving you clean and how the water to ... and most importantly to dream and it can cost as little as what you may already be spending in bottled water to start getting clean how the water for your family called that led to a\nFive eight three Seventy nine nine four seven three seven nine nine four seven how the water started to take\nEvery business needs good partners to help them succeed and meet their goal vertical solutions media has been working with small to mid sized companies in the Birmingham area for over ten years in fact they've been the trust in marketing partner for this very radio station for almost three years\nVertical solutions media has experience working with a wide range of industries and with companies of all sizes for small retail stores ... corporation or purchase customize to the needs of each client whether offering occasional projects support or fully integrated day to day marketing operations in addition vertical solutions\nMedia recently launched a new Web development division called alpine start they specialize in online Web strategies to build affinity with your audience for friends awareness\nCalled outlined start they specialize in online Web strategies\nAnd build a fan of the with your audience support brand awareness and the prospects for yourself process request a free no obligation sixty minute marketing consultation limit to what five nine three six three one\nSeven for er visits our website at vertical solutions media dot com\nIt's super station one on one we care about the hard work you vote in your lives and that's why our advertising partners are people we take the time do you don't have to when you go to the white lie and check out our partners you can trust that you're doing business with a right to be people you can count on if there is something you need that you don't see why let us\nKnow and we'll start for the call said eight seven three three to four new business the right way superstition one on one what are you why do\nThose guns be certain show he would start earning ... point\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nThey'll be ... there'll be ... now do you do thirty seven each room and the w._b. ...

something to happen that way just kind of on a personal level in your day to day just out and about going to the gas station convenience store where you might go\nHave you been on the receiving end of any ... consternation threatening postures comments no yeah either by\n\nMatter of fact you know and most of my interactions with just my fellow Alabamians\nNada\nNow I'm not suggesting that it's not happening\nMy fellow Alabamians\n\nNot uh\nNo I'm not suggesting that it's not happening but I Am suggesting that I think that it appears as widespread as it is because of the media is tell you about the plane crash but the gleaming awry mentality\n\nIt doesn't matter of I encounter a Latino guy or a black guy or another grey haired old white man\nPeople just seem to be getting all their lives and most corners\n\nAnd I really do believe that that Paul has a a a very valid point here that if anything was to ignite it is going to be because of the ... the political rhetoric of the politicians on the left and encouragement by the media\nNot that the media would necessarily encouraged these outbreaks\nAs much as give fodder to the justification for them\nThe media\nIf you look at what's going on and you got you got two kids on the on the basketball court or in the soccer field or whatever analogy you when you so you've got two kids stand in their face to face and they want to fight each other but nobody wants to take the first swing the media is that little\nHeightened man that's jumping behind them you know do it do it do it yeah right he fight he's talking about your mama and stuff like that that you let him get away with that exactly that's what\nThe media is they're the ones they instigate and start pushing it toward escalation\nBut I thought you were a man you know and push you around that's what we're getting from them mhm\n\nAnd you know earlier today we had that conversation with a might more of the guy that wrote the book and this guy was he's a legitimate federal government contractor a security contractor\nAnd he's written a brand new book we talked to him earlier today we're going to talk to him again next week or so about accusations about the deep state and he said point blank on the air I Am part of the deep state\nBut he made an interesting observation that he's also a journalist and I and I share this with the guys a couple of days ago that he felt differently at twenty seven that he did it forty seven\nAnd how many of these journalists are young and impressionable now he was speaking about the security apparatus and not the media\nBut isn't it interesting to note that you've got these young impressionable people that feel like they're being turned into some kind of you know social you know ... they're no longer social activists they are in their minds becoming social warriors\n\nAt least you know through their own shortsighted and very immature thought processes\n\nAnd I made a comment about last time Trump was in Alabama when it was up in Huntsville\nAnd I was up there just because I went up there and we were both in the press pool and they are they're they're youngsters\nI mean they were bringing them in by the busload\n\nAnd I just can't help but wonder because you know think of it for just a moment when when when you're doing you know the age you know and like you talk about or it's on social media when you were that young and that inexperienced and that immature\nDo you really think that you are legitimately encouraging someone to take their own life for example which has happened or you just ... it's like this um this I don't know what it is a the ... thing the suicides\nI for example which has happened or you just that route is like this um this I don't know what it is a ... suicide challenge I think there's a lot of young people in this country and frankly with a mobile thing across the globe whether or not necessarily considering\n\nThe long term ramifications even uptick in your life because they're that far removed from reality\n\nIf we start seeing violence perpetrated patch\nStories\nPass Gabby Giffords et cetera\nI don't ever foresee a full scale civil war Israel understand it but for the tension in the streets of this country and the city in this state is gonna be palpable despite the fact that up to this point I have not detected any of it\nBut I can guarantee you that would not be the long term the long term results of is burning trucks in the street threatening senators\nI made that point they have no time you're right my are made that point several times\nAnd when it comes to throw down you know it's let's get this over with and we don't do everything we got at it so liberals may want to step back and take a look at the posturing that they're taking because when this thing blows up is going to get ugly and it's going to get ugly ...\nYeah I agree I agree might be safe out there and my friend I have a good that\nYou to one of my favorite movies is roadhouse Patrick Swayze he plays the cooler ... the head bouncer of a of a road house maybe in the movie\nAnd there's a scene where he's talking to his uh his bouncers muscle guys about cleaning up this particular bar refuse hang out there drunks you know the scene where I'm at least you could imagine there\nAnd he's making a point about always being polite shows on the door but be polite they get up in your face serves on the door by being polite\nThey pull out a knife\nTake out the trash by being polite they threatened new shows on the door walk them to the door call one of the other ... or call me but always be polite\nUntil it's no longer necessary\nTo be polite and that's what my is referring to a lot of liberals particularly the younger ones have ... have they they have a switch a toggle if you will and it's easy to trip it or if you prefer trigger it\nMost conservatives we have a dial\nOr if you want to liken it to the shower you took this morning we get some\n... water lukewarm water gets a little hotter you turn it up as you become a little desensitized to the heat\nIn the water\nAnd it's a little warmer and a little warmer until you can no longer take the hot water and you're turning the shower off\n\nThat would potentially is on the horizon does me myself I Am a pretty laid back guy I Know I go off all my ranch I Know I got 'em out for me I can be emotional maybe illogical at times particularly I'm trying to make a point\nBut I Try to always be respectful cognizant of others feelings\nAnd there was no longer time to be polite\n\nAnd I think a lot of conservative share that viewpoint\n\nJesus Christ was very slow to anger\nBut when he was well\nMhm I'm coming\nIn hell's come in with me\nTo go all Kurt Russell from tombstone when you're\nThe liberals are the rent\nThat was coming with me to go all Kurt\nRussell from tombstone on you\n\nThe liberals are the ... the cowboys and the rest of us or the ...\nAnd Hillary Clinton is I claim soccer big game until you're confronted\nA yeah and we saw that as a corral which didn't happen to the corral but that's historical anomaly I won't bore people with\nYour laws Lester Moore for shots with a forty four no less no more random movie reference\nYeah I Know but at least we know are we are talking about mhm mhm\nAs long as we can have a conversation who cares really [laughter]\nAh that's a bad storm yeah it's a bad one but it's a bad ones\nI right now Pensacola destined Panama City and older again about a forty mile an hour winds\nAnd it's probably gone double in the next hour them\nAnd looking at the graphic it does seem to be a kind of a tapering off to the east and the reason is doing that is because of the cold front right behind it if the cold front stalls\nIt could go right up to the center of the pan ... it gets because you got to remind the northern portion of the panhandle Panama City that's ... and at what time actually was south Alabama\n\nYou know one day they will get to one of those or how the state's got their shapes kind of stories\nBut back in the day that I Would have been sweet home\nFor many of us feel still considered that anyway I was really funny a lot of residents from the panhandle kind of consider themselves Alabamians\nBecause I'm a taste of it if you ever been to the panhandle of Florida most if you have and then travel down to let's say Orlando all the way down past a Deerfield into a Fort Lauderdale Miami, Florida is to an entirely different states not dissimilar from California\nAt least in terms of their political ideologies\nBut yeah this thing could turn on and by the way that is me saying it not the national weather service but yeah it looks like it's going to track up through the Carolinas and now we're going to\nContinue to monitor it throughout the course of the more than\nEight six six five five one nine nine three three that's going to take our last break of the hour last break up a day doing

I Hope I Hope you're ...\nHave seen them screaming it in the streets are saying well ... I Hope I Hope your family members are sexually assault and so you learned your lesson\nI've had these kind of folks say oh what are your children turn out to be gay\nOr singing a sign on the other day from one of the protesters say they hope the Milan ...\nWas right yes I Would think ripe would count as sexual assault when you you said you've seen this I just do not believe and if it has this story is written\nThis this journalist they people who wrote this article no who make the those kind of threats mhm it's not the conservative you seen the picture of the the two groups of women there's the women who were for Kavanaugh and they're praying\n... then it shows women who were anti Kavanaugh route there screaming with all different kind of hair and look like I'm\nYou know\nI'm not even going to say they just don't look real good how's that\nWell by my it doesn't matter what they look like I'm just\nLike a crazy insane person I'm not talking about their physical appearance I'm Talking like they're they're\nMad or rabbit\nRabbit dog and still be a good looking dog but it's just rabbit it's going crazy and say I'm Will differ with you on this guy because I think\nAs long as they're not harming anyone else they can scream all they want and everything but when they start harming someone else or getting in someone else's face ... limits the problem\nI'll give you that\nThat is a change if they look like a bunch of crazy rapid ...

said Thursday this was not a political call for him [noise]\nI've tried to do my due diligence and exercise my best judgment\nI Can't out it it probably was his best judgment he's doing all he can do or you say any smarter than that no [laughter]\nJust said he had additional concerns about Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary committee he said Kavanaugh has every right to be angry and defensive [noise]\nThe the quote unquote bullets or the material for nuclear weapons to who they say is our biggest enemy I Would think that would be a far greater crime the cell and bullets to a

show when the country has done both those things in the same day let's go to the day before I get into this next article Dave welcome to the program thank you for listening\nI got there are several YouTube's and and hear these folks talking about was fixing to happen and I believe it because the president is up for the American people not for the uh the imagine they asked if they\nBrought 'em they brought Obama and John she sued and and Hillary\nOr and or in chains and they they're talking about they're fixing to a church tribunal on them for treason or we have come apart in or are we going to need a martial\nLaw the police are saying in a good thing is is that Donald Trump is for the American people this is not going to be a beat down from the communist or that a liberal stance or liberal Democrats stand for is going to be for the last one I listened to was a ... a former CIA\nAgents I'm Robert David Steel and these people are very credible um\nAgents that are that are they're they're not telling ... state secrets they go to Dale themselves said they did that\nAnd um but uh the the best one is a mark tight or or he talks about all the the what God's are doing for by bringing us Donald Trump and as far as\nThe piercings and tattoos are concerned um I don't have any I've got a lot of military service that I can really be showing\nOut with all my tattoos and stuff like that because a little bit of ... said don't have now I did\nInhale back in the day and I have not nowhere near anything\nIs as bad as as uh the people who never inhaled or never even thought about it right so um but a little bit because I think it's that don't have any fears and so but we're on immigration integration period so just asked Jesus gave you for a will\nYou got a guy yeah last time I do\nHave people gave me for inhaling design held a lot [laughter] I told you have\nFor ... you got it I died last year\nHe if he gave me for inhaling cause I Am held a lot [laughter] I told you have a heck of a testimony no doubt thank you for the power the gospel you\nKnow other interesting article\nWritten by a gentleman named ... than you'll Blake senior contributor at the federal is he has a PHD and political theory lives in Missouri\nAnd he starts out the articles couple of days old person is is it too late to get one of those red hats\nI didn't support Donald Trump during the two thousand sixteen election not that it mattered I wasn't in a swing state I was a\nPublicly oh panning about the general election had my vote mattered I might have brought myself to vote for him but it didn't\nSo why didn't so he is at least saying the than you'll is they look I didn't like throw if my vote\nIf I had been in a state that was a swing state of Missouri was going to go for Trump full out\nSo I didn't vote for him and that's kind of a ... I'm not going down that road that's what should have happened in this state we wouldn't have to worry about Doug Jones on election night I had a few drinks and enjoyed Hillary Clinton losing it was a spectacle which to borrow a line it would have taken a heart of stone not to laugh\nI did text a friend or two that I Hope I was wrong about Trump\nIn some ways I was the U.S kept his promises on judges for instance and otherwise I think otherwise I think my low opinion of him has been thoroughly vindicated dusted in writing for the federal is I have defended President Trump and criticized him sometimes in the same color\nOf also ... criticized the die hard never droppers who are willing to jettisoned conservatism to pursue their vendetta against Trump like many Trump skeptical conservatives I tried to call things that I saw them sometimes I was pleased with Trump's policy ... sometimes I was appalled\nI Do not just about any of what I wrote nonetheless I now support ... re election to use the word does your I have been radicalized\nThe enormity of the efforts by the Democrats and their media allies to destroy Brett Kavanaugh forced me to reconsider my views the concerns I have about Trump's character temperament and propensity to damage America's culture and political institutions are still there but I'm supporting him anyway\nNot just that the Democrats have VCA did any claim to ... possessed superior character temperament though they have said that\nOr that Trump's policies have been better than I expected I now support Trump because the Democrat Party and its media allies are controlled by people who view conservatives not as political opponents to be voted down but as enemies to be personally destroyed I read you\nThe entire intro to this article in order to get to that Senate now you have heard on this program\nI'm a little a little bit like Jim from Marshall County I have been saying this very thing since way before it became\nAccepted to talk this way\nThe left sees what you and I believe in as something to be destroyed we have people on our side who want to talk about how we need to come together we have people on their side you talk about how we need to come together and ...\nPeople on our side who want to talk about how we need to come together we have people on their side you talk about how we need to come together and compromise that does not mean what\nYou think it means their version of compromise means that they win you lose you continue to allow them to march forward with their lips\nJust they just atheist\nAnd are just they're really not in Oregon so good band orchestra just tools I'm Sorry they will lead piano workers run out there and and just be against everything destroy everything but I promise you when they get in charge there will not be ...\nIt won't be it will be iron fist doubled government that's where it goes we\nOnly have a minute before the break but let me ... let me read that sentence to you again he says that\nDebate our guy and I predicted that back out here in the primaries I said they are going to care tremendously right about debates when it comes to the general so what is going on what do you see it happening out\nThere go show I got to tell you Scott I was a a business dinner yesterday a business lunch should I say and the guest speaker was none other than Walt Maddox the mirror of Tuscaloosa yes [noise]\nUh let's put it this way the most important business people in the state of Alabama in Birmingham ... in that room guy all the heavy handed all the big meal or buddy was it\nMay medics timing and gave a stump speech that you would expect him to give it a liberal gathering of students on the campus at Stanford or you might be\nA I was a poll a it was astonishing he well he talked about was giving stuff away giving failings free cell phones when I get outside like in a climate dies\nIt was old just give give give and he spent half the time talking about Medicaid expansion life are and how that's going to be worth I mean a hundred million dollars is and it's worth as much as ... billion oldest known since [noise]\nAnd you could see the business people in the audience sitting there going what is this going on ...\nWhich is in debate fair some of our business leaders in the state\nAren't the most conservative guys in the world not agree but they do have a tendency to understand that somebody's going to have to pay for this stuff I Would also say that many of those business leaders understand that the ... one of the main reasons the state of Alabama is broke\nIs trying to pay for Medicaid that we have now ... much less an expanded version but I I didn't think it shows that won't matter is is a is an intelligent guy he's a smart guy oh he was very\nA ... a great communicator all doom and gloom role doom and gloom was awful really yeah\nAnd so he's a smart guy but the the things that he believes in\nJust don't work and live and they've not work anywhere but it's unfortunate that he's using that same tactic that it really does work or hasn't worked as a policy but it works in getting elected right and I always compare it Greg to\nPeople running for\nThird grade class president mhm and you know the stereotype is this the elementary school action and you've got the one kid who says vote for me and we'll have ice cream every day and no homework and everybody was like yes Greg's guy vote for Greg and it's all free and it's all free been they weigh in\nAnd they're shocked that they didn't get free ice cream and they still had homework uh-huh and that and that's what happens with so many Democrats and Walt Maddox is promising the same thing\nWell yeah and that was the thing that really struck me he was talking about just\nGiving things away and some of it's probably needed for roads need to be fixed and bridge right to be fixed but they need to be paid full yes and he had NO PLAN or idea on who to have that was going to happen and he was to Medicare Medicaid expansion like\nIt was like this magic pot of money that was just going to pop up from somewhere and we were ... well no we're not someone pays for that right and that's\nExpansion in Alabama is the same thing is claiming to be supportive of universal healthcare on a on a national labs actually we're just going to be great everybody's just going to be taken care of\nIt a walk and you ... how can you oppose this if you want you to do if you like you don't do you can keep your dog ... anyway and that was my insurance should meet two or three thousand dollars cheaper now because ... told me it would be rod and it and it's going up more and more and more\nWhy is it that I Know it works because\nAlpha ... told me it would be rod and it and it's going up more and more and more why is it that I Know it works because a lot of Alabamians don't listen to this program but one twenty eight teams do people still believe these things\nWell I think Scott if you're listening to a traditional or reading traditional media and getting your news on the television and lifts and reading\nYou know the the the traditional press they're old and the bag for the Democrats and that's just a fact of life and we've known it for years and years so if you've got somebody that's not a dozen emotions you said before there's a lot of people that don't aren't really paying attention but they might see that headline in the\nKnow in one of the local legacy but publications but they got a guy I Will I'm going to get free Medicare is like it's like I'm going to get an Obama phone I'm going to get a free fine well that's great I'm paying for that ... that I look and that's why I think I eat it and then maybe their parents voted Democrat and so I like stupid Democrats\nAnd they just they just just don't get it and and here's the part that that scares me for my kids and grandkids if I ever have any of those kinds of thing is that this plan that\nWalt Maddox and or the bronco bombers of the world and Hillary Clinton's and Maxine Waters below sea all these all the plans if\nThey have have in the end the strategy they're using has worked\nAll over the world very successful prosperous countries ah Argentina Venezuela Venezuela ... um\nBought into this whole hey look everything's so good for somebody else and uh let's try this socialism thing mhm and then they destroyed themselves that's what scares me is it an America for\nGenerations we taught American exceptionalism we taught the free market we taught that communism was an evil that had to be destroyed and ... and now we have dinner at least\nIf you go twenty year spans we've got at least two maybe three generations who\nDon't think negatively of socialism and we're we're rushing down this road and it's not going to be any better here than it was anywhere else but how do we convince people I mean you're from dread not\nPart of governmental affairs is how do you message to folks that this is a bad policy\nWell I think Scott part of the issue here is people no longer believe that that twenty your generation no longer believes in American exceptionalism mhm because they've beaten into them at school at college that it's bad to want to be the best and it's bad for the United states to be the best\nAnd buy buy into that and part of that is just in\nTime ... that we're talking about now is people don't appreciate the United states and I don't believe in American except you and I to me if I was messaging political ... this was what happened yesterday with um medics okay he stood there\nFor Fifteen or twenty minutes and said how bad Alabama was how bad the constitution was how bad business was how corrupt the site is\nAnd I even if you were a medic supporter you know he was very Robert Kennedy asked right but even if you're a medic supported the the the the magic of the Kennedys were they would they would project they would make you feel good you would move ahead and uh you know if you like may all be the guy\nThat will make you a lot better Maddox was just old doom and gloom and you'll ... at one point he said there's a million Alabama in Bamiyan driving over a bridge is ...\nMedics was just all doom and gloom and you ... at one point he said there's a million Alabama in Bamiyan driving over bridges every day and they're going to collapse and those bridges will collapse and people will die\nWhile like rally rallying cry it was craziness well part of what happens to a candidate especially a liberal candidate is if they're not getting traction which I don't think Maddox he is a he fully expected to have\nThe the Doug Jones kind of event he's not getting the Republican establishment to turn on Kay Ivey which had to happen for us to do me up and end up with with Doug Jones right so their their frustration level ... and I think what you're seeing it those kinds of speeches as you you're seeing\nA glimpse of that that dark Cold War that is liberalism\nThat that that anger that is liberalism I look at the protest it I've been talking about and given him a hard time cause I don't know why anyone would look at some of those crowds and say I want to be like that those people but there is a an happiness there's that something's\nWrong and on guys just wrong it's just so you get this almost is growling angry the angry\nMhm soul of liberalism and it starts to show as the frustration level ...\nI'm a case in point to the issue of pointing to from the uh the venue like police and the federal or so I guess where he would he'd sentiments in that in ... that was one of the best place to operate a long time\nAnd you know and then that leads into Hillary Clinton saying we can't be respectful to Republicans I mean give me a bright could you imagine if a Republican presidential candidate said that oh that would go crazy it would be insane that would be on the ... it would be the lead story on NBC and CNN and everything it was\nIt would be we got to take a break Gregory kill the killing Keely can we say how do you say that Australian voice it's like she only kidding yeah mhm so you may just going to sign up you're going to sound like a crocodile hunter when you tell people that are people in Australia y'all say y'all say y'all\nRight now I say you all now because I'm On I was I was greeted getting off the airplane and Australia and the lady said how are you all and I thought I'm I'm at home\nNow she was probably just stringing would you do it it's just a Alabama say right exactly yeah sorry about that we just
