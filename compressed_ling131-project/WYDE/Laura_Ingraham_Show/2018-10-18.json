creation of a permanent third class and this was also the fellow that uh had talked about the increase in our hurricanes and the severity there of or salt of global warming\nRight you're talking about David\nYeah and I got to thinking for a while about how he could hold these notions I mean you know he seems fairly intelligent and yet he holds these ideas and the conclusion that I came to is that he is\nAnd it's just plain as the nose on your face consistently horrible results of leftist policies results than I\nWanted to put that in terms that the left would be able to understand I mean you know I don't want to get into the horrible results of all their programs that's not my point we could pick any one you want you know the war on poverty and then we look at the situation in the inner cities now the results of affirmative action et cetera et cetera\nBut that got me to thinking further\nGiven the track record of all the programs that have been brought to us by the left\nImagine the condition of the planet fifty years from now if we allow the left to put a program together\nTo stop global warming would we have category five storms on a weekly basis with the entire planet the one big huge sand box because it was one desert would we be an ice age I just I don't know I had to wonder about\nThat\nYeah I hear ya I definitely hear you but\nI take David comments\nAlways with a grain of salt because you know it's easy to by David is that he and he went into the whole oligarchy robbed child thing yesterday and he starts out almost every conversation\nMaking some valid points make it a little bit of sense and then somehow he breaks away into some kind of very loosely cobbled together segue\nInto global warming and they were almost every call\nThe genius of the left Michael is to put just enough truth and every lie to if you're not really paying attention or if you're not on top of things give it a little bit of credibility\nYeah it's a good point\nYou off but I don't know I you know when you look at the result of\nPlaces where Democrats have been in total control and I've been able to set the entirety of the policies and then you just look at the horror of the situations how can you deny these things and say you know we'll bus the Ross\nShells fall oh I don't know I don't get it\nRight now it's on ... because there are people out there for whatever the reason everybody on the left in particular and I'm not necessarily saying Democrats I mean the hard laughed\nBut there's a lot of extreme it they they have this need regardless of what the issue is Supreme Court justice whatever they've got to have a bogeyman to turn everybody's attention to\nAnd they're like All right go ahead\nIn the absence of racism or sexism they will create it to maintain

less uses fear to motivate the base it's always internal things it's fair of other Americans and what they were ... like what was that was one of the primary differences and how they want about doing things\nOh and it was a good point oh when you look you know the less never charged dispense people up about something that might attack us from the outside\nIt's always internal things and how bad America is and uh that's kind of the point you were making right there yeah you know looking at all and the man is always us for the left\nRight well it can be white guys you can be Christians can be

the right I'm jumping to conclusions uh in order to create more chaos a and that includes a Lindsey Graham I don't understand how and thankfully Donald Trump is in charge and he says look turkey is telling us we have the evidence or they have the evidence\nI'd like to see the evidence a turkey has sat supposedly on this evidence or on the suppose that evidence for days if not weeks and here we still sit waiting a you know this is a turkey Saudi Arabia issue this is not necessarily\nA United States issue yes he was a journalist for the Washington Post but he wasn't an American citizen\nOr and so when we were ... when when all of the um politicians that I've been seeing saying well turkey says it so well turkey is a dictatorship\nBy the way a and they run their media\nAre they are a government owned media uh and so the media will say whatever the Turkish government wants them to say much like the media here will say whatever the Democrats want them to say uh and so this whole new you know crisis right that's been manufactured over the death of this journalist\nUh I find is a little bit extreme in the sense that you know what\nDo we have a dog in the fight yeah he was an American journalist but it's just really are issue that's what the Saudi Arabia issued a and a turkey issue and when they talk about an MBA us the a print schooler second line that are thrown at the Saudi Arabia regime\nUm they said well you know like he jailed two hundred a bankers and\nRuler second line to the throne of Saudi Arabia regime um they said well you know a a heat jailed two hundred a bankers and a a finance here's a wealthy man of the Saudi Arabian regime well yeah he jail to honor them after the Las Vegas shooting and guess what\nThe uh the financing of the terror network of ISIS and others dried up uh they said two hundred million dollars a night that might be a little bit like\nA disappeared from the terror networks uh uh financing of terror the terror network or and so I really don't hold that against the print a but they're using that as a talking point as well is that he was a brutal dictator and to you know it was killing people\nAnd it maybe is but you know you never heard the Democrats talk about Saudi Arabia at all you'd never heard the Democrats talk about North Korea for the last eight years I never heard the Democrats talk about China as a matter of fact they were just deals with China and happy to do deals the communist Chinese\nSpain with the narrative of the media for for just a moment you've probably heard that oh ah\n... you know ... words tumble out of her ... again if you brought on her psychologist carbon acquire the Donald Trump isn't mentally fit for office because he called Stormy Daniels horse race\n[laughter] when I saw that tweet come across my phone I was drinking coffee at a nearly landed all over my dad's\n... yeah I make up residence ... get around had checked I mean look who she's marrying 'em Mika Brzezinski the legend and their own mind and let's just leave it at that she works for a hack network I sometimes I'll watch MSNBC just to get a few laps a but it's scripted it's like this\nIt's not news it's like a production\nUm it's an anti Trump\nProduction or what they have all of the same talking heads on all the\nSame time and they all hate Trump I don't really know who they're conservative pawn is I don't even know they have one like CNN has anti bio uh who claims to be a Republican supposedly a lifelong Republican but as supported Democrats most of her life uh and so you know it\nDoes anyone watch MSNBC does anybody watch Morning Joe with yeah maybe ten thousand people\nI mean these are they're echo chambers because they have a microphone and because they have the press the Democrats\nUm and because they can pay for mobs violent a communist anarchist mobs anti Semitic mobs like the women's march for example um\nThey believe they have more power than they do\nThey believe that they have more power or that\nThat they have more Americans in a ... a wind up with them than they do and that's why they want to destroy the electoral college because they're clocked trap works really well in the echo chambers of New York city like where Mika lives and I'm sure she lives a very nice life or daddy was a billionaire I think\nAh that works really well and the echo chambers of Portland I and maybe San Francisco and LA\nAh but in the rest of the country we aren't all socialists and the rest of the country we still have the presumption of innocence before being proven guilty or in the rest of the country we don't want our borders invaded uh and this is exactly why we hear the latest calls to the\nDestruction of the electoral college because it's so date at all the ... all the Democrats care much like I said earlier was about power\nAnd so when Hillary Clinton comes out and says we're not going to get ... get our power back okay yeah I remember when the Democrats had power or they used their power much like her husband but in a different way they used the\nHow we get our power back okay yeah I remember when the Democrats had power or they used their power much like her husband and I had a different way\nThey used the power of the federal agencies and the bureaucrats to go after their political enemies I and we just witness this from a treasury department official or who had a secret and sensitive financial information she was leaking but he sees\nAs the news right a ... on the behalf of\n'em and she wasn't asked to do it but she certainly well perhaps you live by your boss you know but in order to give more evidence\nTo the Mueller investigation and to create the a perception that many in the Trump Administration were crooks I mean if you don't think that the Democrats have an enemies list now or you're not paying attention or you're not listening\nOr you are familiar with the uh the animated feature from Dr seuss The Lorax\n\nNo maybe well essentially the low rider earlier but I Can't picture it\nWell it tells a story about a young entrepreneur who ... who he developed these things called me\nAnd if you want to think of them is just an all purpose sweaters but he did talk to make his needs he has to cut down these things called Trump fewer trees and eventually he goes down all the drop your trees and the forest disappears and all the animals leave\nAnd so over time there is this a kind of dictatorial character\nWho gathers all the populations in this particular area together and build these big walls around the city\nWhere all the trees are now all electronic and they all live within the walls of the city and he doesn't want people to get out and see a real tree for fear that he'll lose his power and he's just a diminutive little character and it's actually a very cute little movie and it's got some underlying\nPolitical tones to it but the idea is is that there's this one young boy discovers that there's wife outside of these walls any escapes outside the wall and he finds the one remaining seed that will allow him to replant the truck fuel the trees so the forces will grow back and forth back\nAnd the animals will return and the whole pretense of the movie is that this one little diminutive dictatorial character that looks eerily like Tim Young ... goes through this process where he's trying to keep his young boy inside the walls of the city last the young boy break out and see the real world\nIs there a wall around our Chicago's in our Los Angeles is and our Manhattan's roaming media perspective because it seems to me since you brought up echo chamber and occasional ...\nThis little this town a city seems to be an echo chamber where if you leave outside this wall you will be in a place of despair where there's no reality where you won't be protected view there won't be any safety or security and you're gonna die\n[noise] well yes he'll be walking amongst deplorable like Hillary Clinton\nAh yes asked of them\nAre and and the dragon stuff man kind like Joe Biden said now why would you want to be with the basket of ... or walk among the ranks of mankind ah that's how the Democrats have you the rest of the country or outside of their um progressive ass holes\nAh you know you look at San Francisco as a prime example they're paying\nPaying a people too in hazmat suits to clean up the streets because of the amount of feces that have plagued uh the tender line specifically a but many streets in San Francisco\nTo clean up the streets because of the amount of feces that have flagged\nOr the tenderloin specifically but many streets in San Francisco a hypothermia needles if your trip you'll probably fall on one um and so instead of going to your concierge and saying hey you know when I get a a map of Union Square you actually ask for a ...\nA ... and this is the progressive utopia\nI you know we all ... to to expand upon that you know going back you know to the hyper Dermot needles for example and the problem is as bad as you as you allude to\nIs that not a demonstration of how miserable people in California are that they're shooting up in the streets so they have to so they are able to drug themselves self medicate to the point that they don't have to recall where they are\n[noise] well you know I have a lot of friends in California and when you look at California I feel bad for them I Lived there for twenty three years [noise] um [noise] the concentration of this bill is specifically into really to area\nIt's LA county and its San Francisco that's it and then when you look at the rest of the state it's like well\nOK but the voter rolls are so incredibly polluted with non citizens you\nA may register but they don't necessarily get to the polls you know they're too busy hanging out with their friends the mall or taking selfies on Snapchat\nI'm so registration does not necessarily translate into votes\nA and but but not nonetheless this is exactly why we need the red wave or we need to overcome a the the celebrity quotient I'm like Taylor Swift and I don't think that tendency Marsha Blackburn is looking pretty well um you know I think that that show hold on but\nYou know again I I think that the Democrats have really angered\nAh many people are more than they realize specifically in their performance against cap it off and then of course as they continue to turn their backs on legal Americans in favor of illegal Americans I think that the Americans are going to turn their backs on the Democrats you know you look at the walk away with that\nAs one example but then you also look at how popular the president is with African Americans or if the Democrats fall below Ninety percent of African American votes they're done\nThey're done and I think that the ... of fact I is something exactly like what we need and then you have Candace Owens who's a wonderful vote voice uh for all Americans but specifically black Americans where she's waking people up and she is promising an October surprise this week\nOr so I think if we chip away at the demographics the Democrats have controlled for so long are the only way they are going to offset the walk away movement as if they engage millennials and that is a very tough thing to do\nSince you born in ... ah Christine Ford\n[noise] yeah you know who knows uh she was abused like many Democrat women are as Democrats needed her and she's been tossed aside you know and and at the same thing can be said for judge\nRoy Moore whether you like them or you don't like them or we're all those women that came forward glory alright I'll tell you what that if my daughter was abused by someone like Roy Moore I wouldn't go quietly into the night to this day I Would still be fighting a and so it kinda makes you scratch your head doesn't it\nAh we're all women that Gloria already have lined up against President Trump whether that was eleven or twelve or Thirteen of them where they go\nOn and so again the Democrats will use an abused primarily Democrat women\nAre in order to gain power and that's all it is it's not about the empowerment of women it's not about the protection of women it's not about the need to live that are in sexual assault or harassment uh it's about the Democrats power and one thing that is often overlooked in this whole new team is meant is that\nThe Democrat women are often abused by Democrat and then\nYou know you look at Bill Clinton for example and and the many women he abused whether it was Juanita Broderick or Kathleen ... they were Democrats they volunteered for his campaign you look at Keith Ellison\nKeith Ellison met these women at democratic fundraisers and and Democrat leading a and and his accusers have police reports they have medical reports they of text messages\nBut because they are fighting a Democrat man of course the Democrats will protect the Democrat man because they want to protect their power\nWell the only thing I'll take exception with with all your common Megan is that a quarter\nPerhaps we'll protect the Democrat man because they want to protect their power\nWell the only thing I'll take exception with with all your comment Megan is that according to Hillary Clinton with Bill and Monica Monica was at an age of consent so what difference does it make any more\n[noise] yeah now she's rewritten the whole entire sexual harassment law\nInto the fact that if you are an adult you can't be sexually harassed excuse me you're a sexual harassment most often times occurs in the workplace when you are out of college and you are starting much like Monica Lewinsky uh the whole definition of sexual harassment as a person in power abusing their power against their subordinate\nA Bill Clinton never loved her you never saw a future with Monica Lewinsky you simply thought a cigar in a blue dress that's all he wanted from her it was but said the abuse of power because he knew he could get away with it\nOn and so Hillary Clinton again a rewrites the rules in order to protect predatory behavior and now is told scores of young women that if they are a young woman in the workplace too bad you're an adult\nUh you can't claim a sexual harassment or or pursue sexual harassment charges thank God that that was not around when I was sexually harass\nRoutes I never had a bad it wasn't around in the pre Christine forward moments because that you know that unraveled that entire argument\nRight well she was Fifteen supposedly when she was drinking beer when she was assaulted allegedly by ... ... ah so I guess she wasn't really an adult um but you know forget the statute of limitations forget the lack of evidence we're all presumed guilty before proven innocent now\nBut not Democrat man\nWell you know now and and I don't have the details on it so I won't speak too much of it in depth\nBut now there seems to be some question about some of the allegations leveled against Harvey Weinstein scene and the veracity of those claims by some of the women and there's probably comes on the heels of the comment from Hillary Clinton as ... Monica Lewinsky\nSo now all of a sudden and also it calls into question\nThe conviction of Bill Cosby I understand the drug ... aspect of it but I'm just talking about you know whether or not there was any a compliance if you want to put it that way and it's just interesting to me and you know you you you make the comment about how Hillary Clinton changes the rules as it comes down to sexual assault\nBut she'll be the least bit surprise as you've changed the rules are but the emails and the server and a security clearance and everything else she's engaged in\nWell right and you know I was just tweeting earlier about Eric Schneiderman let's not forget about Eric Schneiderman he was the HGF New York you know he wasn't low on the total oil yet a lot of power and he used that power to beat up many Democrat when it\nUh and and and use such inflammatory racist language against them calling him calling many of them has brown slaves that didn't even really appear in the press did it you know\nI said the press of course it's going to cover up the high crimes and misdemeanors and the sexual assault sexual harassment and ignore them ... and by doing so\nAh they elicit a not not only more false claims but then they ah\nThey basically take away from the severity and seriousness of the claims of the of the legal or truthful or evidence Sherry claims\nI and so this has been historical what the Democrats this is why I was never a Democrat you know I was thinking about voting for Bill Clinton at one time when I was becoming more politically astute and I turned Eighteen ah but then I saw what Hillary and bill did and the you know ten minutes\nBill Clinton at one time when I was becoming more politically astute and I turned Eighteen ah but then I saw what Hillary and bill did and the you know ten minutes now isn't it and the feminist it to Monica Lewinsky and the others that I've come forward\nA and that changed my mind I said I'm never going to be a Democrat I'm never going to be a ... that's how they treat women and this is how they've treated women historically an end to this day you know the rose McGowan who really was the\nThe figure head up the me too movement she was the first one that charge Harvey when whites gene with rape or she said the me too movement has become a joke and it really has because it's not for all women are they would be rallying behind Keith Alice was accusers they pick and choose their victims they create victims\nAh and they ignore that the truth perpetrators I if the perpetrators are Democrats\nIt's a politically motivated movement\nYou're spot on as always Meg I'm unfortunately our time has come to a ... tell us how we can find out more about making bars give us all the addresses\nA regular ... dot com Reagan they've on Twitter Reagan babe on Facebook meeting equalizer dot com same handles on Twitter and Facebook stop the scalping are activists group on Facebook stopped the scalping that he has a hundred and eleven twelve thousand strong now and red wave dot vote or read way of America on Facebook\nVery good Megan will get my own radio show in a little bit\nI was gonna say I was going to ask you about what what is your timeframe\nI'm hoping to launch before the midterms I'll be on a statewide Michigan Radio for right now a and hopefully you know you'll be able to stream it pick it up and and every Saturday morning for right now I'll I'll have my weekly raft uh called the heat\nAre very noise well congratulations and we're very proud for your Megan\nThank you so much as always a pleasure things Michael thank you talk to you next week okay Bye bye bye\nBye guys quick break come back to wrap this thing up as we make preparations for Scott ... and based on the radio you're listening to the Michael heart German supervision went along W.

up by the full story OK old or so or you got a\nMany well most of the time we don't get to see the cross tabs we really don't get to see who they\nWho they sampled where they you know where they ask the questions and there's no doubt in my mind that they skew the sample\nThe population that's questioned to help Democrats there's no doubt about that also believe that many of the numbers that we are seeing when they come along and they say will Chris Chris Reed has a three point advantage on sky or I six points advantage almost got\nThat they are not telling us where the undecideds are breaking and their polling with\nPeople who absolutely no they're voting for ... people who absolutely voting no they're voting for Scott so that the the news story says there Chris is winning by seven points and I'm just gonna you know just for the fun of it say that you were the Democrat\nBut they know that the undecideds are leaning towards the Republicans or the undecideds are probably breaking Republican so you have a you have a sample that's tilted to the left and then you leave certain portions now and you leave out the follow up questions\nAnd then we'll come election day are closer to the election they realize All right I've kind of skewed this to the public to backtrack a little bit and say\nThen we'll come election day are closer to the election they revise All right I've kind of skewed this to the public to backtrack a little bit and say things are changing but my question is are we really in such bad shape in the house or is it still more of them not exactly\nBeing up front with where the numbers really are because I I have this gut feeling that we ... we we're we're going to be better in the house than people think we are\nWell it is growing it during one party rule the average loss in the house and the mid term is forty eight so we're already even if he loses out we're going to do remarkably better than Obama that if we I mean he ... he lost like sixty four seats or something some crazy number like that\nWhat you're describing Scott is exactly what's happening in the New Jersey race to the undecided will all break republic Republican 'cause everybody's already decided they're not going to vote\nFor that senator but I Do think there is an inherent\nBias and some of the polls and that's one reason why the polls that Hillary Clinton uh turned out to be an accurate now if you looked at rationing which generally has a lot more fair Trump has a fifty percent approval rating whereas the other polls have him like forty five forty four\nI think the breakdown in a district polls are generally going to be less biased but you're right there's still a lot of undecided\nUndecided it's usually break against the income but the problem is the undecided break against the income that many of those seats\nAre Republican so we'll see what happens\nI Do think that they're more the ... the Democrats kind of show their true colors and kind of ... show people just how far left\nAnd I'll pick socialist they are I think that can only benefit us and the things that happened recently with Elizabeth Warren and Hillary Clinton saying it's All right to commit violence it's only helping us and it's like I always say I don't always know that the Democrats\nWant power because every time there are about to win an election they somehow find a way to lose it\nSo we'll see uh I did talk to Congressman Tom or if you believe that we're going to be able to keep the house with a very\nNarrow margin and if so that would be\nPhenomenal even if we keep but in order for us to maintain that for two years we would have to get at least five point buffer because people can switch parties people die cetera so we really have to look if we went up by one or two that's going to leave me a little bit nervous that means that could switch during the intervals so\nI Do think we have a chance we just need to make sure every Republican voter gets out there and it's important even in states states like Alabama because he wanted to get the popular vote up because that helps the party nationally\nWell it also it ain't it will keep the the don't laugh from saying a given give you a great example\nThere were thousands of Alabamians during the last presidential election who knew that Donald Trump was gonna win Alabama\nAnd they and they were told by pundits in in this day the way you know it doesn't really matter because Donald Trump is going to win an Alabama he's going to win by twenty points you can win and Mississippi by twenty points he's gonna win in Arkansas about twenty points those places were told\nIt it doesn't really matter now in the New York's into Pennsylvania's nice places like get out and in in showed the to support Hillary we got to get out and make history and we got to get out and do all this stuff and then when it's over\nWe get to hear this crap trap of well Hillary won the popular vote\nMy argument is is possible that millions of people in solidly red states said it doesn't even matter we're we're going to the Republicans are going to blow the Democrats out here so\nSolidly red states said\nIt doesn't even matter we're we're going to the Republicans are going to blow the Democrats out here so some of this whole popular vote versus ... is just a bunch of bunk\nBecause there are places where people will not vote because they know the Republicans are going to win but you're saying and I'm saying that even in Alabama we've got to go out we've got to make a statement and we've got to prove that millions of Americans are for this these policies and we want to see conservatism move forward\nYeah and it's important\nFor our democratic listeners to remember that this year Republicans vote on the six than Democrats voted on the seventh I just want to make that public service announcements just to make sure they don't show up on election day\nAnd they can vote on their phone texting me or just takes me the word Democrat who ah whatever number my to my cell phone number and I will go ahead and log that in with the secretary of state and you won't even have to worry about going to vote\nThat's the public that's ... that's the kind of public servant you are but you're right\nI mean honestly if you actually look at the popular vote Trump won the popular vote if you leave out California and in Alabama you know we don't consider them state anyway ah right so but for California having so many overwhelming Democrats\nAre yeah and and they vote him out of illegals out there and they just had a story in the last week or so ... where there are are are bad we don't we don't know how in this one little place we registered Fifteen hundred illegal aliens devote well\nThat's the one spot how many people were on the rolls illegally voting in that state and how many dead ones are voting\nYou you know the the Democrats are doing so bad that didn't allow the last elections a dead people broke Republican for the first time\nSo [laughter] that you know you're\nGoing to die when the kid he gets the dead people vote for you but um yeah people that think there's never any election fraud does need to understand American history now\nThere they did major reforms um instead they're actually cracking down and doing a better job Colorado's a great model or do I do think the illegal boating because of some of the reforms that Trump had actually put in place for ... I haven't even talked about\nIs going to go down thankfully um but I mean it's true like we we it's I find it very odd that the Democratic point\nOn voting is that you don't need an id you don't need nature check you gotta make sure there's no reason anyone would ever tried to steal election\nAnd then they say the Russian stole the election so it's kinda like All right which one is it so\nI I Do think we got to do a better job of playing out our voter rolls making sure that everything is fair but I don't know that in mid term you really going to have as many people trying to cheat as say a presidential election\nBut hopefully with the administration and apparently have they're going to be able to make sure that does not happen only twenty but if the election were held today again for for Hillary and drop the last poll I saw\n... wins the popular vote and I think he picks up two or three other states and sore [laughter] and so I think if things get comedy continues to do well Trump continued his popularity I think he'll eat and would they nominate Warren were easily get a win reelection twenty twenty and I can imagine\nThe crying that's going to take place on CNN that day that's going to make I I'm going to record every minute of that day though when I feel that I can really watch it just like I didn't say sixteen\nYou gotta Chris Reed is my guest them to read all from ...

the climate\nThat Iraq they used to call the Alberta before we decided that was horrible but that's what I heard actually meant\nWith the concept apart money which is that we said hunters\nBut that's what I've heard I actually meant\nWell except for first class that hard with the concept of parsing honey which is that we said punished harm someone\nOr use our power and four cents ... cents possible in order to get our site outside so that might mean that\nThere's a there's a question of punishment\nThat tells you that that sounds that was impacted by a crime I could look different ways depending on the crime and hit effects and that's what they really watch 'em and then as a portion of your punishment or accountability that's about making sure you don't want to get three adult patient component so that's why it depends on the individual maybe someone yeah they\nSay oh they sent a couple of months I sent them so they you know they need to go through some treatment of

reason\nAnd do I believe\nThat what she served your time you should have the ability to get back and have a real laugh yes do I believe in God ... you know do I believe that eventually you got to put on your big boy parents or your big bore you underwear\nIt is you're alive regardless of what may happen\nWell let me ask you in in in ... you know I told you I I probably freaked her out when I said the people would do something a little kids I wouldn't worry about them because in my world or they're just doing I hang up\nTheir over rock and when I said oh that's the opera die she she almost died [noise] but ah for an hour yeah\nWhich is now been translated oh that is horrible and brutal\nActually an unbelievable advancement in civilization\nWhich said the punishment\nFits the crime that is what I've heard I was because before ah for\nIt huh you did something small\nAnd they put a few to the nth degree you stole you killed one of the king's beer\nYou were executed\nAfter and I was actually a supervising thing but now we've become so an educated that we do know and offer an iron sales like\nOh are you part mined part cat oh it's terrible brutal horrible it's astounding\nWhat we don't know if they've served their time yes can get their rights back to vote\nYes but there's a process already that says hey look I I'm Out I'm doing well and and voting matters to me I ... the process of taking a look I Would actually let you have your good rides back to\nEven you know this thing about you can't have your gun rights back if you committed a felony I don't know if it's all felonies but if you stole a car when you're Eighteen what can you not defend yourself or your family\nI don't know if it's all felonies but if you stole a car when you're Eighteen\nWhat can you not defend yourself or your family when you're thirty it makes no sense\n... turn turn liberal I have a shot I can only imagine how bad it would be to not be able to get a job now look we we're not going to do away with your record\nYou go out and commit another crime after you've made and brave in and we said you know after ... we're going to Bush duty to a degree you're just going to be making beer out here in the little rocks but I think we should we ought to give you a shot\nThat role is that there were\nSo you stole a car when you're Eighteen you should just never ever ever\nTo have a normal lives the way a lot of people on the wrong thing\nI'll be right if anybody can get I don't think they thought is the problem Ron welcome to the program\nIs there a serious libertarian even on the ballot for telling me to vote for\nIs there a serious libertarian even on the ballot for ... for\nA no not that I Know of but uh it was just you know that was just to make a point\nAnyway thanks I added to you too buddy ...\nKeep on rolling Charles welcome to the program yeah thanks for having me on Scott\nHi Charles sorry you miss Chris but he's on the road so on my list\nMaybe he's listening I'll tell you is very relevant that you had him early on especially with what's happened recently with um with Kay Avi saying that the person's can go longer without getting parental now yes I I think I think the parole board being reform is what is necessary\nI truly believe that they should see and speak with the individual I also think that in the case where you said the kid or whoever stole the car and that may not necessarily need to have their ... completely gone forever yes I Believe it should be a degree that the legislature leads to that parole board upon interviewing and seeing the nature of the crime\nThat they allow person to do what you were talking about [noise]\nBut that's going to take some parole board for reform and the other thing\nI mean are there Charles what other thing though if if the person is found guilty and the judge says them to jail for\nThree years is\nA lot of it is really up to the judges but don't forget if you're out on parole\nAnd it's not hard to say all the right thing and you know I'm reformed I've found the more I just want to get back I mean nobody in prison guilty and they're all ... many times so you know it's just far more complicated I just wish we would\nMake it kind of simple the crime the punishment fits the crime\nAnd\nOnce you get out we expect the best from you and then if you screw up again dropping and don't forget all this pressure against the three strikes walls with three strikes for goodness sakes I don't care if the last strike was just cause you had a a bag full of marijuana in your car really it's three strikes you're screwed up\nThere by marijuana on why why are you going there I don't know what are you at home or in my home buyer because that's what everybody always use\nThat he wouldn't hurt anybody it's just I'm like look if you're on a third strike oh you guess mountain oh sorry I'm Sorry it was the other to the head you going\nFor ... and I'm ... I'm agreeing with you on that and I for one thing I Would say about what she she just stayed about persons waiting longer to be paroled out yes when you go in that courtroom you actually later wheeling and dealing with the prosecutor\n... with the idea of you would get paroled and be up for parole at this particular time I bought her bringing that making that burger is actually like what would be an agreement with the court no longer being a proper agreement with the court anymore\nExcept Charles I know that there were some alterations to the rules for\nPorn which was supposed to try to clear out some of the people from the prison which\nCan order granting people parole a head of that agreement with the court\nIt kind of automatically so it's not necessarily going back on those agreements I think\nYou know they canceled itself outside of this\nI think that's where we are yes there are also\nWhat what we're going to be in a lot more trouble do with what I was telling yesterday about them letting people out on their operate cognizance oh I'm gonna I'm gonna do well that was the more people in the wild ruined go into prison\nThe part I didn't ask him only about ... and you can tell kind of where she means I mean I understand is why we\nWell that was the more people in a while we're not going to prison well\nThe part I didn't ask him only about ... and you can tell kind of where she leans I mean I understand is why we have to have this discussion Thanks Charles I don't know why I just hung up I'm Sorry\nI'm is what do you what do you tell the people\nIn the neighborhoods when criminal justice reform was kind of working in the Alabama Legislature Campbell was care and some of that stuff and I know for a fact people in the neighborhoods impacted by crime were actually asking the state legislature\nDon't do this reform you want to do 'cause I don't well that the back in my neighborhood I don't care if you only send him to jail for some minor thing he's he's a myth is we know it don't let him out\nSomebody's got to listen to those people they live it every day it's easy\nTo set up in some of the a safe neighborhoods around the state and say ah let 'em out let 'em out that\nThe people who have to deal with it day to day have a a have a tough time\nWho was next we're going to go to the ... question order so yeah lane or what\nThe let's go ... so tell me what's going on All right so rose are sent to a pack here in Alabama okay two hundred thousand dollars\nWhy don't ... care about all that\nWell I'm sure after the Roy Moore incident no but that was flooded here and we talked about it a little bit then why are people from outside of Alabama trying to tell us how to vote and everything here in Alabama\nAnd that's a good point I only met let me ask this question should we had this big one\nShould Russians be able to try to influence elections in the United states presidential elections well for more\nTo live so that they did but everybody else the regular people are saying no they should\nThey should not do should chimed in the Chinese be able to influence elections in the United states\nNo an answer will be no rush so Russia's can't Chinese can't the Israelis are supposed to we mess around their elections but that's another show\nSo why is it okay for Soros I don't care if he has American citizenship or not he doesn't live in the state of Alabama but he's not original so what he's not yeah he's not original southerner whose not original American boat\nSo why why is it okay for somebody from New York to play around in the state elections in Alabama oh well this Asian Americans got really\nDo you say I think I'm agreeing with you why why do we let people from outside mess around in state elections\nWell that's that's no different than me from Huey town\nAnd you're running for mayor and I'm over there going hey well I don't care if you're a mayor or not and guard right and I'm not running for mayor you just making that up right well you should probably ... or or maybe running for mayor in huge town which I'm not but it may be coming over there man and given money in your ...\nTo ... to my component because you don't like me you see what I'm saying it should be the people from Huey town that's decided I don't want you from Gardendale coming over and telling me what I should and should not do\nI I think there's a lot of lot of truth to that\nAnd I don't want Soros or anybody else you know and that's what a lot of people you know talk about you know like the Ted Cruz that's happening in Texas well that's for them to decide I don't need to be going to Texas and say anything I mean even though the do the he's running against was talking about a ...\nWell that's for them to decide I don't need to be going to Texas and say anything I mean even though the do the he's running against was talking about a blind squirrel the other day I don't know if he's saying that\nWe talked about a bond squirrel and this yet by a nut yeah but\nThis guy was talking about a real squirrel that was blind and they were traveling a thousand miles\nTo ... to take this squirrels to a\nBeta was saying that yes well don't forget Beto O'Rourke the hero of the left\nWho was talking about his mom being a lifelong Republican did you say that no other than say so what are the things that Democrats would
