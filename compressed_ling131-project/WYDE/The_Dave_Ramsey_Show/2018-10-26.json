at a couple of specific Rice's perhaps\nUm and of course the you know the the big one in the room is the governor's race a governor ... the uh food most popular governor in America which is which is just fantastic uh she spoke last night at a yellow him a awards event\nUh here in Birmingham ah she was inspirational uh I thought she spoke very very well unlike other politicians including Walt Maddox she doesn't trouble with the huge entourages just governor will I be standing at a table or trying to everybody and taking photos with everybody that comes across\nA how are you feeling going into the uh an election for governor\n[noise] well if if our folks will show up at their motivated and that's something I'm always concerned about is complacency rode out we're gonna have a good night on November is sick but that still that big yeah um you know one of the challenges and in\n... and having such a red state and I think Alabama's been ranked fit but it's conservative state that Gallup poll I got called out without because I feel like we're at first\nI Would think so [laughter] I think it just seems like that and you know nowadays if you\nSomething that must be true to stop feel like\nWe're number one pollsters hadn't been very accurate or in the last few years\nWell no but but but let's just say we're we're top five I think that like fair to say one of our challenges is is is trying to get people motivated and not sit back and get what you got it all but I'm I'm a big sports fan especially college for um\nSports and whatnot that would that champions\nThat we all let champion everyone watches but champions don't read they don't go up I got the cost of all I Want that one of the blue ribbon or you know first in a track or whatever are my team lot what the way that they got back and they say how can I Do that or I Can't get faster how can I fix\nPracticing or whatever on my team was what they do is they go back and they say how can I Do that or how can I Do it faster how can a fix my mistakes what did I met and those that's Mike's champions and so I work with a group\nChampions across Alabama and they're called patriot they're good oh yeah not American citizens that say I love my state I lost my county I care I just came here and the founding fathers gifted us with the greatest gift\nIn in ... in in mankind and our history on planet earth with with the demasi with democracy with the bill of rights of the constitution\nWas American retired from the ... that's one of us are\nI mean it's one reason the group the caravan as we call them as you know we're trying to get in it you don't see any of us trying to get out there to try to get it right and so we have a great team of people and I'm really just citizens patriots is is it your neighbor\nSure your your relatives ditch your church folks at your school friends and and we we just think that conservative policies that and so but on the flipside of that that's the good days the flip side for us\nNot to be complacent\nAnd say oh we've got it all oh they don't even though I don't need to got more worried to him back\nIn ... yes and in fact is if any thing right now with the noise that we hear from the resist don't across our state in pockets now it is it pockets of Alabama but it is they're across our nation now we need to um\nPut put our nation put our state first and and not our complacency so that is always my number one fear\nA less railroad oil agree with you wholeheartedly you know or ... or ... or seen the ... the governor why these opponent a Walt Disney world from ... a couple of going to have a couple of computers to sleep you\nKnow you you you know just put 'em in or whatever and seen him a couple of times it seems the mayor of Tuscaloosa seems to be much more liberal when he looks on now is that we just\nAre seeing something which would ... that would that be an accurate description\nNo I think that's an accurate description not because\nI Want it today or you want it to the people want it today I think it is what it is\nUm when he says out loud I Am so glad George from ... that money to packs of guide me money I'm so glad that happen and when he says I'm pro life though on the Internet to\nWhich simply steps Alabama's alive state there is no legislation by the light on them to tell you there's no laws that are trying to please\nEveryone don't let Planned Parenthood who's been in a million dollars in Alabama and television and digital radio scary\nMy dad that's\nThat's fake news right there and I'm going to come at a rally crashed I'd forgotten about when he\nRight when he when he looked at you on TV goes but I'm pro life but he turned right around and he gets he gets in with Planned Parenthood and and them fighting us\nThose were were making things and that is totally contradicts\nContradiction to what he is saying us looking at us in a saying it so I think what people will have to do is use your gut instinct on that\nWhat about this is not making sense when I see him standing up at a press conference with I'm senator Hank Sanders who's right around at a purple bus rowing boat or die stickers on it\nAnd I see him standing next to Doug Jones who we now clearly see is is less progress that we see the money Chuck Schumer helped him get elected he's a truck shoot\nIn standing next to Doug Jones who we now clearly see it is less progress that we\nSee the money Chuck Schumer helped him get elected with trucks you know\nI mean I I just tell everyone you know what Alabamians are smart and they're going to see through this a absolute a show they're putting on\nYou know there are no Jim and we have a goal of Michael is on the line Michael you a question for Jim and light the\nGerman ... I Hope you're doing well how did you join the show you should I question as an Auburn fan you think it's a coincidence that the Republican Party adopted the Alabama orphanages mascot\nOkay now they there was a big growth model I I Would rather he hasn't asked me about like you know Russian collusion up some of my goals of you're going to get in trouble here but let me just say yes I Am and all of our girl or a Gulf War and I will roll part\nUh how'd ... terrible\nYou know there's money going to school spending people good jobs\nUh\nHow'd ... terrible it's terrible out right how I mean I'm not I wouldn't wish not all sleep well tonight and I just\nCan't kill it and actually it was not the government is doing the things that people\nIt's the people when you implement a when you get\nYou vote that's that's the first step right that officials aren't that the first step of voters or the first step the voters or the board of directors they determine which way our ship is going to go and when I go to the voting booth and do that in it and put in conservative Republicans not liberal Democrat\nThis is what we get this is a simple I don't know it could be a better cause and effect\nYeah this is what happens if you do this is what happens is is this thing over here well that's what's gonna happen and I guess that is just has to make that decision do they like what's happening or you're better off is Ronald Reagan said you're better off now than you were a year to four years ago I think the answer is pretty much yeah yeah\nYeah I should have paid more attention in college I Would have gone that whole cause and effect or a thing [laughter] now chairman of one could be much longer to\nGeorge Soros this Boston today or a couple of days ago he pouring money into long we Planned Parenthood to wall medics and other Democrats ...\nYou know I read in my view so correct but he put nearly three hundred thousand dollars into medics combine surely a you know this late stage\nThat money is going to be spent on you know getting out the vote in those more liberal areas sort of around Birmingham man broke a ... you know where we might not normally vote\nBut you know he's going to spend this or you know there's two hundred thousand enjoyed store is a gold coins uh uh trying to get people to to to vote\nHow much you ... do you think that we have on races down ticket like I'm Talking about in Jefferson County in some of the other counties or you know how much effect will statewide get out the vote campaign to these like ... with George sources money have on those rights as\nWell I you know first of all I think I heard that Mr ... put six hundred thousand dollars hole in the tax now I don't know I haven't looked to be done on a date that on where it all and um you know he's that's just play money for him so that's kind of like mind blowing but\nThe fact of the matter is I I don't know how they're going to spend their money and I don't know what they're going to do but\nI'd really like to think and I really believe in my heart and just watching what's going on in our state how how wonderful things are for folks that\nThey're that Alabamians will show up\nAnd maybe regardless of something they saw on TV or something or start running across it at all you know they'll look around and go gosh things are things are going really well in our state\nUm the national news it seems to be a very loud because they're on a chair to get Donald Trump and they're not going to be stopped ... seven so um I don't know how they're going to spend the money but I'd like to think that the diabetic service policy when people walk in the day that that that's where they're going to plant themselves\nRegardless of where they live in regards to how they send them\nWe hope you right now just one last thing can you we touched on this the when you first joined us\nYou know the cooling now the great pretender would senator Doug Jones no influence bleak for you know majority of Alabamians certainly folks listening to die or the when I say how hole and just show I was at his treatment of no justice a cabinet or\nA you know an incumbent I didn't vote against the judge who was\nAnd just ... I was at his treatment of now just as a cabinet or a you know and then come when I did not vote against the judge who was I hardly hardly qualified jurors your\nSenator Jones went against the will of people in Alabama how can you justify that boost and what what what is the endgame here as he becoming a shoe for Chuck Schumer so we can get a job on CNN or MSNBC and to use\nIt seems like as in game is to come back to Alabama center the he'd like to yes thing I mean I I don't know what kind of ... housing leases he has a big say that I wouldn't sign anything more than six months at a time look here's what he did he went on a and you anybody can Google it are you to that he he\nLike he went on national TV on CNN and my job and a lot of other people that too and he said\nUh well um when asked by national news reporter also don't you think I mean we understand that the Georgia of Alabamians want you to vote yes on a half an hour and you're going to vote you you're going about NATO and he said well that might be so hot\nIt's not the end all be off\nNow listen to that for that might be so the majority of that might people might want me to but I'm not\nAnd went further out later on several days later he said well ... thanks now my staff with the fact that we came to this is just so he and his staff right [laughter] so he's governing for stuff\nYeah it's on thinking Alabamians are going hey hey overhear us up yeah um you know ... or ... he's always had it right on the topic\nAnd ah I think that that John could learn a few things from the states men ah Richard Shelby on when it comes to things like this for sure but I I just um look what you got ... now and I'm going to work across the aisle he would you call it along with interesting and the album still off\nAn even under circumstances\nThat we found herself and Annette right\nBut yeah that that's not what he's doing he's a real a real sick this\nYear he's a true believer I you know I my uh my day job I have a a governor ... ... ... the booth we started to pretend to call into potential candidates are and we even have it as a hash tag when we put her account these candidates matter\nAnd ah you know we saw this play out you know we put Doug Jones had mislead\nA but even wants to be candidates matter and you know we sort of get report you saw a little bit I guess but uh now before we let you go which we have to do 'cause we are because I'm getting the ... from a big dive\nUh uh what's your predictions for the house and Senate and can the Republican Party hold the house\nWhen I see CNN last few days I'm Talking about well wait a minute\nMaybe the Democrats want won't take the house over oh wait a minute maybe our numbers are wrong to me that signals they're getting a little soft in their messaging and so I I think we pick up in a Senate seat in the United States Senate\nI I have not bought and so that we're losing how we're seeing record turnouts around the nation in early voting\nAnd and the Republicans are crushing it in early voting so I I think this is a narrative the national news is I think if they say it over and over and ask you then maybe we'll country you know what they were wrong it twenty sixteen\nMother probably was wrong and everything they threw out us was wrong and so I I think we should hold are we going to lose some\nIran it twenty sixteen ... all the Palin what's wrong and everything they threw out the strong and so I I I think we are we going to lose some we are allowed to have been drawn that is one thing I was talking to somebody today Murray

you think everybody thinks I'm a decent politician\nOh she's the best [laughter] now you didn't really does you planted a breast cancer awareness thing today\nAnd I was way or the classic or a ... van a had a um had an event that the harbor center and a ... hour tell you not to burn up too much time but to anybody with who's a breast cancer survivor\nDying and had a\nTriple negative breast cancer and I will tell you the I I Would I Would my comments will be entitled the making of a uh matriarch because you know you got a patriarch or much you are right the way she did that uh she handled that was as much grace the radiation the uh the tack to cure the uh\nUh what's that middle one is called the red devil\nAnd uh she had those three are will kind of on edge you know chemotherapies but the bottom line is is I was even\nYou don't want her hair started falling out she knew she couldn't count me on me to cut that air so what did you do if she calls my youngest son who's already bald headed and she came out shaved\nOr ... but I saw a real shock girl I'm more into something that uh she would go anywhere to speak to anybody about uh early detection and breast cancer\nAnd uh I saw somebody that I began to share her face more\nAnd uh I just saw someone who's really really shy become a major fundraiser for us to be a radiation ... radiation uh on ecology\nAccelerate research where there is in doubt professor professor ... named after her ... and this is a ... a girl that that when I say the making of a matriarch I mean you absolutely odd and doing because she is done more than I ever could in that area like I said\nShe knew not to ask me to say we're headed 'cause I could\nSee like I said I couldn't do it either that I Would kind of freak me out anyway would share of Mike Hi all in the studio right now I call the number is non for one one zero one one non for one one zero one one if you'd like to watch the share of the question a sheriff's\nGuy so\nJefferson County isn't just Jefferson County as we understand it dried it's no that's wrong orders of Jefferson County you go or like it's what nearly twelve thousand square twelve hundred square mile\nAbout that a thirty eight cities and towns are I think uh twenty eight different a ... a law enforcement agencies are so it's a it's not just like a single city in a single jurisdiction and uh it's the one that as you know Greg the criminals don't\nGive a darn about the boundaries city limits and they use that against us but uh but it's a very\nDiverse area a great place to live as you know I Know you fall in love with their since you just love it his yes yeah absolutely ... so that's going to be what a million people or thereabouts you know the metro areas but it's about six hundred and forty four thousand in in Jefferson County okay uh I Would say about four hundred\nThousand or a registered\nPeople were tiles in in in Jefferson County okay ah I Would say about four hundred thousand or a registered voters usually about two hundred thousand will vote in elections okay well yeah it's a it's Brittany do\nWell I can I ask ...\nYou'll see some of the ... [laughter] I think that ... I was growing up I was so glad to see that you're helping some of the smaller towns out well by giving the communications I ... a friend of mine\nIs the chief of police in a Lipscomb yes and a good guy would yeah oh yeah very nice guy have called him for advice on a few things yes super nice guy and he's that way with everybody not just me\nBut I Will make it out there and then he will yeah and the the funny thing is is that you all had some surplus or something tell us about\nThat well we uh as you have to upgrade radio systems we've had a great radio system in Jefferson County\nIs kind of like the use of fiber optics or digital and uh we were forced to do the county commission or it was just best for us to a\nTo change out if we ever wanted to get into encryption and things like that ... we had to be able ... not that we are but uh we had to change our our radio radio system\nRadios heart you know the actual in common is that part of the being compatible with the idea that you could actually right that is going back and uh we had some of our older units that we just\nHad and really we didn't have a use for them and they're going to be a good Robin for another\nTen or eleven years and uh but of course we changed all of hours outside of the art but the bottom line is you had a smaller jurisdictions\nThat had to make decisions about whether or not this county the city government was going to renew and rebuild their own individual systems or they were ... they were going to be a part of the Jefferson County system\nAnd ah this allows them to be part of the jumps in Ghana system\nThis allows them to talk with each other talk with ... ... there's there's a deal that they are co pay call that an any emergency you know whether it be a tornado right or I or ... or a timely last forcing event like we saw on TV to die they're going to be switch I Will switch over and talk to our ...\nWe got him out of the closet but I ... I wanted to have some by you know hope all these\nCitizens agree with this if you give somebody something it's almost like wow that's not worth anything\nI wanted them to buy into it so we're doing half the programming they're two and a half from now that's good and that's also so we just going to get a break and we'll be right back with you a pile Colin non for one one zero one one [noise]\nInterested in the sheriff in and one other thing\nWe have Thirteen school districts and uh all I can say is I Want to be what we tried to be a good example\nWas asked sorrows and when we created that Ninety nine but ah now we've shown the national trend I guess with Parkland where I looked at and I know did you say that Parkland is that uh in in Florida with the F D did not know where to go in or stay or go in well you know what\nThat changed the national conversation today is an expectation that once we're there we give you a body armor we give you the right well weapons would give you the right avenue should we expect you to go in and disrupt the shooter and so what I and also the national conversation was we want somebody in every school\nAnd and the national conversation talked about retired military retired a debt these are our police officers or to volunteer I wiped out the volunteer because that that's just not going to happen [laughter] I thought what I did do is I went up partnered with the Jefferson County commission a\nPartner with uh the school board and I parted with the Jessica personnel board we're funding in permission because they were American system\nAnd I got enough by and and now we have a deputy in every county school there's no more soft targets with elementary schools so that's covered now what does that mean for the other twelve districts\nYou call Katie I'm gonna let you go swimming getting ready for the next caller\nBut what that means is is that we can set a good example for some other school districts like a Hoover is doing and like Fairfield by the way he has signed a contract with us or a ... district they won't one of our as I ... I think that's a giant step forward I think that's the right way to do business\nWhy has signed a contract with us to a parochial school district they won't one of our as rose I think that's a giant step forward I think that's the right way to do business so Katy uh appreciate the question because us at some point in time if you expect you sure to have the leadership and division\nAnd to develop the partnership with other agencies to\nGet the job done and that's what my dad he's done and that's I think that's the case here if we will go back to the Mac and just a second we got a couple of by the coolest put a Larry you're on line one Larry got a question things going thanks for\nYes sir sheriff this is Larry I live in a Hoover I'm a big supporter of years and I think you're doing a great job in\nA have a son out of ... and over pretty well [laughter]\nWell I Hope it never pulled\nMe out yeah [laughter] I Will tell even though he's dead [laughter]\nBut uh yeah I've been reading about the Mac and a and I'm Still I just think it's amazing what is it gets so stove piped here in Jefferson County and people only care about their city or their area but you found a way to\nReally uh bring everybody along what was the secret of that how are you able to bring some of these folks cause the crime reduction that you have experienced in in ...\nIn the last year and a half has been a unbelievable and I think you know national recognition I with that and and and uh and and so it's just I Want to to does for what you're doing and\nAnd but I'm curious to know how did you finally get everybody on board to to do something that uh uh you know it's so so so innovative is is this well\nThat's a that's a great question I you know being in it a\nI've been here since I was elected in Ninety eight and a a made a lot of relationships and a lot of partnership like with my buddy chief Nick nurses out in Hoover\nAnd uh to cook over the over mountain broke or Tim Raul sin home would and it's just it is is is relationship driven but a lot of times projects like the metric crime center\nOutstrips the ability for the local jurisdiction to fund does that make sense\nOf what happens he died booted lair okay what happens I asked her ads for Larry David yes [laughter]\nAnd the sheriff has a unique opportunity to step in and and I don't mean any disrespect by this\nBut just be a big brother to understand what the needs are of the other communities and have a desire\nThis part of your DNA to won't Hoover to succeed that won't mountain brute to succeed to need for the city of Birmingham to succeed so the vision\nIs easy to come up with and when they trust you I'm Talking about these different cities than they will buy into it and I would like I'll end on this this vision we didn't charge him a dime for we ... we wanted them to bring a detective and there are there a report saying\nThat's just like with a captain woods over and looked so you want him to do good out their absolute goes the better they do there the last you have to come in the community and do stuff and you got how about this you've got other places that you need to be how about if twenty seven oh the police\nDepartments are all bored with me at the Mac you tell me where the criminals are going to Greg and they're going to the one that don't exactly right\nOh we got one more call before the ... let's take camel line for hey Kim thanks for calling you have a question for the sheriff\nYes I'd like to say\nBut uh we got one more call before the let's take care of them alone for hey Jim thanks for calling or you have a question for the sheriff's\nYes I'd like to say something to to Mike hell if I can I mean I'm a Democrat and I'm a liberal but uh about ten years ago I had a debilitating mental illness and I had gotten violent and chased share Stefanie came out to my house\nAnd the amount of care and the amount of compassion that they showed me it ...\nIt was astounding they made sure I got to a hospital jail they realized what I needed um and I just got to tell you just because of his own that's the way to ... for you\nEvery time you know what the gentleman they did not learn this compassion without the help of you and I firmly believe that that shows what kind of leadership the cheapest gas and I just wanted to say thank you for your um\nYour welcome and look I'm I think I'd be able to take a step further\nIs I inherited basically a white male dominated a sheriff's office and it's just been my absolute privilege to turn the sheriff's office\nIn to warn that reflects a community it's not about being a Democrat and it's not about being a Republican surely that's maybe that's the case on November six but the service component of the sheriff's office it's not about that\nAnd it's about good training and it's about serving you fill a million and a man and woman but ah it's just an honor to serve my guys love dude is great jurisdiction\nAnd uh I just appreciate your comments I trust all of my I got close to seven hung over seven hundred and blow it six ... six hundred or enforcement\nBut I trust them all I won't any of them to come in my neighborhood and deal with me at my very worked on trust him I Know they're trying I Know the compassionate another part of the community you thank you so very much\nYeah sure cameras a good point and you do to just as we go into these break the ... all the elected positions in a city or county or in a state the one that should go to the best person for the job is sheriff is too important\nTo be caught up in political mumbo jumbos if you're the best guy and you're Republican I'm to vote for him but also if you're the best guy and you're going to take my family and you're a Democrat on the boat you to
