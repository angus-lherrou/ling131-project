J. I said this uh yesterday I think it was you know their their motto is a put us back in power a or we were in the house down with you in it\nExactly and when I one of the thing I let you go it's just [noise] thing with the with the reporter over in a Saudi Arabia he was not an American citizen was ...\nI Believe you not only are resident that is right\nYou're right and he's a citizen isn't he took isn't he\nA bleeding I Believe the Saudi yes okay it's\nSaturday he was and he was in Saudi Arabia he was going into a I think they said the Turkish concept\nOh he was in Turkey and the ... going in the Saudi conflict\nOK okay like it doesn't really matter that's none of our business that is that ... that Turkey's business that Saudi Arabia is is is that the guy his family's business that's not the business of the United states I mean something like that God Forbid happened and\nThe United states with Canada and and Germany and any other country they wanted to get involved and start telling you know telling us what to do that's none of our business we should just\nForget about it oh I I'm Still I get the guy got killed right you know and and all that\nBut it's none of our business we want to do business with that country you know we can't tell them like the Democrats want to do us we can't tell them every little thing they must do in order for us to do business with them\nOh I Know and I know the media the media is the first one to tell us oh we can't get involved in the middle east and maybe they're right made their own doesn't matter but now all of a sudden we're supposed to care\nI'm gonna let me of course enjoy anybody out there listening and I know people have forgotten this\nBut ah went ahead and look it up really quick um\nWasn't there a charge at one time um a couple of years back or a few years back that we had drone Obama had author of drone strikes that killed some Americans\n... are actually fighting for the Taliban rising crazy but uh we didn't give them due process we decided that they were for the audience does and who are in the country yeah we did um we did um in yeah\nInteresting got hey thanks for the call Jay Jay appreciate it I'm the only thing I Would say again with this razor wire idea are dropping stuff and ah once they get a look we've got thousands of miles of border to patrol idea they need to cut it off now because while there are in a good position\nThem stay in for the past hour or so and talking about this whole thing with the caravan we've got other things in the story in the lineup of stories are that are happening but this one is really the big one it's a it's a it's quite honestly very scary\nTo contemplate what is going to happen to these people continue on through Mexico and land at our border is not going to be pretty there's no way to resolve this in a nice way they are determined to force themselves\nJust like they did down in Guatemala and Mexico they're going to force themselves upon different ports of entry\nAlong the U.S Mexico border and\nIt it's just not going to be pretty ah at all I mentioned an interview that was done with a spokesperson with the department of homeland security\nHer name is Katie Waldman and she was talking the last cold I mentioned of her was that people like these people in the Caribbean no our immigration laws better than our own members of Congress which is a pretty\nStrong statement a pretty condemning statement for people members of Congress who don't understand\nThat we can be game we can be played we can be used in a in a\nThis honorable way\nBy other people who are using the law for their benefit and in this case it's a it's not us citizens that are using that law it's non citizens trying to gain access to our economic system essentially to our economic benefits\nThis and trying to gain access to our economic system essentially to our economic benefits and they're they're going to use the law to force their way in and uh\nIt's got to be stopped this is what she said there was an earlier caravan from Central America with migrants that traveled to the U.S to the U.S this past summer and she says we never tracked the caravan of migrants from the one back earlier in the summer\nShockingly enough of nearly one hundred thousand family units apprehended from El Salvador Guatemala and Honduras and twenty Seventeen so this was only a year ago Ninety nine percent remain here today\nThat's because of the way the laws written right now\nThat we're requires\nThem to stay or allows them to stay and ties the hands of the border patrol in getting them out or deporting them\nSo and then she mentions of the thirty four thousand unaccompanied alien children from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nThat we apprehended in twenty Seventeen nearly Ninety eight percent remain in the country today so there are thirty four thousand or let's knock it down a few points thirty thousand unaccompanied alien children from Guatemala hunters in El Salvador that are here they're unaccompanied minors so we don't know\nWhether they've ever been reunited with a family member at this point and they're\nIn the system what where where are they who's taking care of them what about the children the liberals are real quick\nTo jump on it when they have a photo op of a of a child supposedly being separated from their mother or their father and they make they milk that for all its worst but we've got thousands and thousands of children that could be in dire straits ... not being\nTreated well they could have jumped into a far worse situation from wherever they came in Central America just based on the fact that there is no parent to guard or protect them or to help them and so these kids\nThey're they're losing the country are there within centers which may be trying to do the best to care for them physically but we don't know what else is going on in that center with the other kids and it's just a what a mess we don't need this\nThis is crazy\nSo she goes on to say day in and day out we see caravan size apprehension at the border there are two thousand people apprehended almost every single day at the border this is a crisis and that's not\nWith the people that are seven thousand strong moving towards it this is just an everyday occurrence when there isn't a plot and plan in place to de lose the border with seven thousand people this is just as\nAs as people are trying and attempting to cross the border on their own isn't without a mastermind behind it organizing these people\nGiving them talking points giving them money giving them cell phones giving them fresh shoes and a list\nSo it gives you haven't noticed there there are now people documenting that there are trucks down their flatbed trucks covered trucks that are taking these people and moving them further north\nUp the road to their\nWhich is the U.S Mexico border so either the Mexicans are aiding and abetting this process which they there should be\nDestination which is the U.S Mexico border so either the Mexicans or aiding and abetting this process which\nThen there should be held to pay by the Mexican government for doing that for not stepping in or there are other groups at play within Mexico in which case they themselves should be a little angry and upset and working to stop this along with the U.S\nIt's a something shady going on for sure Jay Jay's back on the line I think it's the same J. J. they called earlier hey are you there\nI did and I'm Sorry to get an I'll make it really quaint owed oriented to my mind the most\nImportant things are meant to say while Scott was there and I hope he's listening casinos I always get that than\nI Am trying to persuade him and I hope other listeners will do this to to run in twenty twenty against that Jones because with his previous experience in the Alabama Legislature and all of the experience he had with these and lord the immigrants when he was trying to pass the law\nFor Alabama and all the good things he did we need someone like him a good Christian guy who is\nUm who had the experience that she needed and uh\nAnd the courage to do it you know to courage to get on take on the radio and say what needs to be said and so he needs to be there he needs to be our senator to help Donald Trump\nFinish what he started out and it's like a toe Scott I said if you don't want to stay longer than a than your first term you know just come on back home and then you can be the number one radio station and you know in Alabama after you've been in the Senate so\nThat's how I I tend to run so\nLet's all encourage him to run in and play that he will we need more good guys like him and truck\nAlright thank why dry you bet that Jay Jay I'm sure he was listening and I if not I'll make sure I repeat it because he's heard it for me as well\nSo Jay Jay thank you for reminding him a of that option and planning it all out for him six years just six years that's all and then you could come back and ruled the roost on radio in Alabama for sure All right bill well into the Ford faction are you there\nYes the Gulf of things uh you know\nIf you don't want you know they always give you that it's just we don't have jobs we don't have money if if you don't do you need to change your country okay because if you don't you're going to come up here in China jars eventually cause we will all be dead and gone but one of these days the country's largest oil or the Democrats that run it\nUh every other election in this country right and uh one other thing you know I mean if it's a\nIt's like oh man they're slowly but surely are changing our country but all\nWe need to get a bunch of sort of for a lot of veterans that so he's a retired veterans are\nVeterans is a than in the military and go down there and got her own down borders and then again data from the military and and the law enforcement out to get up there on what the get illegal but they do it they would do that if we went down there and tried to guard the border wouldn't it\nYeah I Would think that um [noise] some of them will be done if Americans are taken action now feeling\nIs that if Americans go down their guard a border them our government would take action against us but they won't take action against the people that are coming in illegally that was up on\nYeah right I agree and then of course then Americans are forced to basically put their own jobs in livelihoods and in jeopardy just in order to do the job the military is paid to do which is defend the or defend the borders and defend the nation so hopefully Trump will uh\nOf the military is paid to do which is defend the or defend the borders and defend the nation so hopefully Trump will ah ah you know if Obama were in charge I I Would not be holding my breath but I\nUh I think Trump will act correctly and do what needs to be done because he's very adamant that we're not a nation if we don't enforce our borders so that's\nThe other the other problem is when they come in and they're not under the laws that we are and they get you out there let go they're not put in jail they don't have the facts and there's a lot of way\nRight I Know there's a whole slew of problems that come with is that a permeates every level of our society and I I don't think people understand we've talked about it before\nThe sickness level the way it affects\nWhat budgeting is done in education systems that now have to introduce an English as a second language\nTeacher just because they've been a inundated and they can't do their jobs without addressing these children are the taxes in communities to cover all the the new expenses in the medical area than in the town governments\nHave not\nBeen to the level of tyranny and Hitler like activity that we were told by the left it was going to be not that I\nBelieve them so anyways I just thought I'd point that out there another action of of violence against Republicans against conservatives happening to Kevin McCarthy and his\nOffice staff and I'm not going to go through the whole list but it was mind blowing all you got to do is do a search of it I Would say go to the Daily Caller because it that's going to be a pretty comprehensive I don't know if you heard about this\nBut ah Elizabeth Warren\nYou know she was in the news a couple of weeks ago last week yeah she was in the news a lot last week just because it was so much fun it was so much fun to talk about this crazy back firing of her DNA a test and the wage I don't know she thought it was going to help\nWhich is amazing so amazing that she was so out of touch with the American people and how they view this whole thing that she thought that by releasing a DNA\nResult which shows that she's one one thousand one thousands and twenty fourth Native American Indian was going to a peace who\nUs the president it does neither it does neither first of all here's why doesn't appeal to me it's a\nIt's a flimsy claim one one thousand my goodness the average American is I think one eighty four\nSomething like that so she's not even close to the average American when it comes to Native American DNA\nBut on top of all of that she's doing the test twenty some years later after the fact of her claiming to be a Native American in order to get access to Harvard and the law review directory and all these other areas including cookbooks and all of that she that she was\nUsing that Native American labels to get access to so it's way after the past in fact and it's not convincing that she even has any DNA that would she could claim\nBut here's something else I didn't realize\nElizabeth Warren has an ex husband I guess I didn't realize that I assume she was married when she had an ex husband [laughter] this is amazing her ex husband cofounded a DNA testing company\nAnd wrote one of the first computer codes for making genetic comparisons\nSo Elizabeth Warren\nMakes the claims twenty Thirty years ago that she's Native American based on ... family lore\nAnd apparently that's enough to get her into the institutions that she wanted to access and get the job she wanted access so she didn't bother actually confirming it\nShe had access through her husband because he or ex husband even if he was an ex husband at the time when he did this he's founded a D. N. A. testing company\nHe or ex husband even if he was an ex husband at the time when he did this he's founded a D. N. A. testing company and wrote the first computer code for making generic comparisons genetic comparisons\nSo she had at her fingertips access to any number of ways of confirming this\nOh by the way his testing company family tree DNA he's the co founder with a Stanford University geneticist so she has that her finger to those you've got to do is call up and say hey Bob um would you help me out here you know old time's sake remember I was your wife even\nIf he's the ex husband at the time I mean he could have been her husband at the time that he created this company I don't know but either way she has full disclosure at our fingertips with his DNA testing company and she never avail herself of it\nAt any time until now and she didn't even use that company she used another guy\nWow the divorce must have been nasty she can't even call up her ex husband and say hey look would you help me out here you don't have to call me back just sent me the results in the mail I'll send you a sample that\nShe can't even do that she uses another less reputable less of a particular\nGuy\nTo do this evaluation uh I find that really really interesting she even came out and talked about why she went through this whole process\nI Do have it on audio but I don't think I can access it maybe I can I'll Try and talk and mess or maybe I'll do it on the other side of the break maybe I'll do that All right let let me see if I can get the audio queued up of Elizabeth Warren\nExplaining why she went through with the DNA test twenty thirty forty years after the fact after her claiming to be Native American for the purposes of getting access\nTo educational institutions and jobs being a lawyer and all of that or\nDoes it she she explains it and will will dissect it for a little bit and then we'll move on All right this is Andrea ties in for the Ford faction be back in just a minute\nThat mixture of sun shining clouds with low seventies expected today forty seven and the other night low tonight will still be nice and drive with a high close to Seventy and then a chilling rain arrives for Thursday and friday WB GM Thirteen meteorologist Seventy four cats on his Crawford Broadcasting station\nOr ... we care about the hard work your vote in the room looks such while you're on advertising partners are people we take the time do you do when you go to the Y. and struck out off or you can trust what you're doing business with all the people you can tell you're ... you're losing your seat on the one liners no\nReal stress on the whole\nCity seven million ways to reduce business school what ... what do you want to [noise] [noise]\n[noise] America was not built on free [noise]\nAmerica was built on her own imagination shown\nOn on reasonable determination to do the job of town [noise] area ... proof [noise]\nWe are home to own guns on preached [laughter]\nSupervision moral one [noise] nobody want to be [noise]\n\n[noise]\nDaniel alliance wasn't back to the horn faction Andrea ties in for four grand he'll be back tomorrow I have been talking about Elizabeth Warren and the fact that\nShe was married to a guy he's now her ex husband\nBut married to a guy who founded a DNA company how rich is that [laughter] she's married to a guy she called him up at any given time and say hey she goes on the Twenty years ago and said hey ah could you help me out here I really want to get to know she didn't\nShe didn't call him on any point regarding this DNA testing she use another company and then she goes on to explain why she went through with this recently as in the last couple of days now I'm going to try and play this audio let's see if it works\nWell let's see\nIf at all time low and I believe one way that we try to rebuild I'm going to back that I'm just a little bit out an ad on one of the things that I see now is that confidence in government is at an all time low and I believe one way that we try to rebuild confidence\nIs three transparency so I've really made an effort over the past several months I've put ten years of my tax returns on line anybody can see them [noise]\nI have put a a things about my family history on line I put my employment record on line and yeah ultimately I took a DNA test\nBecause I Am an open book and it's all out there it's on the Internet anybody can take a look what is it I ... I see there you go that confidence uh\nThat's one of her explanations transparency it's transparent how All right hey great she put her tax returns up there I'd be interested in knowing it's it's one thing to show\nThat you pay taxes it's also interesting to show how you made the money especially how she made money however many years she's been in Congress that's always interesting to me she's worth quite a bit\nSo she's done that All right that's great thank you Elizabeth but it's all about transparency okay\nAll right so it may be about transparency in the sense that you reveal the results of the DNA but the the results themselves don't prove anything other than that you lied twenty Thirty years ago\nYou claimed you were Native American and now the proof shows that you're not\nOh we're supposed to applaud you for transparency okay but\nRight do you think that this was a precursor to the possibility of roe v Wade getting a a challenging case\nOh in the long run low del ... it has to be this was well within the legal community and for the light to light and uh to go just a show called shortage because the the uh ... do you ever been in the womb has no choice if you're kill it\nIf you look at a chill is different than motor and those are two different borders according to Tony runners started the Bible or learners find jobs and the Greek and it managed to live in or to plan ahead a murder killers to defend yourself or to a larger nation [noise]\nThis is yellow hammer News I'm Andrea ties the University of Alabama places a professor on administrative leave Steven Black is also the founder of impact America and the grandson of former Supreme Court justice Hugo Black\nBlack is accused of sexually harassing in America corps member with the use of text messages or emails black has admitted to sexually inappropriate messages with the woman but denies that it constitute sexual harassment the administration has placed black on leave pending an investigation\nAgainst demand is under arrest and charged with rape and sexual abuse of a child under the age of twelve thirty three year old Carlos ... is a Mexican citizen living in Gadsden he's being held in the ... county detention center investigators believe that they have\nThat has caught on and understands\nWhat this foundation is moving towards\nIt's moving towards being constitutional should roe v Wade ever get challenged in that we stand with what the constitution says about the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness\nAnd believe me I don't think they will be sending a million dollars\nTo Alabama of all states\nFor the next two weeks if they did not see this as a very very real threat to their sacrament\nOf abortion and murder of unborn children\nAnd that's what it is so that's\nOn the horizon here for us in Alabama we will be seeing who knows what\nIn the next two weeks by way of media efforts to sway our votes or maybe not sway because I don't think they I think they've given up on that [laughter] I don't think they can can argue that ah distort what this amendment is about\nDistort ... ah what it means and try and scare\nA lot of people are no doubt into thinking that this is a bad bad thing and you must not vote for it so if you want more information on it go to yellow hammer news dot com there's an article that's revealing that it's written by Sean Ross\nAnd it ... you know talking about what all the packs that they've been donating to and and George Soros and his involvement as well in this and the fact that Walt Maddox has come out and said he's not going to vote for the amendment to even though he said he was pro life\nSomewhere along the line apparently but not to the point where I actually do something about it clearly\nThe other thing that's happening in Alabama I'm not sure if you're aware of this is\nThat a ... Alabama congressman Bradley Byrne has introduced some legislation don't know how far they'll\nGo we've got several sponsors including two other Alabama congressman mo Brooks and Mike Rogers but it's a legislation that kinda ...\nThey is being described at least from his press release as creating a pathway toward securing our borders by building a wall on the southern border of the United states now you might be thinking well I thought Trump was already starting that yes he has started it and he's continuing to get funding for it but it's kind of coming in these packets of\nFunding and it's not the full amount that he wants committed to guarantee that the full wall is built I Know it's a hefty price baggage for sure but\nBut considering that we talked about what it costs to deal with uh all the millions of illegal immigrants that are in this country it's in the billions and billions of dollars a\nI have to find that article I don't know where I have it I'll find it uh considering that than the wall will pay for itself just that alone um\nBut anyway this legislation that burn is introducing is called the fifty votes for the wall act it's also HR Seventy Seventy three if you care to be that\nDetail oriented [noise] ah so the bill is the idea that it would put this whole funding of the wall in under budget reconciliation and that way it avoids a filibuster by the Democrats in the Senate\nWhere where you need sixty votes to end the filibuster if you do it this way you only need fist\nBy the Democrats in the Senate where where you need sixty votes to end the filibuster if you do it this way you only need fifty votes to get it out or get it out of committee or out of reconciliation and onto the floor and therefore passed through the Senate\nAnd so this bill would also he says fully fund the border wall eliminating the possibility that Democrats could bottle up funding in the future with appropriation bills which is where they cut away at it or they do it in small segments or whatever or they just don't do it at all\nOr they find something to leverage in order to reduce it and you play the game the budget game so Bradley Byrne has introduced that into Congress as of today is the twenty third so he did it yesterday not too long ago\nSo that's going on about their this is what a burn was saying he about border security he says it's national security and we cannot allow Democrats to continue to block our efforts to build a wall along our southern border amen to that\nWhat was the new\nLandmark legal foundation\nOh what is the nobody ... you\nKnow hey they're voted started out as though we'll just let it goes without equal to legally vote COBOL [laughter]\nIt was really really will be a little bit ill and Joe on people voted illegally\nYou would have to do\nWell you know give me enough time and I'm sure I can find an article by Fox News about it because it's been brought up before a so you know I'm finding it on a Daily Caller I'll just give me a matter of time to find it on Fox News but there this is a legitimate problem and you can't prove\nThis unless you have the will to find it and if California government the government or the state\nOfficials are not interested which they've shown themselves not to because they're run by Democrats and they are allowing these sanctuary cities now there are people within California who want to change that obviously it's not all a hundred percent but\nAre there if they don't have the will to expose it if they don't have a will to clean up their voter rolls if they don't have a will to enforce ID laws then\nYeah they're going to get away with it and it's not going to be provable because they're getting away with it hey I got to let you go we've got to go on a on a break here Brandon thanks for the call I appreciate you being part of the program and I'll get to share and Jonathan\nAnd whoever else I see on there and just a minute we'll be back in a minute this is the Ford faction\nThat mixture of sun shining clouds with low seventies expected today forty seven and the other night low tonight Wednesday I'll still be nice and driving a high close to Seventy and then a chilling reign of rides for Thursday and friday WB GM Thirteen meteorologist Stephanie lack of any forecasts on his Crawford Broadcasting station\n[noise] we don't know what\nWe are golden retriever moral won\n\n\n\nWas from Birmingham, Alabama [noise] from a Jewish version on on\nJoel him or radio or factions [noise]\n\nHey well some back into the Ford faction following up on Brandon's call I had to go to a break so and I can't type while I talk I just have not mastered that yet so we mentioned well hey where all these stories from\nNews because I mentioned California and I'm so oh okay there it is um so I went quickly to Google and fortunately they didn't block me this time\nBecause you know they're not interested in getting this news out so anyway this was a latest report done in August of this year\nOn Fox News the headline is names of non US citizens increasingly found on voter rolls non American citizens are\nGot a commission to go to a lipstick tumors or killed as he does say let's say two\nFive to three million people that are legal so that'd be the right moment you lost the popular vote but he got a commission to go to trial as five voted for and they could not fired\nNo I Know brand that I got I got to insert myself hang on\nThey didn't even get past first base with that commission they couldn't even get to\nThe necessary database to get the information because they wouldn't let them let them do that right so it's not about winding it or not fighting and they couldn't even get into the investigation\nAnd it said it was almost ... okay with that being said oh and tell us what what people were talking about what the deal will be in a while everybody to be registered\nTo with their driver's license badly special driver license or\nA non citizens just like you're a police where people were not allowed to drive without a special license and it automatically flags\nTheir driver license led them to not an answer it so the registration so now what happened it was the studios or San Francisco\nEvery time I was there a city ordinance to allow parents who are undocumented\nCisco they came up with their own city ordinance to allow parents who are undocumented ... documented or adults\nOr to be able to vote in their local school a lick their own vet Boulder bay and that's what ended up splitting people Jews there is this show that he's been with all the voter registration\n[laughter] right where they got their whole lot about what\nReally happened it it was a lot of human body were true so I'd encourage people to dig deeper into that and I also occurs you're on your list moves\nTo look into it if it were so big on the coast too soon and so big on voting not trying to keep people from voting but won't Americans to vote will Native Americans or a mirror they will steal first\nAnd then North Dakota had real problems to vote this election they were able to vote last ... the one that farmers whether they might not be able to vote in this solution based\nOn a loud North Dakota I'm may in the last couple of years and went to the Supreme Court Supreme Court held a venomous scramble in these last couple of days to be able to be to be qualified even vote\n[laughter] All right ... and that that's that's that's on a ...\nI don't know enough about the about the north Dakota story at this point branded due to weigh in one way or the other but I appreciate the call and it's definitely something I'll look into and um see what that is all about ... welcome to the Ford faction\nAndrea I ... a couple of articles and ah\nYou know voter fraud which is a ... it's the the myth that it doesn't exist and it's been debunked hundreds and hundreds of times like the county in Georgia that has six hundred and Seventy voters and there's only three hundred and Seventy five people registering old town\nOh isn't that a lovely [laughter] yeah oh yeah but you know voter fraud that happened um and then there's another article I'm\nAbout a California political stuff from California where they surveyed a whole bunch of illegal aliens and Thirteen percent admitted to voting illegally uh-huh so you know they they claim there's like eleven million\nOr so they're not really sure but for Twenty years now we've had only eleven million illegal immigrants in our country but proper estimates put it over thirty million non stop and think about that thirty million illegal aliens in our country and Thirteen percent or admit to voting illegally and federal elections\nSo that kinda winds up with Trump's claim of over three million illegal votes were cast in the last presidential election\nYes right that whole popular vote argument that she really one well wait a second if there's a large possibility in and there is that those were not even legal votes yeah that that wipes away even her lead with the popular vote\nThat's exactly right but it you know a brat random schedule radio I'll I'll put it that way [laughter]\nI mean I I don't know what's going on in North Dakota have to look into it but uh\nHow we've had bigger fish to fry in the state of California just by their their uh ... level of population is enough to really cause some damage to other states because of what their uh permitting and and the rent\nLevel of population is enough to really cause some damage to other states because of what they're up permitting and and the ramp it problems there with the issuing driver's license now I don't know about this whole thing with um them being special permits that are flag\nIt's Andre if if a Mercedes plant down the road over here they bring in German um\nEngineers all the time I've met um actually help one guy with his motorcycle and saw the road supervised guys but they come in all the time and they are giving driver's license in the state of Alabama because they are sponsored by a Mercedes Benz usa an American corporation that sponsors them\nThey have special visas they're allowed to get Alabama State driver's licenses but they're ... they're marked in their color to specific way to identify them as non citizens\nWhich thereby does not give them the right to vote and you know they're they're giving all these the local municipalities in states are giving everybody and anybody the right to vote\nIn state or local elections which is their right but on the federal level it is not allowed for them but when you have people who can't maintain their voter registration rolls and you have other\nStates that just don't bother to check exactly where they arrest you if you do it's going to get\nConvoluted and watered down and the federal elections put at risk\nBut ah it's just\nIf we don't have a wall where we have a border we don't have a country if we don't have secure voting we don't have a country\nEither because any nation in the world any entity can come in and just to dictate to us how they want us to do things and anybody that was one that is a moron\nRight I agree ... I agree and and you know the big invade and then they uh take control under the cover of doing it democratically\nBut that whole premises is undercut by the fact that there he'll here illegally doing it [laughter] um yeah we we've got to we've got to maintain the integrity of our elections or we are in deep doo doo to say the least thing why the calmer if I appreciate I'm going to go to David real quick because we're\nHeaded toward the top of the hour David welcome to the Ford faction\n[noise] very good I'm also just for if that is in North Dakota or wherever it is that's a absolutely appalling and should be corrected immediately also uh many of the military people over the last for\nA elections have not been giving their paperwork to pass an absentee ballots in time and so forth or not is\nHundreds of thousands of votes in many many states in the military usually votes Republican so of course they want to slow that down ... and the deep state slowing the paperwork down on them so I we didn't send it out so\nYou know you want to represent us in the war zone but you know you can't vote it's absolutely amazing um and and the people in the DMZ and the minister policies\nAre actually on the job retiring as Ninety percent of 'em sit there and he can't wait to put in my twenties\nAnd then you guys only a paycheck for the rest of my life and there's no management to say that he didn't do your job today mhm or way way way that's critical I'm a woman you were um black I'm I'm a panic comes is a\nI'll give you another example look on the\nAh did I just lose him or in in my not hearing and are you there oh I don't know what happened I'm just going\nI did I just lose him or in in my not hearing and are you there\nOh I don't know what happened I'm just going to drop it if you need to call back David you can but it it it cut out on the um were let's take a break see if we can resolve this and we'll be back for the final segment before we head out this is the fourth action\n\nThat mixture of sun tanning clouds with low seventies expected today forty Sam and the other night to night Wednesday I'll still be nice and driving a high close to Seventy and then a chilling reign of rides for Thursday and friday this is Debbie ... pm Thirteen meteorology Stephanie lack of any forecasts on his Crawford Broadcasting station\nThat's super strict moral one we care about the hard work you vote in your living that's why you're on advertising partners or people we take the time do you do when you go to\nThe wine bar and check out our partners you can cross that you're doing business with only write to me you can come here says something means that you don't see 'em a wide margin that snow and we'll start going on for the whole city seven million three to four new ...
