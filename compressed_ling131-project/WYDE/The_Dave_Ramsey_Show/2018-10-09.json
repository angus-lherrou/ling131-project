Talking about digits then you've got to be thinking about anyways anyway uh our number eight six six one nine nine three three Jonathan what's up buddy won't come in\nWell as well what's up rather\nI Will do it you're a mathematician you got to kind of a little weird love for numbers anyway but\nYeah it's that's a good point like it but it but think about think about the guy who walks into his office and his title is um State Farm mathematician you know what I mean like it's it's probably just like an actuary or something nobody is actually a mathematician right\nI Will I don't know man I don't know a lot of the show Dr ... which is why I called ... that those NASCAR guys on and there is\nNothing in this world more attractive to going down the road and I see a lot of those fabulous role trials can laughing crawl just mope and\nOh yeah and their trucks they have to look awesome because they get seen by fans so they have to be up to up to inspection of the tea up to everything and\nThen it's beyond that bad like the federal due to regulate those guys are just like what yeah and\nSo everybody is out here it's supposed to be up to you know that far but it does take a level of gorgeous this you know that little extra ...\nThey did not to mention\nThat was kind of live inside those trucks manage some of those inside those strokes acid in some people's part\nI mean it's it's incredible I Know I you Jonathan I'm going to go on the inside of a of Dave's truck this week I've never been on the inside of a tractor trailer I Want to see it\nI I I'm telling you I mean I Do for your loss for about ...\n... it's all about [laughter] [laughter] oh I made a space time he's okay [laughter] I'm ... I'm coming out of Atlanta right now it'd be having a great\n[laughter] ah but yeah I mean it it really is it's the coolest thing 'cause those hollers like on the back people don't realize when they put those those\nTrailers though that the gate down in the back those are are like the lift or or the the platform that raises up to roll the car on to raise it back down to get it off like that thing is a is a lift in itself it's incredible\nA big day thank you truck yeah Timothy Showalter turned backup read I I Want I Want to hear ... [noise]\nBut the only part of the story for\nUs to talk of trucks first of all if you've ever watched one of these horrible Chevy commercials\nAnd he takes them out of the middle of the desert in these three Chevrolet trucks drive up and like you don't know it's a ... truck about to come up like you're an idiot like those have to be paid actors that's the dumbest commercial ever or where are where he's he's got that horrible looking orange Chevrolet core\nAnd it it's a it's like a sedan hatchback crossover ... whatever the kind of bull crap court is and if\nYou're only talking about Chevy you might as well just advertise with me just for that you'll have a news dot com\nI you know um but those commercials are so bad you know one of the commercials on talking about Britain where he comes out and he is in the middle of the field or in the middle of the desert and he's like here these are a lineup of trucks and the people are going oh I Wonder which one it's going to be and he's like\nTruck is when the dependability award for blah blah blah the J e W power award and it's like there's Fifteen thousand Jay W power wards J. D. W. power whatever whatever the power awards called you know it's like a little lamp and gold [laughter] it's\nSalads and Jay W power awards or J. D. W. power whatever whatever the power awards called you know it's like a little lamp and gold [laughter] stupid stupid award now if I wanted I'd be thrilled but like it's a stupid or and\nAnd they they take them out of the middle of the desert and they're like guess which truck in the truck you know I have a dodge I drive a Ford is probably Ford I Love my for\nMe you can love your afford it just and like I own a Chevy I own a shiny and that commercial makes me want to sell my truck because it's so stupid it's so bad\nI think about a use I didn't have to buy it from that we'd walk up\nThere doing those commercials Coors stupid he brings them into this huge factory right\nAnd there's like boxes like those crates shipping boxes and he's like this truck when the JD power war Baba and and all of a sudden the the gate falls down in the Chevy Trucks drive out almost like the Batmobile\nAnd then it's like truck shown here starts at a hundred and eighty million dollars and then it's like these cars started twenty five thousand dollars a beat\nAnd it's like it's done those commercials are so stupid and advertising is I Am it's so stupid but it's it's you know what it makes me makes me think\nAbout those commercials all the time because they're so dumb like the orange hatchback commercialized honor he moves the walls to the side so they can see the back of the car\nAnd like the car gets ugly your as the walls move apart because it turns into like a hatchback or whatever it is and it's like how does a core get as a kind of the guardian uglier as I continue to look at it\nTerrible terrible terrible commercial I mean what was the Chevy is one Seventeen dependable but what do you mean dependable ... was because you put a a bigger battery in it and it cranks more times than a ... like\nWhat what in the world as it goes dum dum commercial dum dum\nOh goodness anyway talking about going to the port fashion a lot from the gas dot com heating and AIR Studios Alabama license number one on the twenty a meal fit that ... um so we're talking about this Nikki Haley abrupt leaving resignation and like I don't want it to seem\nLike it's that abrupt I think the only reason\nThat people are saying it's this and I'm trying to get my microphone working Stan I'm Sorry ... but I just I Can't I Can't get that fired up talking about those\nDumb Chevy commercials like they bring them out to the to the track in the middle of the desert\nAnd this car pulls up and they they try to act like it's a Ford car and they talk about all of these new features and all this like they put the step into bumper and it's like maybe four inches below the bumper stat like those four inches are going to cause you not to get a hernia when you're trying to get in the back of your truck\nLike if you get up on that bumpers that you're not going to step on the steps it's four inches below that it it's like three feet off the ground\nAnd like they they take these people to the middle of this track this looks like an F. one fifty pulls up any ribs it off and it's like oh I didn't know it was a Chevy is how the world's you not know is a Chevy I think it's it's it's one of those commercials with all of 'em\nAre we talking about Britain advertising yeah just ridiculous anyways this Nikki Haley thing but the reason I think it is abrupt through a lot of people and especially to the media is because they kept it under wraps that Kevin unwrap see they probably I guarantee you\nEverything happens for a reason under this this this administration right Nikki Haley probably hinted at this a couple of months ago to somebody\nFor a reason under this this this administration right Nikki Haley probably hinted at this a couple of months ago to somebody met what Trump said this is what I Want to do we got a plan down I work through the end of two thousand Eighteen then you're gonna have to find somebody else\nYou're wearing me out you're wearing me down what I Want to talk about all the time with your heating and cooling system that you should call chaos today two oh five three to ... what do I talk about all the time if you want something to run longer let it run easier\nI'm not going to take a fat kid and put 'em in the Mercedes marathon here in Birmingham and expect him to run twenty six miles\nNo I'm not I'm not going to do that I'm not going to I'm not going to take something\nLike my Chevy like my my truck out there that's an older truck it's like what eight years old now nine years old and I'm not going to have it run a hundred and fifty miles an hour around Talladega super speedway drag\nI'm going to let it run my commute where I get on the interstate for Fifteen minutes at a time and I I drive at five miles I'm going to let it run easier for longer\nOkay with Nikki Haley it's that same thing she's running harder harder harder harder and she ran a short period of time\nI bet you know what I'll go out on a limb here and say Trump not the easiest gotta work with\nI've talked to people that worked with Trump I've talked to people that work beside Trump they'll literally see those are the first person Trump sees when it comes down to the elevator on the White House and Trump says not good morning not hey how're you doing Trump says did you see the truth I put out this morning we probably need to take care of that\nHey\nWe have this going on today because I called this he's a he's kind of a tough pickle to work with\nAnd he said well he's doing great he is doing the right thing I'm not saying he's not he's not I'm just saying Trump equals tough guy to work with Rome I mathematicians out there let me put this an equation and it in an equation for you Trump equals tough guy to work for\nOkay and I'm not saying you can't do it but it is a tough guy to work for okay Trump's running a marathon the people that were working former running sprints throughout this marathon and it is it ... it is tough look at look at 'em Nick Saban looking to save and and then like your guest miles on\nHow much how much coaching turnover do you see at Auburn as compared to Alabama think think about Alabama they've had what for off into coordinators in the past year\nTwo years I I mean\nThen look it over and over and keeps people for a while it looks like an easier place to work it looks a little bit more relaxing obviously\nThey don't have the kind of\nKind of winning that Alabama's had in the past ten years but still ... solid program coach gets paid a lot of money I athletics make a lot of money Auburn fence spend a lot of money to wear\nA the orange and almost navy blue collar\nSo when I when I relate it to you you can run longer you can do what you do longer if you do it easier if it's easier to work with like if you have a boss who wears you out I mean he wears you out like Nick Saban\nLook how long those coaches stay there how long did Germany fruit stay there how long did Steve start fusion stay there how long will Bush Joan stay there how long did um [noise] who's another a\nSmart stay there I mean I mean look at it look at a as a record of wearing people out not trumping Nick Saban to complete\nSmart stay there I mean I mean look at it is a record of wearing people adults now Trump the Nick Saban two completely different personalities to completely different leadership styles but where's people out when's the last time you saw Trump not in a suit\nBecause he has a routine he has this\nDaily way he carries himself where you know what we're only gonna wear suits everybody around me were only gonna wear suits going to dress nice real look nice or to present ourselves in a great way now like I I was talking to other all day long but we're going to present ourselves in a way where you only get away with it and he wears people out he wears people down just like next saint\nNick Saban will where somebody down that's what how many coaches\nCoaches or Alabama\nOther than the highest paid strengthen conditioning coach there I'm In Alabama for more than like three years two years and\nThen other people out\nTrump Trump Trump where's the dog out to people\nI mean how many cabinet\nPositions Trump into you where's people out and he wears people down six years they can take palm pale in there and they didn't take it wouldn't get somebody else in there somebody else who's qualified\nI just but what about ... there for a year ... diesel is an officer coaching one day\n\nI don't know vaccination where we ... we may just have to disagree the whole abrupt saying we agree on 'cause I don't understand this this abrupt resignation like I I don't ... I don't understand why people are freaking out about this I don't get that thank you for the call me I Will talk to somebody\nI think six five one nine nine thirty three and we were set the phone lines and there are guys it's so scratch you I mean I Can't even I'm having a hard time we go to Josh will be one more call Josh with a buddy\nAnd I\nAre doing well how you doing buddy\nAlmost Josh mostly I get to where we said the phone lines that we got to have a we have a serious problem going on in there yeah I don't think you hurricane bread I I don't I don't want it to re scratchy like Josh you can go back and just a second I just\nMix saving is one of those guys who every morning he gets an oatmeal cream pie every day for lunch she has like a choice between three things like he doesn't make a lot of choice of the day and he is the same got in and out in out\nIn and out they didn't smile and laugh often I think he just warriors people out you just wears people down here just got to work for I\nThink Trump does the same thing I think it's when you have a boss and a lot of people you have a boss out there like that you have a boss out there\nWho\nEvery day you come in it's something new every day you come in and not like a good something new every day you come in and it's like we have a new problem we have to do something else we have to deal with we kind of like a a scattered mind boss scatter brained boss\nRight and it\nKind of like a tough person to work for whether he's just intensely working all the time or he doesn't have a plant like whether he is working at three AM in the middle of the night and he's trying to get stuff done is just not enough hours in the day or whether you feel like he's not confident\nI feel like those kinda people where people down and like Trump I feel like Trump didn't tell us playing a lot of people he he's got his his close circle is administration\nAnd you know all these announcements and all these tweets those where people out why didn't include Sims went to the White House worked for ... I mean yeah it's a step up but I I mean if it was that all some working for Nick Saban\nThey'd probably be an officer coordinator who would stay there for more than a year and when a lot of national championships if it was that awesome yeah go into another school is great but like you went to another school and you know being the head coach school school next Seventy gonna beat you buy a eighty school\nI just think at the end of the worst people out\nAnd Thomas Cox talks more about it on Thursday and that's really where I got this from a Web that Thursday one thirty mix savings diet and really talks about how your worst players out too\nAnd I mean look at it\nLike where is this running backs out quarterbacks out whereas those boys out where's those guys out I mean there's been some players have been burned out I mean you think about it like Trump Trump tweets\nAll the time he's always saying something he's always doing something he's always saying something about somebody I bet it just ... years\nPeople out are you on the phone\nHe's doing something he's always saying something about somebody I bet it just ... years people out are you on the phone to me right now big to do things ... ... ... say something again to hello\nHello NATO\nWho's on here who's on a bigger there's somebody on the line is\nThat that was it not that was not you're the first time\nOh ... ... ... yeah you sound much better thank you okay so rich and the phone okay thank you sorry\nUm yeah phone lines eight six six of one nine nine thirty three you had to reset the phone lines for that big day\nI just think Trump these just always in the news always we now always doing something I think ...\n... and all these foreign affairs where's the glove and like Nikki Haley she's going to move up into a better position she's going to go somewhere else she's going to do something better but you know call her time at the un a blessing um but offered no reason for leaving other than beliefs that government officials must know when it's time to step aside\nTrump told reporters that he did a quote incredible job fantastic person in quote and she um had told them six months ago she wanted to take a break and maybe at the end of the year she would back out hopefully you'll be coming back at some point maybe in another capacity told her and you can have your pick\nHaley called her time and Turtle Bay in honor of lifetime and said that nothing set on where I'm going to go\nUm she also praised the work that of aka trumping Jared Kushner did for turkey particularly Kushner's role and renegotiating the north American free trade agreement NAFTA and she called ... a hidden genius\nNow the U.S is respected countries may not like what we do but they respect what we do I'm citing the number of achievements that the Trump Administration has made the U.S\nIs strong again\nIt's strong in a way that should make America very proud and she told all this to reporters earlier today\nSo I mean that's just that's that's how it is I I don't understand all this speculation\nOf of why she doing this what went wrong what happened hopefully Drake you can help me knock it\nDown here in a minute he'll be coming on I'm sure is just in a a just in a minute we got him call and then you may know Greg he's a Fox News consultant mental Fox News several times in a just a great guys got a great Australian accent guy just got a tweet in kind of like every person on the railroad\nIt wears you down and tell your job your job wears you down like if you're in a job and it's wearing you out ... or like let's say this let's let's take it take it this way but I Want you to jumping on this with me okay let me ask you this question if you're in a job and you make\nSolid money ... solid money your kids have extra curricular activities you got a a nice\nCar every five years um your your husband can do some hunting do projects around the house you keep your home value up\nYou've got a solid job you both make solid bunny you get the middle way middle um class I I mean ... solid wage jobs right ... you're probably on salary get good health care and you uh do you have an option\nTo go to a twenty percent increase in salary but it's going to be more hours you're the boss is going to wear you out okay the boss is going to wear you out but you're going to get paid more it's going to be more hours though not going to get as much time to spend with your family kids whatever\nRight are you gonna do it are you going to take up to that next step then you're going to go to the next step you're probably going to stay on the\nTake on the talent\nAre you gonna do it are you going to take up to the next step then you're going to go to the next step\nYou're probably going to stay on the take on the talent ... yeah I think a lot of people are very comfortable with where they're at they don't want to go to the next challenge they want to they don't want to do the next thing\nThey want to take it they they they want to keep what they know right now let me change it this way you are under a boss who wears you out but it's great on the resume ... great on the resume\nPays great this balls wears you out you don't get to see your kids for like half the year right this balls wears you dog up dog down\nWears you out okay and and you make pretty good money you get an opportunity to where you're going to go be worn out just as much but you are going to make a lot better money and it's a bigger risk but if it works it's going to pay off\nAnd you got a great resume and you're going to be worn out just as much but you're going to be the head honcho now you're going to get to be that boss that war you out all those times what are you going to do\nOf course you're going to move on of course you are\nI'm going to do it yeah you're gonna you're gonna move on\nThat's exactly the same way with save and that's the same way which is the same way they gave I truly think you've or fixing my phone lines\nThank you so that makes me happy um but yeah you're you're going to do it so these coaches that move on to bigger and better things like of course they're going to do it but
