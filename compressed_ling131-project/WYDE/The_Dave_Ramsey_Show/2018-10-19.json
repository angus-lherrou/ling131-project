and do his job on the other end of this building with W DJ see 'em so as we head into the next two hours just you and me\nUh I'm looking up at Fox News and I I Can't believe what I'm seeing a this mass as you know there's a migrant there's a group of migrants watermelon and Hondurans in El Salvador ends and all of that\nWho has all group together in the in the Central America and are heading towards the Mexico border at the bottom of Mexico wow that is crazy it is um there there are thousands were watching then they're in it looks like some sort of\nRoadway but they've put up temporary metal\nFences um bread and there did you see they were calling at them shaking them bending them climbing up them yes uh easily could have turned them down if everybody went after it there's no doubt about it I don't know how\nUh the authorities are going to stop this if these people get violent and it's it's it's actually pretty scary right now the this caravan of\nCentral Americans has reached the Mexico Guatemala border now at the bottom of Central America at the bottom of Mexico the whole Mexican border a doubt it goes kind of narrows down at the bottom and along that those that southern most border\nMexican border a doubt it goes kind of narrows down at the bottom\nAnd along that those that southern most border\nA it's a shared the border with Guatemala and I believe they'll Salvador I don't have a map in front of me but\nUh several Central American countries they've chosen to go through Guatemala at the checkpoints there and it is chaos and I see them now moving it looks like I see the word image Ross the own and Spanish which means immigration it looks like a little um\nCheckpoint little\nA kiosk and they're all marching around it so apparently they are moving into Mexico as we speak I don't know what's gonna happen here because as you know President Trump has called on the Mexican president to put a stop to them even entering Mexico\nSo that they don't get anywhere near the U.S border and the reason why is because Trump knows that if they make it on to us land according to our own\nRidiculous immigration laws they can't be turned away and they'll claim asylum and then they get a\nThey get a slap on the wrist or they get a court date and they're told to come back to that court date in the meantime\nThey're letting loose into the United states where they begin to filter through to all the points where they know they can um access whatever they need to survive be it\nFake IDs be it welfare checks be at jobs on on on the black market because they're not legal\nWhatever it is that they do when they get in here in the United states so it's actually a very scary thing because what we're watching right now or is about four thousand people trying to stage an invasion\nAnd it's an invasion that appears\nHarmless in a sense in that they don't have weapons\nThey're carrying bags and even some of them have on a bunch of red hats and I don't know that they're ... but that it's very American looking um they have on backpacks there's kids mostly men though I noticed there are some women and children as I watch this and it and they're just walking slowly so you know ...\nWhat are you gonna do yeah most of them over\nBut at the same time they're not turning around and going back to Guatemala so this is going to be an interesting show down to say the least uh how you turned back a wave of four thousand people on a road without getting forceful\nAnd run the risk of appearing\nHarsh and violent I don't know it's a good thing it's up to Mexico right now\nA Trump has said that he will send\nThe military to the Texas Mexico U.S Mexico border if need be\nDepending on where these people decided to try and cross so that's what's happening right now and um I almost can't believe my eyes a that was on Fox News if you want to be part of the show and weigh in on this whole thing or you can at nine four one one zero one one or toll free eight six six\nPushing their way through slowly but surely just because there are four thousand of them and there's only so many\nOfficers there and unless they're willing to bring in tanks and brigades and blocks you know trucks to block it and everything I'm\nIt looks like they're making it through so which means they're going to go through Mexico I don't know what's the how this is going to play out this is going to be interesting and we also talked about the fact that even Trump alluded to what caused this whole thing to ramp up\nAt this point in time and he suggested that there's other elements at work behind the scenes\nShores are um other people working to organize this get the people in a large enough mob that it's very hard to disrupt\nAnd this is clearly nothing but\nA tactic along the lines of what liberal to a I have yet to see Republican I'm I'm not saying Republicans are as pure the wind driven snow and angels with halo but you don't see Republicans out there organizing mobs\nAnd causing this but you do we know for a fact that there are elements out their George Soros even Iraq Obama behind the scenes with his community organizing group I don't know the name of it but they\nThere are elements out their George Soros even Iraq Obama behind the scenes with his community organizing group I don't know the name of it but they they organized people at the least to cause these protests in Washington and abroad um\nAnd at at worst they pay him we know Soros is paying and let's see what you have to say about this whole thing Joe are you there\nHey glad to have ya yeah a\n... show always appreciate you are your views and stuff on it so like listen to the\nUm yeah that no is it I've got to say exactly what you said I mean I this obviously started with during the Obama administration and we know George Soros was involved\nIn that um and I think it's no different I personally think\nThey're the reason you made the comment that it seems to be the majority of man and and that doesn't surprise me I think they're going to push this thing\nBy force um that's my opinion and it seems to indicate that that's starting to happen anyway and the fact that they're getting through our at least some of them are my guess is probably going to break up some of the\nPeople that are quote unquote a while for the ride a but uh you know there there's not that I really can't see this thing going ah being stopped without force\nYeah you know Joe as you're talking to me this whole thing kind of crystallizing in my mind\nThat this is two weeks out from the mid term election this is all planned by the time they get through Mexico because they're on\nFoot they're walking it takes time by the time they get from the southern border with Mexico to the U.S Mexico border it is right around the time that people are voting and what they're looking for I have no doubt in my mind if they want they want violent conflict on the media on the news\nEvery night leading up to the time that people vote and they want to make it look like the military is out to destroy men and women\nWho are seeking shelter from violence and poverty and it is it just coming before me as I sit here\nYeah no absolutely not only that\nHow many what percentage based on the figures you gave us earlier are ISIS who are definitely going to be forceful ah you know because they have the cover of a innocent or not and I'm Carrying non weapon carrying\nA people right uh so uh yeah they're going to be they're gonna be the people back during the election sue war of the black mask ah although there won't be wearing a black mask and were you know\n... you know doing things beating people up shooting a young girl I remember with a chair gas yeah and shot a guy a so so that that's my opinion what's what what they're going for a and it just\nI I mean I it it sickened me\nIt I I'm angry really sick and you know because it's not something that I can individually do something about and\nAnd and you've got to be diplomatic about the way you do it but the way the Democrats\nAre tree I've always felt they were a lot she still and even in some cases kill right to get there like a bunch of widen babies who are so we're losers I mean look look it from the try\nRight to get there like a bunch of wine babies who are so we're losers I mean look look it from the ... uh you know in the in the beginning when the uh rallies were going on they were they're starting fights there I just spoke of\nAnd and it goes on and on with Kavanaugh from there to have it on all points in between of their uh antenna four and a black lives matter all those things are pushing vowing they're pushing 'em\n... real rebellion and and even revolution in the ... for the word right a upon upon our society and our free nation then just a just angers me to know yeah\nIt absolutely is a very frustrating to watch Joe because you're right they act as like this they have the same level of outrage\nAnd I'm a retaliatory rage that a pimple or a drug dealer get when you when you impose on their turf I mean there's no did that and so there's like how dare you\nDiscuss in twenty sixteen we're not going away quietly and we're going to cause a ruckus a everyday leading up to this election um ... you're right it is it has come down to mobs versus job it is the most truest slogan\nOut there for this upcoming midterm elections that could ever possibly put out their back in twenty sixteen it was drain the swamp and that kind of emerged organically through Trump and all of his rallies and it was it was a rallying cry I think\nFor Republicans and independents and now it's mobs versus job we're seeing it there is a mob in Mexico and they're headed our way thanks for the\nCall Joe I appreciate it let's go to Dorothy Hi Dorothy welcome to the foreign faction\nHigh um yeah this is so [noise]\nYou know where it sport uh I mean I hear it keeps growing like you know people are just million and adding themselves I possibly ISIS people like you brought up you know about I Know what was that that's not going to talk about a lot\nYou know you won't hear about it our sons and uh you know a a quiet little session on your somewhere you know like what you guys are doing or a ... it's\nI I don't know I hear that's going to get military down there out you know we we can do what we have to do to keep people out we should be able to use all means possible\nI don't care tear gas ... rubber bullets or wouldn't allow to step foot over here if people are making us sectors are as as a strange I edited ounce bottles that disease\nRight that we all ... yeah yeah polio virus killing ... yeah and that's\nYou know when when we have to go somewhere in travel we have to get shots you know like a you got some you know island country uh overseas uh Europe\nDon't you have to have jobs to keep yourself well from whatever their diseases are they don't want to get your you have to make sure you have their shots right but people over here you know it just yeah come on you know and like I say\nYeah they're they're they're just said you know the whole world leaders everybody wants to come here\nThere's a lot of factors on I'm dangerous factors involved in this whole mob scene it's moving towards our border you brought up the health issue yes there's a lot of things going on that had been reintroduced into the United states we we don't hear a whole lot about from the CDC other than um you know that story you mentioned about the polio like\nA virus illness or the CDC said it's affecting a hundreds of kids in twenty two states but they would not release the names of the states\nLike a virus or illness or the CDC said it's affecting a hundreds of kids in twenty two states but they would not release the names of the state\nAnd I find that interesting why that why normally you release the names of the state so people can be warned it I could put it in a newscast in if something's happening in Alabama like ... or whatever\nIt is probably\nCalifornia for a short and all these other border states in it you know ones that have have welcomed um illegal immigrants it would be interesting to find that connection if we ever got the list of the state's thanks for the cold or the appreciate it\nUm yeah we're about to head to the bottom of the hour so in the meantime yeah we've got this mob moving its way through Mexico they seem to be a good gaining ground or at least making it through the checkpoint\nAs Doherty and the color before I think Joe said ISIS can easily infiltrate in fact they don't even have to join the crowd they don't even have to be part of the moving mob\nThey'd just as long as they wait until the mob gets to the border of the U.S and the ... in Mexico\nOr whatever happens there is not going to be pretty\nWhen the military has to push them back it's not going to be pretty and as with any criminal you always use a distraction to your benefit so well whatever's happening at and the cow in Texas is going on at the checkpoint there that I can bet you they're going to be you know fifty miles away at another border crossing\n... we know that the press is more than willing to try and craft the image tried to craft that weaponized headline that we know they're really good at\nThey love to weaponize a headline and make it look like horrible things are happening in Trump's behind it all and it's nothing makes them happier than to try and do this\nDays and weeks ahead of the November election so I guess for the next couple of hours that I Am here we're going to talk about different stories but the the bottom line is going to come to the same message at the bottom line is don't fall for it you're being played and make sure you'd go and vote\nAnd get your friends and your family than everybody else who's\nAware of the facts and willing to act on them to go vote as well but do not fall for this phony emotional propaganda that is being pushed out there is nothing\nLess than what happened in Alabama when we were we had the Roy Moore special election and outside forces came in and and tried to disrupt it there and cause all sorts of grief and we now have Doug Jones in the Senate who by the way didn't vote for Kavanaugh and regardless of the facts or\nActually wouldn't even meet with Kavanaugh so he just\nWasn't even going to consider it\nWe have a guy now representing Alabama who won't even give consideration to what the president is proposing even though Alabama voted President Trump into the White House so I Would think as a representative that's the least that you can do\nAnd still be able to say you're doing your job\nAnd if you can't do that then you're not doing your job and the countdown continues on that old story\nIf you want to be part of the ... the show than um feel free to call in nine four one one zero one one\nEight six six five five one nine nine three three is the toll free number and you can share your thoughts on all of this um by the way the whole\nCabinet I one of the things that was very clear about the whole cabinet situation was that they were hoping hoping it was a it was a Hail Mary I Know that they were hoping the Democrats in the Senate\nDianne Feinstein and all the other people that were playing into that Chuck Schumer for sure we're all hoping that this Kevin uh issue would be delayed more into the upcoming elections and if they could play it um they would and if they could stretch it out they would\nIf they could actually derail it that was the ultimate goal believe me they wanted that to be derailed because they knew it would have a huge huge morale affect on Republicans if Trump\nCouldn't get his Supreme Court nominee through so this you know that\nThey that was the whole kitten caboodle that they wanted that would that would have been the the ultimate dream and they knew you know if they failed but hey they'll take whatever scraps they can so if they can at least scratch out a delay and make Kavanaugh look\nTaint Tim taint his image taint the appearance taint taint his record then they'll do that\nAnd if they can't uh derail him and cause him to withdraw\nChanges image taint the appearance taint taint his record then they'll do that and if they can't uh derail him and cause him to withdraw because of the vicious attacks they've made on him his his wife has children and all the people associated with them\nThen they'll just settle for a putting it out there that he's a rapist or at least implying and putting it out there that the me too movement has just been set back\nYou know and uh women now have have had been dealt a blow it'll settle for anything they can\nFor them to be in control and and help you help being the\nThe questionable word help you interpret it the correct way the way they want you to see it and I'm\nSo that didn't work and I believe that what's happening now I'm Down in Guatemala and Mexico is another round of that exact same things slightly different form you know same song different verse\nLet's cause chaos let's see if we can get this to time out just before people are going to vote let's see if we can get a big enough mob that a a riot ensues at the U.S Mexico border\nOh when we even love it if the U.S border patrol uses tear gas or water cannons cars will will be there with our cameras to make sure that we catch a little two year old getting blasted with water even if we have to do the blasting ourselves hey well whatever it takes\nWe're gonna make sure we've got that that photo op to make everybody mad and to make everybody convinced that ... these are the true colors of Trump are coming out now he's out for the kids\nHe's out for war he's out for violence never mind don't ever fall for this never mind what has taken place in the weeks leading up to this election okay I'm just here to remind you this is my service you for the next few ... a little while\nAnd this is my service do you I'm just going to remind you that um several ... congressional\nSenators congressmen and candidates had been threatened some of even been attacked I think it was in North Dakota I don't have that story in front of me or I Do know that as of today in New York they've arrested a man who threatened to assault and killed\nTwo senators they would not release the names of the senators I'm Glad that's fine they don't have to do that\nI Would be interesting to find out the name of the guy\nAnd where what his story is and where he's been for the past couple of months at have you been in Washington DC clawing up the doors of the Supreme Court I wouldn't surprise me if that's the case so we\nThere's been an of a lot of violence we've got moms in DC clawing at the Supreme Court doors we've got antifa in Portland, Oregon causing all sorts of the\nHabit of their most recently we've got threats we've got a congressional members like Maxine Waters are pushing for us this idea that you got to not let them eat in peace we've got people getting disrupted during their dining experience\nUh that's the that's the minimum\nAnd and now you know we've we have a you know Rand Paul's wife sleeping with a a gun by your bed because of all the stuff that's happened to her husband\nNow remember Rand Paul had his ribs broken by his neighbor but he was also shot at on a baseball field and and don't let me let you forget this that just didn't that happen just a little while ago\nSteve ... was almost killed and two of Alabama's\nThat happened just a little while ago Steve ... was almost killed and two of Alabama's come congressional members mo Brooks and Gary Palmer were on that field as well\nSo again I'm coming back to the slogan\nUm now we're going to be chanting all the way to the polls it's mobbed versus job and there's a vast that's different we're going to take a break love for you to join the show\nOr you can call and be part of it nine four one one zero one one eight

catch up on it here's the thing I I'm a ... it's great that they caught these Russians it really is but the key thing that Katherine Harris who was sharing that is that they were tasked with causing

should be following on his coat tails and the ...\nThe guy goes around and says discord through his organizations all the time\nSo tell me how we're focusing on a Russian national\nAnd not others\nNot

can't have a say in our government in our governance when they are legally here\nAnd they don't understand it they're here to to to work off the system and gained the goods but do they even understand the fundamental issues that have made America what they are\nHow can they they they've been they've been lied to for one thing they don't know English and they and they're coming from another country that has not promoted democracy\nA representative republic has not devoted has not promoted the individual rights that all of us have under God and the constitution these are not countries that do that what a mullah El Salvador Honduras\nDo you not do this these people are not coming in with an ideology that says I'm finally gonna make it to the motherland that coincides with my long held deep seeded beliefs\nThey came up again [noise]\nWash your hands [noise]\nHey we'll come back into the Ford faction Andrea Tice here for brown will be in next week I'll be here on Monday I'm taking it\nThrough to Monday glad you could be part of the program we just had a call from ... and he was um bringing up issues that uh our nation face and and he's got a valid point that you know we have a criminal justice system that needs to be evaluated and corrected and all of that\nThat is a long term goal\nIt here's the thing I guess I Want to point out from that totally by the way I'm Glad you called um\nI understand that that is the long term goal that doesn't move quickly you can't pivot on that quickly it's just not the way it is anything with a involving the system takes time it takes leadership that takes selecting the right people through the system\nThis isn't a case of a mob running down to Montgomery and\nStorming the office of the a commissioner of prisons and yanking him from his desk and replacing him that we do not live in that kind of a country we live in a country where the system is built\nTo replace bad leaders and we have to go through the system otherwise we we just\nDenigrate ourselves into a mob rule into a government of chaos into a tyranny into\nA non democratic government where the people don't fix it from the bottom up and so that's\nYou know I I understand you get ... again I felt like ... totally was pulling an emotional car there this is happening these are people that are on the take their crib they're got their quotas and they're throwing people in jail that don't deserve I understand that I Do it's okay I don't like it\nBut again it it seems to be an emotional pleas for something to be done\nOkay but you got to go through the system\nLook if I if someone comes to ... lists all the things that are wrong with my body you know you've got high blood pressure you got diabetes ah your knee is out of whack I got a choice I can let it go\nI can go find the best doctor to address those issues or a specialist\nOr I can go down you know I can go get in a panic and go down to you know the local ah which doc tour hippie you know organic ... what do you call those people that that has crystals and all sorts of ... you know herbs in their house and see if\nThey can help me um I I don't recommend that\n[laughter] that that has crystals in all sorts of ... you know herbs in their house and see if\nThey can help me um I I don't recommend that but if if I get all emotional that have to be dealt with right away I might be more likely to go that route\nAnd it would be a shame because it wouldn't take care of things ... you know I'm not talking all holistic medicine is wrong but I'm just saying\nUm you get you got to pick your the right vehicle\nTo accomplish their goals and you can't throw everything out 'cause then we just have chaos\nRoger can you you want to weigh in on this whole thing\nThat I have a couple of port Charles ... you mentioned emigration and you also mentioned the protesters mhm ... California fires too low spiritually or LA or there and get a driver's license or two and a lot of Africa for the ...\nThat's right and all sorts like ... years old rock the vote\nI Know California California is becoming the entry point for this invasion simply by way of being able to vote in the system\nIllegitimate ... they're not legitimate citizen but they're able to hijack the system and vote this is very concerning to me it really is voter fraud like I said before I'm more concerned about voter fraud being I'm becoming pervasive in the state of California\nAnd overwhelming the system just by the fact that they pull all of our congressional representation by number by their population not by legitimate citizens it's it is but it's very upsetting\nAll this focus on one side of this law ... law that should not her heart felt folks\nIf people are getting paid on a I'm a I'm a big money the lady at a at a flight up in the Senate yeah like a hundred and fifty thousand dollar air strikes drunk ... that's ... yeah\nI yes I did see that things Roger\nProfessional get fired for Fifteen dollars\nYeah I Know well the reason being Roger it's really simple look ah we as humans we we can only\nMuster up fake emotions for so long right um other incentives have to be brought in so they want these protesters they want them to stick with it they want him to claw at the Supreme Court doors on the data Kavanaugh's there they they wanted to stay in DC for weeks on end\nAnd caused commotion you got to pay them you gotta pay him to eat you got to pay him to sleep\nAnd then you've got to pay them give them an incentive for for hanging on that long because clearly they don't have jobs they got to get back to\n'em so he had other incentives for being there and\nI think these people are are so self interested themselves that they wouldn't last long if it weren't for that fact you know I think they get bored and and then the get distracted find a squirrel in and walk off I'm\nA or ask you one question before you let me go yeah a follow up above of a show trial if I'm a crush of it or if I stood up for the ... national stood are protesting now\nI think it would be great I think it would be refreshing I think Washington DC is overdue for an actual grass roots protest and I think it would be fantastic if Alabama and all the other Americans out there and other states took part in\nThe other way to get in our face or that it shatters\nA there'd be too many of us and they probably would have an idea we'd all be packing so that might have flown\nDon't let it get shorter showers\nA there'd be too many of us and they probably would have an idea we'd all be packing so that might slow them down thanks Roger [laughter]\nThey for the call I appreciate it yeah I think Washington DC needs I think if an actual true blue grass roots effort happened without any payment between George Soros and his organizations if that actually happened I think the media would be overwhelmed with the amount\nAnd the and the conduct\nIt would be vastly different than what's happening\nWhat has happened in Washington DC and what's happening down at the Mexico Guatemala border [noise] um and all around you know other places where this is happening Roger mentioned again that California\nAllows driver's license for non citizens and then by virtue of having a driver's license you can go to a polling place and vote and then if you have someone within the precincts and you know governed by the um\n[noise] uh the secretary state who runs the election if they're not requiring a strict adherence to verification and um ID and and ah who gets absentee ballots in all of that\nOr if they're not even committed to purging the roles to eliminate dead voters and people that have moved away and I'm ... and you know all of that then that that that state is ripe\nFor an invasion of by way of voter fraud\nImmigrants illegal immigrants I should say as getting getting their license at a sanctuary city and and and basically stealing or vote I Know that we tend to think oh that's California there are all nuts over there and they're\nYou know hundreds of miles away\nIt's a shame I wished that state would fall off the face you know all that big earthquake dropped into the hours that we ... wouldn't miss a lot of ... I I understand that it's in some ways it um\nIt seems far away and so it's it's a little mental bowl but what are you going to do but realize California\nAs we speak if the more people they let in illegally means they're stealing our vote over here in Alabama those of us who have legally registered we are citizens we've got the id we'd go out to vote they've basically from a distance stolen our vote\nAnd that's why mo Brooks and I'm Steve marshals launched this lawsuit I Hope it gets through in enough time to do some some real I'm\nHaving an effect on the twenty twenty\nBut it's going to be interesting to see what happens here November what has happened in the in the past two years\nThat could possibly um steal the election just through voter fraud in in California law I don't know it's it's very disconcerting 'cause there's already stories coming in a like Roger mentioned about the\nIdea being issued to to non citizens um there was one I just saw this morning I don't know that I have it to find talking about ah someone of admitting to voter fraud\nAnd they're very much activating people to cause it now they may not be doing as much of the violence that George Soros is encouraging\nI don't know we'll see\nWe'll see what what are you know comes to the surface overtime with people digging around and investigating 'cause this is going to be one of the first elections word Brock Obama having been gone for two years from the office would have gained any type of influence our power within his organization to\nYou know to make a change in the terms we know he wants to for sure so I mentioned Brock Obama George Soros George Soros is weighing in on the Alabama it's on yellow hammer news dot com\nHe's put two hundred thousand dollars into the state he did it by way of Tuscaloosa political action committee\n[noise] um they have various names is kind of a group of packs a they're called cash pack C. M. G. packed to eat the pack leadership packed pride packed to teach town packed too and there's probably more these groups have already contributed thirty percent to ...\nAct two and ... there's probably more these groups have already contributed thirty percent to ... his campaign for governor\nSo these packs are very much Democrat leaning and now we know that George Soros finds a kindred spirit in these packs otherwise why we put his money there\nHe feels they're going to do exactly what he would like them to do in this campaign and he has thrown in two hundred thousand dollars\nA certainly nothing to sneeze at it's probably not as big as contribution but we also don't know how many contributions he's already given to the state these packs because it's only flag because of its amount if he sends a thousand dollars here and there over the course of the last six months that is not going to\nBe as noticeable this was brought to our attention because of the amount\nAnd then it's required by law for him for it to be disclosed the source and everything\nSo we've already got George Soros wing of the Alabama my gosh this guy is like a spider his fingers reach everywhere he sees any type of weakness he sniffs out like a shark blood in the water and then they try to go in there and now I think he's wasting the money because I don't think Maddox is going to win\nBut nevertheless ... Alabama's gotten on the radar of George Soros and I I'm\nPretty positive he probably was involved in the whole Roy Moore thing as well or at least egging it along\nUm so just be aware of that again here we come November midterms\nAre don't be duped into thinking that all is as it seems on the service there are people behind the scenes working for a different outcome than what's best for America let's go to Kim see what she has to say\nEither [noise] hey how are you doing today doing great\nOh I have a couple of questions for you well ... I have a statement for you [noise] um [noise] I understand you're famous toy George SARS a totally get that but he's actually not doing anything any different\nThan what the Koch brothers do for the right so I think it's disingenuous to just completely go after George tours for everything when the Koch brothers are doing the exact same thing on the right and then the question that I have for you is this caravan of\nPeople who are seeking asylum you know from Honduras Guatemala because they they are so gang infested countries these people running for their lives the way they want a better life for themselves that's while they're trying to come to America do you have any proof that George Soros the left behind this ... this caravan coming\nA no ... no proof at this point uh Trump's referred to it at the rally in Montana that it it looks like there's there's some shady business like how did this all come together here's the thing\nWhen do four thousand people all just randomly from from all over the country just just suddenly congregate together and say hey let's make a run for the U.S Mexico border\nNo it doesn't happen if people are seeking a better life and they do it individually because they stand a better chance of first of all getting across the border\nBy themselves if they're really going to do it that way I don't recommend it but if you if you've come to the point where you've got to get out of the country and you've got to get to the U.S\nAnd seek asylum I I don't buy that argument to begin with but if you're going to do it you got to do your best chances of doing it is all alone without causing I'm getting eyes on your endeavor now why they don't seek asylum in Mexico that brings up a whole another reason why\nBeing um getting eyes on your endeavor now why they don't seek asylum in Mexico that brings up a whole nother issue why is that they go to the U.S and not Mexico Mexico would be a whole lot easier there it's right there [noise] um so you know there was no proof\nRight now but it's very very suspect it follows the name line of all these protesters in Washington DC that came together and we know for a fact that they're getting paid it's been traced so it's just odd we don't have the means to know exactly what happened\nDown in Guatemala when it first emerged we're just seeing the the the actual symptoms\nIn full display but we don't know what the sources\nAre all came to the to be and to your point before that when you were talking about the Koch brothers yes they're contributing legally\nThe law and George Soros I is free to do that as well but George Soros has a tactic that I don't see in the Koch brothers and that is to go hand in hand\nWith the baser elements the antifa the protesters those who are willing to be violent those who are willing to be paid to\nCause problems in and burn things and break things and\nUm [noise] obstructed people in the hallways and ... you know corner them in elevators\nKoch brothers are sending money to other um groups but that's not the outcome was coming out of that is political action not violence that's the difference I Would point out with George Soros Kim thanks for the call appreciate it let's go to David are you there David\n... I was going on on\nMay welcome to the Ford faction\nYou know the last caller talking about and all those martyr here and people trying to come over here and better lives but why should we\nBe Verghese with all the problems I mean they're fleeing Guatemala and they're coming up here and\nI mean Donald troubles right you just sit at the wrong way when it started as campaign yeah some of them are real people suffer writes us on burgers you know there's a kid in San Antonio that\nWas supposed to be the poor country the murder and still Eighteen year old she is emerging him alive and that's the stuff that we're getting from these other countries\nThat don't care about our way of life felt some that are down there with our yards of bullets in southeast votes from coming in our country without our government's not going to do\nThe whole time and just you know look at each other on the news for Americans to stand up and do what they need to do to stop this crap\nThey save it for the call I appreciate it I Do I hear I hear your frustration\nI'm hopefully Trump has seen this tactic play out already and how they use it and how they um play the crowds in and play the press will actually the press is more than willing to be played\n'em and hopefully he's seen this already in his head of it and that's why he's calling on Mexico to step in before any violence ever ups and um before we had come down to\nThe U.S border patrol in the military having to take action in a way that will be very unseemly on camera I can assure you I'm In I don't think it'll get to the point of bullets\nBut um it certainly hope not um but ah hopefully Trump sees where this is going and heads it off the path we got to take a break we only have ten more minutes after that three hours just flew by I'm Andrea ties in for the Ford faction will be back in a flash\nMuscle irons rather currently looking for forty local to want to participate in a three six weeks challenge that is guaranteed to get the results [noise] with that challenge you'll get accustomed meal plan personal accountability grocery list and so much more as long as you reach your goal wait the challenge is absolutely free contact your closest tribe today to find out more\nHad guys this is Thomas Cox from ... we're talking about our service milk for meals which is real forever but you could pick up on Monday afternoon so what we do is we have meals and we have food pounds which you could take it home and have food\nAll week for what this does is it makes your life easier it keeps you out to dry food if you also point with what you're trying to seek ...
