we [noise]\n[noise] ... and ...\n\nHey welcome back into the Ford faction hundred ties in for before brown a big day if\nThe producer just informing we were we left before the break talking about the trans gender doctor from Charleston representing candidate for some reason I don't understand that ah but the a transgender woman meaning he was a biological man entered the\nCompetition as a bicyclist as a transgender woman was competing against biological women and they found out how much this person one by so go ahead\nLess than one sucker so ... got his boat but by girl\nYeah eh yeah considering all that he brought to the table when when ... he has the muscles the leg power the arm power everything on that bicycle and so the the women gave him a run for his money so I don't know what that says\nDoes that say he's a lousy transgender yes okay All right we'll apparently now if if he had won by huge amounts we would still be outraged because then it just shows that that there's a huge this\nLiterally that's the way the laughs gonna boy it is also there are almost equal yeah you're right that's exactly right so you know but that's the way I look at it they're gonna they're gonna go see there's no there's not that much\nBut it wasn't that in the ... are the women are just right you know nipping at his heels so there is no nothing to worry about nothing to worry about they'll be fine\nRight at it and if she if you would have got beat by a woman ... you would have never seen any of this\nYou know you're probably right listen to what he said I'm this is the quote from Rachel McKinnon who was born a biological mail this is bigger than sports it's about human rights okay McKinnon if it's about human rights then why did you take the when if you're trying to\nTry to make a point beyond the sports and the competition of the bicycle racing I Would think that you would actually make a bigger message by not taking the win even if you win\nI don't know\nIf it's beyond the sports I'm not sure why you would allow the wind to overshadow what you're doing\nWell um\nI don't know that my as my logic to twisted there okay so then he goes on to say my\nDoing well uh\nI don't know that my as my logic to do is they're okay so then he goes on to say my ... this this ... listen to this by catering to sis gender people that's talking about street people that raw deal with however they're born they live with it right they don't do anything more\nBy catering to this gender people's views that furthers transgender ... people's oppression so\nBy you and me continuing on in life just being this gender straight people who accept our our our gender as being God given right no way to change it was live with it or\nWas by doing that we are furthering the oppression of transgender\nSo when when my grandson or sly whose adult I was just supposed to go with it is is that what he's saying I mean oh little man who's ...\nDog so who's going to end up being a fifth or sixth ... members stuff and putting them out in the back yard so he can think of ...\nSure because you could potentially be stepping in and oppressing his gender seeking self no I'm a look\nAt it I go shut up you actually get a ...\n[noise] yeah well this is what this person said by catering catering ... we're not talking about just holding a a competition where\nThe people involved in the competition the other women are working hard they're training they are giving up and sacrificing in order to be part of this particular sporting event so I don't see how catering ...\nThere's nothing was catered to\n... the way always look at it is there's a of always heard women studied\nThis\nIn a man's world I have to work twice as hard to be as good as them in a man's world if so now they have something of their own they're still have a new work twice as hard to try to be a guy that thinks he's a goal\nRight because it's crossing over simply because this person wants to identify as a woman and so yes they've crossed over into these uh arenas that we have carved out to help women compete without the a\nDisadvantage of men being in there with their physical strength\nAnd he's cross over and basically now not just crossed over and said hey I Want to do this hope you don't mind but actually saying things like this\nIf you don't let me do it you're just furthering transgender people's oppression that this is what this person went on to say McKinnon when it comes to extending rights to minority population why would we asked the majority in other words\nWe can't rely on the majority to have a fair analysis of this that are always on and only depends on the minorities opinion and in this case a very very very very small minority a fraction of a fraction\nAnd are weighing in on there and let me just say this murder I Can't believe you send me something like the ... my ... my partner is a dog the\nTransgender man who's a ... as I\nLeave it to ... to do that because I actually saw the headline for that story and it there are certain ones that I just don't even dare to broach because other low quality and looted giving me yeah your\nPartner acts like a dog so you trust\nWell offering offering personally he should have started where everyone else ... book cause number one if you look at them artificial words they're kind of ... so I gave him more of an advantage so he should've started [noise] buying the people with regular\nSo I'm not sure I understand the on\nDon't disagree [laughter]\nDid are you saying that he actually started behind or in front he was given a head start in the Olympics\nThat he said I should have been a he should've started behind everyone else because they had such advantage\nAnd disagree but yeah you know but you're saying in the actual Olympics dawn that he actually got to a head start I Know you started your date\nOf dawn\nYeah oh there you you cut out there for a second I'm not really the only thing I'm familiar with with the story is is the fact that you know his girlfriend's dad and it's very likely he's he you know whatever what but but I don't know what happened before that with the Olympics so clue me in\nYou know I've I've just started this this person you're talking about it obviously has an advantage and you know maybe there should not be a competing in the uh the\nIn which he's trying to compete and ... that's the case then maybe Oscar shouldn't have been able to should not have been able to compete in the Olympics with is given advantage what those are for springboard which\n[noise] yeah well um it's it's a valid point I mean like like they said I mean he has a a an extra advantage something should have at least accommodated that I mean it's a it's a real earliest advantage or did he ever when\nHe won big time yes\nOkay wow so he even cashed in on that that the\n... yes right\nAnd that's your gift yourself that I'd just by showing a breakthrough for each other you know yeah I was like\nAll right thanks for Don thanks for calling in\nYeah how is it that if you have performance enhancing drugs that's considered taboo\nYou can't do that you'll get disqualified in fact a a woman tennis player from Russia got banned for I don't know how many months from competing because of one single drug that was in her system that she claimed you know that her argument was a you know that was just part of her diet\nThat she did that and it wasn't performance enhancing is just some sort of cleansing thing I Want her name was Anna something something rushing you would think I Would know\nOf someone that is own drugs yeah you have a clip of a person that I think is on drugs oh are you talking about Alec Baldwin yes on their hands on those drugs yeah I Know he was speaking we will go to that a Alec Baldwin was speaking\nI Believe in New Hampshire um to some Democrats there\nAnd it's interesting what he said I'm going to I Am not going to give him the NBC treatment which is to take it completely out of context like they did President Trump when he was referring to general elite in general you this is as grant\nAnd then they had to go back forty eight hours later and correct it and put it in context so that people would understand that Trump was not praising Robert he he was actually complimenting you list is grant by comparing his\nMilitary expertise to that of someone with equal military expertise which is Robert really\nI I completely digress but that was what NBC did\nAt of someone with equal military expertise which is Robert really I I I completely digress\nBut that was what NBC did over the weekend and then they waited a convenient forty eight hours a lot like I'm Ted Kennedy leaving the scene of the crime for how many hours thirty six twenty four hours before you know so that the girl at the bottom of the river Mary Jo ... me is is dead so NBC\nWeights forty eight hours before they ever come back and trying to correct their mistakes in the meantime that headline is blasted out and we all know that the first headline has far more impact than any follow up that you have\nAnd so that's their goal it's the first missile it's designed to destroy so they put out the headline Donald Trump praising Robert de leite incredible general he says quote unquote\nThat is not what he said but they got it out there they wanted to make sure that you are listening thought oh my goodness\nDonald Trump went to Ohio maybe out in the mid west maybe there's some I don't know white supremacy that prevails out there and he's you know a dog whistling to them and a wink and a nod Robert ... it was really a good general I don't know whatever it was they wanted to paint him the obvious\nGoal is to portray Trump as a racist a lunatic or or or just both\nAnd so they did it they threw the headline out they wanted to get your get your attention and whether you follow through on the story whether you follow through and listen to the video it's\nThe ideas out there that he's out there praising Robert Daly and ... and and you know what there wouldn't have been anything wrong with them even if he did because Robert really was a good military general\nJust because you pray someone for their skills in one area doesn't mean that you were praising the whole effort of the civil war that you're somehow going back to this to to the south and saying you know they they should have won\nA you're just praising him for his skills and his military expertise and what he brought to the table anyways I totally digress I'm Sorry ... uh Dave let's get to the Alec Baldwin clip or do you play the first half this is him speaking at a Democrat rally where he\nAddresses what needs to be done he uses the word overthrow but that's at the end and we'll see you listen to how we qualifies himself in using that word overthrow\nWould change governments here at home in an orderly and federal it in the early in the Senate way [noise]\nUnlawful [noise] we need to overthrow the government of the United states under Donald Trump [laughter]\nOkay so he's making it very clear I'm I'm really pushing for the orderly a lawful legitimate way through elections that we have change of power and that is through the people voting\nBut then he goes to another word overthrow so it's interesting to me that he ... me [noise]\nYou ... you can't overthrow the government\nLegally you you're either\nReplacing the ones that are in power but you can't over throw a government without doing something illegal it\nExactly Dave brilliant point right where I was headed until my throat gave out I had to take a civil water right [laughter] [noise] yeah why would he pair that word with what he or what the predators\nRight where I was headed until my throat gave out I had to take a civil water right [laughter] yeah why would he pair that word with what he or what the credit was which was to do it orderly an election in the normal sense of the word is the people voting out so overthrow implies\nSubverting the process\nOr ignoring the process or\nTaking over the process and changing it\nSo it's just a really weird way that he presented it it doesn't make any sense play it again I just want to hear every I Want everybody to hear again what he did he set it up to make it sound very legitimate but then he goes to this crazy very resistance type word a rebellious type word of over throat\nAll right go ahead with change governments here at home in an orderly and formal way it in the early and federal way an awful way we need to overthrow the government of the United states under Donald Trump [noise]\nI I don't think he knows what he's talking about I think you're right I mean who's trying to speak out of both sides of his mild\nAmong a of I've never had respect for them and then after he yelled at his daughter yes that was terrible or the way he did go on a pig and every last\n... I mean there I haven't I don't listen to him and I don't pay attention to anything I mean it's almost to me like\nIf I Want to know some about politics I don't go to ...\nYeah exactly I ...\nA lot of respect I think we've lost in in the way he treated his daughter years ago and it and now there's just does not jibe it doesn't jive what is he trying to do here it's interesting that he would\nAddress these people are saying we need to overthrow the government of the United states and again it sounds to me it sounds to me like it's a dog whistle that everybody in the liberal media wants to\nPoint out on the other side but it's basically appealing to those who are in a fight mode in rebellion mode resistance ... antifa he's appealing to them and their um their current day ... state of mind\nBut then he wants to qualify and self oh my goodness I I Want to do with the right way well then use the right word for the right\nProcess and and don't don't mix is up here it's very very confusing at best All right we've got to take a break I'm Andrea ties in for the Ford faction will be back in a minute hang with us\nAmerica where common sense is not so common the following it does not necessarily reflect the opinions or views of Crawford Broadcasting its employees affiliates or advertisers\nGary Palmer understands that America needs a strong military and\nCrazy we'll talk a little bit more about it you can call in about a to lobby or on the other side for one more hour with a Ford faction but right now we got ahead to break the\nWhat are we going to go to the crazy lady this whole drug snakes will try [laughter] we'll be right back [noise]\nDo you why do you have for Coleman W D.

B. T. M. Thirteen meteorologist any walk of any more cats on his Crawford Broadcasting station [noise]\n\n\nWhy from Birmingham, Alabama Ramona superstation auto on studio ...\nYellow him or radio breeds and Ford factions [noise]\nWell\nWell well keeping with the Ford faction tradition here we are on the other side of the second hour headed for a third ...\nIn for Ford brown glad you could be part of the program I Am watching video right now and Fox News of a President Trump in Florida with first lady at the uh he's touring the area that has been hit by hurricane Michael\nPresident Trump in Florida with first lady of the uh he's touring the area that has been hit by hurricane Michael ah I see governor Florida governor Rick Scott there as well as a homeland security director I guess that's her name\nTitle accused and Nielsen Nelson and it looks like Brock Long is there the head of FEMA\nSo that's what's happening right now as we speak we finished out the last hour talking about Alec Baldwin who plays President Trump on SNL by the way a big days it turns out that he didn't realize that he when he was asked to do this\nSpoof of Trump before the election he didn't realize it was going to\nGo on because he didn't think Trump who's gonna win apparently he talked to the producer of SNL which is I'm\nA I cannot think of his Lauren Michael and he promised and he said look it's only going to happen we've got three more showings three more Saturdays where we want you to play Trump and then once the election's over you're good you're going to be gone no one's gonna care\nBecause we won't you won't be around roared and lo and behold a Trump wins now apparently now I like both when\nYou don't have to you just have to do this no one's forcing him he can you didn't sign a contract to say he has to represent an spoof Trump Everytime SNL does it\nSo I think he needs to get out of it I think it's doing some damage to his mental health him trying to to play Trump trying to get into character and clearly he's not favorable towards Trump's so therefore it's only going to constantly\n... who was crying that Hillary's ever do but it was crazy before the\nWell this will make him crazier this will really be a bird in his saddle\nIs really gonna grind his gears so I think Alec Baldwin needs to take a break from politics or at least humor in politics and spoofing Trump and he probably need to take a break away from these uh these\nUh speeches he's given because they don't make any sense just to recap I I I can play the audio again but it's long and I don't want to promote him\nYou know what I mean but here's what he said a malicious immigration policy okay so it's malicious in what way it keeps\nPeople out that are illegal it doesn't diminish anybody trying to seek\nTo immigrate here properly yeah other than the fact that it's going to try and screen out terrorists and those who are coming with ill intent or those who are offering anything All right Dave you want to go to Trump okay Trump is speaking to do\n[laughter] that's right I mean\nThese are great people [laughter] right here for\nA photo was going to be more than\nHe looked like he was setting himself up to say something to the oh yeah that was Trump down in Florida they're outside walking around they've got some things are RVs and FEMA trailer set up\nA lot of people a lot of people ... milling around talking to the president I'm getting a response to from him in Milan is there as well so it's a good good for him he's he's getting out there\nA big weekend for President Trump by the way I mean we had Andrew Brunson the pastor returned\nA big weekend for President Trump by the way I mean we had Andrew Brunson the pastor returned from turkey having spent two years in prison ... part of that was home improvement but most of that was with in the Turkish prison which cannot be fun\nUnder any circumstance and now Brunson is back in North Carolina his home state after Trump\nPut a lot of pressure on the Turkish government to let them go so a lot of winning for Trump it just keeps coming\nYou remember all the trailers in Louisiana and everything I I don't but maybe I wasn't here whenever you needed them or the during Katrina oh I Know I wasn't here are\nThe voters ... built a lot of FEMA trailers as far as just a little\nAlthough it's temporary housing ... okay you know and it's just a trailer the bicycle you had a kitchen ... in a ... a place for you to the ...\nI'm Wondering if they're going to start assuming a bunch down there to them they need to if they do because these people have nothing I mean nothing\nNever mind that fact and by the way how about the women now who are up against Harvey Weinstein they were adults when he did what he did to them and the pressure and the leverage that he tried to use on them but that's okay no it isn't he's going\nThrough court right now Harvey Weinstein is but Bill Clinton doing what he did with an intern an intern who was\nUh how many years younger day do you remember twenty thirty of think it was some like the it was significant right it was thirty ...\n... ... they had an investigation and he was\nFound guilty ... he was impeached he was impeached by the house so\nBut that to me is a guilt or they wouldn't have impeached him if he was a guilty\nRight or it it just didn't go to the to the final step of actually removing him from office Ross she's happy with that she doesn't mind the fact that he got labeled as the way that he did and then he got proven to be a liar\nOr as well as the gang um she

let's see\nThe bay trip and I get questions from Donna\nYes right that maybe that was what he meant by oh you're so preparing ... takes a lot for her to read them\nI guess and then let's see our defense bill was Monica Lewinsky was sick or a fast statutory right\n[laughter] you're right she was Eighteen she's barely under Eighteen right\nI think she was twenty two and he was already nine but you know really hurt me over Twenty one it's more about the power dynamic oh and I I don't know uh you know that was so horrible\nIt was horrible it was just absolutely terrible\nSo what is she saying all these women who may have even had less of an age gap with Harvey winds dean but they they testified that they felt pressured and they they thought they were going to lose their jobs and blah blah blah and and he he's okay she she's OK with that that that's OK apparently\nWell I Know you could make an argument that there was a quid pro quo Harvey Weinstein thing and that you know they traded sexual favors for a job with Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky\nI think she was deeply deeply I don't know involved is the right word\nEmotionally attached invested somehow oh yeah\nOh you know to me that's I don't want to say but I just says\nNo I I I agree\nI mean you know the level of exploitation is a lot higher there to me\nYes I I agree I mean we it's evidence just by her own life she's never remarried she seems to live this different life as a result of it um just because the victims of Harvey Weinstein are talking emotionally\nDoesn't doesn't mean that she wasn't far more emotionally affected by what happened there and Hillary doesn't seem to want to to even delve into that she was an adult so there you\nTo respect the state of Alabama now has mattered hospital is Eighteen years old flexible cannot have relations with her and the principal's office\nAnd that's just the sense that Hillary use drugs\nThe principal cannot have relations with her and the

what he has to say hey Dave welcome to the fourth action\nYeah a second time around bragging rose today for it's not there I'm\nA less focuses that don't get it in perspective that's get it and focus of\nHillary and bill ... was just an arranged marriage according to her because she's a sexual predator but their religion is communism solemn was the biggest rapists and in Russia there's a lot of young Solomon's running around you know these people are animals they they studied under Salo live he left\nHe sat through our heads when ... when Bill Clinton was in the when they were bringing up a page what charges it was over China gay\nBut the Congress said end of the things to make money off of it they could see the big dollars off of this goes\nThat China minutes time was like in twenty cents an hour where it might get twenty dollars an hour you're different I mean we're still winding down this thing that's what's the swamp is all about it's about the money until we get this thing through our heads\nYou know these people are animals do they have no say hey morality\nThat's all we ask he goes a step further than the communist says Thomas use use as human beings is just a an a tool and\nThey'll work you to the ground but solid you said just kill 'em all he had humanity because he's a advocate for the devil and so\nI mean you know I I Can't disagree with you they I mean if you went out and\nYou know this is ludicrous even argue there is that what we need to clean house you know that this that some of the eleventh amendment was brought out at the civil war so this is southern citizens couldn't food the federal government\nWasn't part of what the founding fathers saw\nYou know we need to go to war I'm Sorry but that's the way it is we're at a point now where people like Alec Baldwin you know I'm I don't know we need to you know everybody wants to oh we'll put them in jail for the rest of their lives now I'm SARS founded we're here at large amount and hiring them\nThanks Dave thanks for the call I appreciate it yeah the Clintons they they are a piece of work that's all I can say about them and I agreed with day they they are out for ah\n[noise] the ends justify the means in their mind so if you get destroyed in the process as long as there are gaining the power that they need [noise] you know rush 'em off Monica ... you were an adult\nHow they're viewed by other countries when they come in and if they are seen as easy targets\nBecause there is the president and his ... and a government that's not necessarily going to take notice um it has a negative impact overall in in their mission\nWell I think every missionary has to do the calculus ... where they're going and um and they have a responsibility to conduct themselves legally wherever they are absolutely um but I I Would say that\nIf they do that in the United states is is going to stand behind um a human rights and but\nI wouldn't exactly say that we're we're told her about her just go wherever you want to go and do whatever you want to do because I don't think that's the right thing either I'm a you've got a you've got to know the customs and the laws where you're going on you got to abide by him on I've got friends who served in China\nAnd they there are certain criteria that had to go there under that had nothing to do with their ministry but that's the only way they could do it or not I think that's part of the equation you gotta you gotta take that into account before you leave\nAbsolutely you do you you don't want to become a problem within another country by not observing their customs their laws right there their authority over over you in in that sense oh All right another issue that I wanted to bring up that's a little closer to home\nIt was the whole um election coming up\nAnother issue that I wanted to bring up that a little closer to home\nIt was the whole um election coming up and recently we had a next door in the state of Georgia the lady who's running as a candidate they're referring to\nLegal and illegal lead documented people voting Stacey Abrams are you aware of that are issued she brought it up it was kind of it wasn't in a speech it was with her discussing it with um other workers within the Democrat Party but it just brings up that whole issue again of\nVoter integrity ... voter fraud\nUm I'm happy to say that Alabama seemed to have a a real handle on it just having worked\nAs a poll worker in in the U.S election integrity and all of that but what does that say when someone of that caliber running for governor is referring to I'm undocumented immigrants actually weighing in on our process well\nI think that it's er um first of all and it's an addictive that they don't think thing when without cheating in that respect the other thing is is there are places in California where they are allowing the illegals or people who came here legally to vote in local elections I Can't vote in the federal election [noise]\nBut um but I also think it's a play for the boat or people who came here undocumented\nAnd um I Would\nIf I were the undocumented people first of all I'd be very concerned that that I that I'm I'm trying to immigrate to a country that basically um ignores it's on walls [laughter] you're right that's not good for anybody and um if they want to be a participant in our elections\nAnd I I Would think they'd want to participate legally I'm you know as citizens but you can't have a a nation that doesn't have boarders that's not a nation and and if you're allowing people who are not um here legally to vote in your election send you basically don't have borders anybody can come out and have any impact and\nAnd I'm I'm ... ... it will come to a bad and\nI Would hope that this would actually the if this gets out and enough people in Georgia sure about this I'm I'm sure it's going to get out yeah so um it's it's really scary to actually think that someone could make a play to be governor right next door\nTo think about it they won't open borders Keith Ellison who's one of the top guys had on a shirt or no borders mhm you had a the protesters in Washington chanting uh no wall no borders no usa at all mhm uh you've got a\nPeople wanting to abolish ice\nWanting to a ball abolished the immigration Customs Enforcement agency I'm you've also got I'm calling for a Canadian style healthcare plan which they say is Medicare for all that's not ...\nMedicare is not a health health care plan it's a government subsidized insurance plan you you ... your insurance is is Medicare\nIf we um where to go to a Canadian style system I don't think the average American fully appreciate what that means for them particularly older Americans in women\nAre among the budget committee we were in a a committee meeting and and the Democrats on the committee kept pushing for all single payer system Canadian style system and I asked the I'm\nA ranking member a Democrat and I'm John Yarmuth from Kentucky\nThey didn't solve system and I asked the I'm\nA ranking member a Democrat and I'm John Yarmuth from Kentucky could he a um recommend to the American people a model\nOr a national model for the kind of health care that they're talking about and he said Canada and I that's what I think the gentleman and I didn't respond any further but the reason I ask him that is that's what I thought he would say\nAnd um there's this study that came out of a group called the Fraser Institute showed that from Nineteen Ninety three to two thousand five\nThere were between twenty five thousand in sixty three thousand Canadian women died waiting for treatment okay before you think that's a right wing a report look it up on the Huffington Post they reported on it okay\nAnd uh but you can also linked to the study and those are that's data that was taken from the province a health departments\nOr Canada or spins a tremendous amount of money in their health care they've got\nA I think it's about sixty percent of their GDP it's pretty close to what ours is yet I'm the wait time and metropolitan Canada if you need a an MRI or you need to see a specialist is over Eighteen weeks if you live in rural Canada it's over thirty one weeks\nAnd you know you and I both know that there are certain diseases and you know certain cancers that if you have to wait Eighteen to thirty weeks to get a a a follow up visits to get the diagnostics that you need that to death sentence\nRight right the MRI becomes a coughing\nRight you know it's just I don't think that's what Americans want and and then trying to provide Medicare for every body which again is a is a government subsidy subsidized insurance program\nWould cost over a period of time over almost thirty three trillion dollars a ... ... it would bankrupt the country\nStill you're making a very distinctive point here that Medicare is like you said a ... a supplemented insurance program it's not a health care found him\nUnder a national healthcare system your doctor is a government employee you're nurses a government employee the hospital is a government a facility mhm um you you're subject to to rationing you're subject to a cap on how much\nIn Canada the each province get so much money each year for their budget if they run out toward the end of the year they they have to deal with it that happened in in British Columbia about I don't know six seven years ago but ah\nYou know the Democrats out running around I saw an ad this morning talking about uh how this one are Democrats opponent a sin West Virginia's Joe ... mansions articles saying that his opponent\nUh sued the federal government and the coverage for pre existing conditions well that's an out and out and out lie well what Obamacare did\nWas set up a system of where it was guaranteed issue\nOr it didn't matter how long you're going without health insurance if you got sick you could literally pick up the phone and get health insurance it'd be like\nCan you imagine the impact that that would have on on our automobile insurance rates if you didn't have to buy insurance but you had a ... called the insurance companies that I just had a wreck I Need to buy insurance so you'll pay for my car\nWhat that would do rates that's what that's one of the ... the main reasons that I think right spiked on health insurance\nWhen we passed our health care bill out of the house back in a uh last year we had an amendment on that bill that that provided\nWhen we passed our health care bill out of the house back in uh last year we had an amendment on a bill that provided coverage for people with preexisting conditions mhm and it actually would have brought down premiums for every age group and I know that because I wrote that was my ...\nSo we
