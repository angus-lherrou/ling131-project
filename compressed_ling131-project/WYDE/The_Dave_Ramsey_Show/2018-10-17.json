I I Do have a a\nThis isn't really a Trump update this is more of like a Trump hater update you you know George Lopez do you remember that really ... funny show or that came on Nick at night was the George Lopez show is that what they call [laughter] yes it was it that George Lopez is a is a comedian if you don't know who he is\nHe's the uh he's like the villain and spy kids three or something like that remember that or a ... he's the villain in shark boy and a lot of girl got his acting career is a is not been the best but\nI tell you what I'll tell you this George Lopez has strongly oppose the president for a long time now as strongly had a little bit of opposition with the president\nAnd you know that's fine like whatever like you don't like the president that okay I get it like you know what I can suck it up and you have your views not by these just like anything else\nJust like and I think we don't need marijuana and you think we do okay that's fine let's talk about it and and maybe you give me to come to yourself maybe I'll get you come to mind that\nBut I'm not going to go out here and and try to fight you over it you know like Brent what something that that we probably don't agree on like can you think of something we don't agree on what something I've said that that you think that's not right or like it can be something as as big as\nI don't know marijuana or can be something as small as like pineapple and the pizza\nI think I don't like the third and I think you know oh I Love seafood yeah how do you like seafood nasty\nAnyway so Britain I'm not going to come and attack you because you don't like seafood right like I'm not going to come over there and I'm not going to like pull like on your braids and and show you out of a room I Hope not because you don't like seafood\nSo George Lopez gets in to and they call it a fight it wasn't really a fight it was more George Lopez just getting aggressive\nAnd um he gets really aggressive with this alleged Trump supporter at just swear drum roll please I think we have a drum roll and here we ... a year and guess where drum roll please [noise]\n[noise] [noise] the fact that\nGeorge Lopez would even be at Hooters that's my first problem second problem second problem with this whole thing is the fact that you would attack somebody you would go after somebody because they think differently than you\nLike\nI'm not gay but I wouldn't like go to one of my gay friends and be like hey I'm going to ... gay tail like no just because you have different views you do different\nStuff I'm not going to be violent towards you like I just because you think that um [noise] you think that\nWomen don't get treated equally your or you think that a Native Americans\nDon't need the ... the right to ... I'm not going to treat you differently like I don't just because you have you're using your opinion doesn't make you any less of a uh any less of a person any less of anything\nTreat you differently like I don't just because you have you're using your opinion doesn't make you any less\nOf a uh any less of a person any less of anything and I just\nI don't and then this is why I Love the the left right what does the left always preach until you literally every second they are on TV where the most accepting group of people we uh we care about everybody anyone can join us\nAh we want to uplift those specific groups of people\nAnd then what do they do they attack you and you don't have the same belief like\nIt's more like the intolerable left like they always talked about like Trump's deplorable like if you're you're a deplorable if you like Trump I got deplorable human\nBeing like okay I Love Trump get over it I'm Still gonna treat you like a person if you're a leftist and if you think that we need socialized medical care and wages and you know investment plans or you can have an investment\nPlan for your social uh anyways but ... what whatever the case may be like I'm not going to attack you for your beliefs are of like for what you think OK so first of all get that out of your head\nBut so George Lopez got into a physical altercation okay now it wasn't a fight it was more like a physical altercation like you're saying here\nWhere the man that was reportedly harassing him with a pro Trump rhetoric at Hooters in New Mexico here's my first problem with this and if you're pro Trump\nYou you don't harass anybody 'cause you're going to be on film and it's going to turn out that you know you are in the wrong like no matter what ever actually happened in the media is going to screen it like you were on\nSecond of all I didn't see anything before this happened but the guy was filming a selfie and he said oh look here comes to my friend here comes to my friend and then George Lopez grabs the back of his neck\nAnd knocks the phone out of his hand or grabbed the phone out of his hand and said here comes my boy George here comes my boy and Lopez wasted little zero time as soon as he comes into the picture um grabs the back of his neck\nAnd snatch is the phone out of his hand hits it out of his hand and then briefly you can see Lopez grabbing um again by the back in the neck\nAnd nobody uh nobody really\nLike got the fight from another angle but of George Lopez's fighting somebody I'm probably going from\nLike straight out I'm going to film and I'm going to send into world store up as the guy kept saying Jordan was to find me George wants to fight me in the video after George Lopez delayed hands on this guy but like the comedians been pretty vocal in the past about like his his hate in his distaste for the president\nAnd really the rest of the administration and literally anybody who doesn't wind up with his beliefs like if you don't believe the same way these leftist Hollywood comedian stars are actors or\nMusicians do you do what they do like they still want to make money off of you like they want you to pay a for you to pay to go see them but I tell you what they do\nThey don't\nWant you to think that they would rather blast you and say you're stupid or call you names or say you have no reason no meaning right then to actually come out there and say hey you know what you have a different point of view\nAnd I'm okay with it I understand like you have a different point of view I get that now they would never dare say that never ever say that I just I see stuff like this and I think to myself okay there's a tolerable left added again that makes me\nIt is and I think to myself okay there's a tolerable left added again\nThat makes me want to be a part of that movement that makes me want to be a part of that group\n... year me getting into my broadcaster who is because of how much this fires me up\nBut in the video the man appears to be like waiting inside the Hooters and then he he George Lopez walks in the door or whatever and the the guy who looks more like a kid and I gathered against\n'em and he was here comes my boy George and George wants to fight me George wants to fight me and he keeps saying that they're out the video\nAnd the comedian at the last cruises Sunday or because he was filming the upcoming faith based movie walking with her\nWhich contained a video of the incident reported that the un identified man started um heckling him with comments about his politics and yelling Marga so\nAnd here's one more thing on top of that like if you're a celebrity like Lopez that has been so outspoken right you've been so outspoken about your political beliefs like you're going to get some hecklers I'm not saying that the only people that are intolerable or the left because like\nPeople you're actually exist like that the company was mad about I don't think he was even matter I think you just had to use the bathroom\nI thought it was a disgruntled employee but the more I read into this because I didn't get to read the whole thing is more the more I get to read into this\nI'm starting to think that the company which produces pork products\nDidn't you know\nDidn't have the right means for him to take a break and you use the bathroom because when that production lines going if you ever worked like in a similar job or anything\nI haven't really yeah I don't like so many places in my day\nSee I've never worked in an assembly line but I figure once it starts it's kinda hard to stop yeah it is where did you work in an assembly line at\nUm and I asked you mean like uh don't give me the brand name just give me like a general assumption of like what you may or did or whatever what\nEveryone's as a sweet sweet yeah it was like a candy production Lincoln's there wasn't here in the state and I used to eat and sometimes when it came down that they probably have it on camera eating\nAmerican night who hasn't seen the I Love Lucy episode where they start eating all the chocolate [laughter] that would be me yeah that was your breath yes ah what was it here in the state yeah\nReally\nI got to find out what it is you're in the break I don't want to give them any money Palin's no you're not even ... I mean it's\nA little like a a production line once it starts I mean it's kinda hard to stop so maybe he was just thinking I can get a quick break in I'll be good to go and then are cleaning up after\nWhat he did it and now fifty thousand pounds of meat how much is fifty thousand like what is how much is meat per pound let's look that up first because I feel like that's a lot of money you know what I mean\nMaybe he was a Muslim he didn't like pork well yeah he probably would've never he probably would have never worked\nAt the Smith fields or meet dispensary were literally all they do is produced meat [laughter] made a and pork at that\nUm how much how much is meat like a kid I I Can't type and do this at the same time I want to find out how much like what dollar amount is meat per pound and how much this guy actually wasted\nOur number eight six six five one nine nine thirty three let's go to a see I see what's up how you doing\nIn order to programs that you got a little bit of everything\nYeah man I I Do you know what I found the store and I thought it was going to be a disgruntled employee but actually turned out this guy I think just had to use the bathroom because those simply lawns going too fast I think it's hilarious\nYou know about to I think it's about three weeks ago you know the cargo Cargill company um that's a huge company I located in Minneapolis but they have any processing center in Colorado and they had they announced it or they were disclosing of a hundred and thirty two thousand pounds of beef\nBecause it had any kind of line and\nMike you off to the U.S enough so they were warning people about eating it and I think it was actually going to come back in July and uh I\nLike I say they say see but I Would much rather eat meat that's been peed on that has a whole lot you know what I mean like I I Will take my chances because they know it has a cold\nLook like I hate to say they say see but I Would much rather eat meat that's been peed on that has a whole lot\nYou know what I mean like I I Will take my chances because they know it has he cola and then like some guy like took a leak around the meat and I'm like oh give me that many you know I'd rather do that I think ... I'll take my chances I may still getting a whole lot that way but ah but it but I've got probably a better shot at it\nWell or in most cases a healthy person or or the European is normally sterile there's no bacteria but if you ever get in here track disease of course it would get bacteria into the may\nGosh how you see I didn't even think about that you remember the very first episode of the office were to write the white case route goes urine is sterile\nSo this guy maybe it was just doing a favor to everybody else I've just also calculated it um he wasted about three hundred thousand dollars worth of meat as well that's a lot of meat well I\nWouldn't I wouldn't make a comment about marijuana you were talking about though yeah yeah yeah well\nYou know the medical marijuana they use a string of marijuana has almost ... THC in it and then a by chemical means that can extract and all and that all is beneficial to people who have\nEpilepsy and have seizures it seems to control a you know by taking that but but see that's been processed into very pure product\nBut just smoking marijuana ma understanding um a few years ago or ... years ago there were just a few strains of marijuana but they've been bred everything produced the marijuana strains now much more potent and they have found several hundred component send them there you know different chemicals and them\nSo up once and say on the man that called in he he gave you some erroneous information or they found that the uh uh if if young people teenagers who winds are still developing smoke marijuana that there's some chemicals and the\nMarijuana so now the actually affects the development of their brain and Lou is there are few and of course have brains develop holding up until we're in our early twenties and uh so uh you know he he gave a little bit of erroneous information there might be interested in that was the facts but\nBut there's been a lot of research on marijuana in fact the University of Mississippi I'm I'm not sure the status of it now but they had a marijuana farm at Oxford you know at the university and they had a big research I'm a effort over there for many many years it made us and um\nBut uh you know a lot of people try to minimize the effects of marijuana but\nFrom my understanding I heard recently that they're they look car accidents in Colorado have increased tremendously the people have soil reactions you know and they're causing a lot of car accidents and so it's not all positive about marijuana there are a lot of\nNegatives and I have never smoked at myself and I heard you say you have and I never intend to smoke you know\nI don't want to damage my brain ... by some things like that you\nKnow and yeah I just I just never see myself like part talking and I think I'm I'm saying and obviously in a funny way I never see myself actually talking in a in that and I just I I don't know I just I've seen my friends do it and I've I've seen the brain cells that it's killing them and I'm good I don't want that\nWell you know mind altering drugs a lot of times\nThey change the wind in some way but it's kind of a subtle change in my late ... or or something and I you know I don't want to expose mumbling to something or you know there there is that it's just ridiculous but but\nBut a lot of people you know you saw in Canada I think a lot of people will start smoking marijuana since they might have legal that calming\nBut a lot of people you know you saw in Canada I think a lot of people start smoking marijuana is legal that probably never would've smoked it\nI think it's just like sex festival that a that a lot of young people start trying it and get you hooked on it and I'm a you know and people say well it's not the it's not a gateway drug but I've heard leaning addicts say that it is the gateway drug it gets you into a trying other things are more powerful and\nYou know has a greater effect on on on the brain and nervous system I don't know I have a patient chemistry I I Know a lot about this subject and\nUh so it's it's not good to do it I I don't I ... I could not justify any person smoking marijuana\nIt just it's just I\nDon't really affects you know if it's been a processed and and they extract good component for a little actually all day so you were born epileptic so then that's okay I mean it's been approved by FDA but but just to get him by marijuana from Romania or you know it's ridiculous and uh\nYeah I just I'm I'm not down with it you know what I mean I just I I'll never really taken it I never really do it and I just I don't want to see like a dispensary on every corner of the street 'cause like I Know that's what's gonna happen\nI I don't know I have the same feeling either about it and uh so I just wanted to mention that the demand that called in my\nStatement out that he said that they're they're almost no research on marijuana but there's been research on marijuana probably the last thirty or forty years it's been research to a great extent\nAnd so you know you have to you have to look at the facts about some subject like this and not just like general statements you know a lot of people just like a general statement and they don't know the specifics of what it actually does to the brain in a\nA you know most people that are going to smoke it they're not going to you know they go to the library and look up a lot of\nResearch articles I did what he really\nDoes to you and the people that promote it ain't going to minimize or you know when they're advertising they're going to going to minimize the detrimental effects of it\nYeah and people like and I've seen even like a heart radio they've teamed up to do something with a dispensary and all these celebrities do and and and look ac first of all thanks so much for the call I think ... let me know about that brother but I just I I uh I talked to me it took six five one nine nine three three I just I don't know enough about it\nAnd I've never done it\nAnd it's a huge gray area and part of me wants to be like no and part of me wants to be like you know what I'm trying to find that\n... that this is the Ford faction live on a Wednesday I'm for brown\nAmerica where commonsense news not so common\nDo you want to melt fat get counted and had the body you've always wanted then you need to check out science and try fitness too high intensity interval training anti Christian education to try and help them trans fat and gain muscle\nW why Coleman WD you seem to me we're super six more no one will be willing to ...

bus and you're thinking\nLike I'm good you know what I mean like it's it's just a big old tank nothing's going to stop me were good to go right and then you start to think of a seatbelt or or even the or the twenty people that died in that limo last week\nOh that was terrible too oh okay so it just makes you think it just makes you think goodness gracious like what in the world is a is going on\nAnd I see this California bus crash took place in the four\nOh five in San Fernando valley or about one o'clock yesterday traveling north of change lanes and ended up in front of a a white tow

five who were in serious condition and the bus drivers the only one who remains hospitalized so\nI'm authorities have so far been unable to interview the driver because of her injuries the crash shut down the freeway south bound for several hours\nBut I mean this is just like a um it's just like a thing like getting these bus crashes and that limo crash that killed you know is killing ... people in a limo crash\nLike a gruesome that is like that as the bee or like the band kids earlier this year who are on I ten in Alabama they they had a bus crash when like a ... or something I'm it's just it's crazy to think about like the transportation we have in this country and like like a bus\nYou know that's going to be the thing that really messes you up you know not some you you going down the road and go on a hundred miles an hour and texting and driving you\nYeah um I actually went to the casino this weekend did you ... and it was so you know did you think about it\nYou know yeah um I actually went to the casino this weekend did you ... ... and it was so what can you know did you think about it um it was this sales their star and um Philadelphia, Mississippi\nAre you kidding me and you wrote a bus from here to there are ... you would have us from Birmingham to Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, Mississippi that's awesome it's like ... yeah yeah me and my mom's cells of long haired yes it was fine\nCasinos are area we're you know I was in a casino two weeks ago in Dover Dover, Delaware\nYeah I play twenty dollars and then I ... and I didn't play [laughter]\nDoes that a good day what's everybody else was there money yes\nA lot of drinks yeah I uh drinks and grill a lot of um a lot of times I go to like a casino or an area like that I haven't been a lot of casinos but I'll just I don't I don't play I just like to watch other people play and like they always really hey man player get lost and I'm like I guess I'll just get off\nI guess I just go like I Am okay\nUm but just you know watching it absolutely just a just horrific news oh goodness in the video of it\nIs a is even crazier big David you're listening in the back I Need you to come up here for just one second because I feel like you're probably the only guy who's going to get to know about this guy John Mellencamp former a keyboard is\n\nYears all of the Ford faction you live in ... there were Wednesday that is where it was a couple of\nLittle ... you know like that I go to Bob Marley smuggler Bob what kind of music do you listen to Britain\nI listen to me I'll sell what does that ... that people like that Jill Scott you never\nKnow who am I the can you compare him to maybe somebody on ... look I'm not the biggest music kinda so we're like of all time but you know I I like my\nMusic what about air combat Erica by do no\nNo no no should I don't like it\nI should know who that is however I Do not though I liked it wasn't a lot of countries like a little country what country rock I'm us with that I Want that to\nTo you you're kind of like a an an all music kind of ... yes I Love all ... all kinds\nOf my favorite is an ESL neo soul yeah yeah check it out in your car All right I'll check it out on my on my way to the airport yeah\nI've been trying to bring a flight doesn't ours are drawn to it it's not really working there are not working as well as it should be\nUh let's see what else are we have in the news here I did have a story about how dogs understand humans and it got so scientific so quick and I thought it was gonna be like a funny like light hearted like fun story\nAnd it got it got just so real so fast that I was like yeah you know what I'm good I I I didn't want to go down that rabbit hole for you guys\nI'm ... and and so but I thought it was going to be really funny and it just it turned out to be a just just kind of a little bit disappointing but\nYou know we started off the show we started off talking about Canada legalizing marijuana and I'm Still trying to get to a point where in our number eight six six five five one nine nine thirty three like I'm Still trying to get to a point where either see it you know\nI Need to be on one side of the other like I hate to be in like down the middle about stuff like I hate to be on the fence about stuff\nYou know what I mean but like I I don't like to be like a dog like my job or not like my job [laughter] I like I Do I Want a walled or not want a wall or like do I want to buy a house or not want to have like I don't like to be on the fence about stuff yeah but no matter what it is and like I think one of the things where you can uh\nYou can really get that out of your system is when you are it is when you say\nYou know I don't want to be a I don't want to be on the fence I don't want to do this I don't want to do that I'm going to make you know tough hard decisions I'm going to believe what I Want to believe and so morally we're all line up I think to myself I don't like things that are that\nYou know impede your trend is All right and so that's probably gonna be a no or marijuana from that I Do like it though whenever I see\nI'm like a video of like hey I saw this video is probably six months ago I Can't remember what what's the diseases like Parkinson's you know where you shake a lot yeah and I saw like a video of a grandpa who smoked weed and everybody smoked sweetie he's totally normal like he didn't shake with Parkinson's\nSince you know where you say go on the air and I saw a video of a grandpa who smoked weed and everybody smoked weed he's totally normal like he doesn't shape of bargains and\nAnd I thought to myself okay is that true like is that real you know because you don't know what's real and what's fake on the Internet and like\nWe talk about all these studies in like a C brought up some great points where like you know I actually knew about the the ... field or the pot form that they had to Mississippi and its state funded because it's on the campus somewhere but like\nI don't I don't necessarily know where I should lined up on it\nAnd I think at the end of the day I Would never do it and I know my family wouldn't and I know that it probably wouldn't really affect me that much but at the same time\nYou know we have so many people in prison over these you know whatever drug charge it may be and even if it's a small drug charge like you know you had marijuana paraphernalia or or whatever it may be or you know maybe you had a grammar or something like\nThat I just I don't know where I should be on this so eight six six five five one nine nine thirty three I Know we only have a couple of minutes left but I uh I listen to some good points that I listen to some good kind of a kind of sided arguments and I'm thinking to myself well as you\nKnow is is that what\nI Need to be on is that what I Need to be doing or or I just I don't know you know what I mean for it\nI just like if it can be good and we can make money off of it and it doesn't become a thing where I see in a dispensary on every corner and then maybe but if it's a thing where marijuana is\nEasily accessible and you're buying it from a certain place and you do marijuana and the next thing you you find yourself doing marijuana laced with stuff or you're doing like purple ocean meets\nUm acid face marijuana you know what I'm saying like you do stuff for like there are certain ... these different these weird name stuff like that I just I don't know I don't know where I'm at on this and so I go to the phone lines eight six six five five one nine nine three three where you add on it James how're you doing brother welcome it\nHey um I I heard I said is a arguments and and he's a very intelligent guy but I I I Do disagree with him on this and I think that uh if you really look at it that you know when\nYou're a strict people's access to a product a plant and you make it illegal it only the incentive for them then to use that product are going to be enhanced\nAnd I you know this from personal experience you know I\nI went to college I was from a ... more poor family I couldn't really pay my way and my second year my buddy it's like look I Know you're going to drop out you can't fail a why don't you just show east and I had never smoked weed\nBut uh you know he had ... she made a show like quarter pound and pay for my tuition ...\nOh my gosh [laughter] and ah they started so huge load thing\nThat I didn't like it at that point in time but uh several years later after being around it for a while I I really changed a lot about it and if you're not going to keep it out of the high schools that illegal\n... you know veers legally you don't say kids walking around the house or six packs that you do hear about the children they find drugs on campus all the time\nAnd that you want to keep it away from the kids the way to do I just put it in a controlled\nYou do hear about the children lifetime drugs on campus all the time and that you want to keep it away from the kids the way to do I just put it in a controlled environment\nThe adults can have access to it and lemonade stuff financial incentives for kids to be messing around I Would never tried it and it had not been able to make money off of it [noise]\nAnd if you if you look at this government studies that show the harmful effects of marijuana as much much less dangerous than alcohol much less dangerous than most of the other drugs that are out there\nNow I Will I Will give you that it is much less dangerous than our like alcohol I Can't believe alcohol is legal like the fact that you can drink alcohol and you can literally like like die from it you can get in a car and I really ... you can it really messes up your decision making the alcohol is incredible I mean that's what they be allowed to\nCall in and it was when you said you're you know battling the ethics of it and and the ethics come down to this is like we all our money to go to drug dealers in foreign countries or didn't want to keep it at home\nAnd you know you you really have to look at it that way every action has a reaction and the actions of making it illegal have driven up the potency of it cost us a lot of revenue costs us access to medicines that are effective\nI Will say this I Will say this to if you watch the show um Ozark if you ever watch the show Ozark on Netflix it'll mayor you it'll make you realize how much money\nDoes go to the foreign like drug dealers or whatever and maybe\nYou will say that and if it if you've ever seen the underground business how it works really all the money goes the topics like any anything else\nAnd um it's just you know piles of cash or going out of the country every day for a plant that we could grow without any harm in our backyard and it wouldn't call any issues\nPeople wouldn't really even know that others are using it\nAnd she's and so I think for the call but when we get one more call real quick All right great\nEight six six one nine nine three to it's going to Michael Michael how are you doing welcome in\nI'm as it gets really bad and then you know real real right\nYeah ... they say it is for you or you could sell alcohol drugs\nIn college and make sure you got it like she got just try and work if you're trying to work it violate your conscience to still approve of that\nYeah you're right you're one might\nSay that they like\nTo go to Mike one more call micro got thirty seconds how you doing buddy\n[noise] doing while doing well just a quick comment the gentleman that you had on earlier that you talk to in depth on this yeah he was talking about that or\nThe government held a patent on it and that they're looking desensitized to it [noise] the reason they're not pulling the dials out of the cannabis it's because it's a natural product and it cannot be pat did that's why they're trying to synthesize that they could use it directly out of the cannabis now\nUm you know I was I had just turned Twenty one uh and I think it was\nI when I was the ... the um I was the ... the one I'm a junior\nRanks of the marine corps and I was the new guy in the unit um there was a few of under new guys but\n[noise] I mean I think it it helped me grow up a lot or you use to also kind of got the\nI mean really I you know and I traveled around kind of the southern part of the United states growing up but I I'd never I'd only left\nThe country once and that was to go to to Mexico and ... my uh senior trip after I graduated\nHigh school [noise] so I think it was kind of a an eye opening experience to go and you see different people\nAnd how they live um you see the ways that they are different but you also see the way that that they're settler so I I think it was a very eye opening experience and I grew up a lot I Know it tough Anthony up along\nOur Justin warrior Wednesday his cruise parks Chris you've come back so what year did you graduated Auburn University\nAh December of two thousand and six months after I graduated from school I went to a officer candidate school and want to show 'em that ten weeks up there [noise] got our commission and um\nThen we then I went to was\nUm did ten weeks up there [noise] God I commission and um\nThen we then I went to what's called the basic school it's a a six month course every newly a commission to were appointed\nOfficer in the marine corps has to go through the basic school [noise] so it was a six month course you you you learn to become a a permit provisional rock rifle ... it's really a a leadership academy really stressing um ethics leadership by example\nYou know kind of I mean it's truly just a ... I think it's the leadership academy if he wanted to to break it down and make and simplify it but [noise] graduated from ah the basic school and then I went to infantry\nOfficer of course I'm just I was selected to uh once you are leaving\nAt the end of the basic school you get your ah your MOS which are going to go do a for you're following school and I was I was selected to go be a an infantry officer so mainly falling TBS uh went to a tree authors course Iowa see\nAnd then I once I graduated from a tree officers course\nAnd December of ... seven I ah I moved out to Southern California\nA lovely twenty nine palms\nThat the middle of the Mojave Desert and I'm became a rifle platoon commander in in January of two thousand a\nWhat was that like that was my goal all along um\nYou know as a junior isn't junior marine you you really I mean you see your company commander and you'll see your battalion commander um they you know like the the first officer your chain of command which is a platoon commander so that the guy that you see\nWhen I was in Iraq or junior rain I had a great point saying commander um\n[noise] you know he he really kind of taught or the the way he lived his life or the way he carried himself I mean he's he's a guy that you would want to emulate whether you're a\nMarine Corps officer um or a man or a husband or a father is he's just a a great all around person so he um\nYou know that that was kind of the whole goal is to be able to enter matter like him so I'm\nOne side once I got to the\nUm the the ... marine force\nOr out and went on palm oil tanker matter I mean that was\nThat's what are those are the some of the the best days of your life as a Marine Corps officer is being able to into manner you're you're in with the brains all the time it's kind of scary 'cause you're learning\nUm and and all of a sudden you graduate and he's gone from only kind of having to be responsible for yourself to now you're responsible responsible for forty plus I'm rains so it was a you know that was some of the best times I've had in the marine corps has been wrestled\nSix men who say that you take you on that responsibility one is that responsibility like when\nYou're in it it's like anything when you're in it it just feels like um\nYou're you're just you're trying to do your best you're trying to not let your guys down um\nBut there's there's very few other jobs where uh you know a twenty three twenty four year old college graduates kind of all of a sudden be put in charge of forty people um and expected to perform\nA responsible for their training and their their welfare so I mean\nHum and expected to perform\nAnd responsible for their training and their their welfare so I mean looking back\nIt was it was a it was a great as Larson level responsibility but\nIt's also a really big honor there you're you're given that level of trust\nAnd that's it's it's it meant a lot I had great guys I had a ... a really good marine I'm not really get called in sergeant crate squad leaders down in\nA vigil a rifleman so I was I was very blessed to have the the guy that I had ... and they they look out for me in a lot of ways uh you know\nYour ear
