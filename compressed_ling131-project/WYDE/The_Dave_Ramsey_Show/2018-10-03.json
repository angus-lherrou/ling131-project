I have like the iPhone is it the eight the iPhone\nEight and and I don't yeah whatever they had the big going on the really big well I don't love it either but\nEverybody else in my family does and we all do the group chat thing but it's the it's the big iPhone like the newest one that came out that's not the eggs and it's like two hundred and fifty six get you literally could put a movie like you could shoot a movie on this thing you know what I mean yeah I mean it's pretty it's fairly new\nUm but I just it didn't go off and I mean I always had my phone on silent when I'm On the air so\nThey said I'm not sure about the urgency alert but I Believe that those would override in my right to file but still you know life life long way from my work phone\nWas hitting on the council and it went off and uh you know that if you're allergic to eggs are like\nReally [noise] well thanks for the car I I uh I don't know I guess I'll take my phone back to a to an unknown retail dealer or here in the army him\nI just had someone call and say that they're off the grid\nA to an unknown retail dealer or here in the army and I just had someone called and said that they're off the grid phone did not go off but they did hear it over the radio that's incredible that's first of All right thanks for the call by the way I Love that off ... the\nThe ... I Know that we talked about a big ... uh Megan just reading in a phone didn't go off but I can hear going off on everyone else's so maybe they were just a couple of bugs in the system like I Hope that if has anybody been watching American horror story [noise]\nThis is the test of the emergency broadcast system I'm you've resident Donald J Trump\nThe forty fifth but the first grade as president you've ever had [noise]\nThis is only a test of greatness\nI Love the American people like that's what I thought it was going to be like you know I didn't I didn't know it was going to a beach I like I didn't know is going to be like just some random\nGuy talking over the back or whatever\nI you know what was just him ... minutes or was that thirty minutes and we just you know if that was it entertaining reading I'm Sorry I Will make this next thirty minutes entertaining right I'm Sorry about that\nComing out of it coming out of Charlotte 'cause I deliver to Charlotte quite a bit of Charlotte the war says so last exit in South Carolina I'm there is a nice pilot their brand spanking New Haven it's got some phenomenal showers and\nA clean pose a heck of a job keeping it a\nHeck yeah I don't know how we got on this but every time I go to Charlotte ...\nYou know what Talladega they always have when you're coming down main the main drag yeah brought their own little live before you get to the track they have these Eighteen wheeler trailers that have showers in them that ain't by ... been\nThere and all those truck stops that they're having to\nI Love ... I Love an outdoor shower any kind of shower is like even like the football locker room shower back in the day I loved it because it made me want to shower faster because I wasn't in a home shower I wasn't in a way showers I got in there got my job and get out\n[laughter] I enjoyed it ... I Will say oh well see flip flops truck stop shower oh I Love law that's anywhere but my own show no yeah it's good point I'm just trying to make sure you understand that\nThe the foot fungus in there I'm sure is just the I'm a I'm sure it's tough what I'm Johnny welcome in\nNow and the only one that does the impression was really hoping it was President Trump going to talk to your life and as a mass all message and lives we're gonna have to sit there and listen to the\n... that was literally what I was thinking that's why I did that in my cousin of trial so bad\nBecause that's what I thought I thought it was going to ring and like everybody would hear a message from the president and and that's what I truly thought was going to happen and now I just I I'm going to be honest I don't I'm a little disappointed in the emergency I armed system\nI Am I'm a little let down a figure for the money it costs which at least got the president talking and selling us something about our great things are and are talking about his trade or something I mean we could have got some positive out of that\nI just at that American horror story so like the first episode of the season that they had a better emergency alert system then that was like like the guy who fell asleep on the button like the Hawaii incoming missile report he he did a better job of learning me\nOkay you know this this is getting a little too much a friend of mine took a picture of his presidential alert thing and if you look underneath it below while he was looking at Stormy Daniels assortment of most [laughter]\nIncredibly well Jonathan I was in the same boat as your body I I wanted that too\nBut we didn't get it it's a shame yeah well I should have done a ... I Know I should have done a mock up one I should have been more and like I said that was the most unprepared I've ever been for an alert or or anything and radio ever I\n... I mean it's not like they talk about all more\nBut yeah I Know right if I ask [laughter] yeah I yeah I've been a ...\nA guy named Greg from a certain show or a ... I Believe it was Greg was talking about this morning real orderly and uh that's why that's out\nNow [laughter] I completely understand go catch some of these ... without using\nIt so I Would go\nLet's go to Robert next Robert what's up buddy walkman\nSo whether or\nNot on Robert de ... did you get the alert Robert I sure did\nUh you know a President Trump is setting a nation that [noise] to stay and his uh the way he\nAnd uh you know a President Trump is just setting a nation that to stand his uh the way he communicates with us and with this entire system has always been in place\nIn one form or another ... doing the Eisenhower days they would interrupt the radio broadcast and then as we more television things like that\nThey would test the system on TV and then I sell you cellular service\nCame on board I remember when I was in the military they what they were tested as well but for this test that we had a day and he tags that\nPresidential something on the other is\nPresidential alert this is the test of the national wireless emergency though\nWhat what does that entail I have ever he's the size of the nation should be alerted on ah some parents deal that he says is going to Iraq\nWhen it's not some deal about pulling like he thought he had pulled out a out of Iran and now we hear from ambassador both knew that that is still in the works in the press briefing today or is he going to tell us that this\nOr that the new name for NAFTA us and see that that that Canada\nHas finally got on board and let me find out that the trade deal is just a portion of the team the team that he's declined see\nNo fooling around with no\nNo I'm looking at two hundred right now trying to figure out what the alert system like like what the president to alert system try mean\nTrump is setting up the nation to have this format that when he when we see this we've stopped what we do and we listen to this guy and he's not going to be truthful with\nI just I don't think like an actual like alert alert would be like that like I don't think like in like the same as an Amber Alert would be the same as like a presidential alert that talks about what color socks President Trump's going to be wearing or what deal\nHe messed up or what he tweeted about you know what I mean like if it was actually going to be like a presidential alert it would be like a presidential alert\nThere are some there is a serious threat to national security or maybe just in our area like there was a presidential alert that there was a there was a um an attack on an Alabama airport or something like\nIt was to make sure that the systems would not be overloaded by the message going out to every cell phone television and radio and it was a success\nWe know what the system has about day but I'm saying is now that the system has been put in place what messages what messages where he put on this system from the White House to try to a man and his lesson\nRobert what if it was like the way it's not too ... ... what if it was like this question\nWhat if what if that turned into Trump's Twitter and every five minutes Robert we got an emergency alert system of what Trump was tweeting out\nI'll have what is going to be what it's going to be that would be insane you want to you know what it's going to be every time you turn around yes\nWow winning\nRight and that's what we're going and that's exactly right you like the Sunday\nAs humor and that's fine that's exactly what I'm concerned\nAbout ... what else are now he had a hope it's not that it was well we'll see yeah\nThat's just one point after the killing of your show you were saying something about toys\nI mean that was well we'll see yeah that's just one point after the killing of your show you were saying something about toys and yes I\nAs I was you know getting on with my day I I don't hope it was some disparaging comments he was saying about the young lady what were you were you when you eat for when you when you being\nA positive or negative because from from my perspective when when I Would listen to her that what you would have to say you know\nIt it was it was great to hear from them like he has some good things to comment on some of the times uh she was that if your show and she gave you the respect of your comment when you when you asked her opinion\nHeck yeah that's what toil always got to talk on the show rubber all the time I was telling the gave him very thankful for him because toy I had to go\nUm started her maternity leave and I was thinking that they have got to fill in because it gives me somebody I can\nI can talk to like I used to talk to Tom Sawyer and toy with broken up subject matters that would make me think outside of the a conservative box that sometimes the studio can be and so I I don't carry much so appreciated to where I texted toy last night I called her two nights ago and it takes her last night and uh I misunderstood\nYou so I'm On now I've been corrected and that can be corrected a million times a day at night and then number two I don't know the number three I don't understand why why you decided to ah\nTalk a little fun at a

like my eyes are too close together or not I mean I'm a I'm a young guy with a Baltimore like it's just the fact\nAli Ali with us either but it seems like you know from that from the radio station or a ... another how does that quite a bit\nAnd he says that he's being snarky or he's being funny but when he doesn't have anything to posit positive to say about\nYou know a Democrat progressive liberal but everyone who called and he always a resort to talking about their physical appearance\nBut hey let me more than enough time I think we want to hear that for sure I'm a man that Robert

I'm so glad\nYou're saved big Dave uh brother I'm so I'm so glad I I I have post saved big Dave\nJust breathing big day would would be very tough for me to uh to hang out\nWith oh either don't cost you out three or four times oh for sure no when you I mean but\nYou know what it is I think\nIt is I have the good or the good big Dave I didn't want to talk about this because I I think it's very interesting\nWe see so many stories about needles like so many stories about drugs so many stories about homelessness so many stories that come out of the west that\nOr make your skin crawl Mickey Mickey does make you think ... and they're worried about straw right well that's all we care about straw right well there's another like fairly pointy long objects strolls right that maybe they need to worry about the here's appointee long object that they really need to worry about and that's needles\nSo the Seattle Starbucks barista um every morning she wrote a report and said every day she came in\nNearly every day drug users a would be outside and she would have to clean up hyper German make a hybrid army needles that were left a by\nDrug users nearly every day so three employees from the north Seattle area Starbucks\nReveal to K. I. R. O. that they had been forced to take antiviral medications after being poked by the needles while they were\nK. I. R. O. that they had been forced to take antiviral medications after being poked by the needles while they were working a\nNeedle users put them in at the tampon disposal boxes in the bathrooms outside and sometimes when they put them in those boxes we'd have to dig 'em out we'd have to pick them up from the outside the baristas\nWho are not named said that they want the coffee chain to install locked needle disposal boxes in the restrooms\nAfter after all this to avoid being jammed\nDo I don't need to explain that story one more time for everybody who maybe didn't catch up when I was talking about\nThere are there is a Starbucks in Seattle north Seattle area that has\nTo sometimes clean out needles from the used tampon box in the bathroom\nAnd it ... sometimes the needles we'll poke the employees cleaning it out so instead of the employees saying hey can we can we try to do something about this drug epidemic of this needle epidemic that we always have to clean up are all these drug maybe try to get away from no we need a needle box in the bathroom and people can properly disposed of their needles\nThe kind of like at the hospital yes me does like to wear\nEither like you're doing your own testosterone shots or or maybe your own insulin or something like that but instead you're you know you're you're shooting up drugs and you can't really know what's going on why do you need a needle boxing the better they won't use\nIncredible big day what about the needles on the outside are they going to put a disposable needle box out there to know I mean I Can't believe they got stuck by the ones outside 'cause I could have swept them up but still\nThat's just well I think they only got stuck from the needles that were in the tampon box right but and the fact that I even have to say that word over the radio or irks me I'd so much rather say like\nYou're able to look at them and then ... yet feminine hygiene box but the ones outside they're just talking about we have to clean those up every day to\nInsolvency they can take a little more precautionary stuff to not out I keep playing with my fingers because I feel like\nJust like being around needles just makes me like think about a fingerprint\n... that is disgusting so Starbucks spokesman er told Fox News the drug crisis the drug abuse crisis in Seattle impacts every company and we urge city officials to work with employers to make sure our public places are safer everybody the social\nIssues that affect us um and that affect all of us can sometimes plays our partners our employees and scary situations which is why we have protocols and resources in place to ensure our partners are out of harm's way\nOkay now again this is from a Seattle Starbucks if I'm unemployed like if I come into Crawford Broadcasting every day\nAnd like somehow I have to clean up the bathroom before I go home like that's my job title like somehow I I get that job title right and a ... and I get poked by needle we have a major problem\nLike no matter where I'm at no matter what job I'm In I got hooked by needle there is a huge problem that that that is something to deal with ... that is a massive issue right\nThis is disgusting and this just adds on like like the story we talked about a month ago when toy was here we talked about the uh the free use clinic where they give you free needles and clean needles and basically like a a cool down room after you do your drugs\nAre cool down really well they gave you a room where you can hang out with other users and you can come off your high in that room\nAnd this was in San Francisco well there you go\nWell they gave you a room where you can hang out with other users and you can come off your high in\nThat room and this was in San Francisco\nWell there you go is the west coast so far gone like is there any kind of hope for it because I see stories like this and I it it makes me hurt just reading that like it makes me uncomfortable just reading that oh\nAnother restaurant story Alabama made the headlines but have you seen this one no Alabama made the headlines a woman claims at a restaurant called her a crazy B word on the receipt after ordering a burger\nWith allergies oh did she know the guy from the other night when I was at a\nMaybe so maybe it was the same crazy be right that is hilarious no cheese on this a dang burger what a crazy be ordered it and it says so\nRight on the receipt and she took a picture of it and this was a a a by Jess where was this just a regular at Henry's burgers and cream in brook would stop by the local spot to pick a blunt for co workers on Tuesday I'm\nOne of the co workers who has a lactose intolerance obviously ... cheese\nAnd so I'm ...\nAnd they were crazy B word on there so there'll be getting a lot of free burgers no kidding good night to the store came at ABC thirty three forty in a hit national news I Love it hilarious because it's been a good show today thank you so much for joining me\nI uh I had a couple more stories to get through but you know we talk so much Kavanaugh and we talked so much um about what Trump said and played a little bit of audio and I I just want to make sure everybody is super super appreciative\nOf ah of letting me be here letting me do my thing okay 'cause you don't know what can happen tomorrow right like as I can be gone tomorrow like I Can't tell you a series that is like I can be gone the next week or the next week or I could be gone November fifth rock October thirty for like I could be gone on Halloween\nGuys keep up with me follow me I Want to know what you're doing and I would like to think you're going to know what I'm doing let's keep up with each other I asked the Ford brand if you are here tomorrow maybe we can give some Halloween tips I'd like to have big Dave that sounds like a fun idea\n... I got a second route I got a I got a grandson\nNow do you all take him somewhere just walk around the neighborhood like yellow too is I live in these apartments right behind the call Rob behind the station\nOh wow so we'll go we'll refer to oh that's easy and then of course we'll have to take him to my mother in law's house in the fall of ... because he'll be dressed up\nCute [laughter] everybody needs a picture oh yeah you know how to take him so he can bring the door and go to go there they don't understand it yeah yeah he didn't he didn't he understands candy I bet ... understand\nWell what I give him because he's offspring of you I I I assume no I'm Talking about a full year the candy ... years how much of his candy do you read\nThe criticality of aviation especially helicopter operations is\nIt's it's vertical list uh so if you think of our special operations warriors ... they will go from point a wherever that may be it may be in a different country but they'll go from point a they'll fly to point B\nThey'll have to do that mostly on the cover of darkness using army helicopters\nAnd then they will either hover or land in a given location\nSometimes within just a hundred feet or a few feet of obstacles to your left and right for an apt but they'll land those aircraft and then our soldiers and I will exit from the ... or ... what we would call fast rope out of this helicopter's onto the ground [noise] go and execute the mission\nAnd then they'll get whatever they the execute the mission whatever that might be it might be personnel a garnering equipment material whatever it might be and then they'll go back to the helicopter and ex filled trade out\nOr in the in the same manner that they came likely to using different routes but you see that on the news every now and then when you talk about the news will talk about\nToday our special operations forces executed in the mission might be Yemen might be Afghanistan could be other places but they've executed emission they've done it affect the effectively safely and they've returned home you hear about that a lot after the fact\nAnd the other things that I have to emphasize is the most important for army aviation is to support our soul\nThat a lot after the fact and the other things that I have to emphasize is uh what's most important for army aviation is to support our soldiers in our commanders that are executing the mission get them to where they need to be or support them while they're there with Apache helicopters affect our coffers whatever it might be\nSo that they can come home safely to their families and their friends and when I think about army aviation that's what we do support our war fighters make sure they can they can do the mission and then come home safely to their families and their friends\nPilots in aviators they do that with surgical precision sometimes under weapons fire artillery fire it's it's really it's it's amazing that they're able to accomplish such a great task every day\nIt is really amazing and the training I think America would be proud if they could see it just realize the amount of training that goes into\nA pilot especially one that's going to take on a roll with the special operations unit are to fly or some of our aircraft that are involved with special operations they go through a rigorous training to be able to make sure that they can actually\nWith a with precision execute the mission and get it done quickly and safely and bring our warriors home and that's a again what I Am so proud about army aviation and what we do is support for the war fighter doing it in a precision precise kind of way and then come home safely\nLet's talk about maybe a mission that sticks out in your mind over your many years of military service\nThere's there's so many that uh gosh I could I could fall back on probably support for the efforts that I that we did overseas I served in Korea and second effort division\nOr during a period of time we're not much different than where we are today with North Korea but the threat was real\nAnd our our mission within the aviation ... with second id was to support our brigade combat teams and our commanders and getting them from point a to point B and there were many times when we would have alerts\nAnd our aircraft will go on alert we would pick up soldiers and we would point them to\nA specific locations to get them ready to fight if necessary and all of thank God all my time in doing that they were simply exercises\nBut you never know when a exercise is really not an exercise it's real so you have to be ready at a moment's notice and that's what our armed forces to us and it's not just army aviation its its are infantry armor\nArtillery aviation and then I Would add to the other services as well because today into in today's fight you don't fight as as an army or navy or an Airforce Marines you fight joint\nAnd so joint integration to make sure we can bring the right kind of power to bear to execute the mission quickly efficiently and then everyone get home safely is job one and we do it together as a team\nAnd I would imagine that that's changed somewhat since you win in the military you went to a flight school you said in Nineteen Seventy eight let's talk about some of that change how has the gear changed over the years as far as ... goes I Believe those cockpits have come along the way\nThe when I started there was a really an analog cockpit Scott that's a great question but an analog cockpit a and the Nineteen Ninety Seventy eight when I actually started flying helicopters but today is not your grandfather's Chinook Apache Black Hawk or other systems\nWhat army aviation has done that has been so powerful and I've worked the acquisition side of this\nAh both here at red stone arsenal where I Am now a but later\nAwful and I've worked the acquisition side of this ah both here at redstone arsenal where I Am now a but later on in the Pentagon we have upgraded those systems or to make their digital cockpits\nAre so a young person coming into aviation today that has grown up with with TV thing game board saying gaming a solution is on board there apple iPhones et cetera Android devices they fall into a cockpit\nAnd they're in almost their natural environment because those cockpits are built today to accommodate\nA the the young person that's coming out of our colleges universities high schools that's going to join the army potentially fly either as a pilot or crutches and so they're very modern the very safe have a tremendous safe safety record\nAnd the protection systems that we have on board those aircraft are so much different\nUh 'cause when I started we had threats from or what we would call man pads are are ground to air\nOr some hand held missiles that could shooter helicopter down that happen a lot in Vietnam you probably see on the History Channel and others where they they show videos of helicopters and airplanes being shot down by these missiles today we have systems on board those aircraft that protect them\nOr that if they are fired upon we asked ways to go after and defeat the threat to\nStay tuned to the warrior Wednesday bungee asked more of our conversation with retired Lieutenant General bill Philips coming up next on the warrior Wednesday podcast brought to
