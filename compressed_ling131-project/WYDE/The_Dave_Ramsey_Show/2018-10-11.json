F. I. I mean ... come like I Know you're from what they did he might as well I mean yeah yeah well I\nMean have you heard a song you're you're such a blinking blank it's like who\nWho like ... ... who would play that and listen to that like with their parents or their girlfriend or I got to tell you I wouldn't know Kanye West tripped over him in the pocket [noise] I wouldn't even know what he looked like I don't know one song he sings a he has one good song it's called it's called um\nHeartbreak her or something like that what is it has so mad he does have one gets\nOn ... and I know what I was kind so they have [laughter] we have quite the ring\nWhy do you have different artist in Australia ... music are like oh you're American\nMusic but we have a strong an artist and a lot of British music as well really ... like ...

have sports to go through that he does like I I Can't get past like light spiced meals when I was sort of [laughter] yeah yeah I think fringe by you know yeah I just it's I see this though and and I see so much criticism rather see so much criticism about Kanye West about him go into the oval office\nAnd I think there was a wire you criticizing a guy\nWho wants to go meet with the leader of the free world and talk about serious\nProblems in his home town this is a guy who got out of those problems in Chicago and he wants to confront them and he wants to talk to somebody that could actually maybe make a change\nWas problems ... you know the crazy thing is you know Obama had a procession of artists and Hollywood types through the oval office but I you know I haven't heard anyone go what what I did it was like oh I guess what\nMillennials Trump or her trip over to Africa I I've been involved in that or not costly but uh but yeah it was she finally she speaks\nUp today and she says um she's one of the most bully people in the world and doesn't trust some of the White House staffers and so you have a lot of ties into administration you're a lot of ties into what actually goes on in D.C and\nYou know for for one of these statements the most bullied person in the world um she doesn't trust the White House staffers and I I got a special guest calling in so we may have to hold your door either but I just\nI I think to myself you know she is and I can't believe she would come out and talk about this while she's on her trip in Africa doesn't doesn't it seem kind of wild\nMaybe she's a letter to bed when she's here that the White House stop she doesn't like\nVery much might be might be going over and over her hovering that's what it is wherever it is she's just on the back of an elephant and she can so that was yeah she's yelling in our era inner colonial style outfit member she looks she looks bright yeah yeah she does fantastic yeah you don't want to talk about the

doing all that nonsense yeah\nKeeps you busy does at least a hundred degrees yeah tell me to see a trend concepts that land an extra yeah yeah I met land in D.C a few times I haven't seen him for a\nWhile but uh yeah I knew I knew what we call him the men and black on the show the men in black men and black because he he never really wants to talk when he comes in here right he'll send somebody like ... and Jeffrey Rosen\nA when Joel and here to tell him don't here earlier this week but you gotta know some guy I'll have to look him up again and now that I'm In this neck of the woods I'm at work right up in his office\nOh really I go there and hang out with this come over and just hanging out yeah man how it is yeah we're all friends or I'll bring the dog to\nA yeah that's right wing Betsy Ross his uh his dog or the Belgian mountain was oh yeah ... yeah it kind of intense kind of scary for ... we work with him and Afghanistan all up the road ... yeah the polls had him and a whole bunch of them\n... yeah it kind of intense kind of scary the freedoms we work with him and Afghanistan all up to ... yeah the polls had him and a whole bunch of the NATO forces so what did you do in 'cause I feel like I'm about to go down a rabbit all yet we don't want to get we don't we don't want to ... maybe one day\nMaybe ... maybe ... a a soda water over some more a liquid veggie my and I go to a a bloody Mary we'd uh that you might\nYou know I mean it's not it's not horrible but it's definitely something you would have to eat it like a bar and grill at one am I just you got to be bought up with it there's\nA reason it's not in every supermarket in America you know I used to think that tele was really bad but now I I Would rather bay the new tell it before I took another ... oh we're gonna make you take another motivation I I I'll take one more\nBut like I just I see stuff like that and like did you ever have peanut butter or peanut butters delicious ending in on\nLike that but but it's not ... who ... who made veggie mine was like this is our this is our\nSauce or delicate food of choice some like insightful genius with a funny accent\nUh and I think that's the only Republican candidates sign on my street and it's a really really long for it [laughter] so I really want to get a governor ... and ... at least represented a on a a an avid dialing first ... well it's funny you\nMention that because I was driving through mountain Burke the other day ... you know it you know like English village yeah and if you're not from around Birmingham obviously were Birmingham guys that you're not from around Birmingham you're from Huntsville or something like that\nMountain Brooke is is a pretty it's a pretty area oh yeah you know you can put my house in most of the housing men broke yeah I think you could probably fit my entire apartment complex and allowed it out and yeah right right and um\nAnyways I'm driving through mountain broke two three days ago and I I don't see a cab is I don't see how well they are as I see ... everywhere and I'm I'm thinking to myself like our we've that secure in who we think we have you know what I mean we we don't need to get complacent\nBecause when you get some I think we are complacent you get you kicked in the growing ... what happens when you get complacent I I work for a politician in Australia who was the president of the Senate eccentric victory was very accomplished politician\nHe would always win his Senate seat by long long margin but he would fight every single rice as we was bought points behind really he would go after everything he would do everything we had a fence and ... ... and he would never lose like he could have as Donald Trump said she'll someone on Fifth Avenue and he wouldn't have laws\nBut he's still every single time people love that though of course and that's what every politician should\nNow I Will give this ivy every time I watch the local news I see her on that you're right I I Will give that to her every time I watch the local news I see her she's at a speaking engagement she um she's that kind of like um\nI don't know I got a business announced he's hardworking yeah yeah so she's out there working I just I think when it comes to like name awareness throughout the state and I think we're a little complacent\nThat yeah I you know just because he's governor doesn't mean people ... yeah I'm In a yeah I I Would just like to see a little more if it on behalf of the campaign doing some things you know in areas where they don't think they're going to get any votes\nNow and saying all this I still think governor Kay Ivey will continue to be our governor I did oh I'm sure she will I just don't want us to get complacent to the fact where you know we continue to see while manic side that we continue to see what medics and the news and we think okay we've got a pretty good following but nothing against us and then all of a sudden\nThey come out in droves yeah and and ... ... is that it's not just governor on the on the top of the ticket if people don't go out to vote for governor Avi they also then don't work down the ticket and vote for\nYou know your local sheriff or your local Houseman Aynesworth hail rye so all of a sudden if there's a huge tune out for the a socialist man from Tuscaloosa in a dramatic a medic so I forgot his name from ... ah just bought us on the house next door or\nIf there's a huge turnout for a ... in a booming ham for instance in Jefferson County yeah\nThat's going to float down the ticket and affects sheriff Kyle yeah and if that a fixture of high all you get a clown car driving guy as the next sheriff of Jefferson County\nI don't think a lot of people understand how crucial like the leadership of the sheriff isn't a county oh no\nAs the next sheriff of Jefferson County I don't think a lot of people understand how crucial like the leadership of the sheriff isn't a county oh no question I think a lot of people just see the sheriff deputies driving around and saying oh we're safe for good you know that's just the big police officer over all of them they don't realize that as a\n... like a political leadership role that they have to make crucial tough decisions about your safety your children's safety the county safe when the ... with the sheriff in particular is that\nIf you get a new sheriff they're going to bring an you know they literally a new sheriff in town and they [laughter] I never played them in a sentence [noise] are they going to bring in all their own people into those jobs that make the decision in different one or two or three or four\nAnd I would have been very grave reservations about a sergeant pit by having the wherewithal to be able to do that and\nYou know this is a a a a a safety issue it's a crime and safety issue and if we don't you know if if you're a pile heaven forbid would it be beaten on November ... uh I think Jefferson County would be a much less safe place a you know a week or two later\nAnd I live in Jefferson County right but I live in Hoover so it's kind of we we don't get a lot of interaction with Jefferson County 'cause you're in a city and you are more so or Jefferson County in Birmingham half the yes obviously they have to have to lean on each other\nAnd so you sound a little more passionate about it where as I sound a little complacent about it and I'm the problem she doesn't like I'm the complete\nWe've been saying that for some time but the ah the you're the problem but um that was in a broader spectrum abroad her son's yeah whatever but the tour that you know if you look at say Hoover or one of the other a Kennedy Davia yeah yeah the\nJefferson County sheriff's office or you know is on the contract to police a lot of the out out of you know the counties outside of ... county\nSo it's it's just as important for folks that might not directly being Jefferson County who the sheriff is yeah and well like kind of influence with if then you know not in that county obviously but\nIt's an important it's a really important position he got some very very good people around him his track record is della you know the world's best practice in the in the share of world and the the major share of\nA school safety also might have got to stop and go safety officer in every school now has an cost any more money to manage to work it out you know the ... the crime the crime fighting center whenever I go down there were type\nBecause you know I feel like a ... ... that are in a ... you know I just I I look at that I think we have the biggest county in Alabama right and I'm using a Jefferson County seriously ... obviously Shelby County is the wealthiest if if I'm not mistaken I Would ... the ... when it comes to a median of income shall we can get what they are but\nYou've got Jefferson County which is when you talk about the kind of cities that it holds the kind of infrastructure of the kind of taxes that state pulled out of Jefferson County Hoover ... ah McAllen a Fulton Dale go right I mean look at look at these cities inside there you've got basically\nA this infrastructure of Jefferson County and I would I Would be safe to say that my cable is probably top ten most influential people in the state when it comes to getting stuff done and being leadership position you're\nTalking about like you got the mayor of Birmingham and then you've got Mike hail veteran who ... is he's used jurisdiction is the entire city of Birmingham\nHoover the stadium mountain brought home with all of the cities in that area like you I think is spot on the front and you know my dad was in ... and he's\nHome with all of the cities in that area are you I think is spot on the front and you know my dad was in ... and he's overturned on now but he's still in law enforcement and it's always one of those things where he got it gives me that insider look into how odd it how truly important\nOur um our our state like troopers R and then down or sheriff's deputies and then down our city cops and and things like that and obviously city cows might be a little more pamper you have to drive around this war stuff like and they get paid or more but\nWhen it comes to like sheriff's deputies and the amount of ground they have to go and it's the prisons\nAnd yes it's not yeah your your role leaves and everything yeah it's it's so much more than what you think of all\nDeputies pony every write me a ticket item\nYou know he's probably the painting on the list [laughter] I don't want to do I mean they're serving warrants on people that haven't paid child support one get out of their apartment they don't all of the jobs that nobody else wants to do a will do and if you don't have the right leadership\nThat's just going to go bowling upon yeah and and the money that's the big thing money too is if you don't have the right leadership to get things done that has to be done and money is not allocated in the right place and it starts falling apart the\nThe I always think about kind of like a a bird right and the better start coming off I don't know where this is going but I'd like to stay on the microbes that bird don't let the voters will [laughter]\nAnd like I was like a course is that what was I asked when I was when I was getting yeah we are ready to break the guys like me to override that Greg
