our day after day to say what's on our heart and what's on her mind and people for the most part\nAre happy to listen\nWhat's funny if you don't have a microphone in front of your face nobody wants to hear what you have to say\nMind and people for the most part are happy to listen but what's funny if you don't have a microphone in front of your face nobody wants to hear what you have to say\nIt

they pay a high price for journalism and and we should pay more attention to that and respect\nThat but they do they actually get their lives and seeking the truth and I think that's an important thing to distinguish against this man was a green card holders but he was trying to become an American\nCitizen he was going through the process of becoming American an American citizen and that is an important thing to distinguish as well and I think people need to get out\nThere and instead of listening to Trump instead of listening to to Fox News or CNN\nThey need to get out there ... and ...
