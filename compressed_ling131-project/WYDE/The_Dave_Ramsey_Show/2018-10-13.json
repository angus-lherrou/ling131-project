somebody come out and tell you that you needed to replace your furnace or air conditioning system\nI interviewed a guy one time who said that the company that he worked for required him to try to sell new heating and cooling equipment to customers whose heating and air conditioning systems where two and three and four years old\nOh look I don't care how in efficient they claim your heating and air conditioning system is if it's less than eight years old you shouldn't even be having the conversation\nHow about your energy bills do you have energy bills to just keep going up and up and up did you replace your air conditioning system maybe or your furnace and not see the energy savings that you were promised\nI Want to talk to those of you out there who have a furnace or air conditioner or he bumped that six or eight years old and you've been told to junk it in my lifetime I can count on one hand how many six year old systems that I've seen that needed to be replaced\nMost of the time they just needed a really good cleaning\nIt's going to take you years to get your money back out of a new air conditioning system do you have six or eight grand just lying around that you want to Chuck it your heating and cooling system\nOr would you rather than just a little bit of money getting it cleaned up operating more efficiently lower your energy bills your breakdowns and more money in your pocket\nNow we're gonna talk a little bit about what you should expect from the heating and air conditioning company that's coming out to maintain your system because I've got a feeling that a lot of you out there have been getting the drive by maintenance\nYou'll recognize it it's the one where they come out for twenty to forty five minutes ask you for fifty sixty Seventy bucks and then they're gone\nMaybe they hook up a set of refrigerant gauges maybe not if somebody's not spending at least Seventy five to Ninety minutes you need to get somebody else\nA freedom heating and cooling tune up

second chance I really do believe that if you made a mistake and you did time for it when you get out you should be able to get a job\nI just decided I wasn't going to put them in your home now fellas if your wife's going to be the one that's on with the heating and air conditioning guy comes by you\nIt wasn't going to put them in your home now fellas\nIf your wife's going to be the one that's home with the heating and air conditioning guy comes by do you want to take a chance that that person as someone who learned heating and cooling in the ...\nDo you have kids how 'bout them\nDid you know the fifty percent of the guys that I have interviewed can't pass in nationwide criminal background check\nFolks I went through over one hundred resumes in a period of three weeks and only hired one person freedom heating and cooling is very selective about who they put in your home\nI Want to talk\nAbout one of the gentlemen I interviewed and keep in mind when I Do an interview I asked them all kinds of questions about how they do the work I asked them how to test the capacitor how to clean a blower wheel and sure enough this guy was giving me pretty good explanations he missed one maybe two little steps\nBut nothing a little training couldn't fix right\nNow at some point in every interview I Try to compare our moral compasses so sometimes I gotta get a little sneaky\nOkay so here's the seventh question I asked him I lean in and I said how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need\nThis year that folks how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need now brace yourself folks because without hesitation he said I don't have a problem with it at all\nI don't have a problem with it at all and\nThe reality is that he had been around and worked for enough other air conditioning companies in the area that operated that way that he thought that that's what I wanted to hear\nI stood up from the table I shook his hand and I said these are the interviews over we won't be offering you a job but\nI think you for coming in\nThen I interview another guy same questions he's doing a pretty good job and when I lean in and ask him my little trick question\nHow do you feel about selling customers things they don't need this guy did hesitate to kind of dropped his head and then he looked back up and then he looked back down and then he said I can do it and if I'm being honest I have done it\nThe company that I worked for required that I bring back a certain dollar amount on every single call that I went on\nSometimes they didn't need anything but if I didn't sell them anything I was going to lose my job and man I got kids defeat\nBut then I got to thinking am I setting the right kind of example for my kids so I had to quit and now I'm unemployed and the market is flooded with heating and air conditioning technicians and it's been hard to get a job\nThat's an example of the type of competitors we have out there guys\nI told stories in interviews about heating and air conditioning companies training there technicians to jump wires on two thousand dollar compressors to sell new systems like crossing wires over to break them\nAnd there are hundreds of heating and air conditioning contractors in this area last time I checked and chances are pretty good that a technician like the one of the story\nIt's going to be coming to your home or your neighbor's home\nYou know you might look down the street today and see an air conditioning technician heating technician and it might be that guy\nYour neighbor's home\nYou know you might look down the street today and see an air conditioning technician a heating technician and it might be that\nGuy\nI'm certain that he didn't decide to quit the heating and air conditioning is this just because I wouldn't hire him and remember there's more\nGuys where that guy came from he got his training at one of those unprofessional heating and air conditioning companies\nNow listen we'd go out to customers houses all the time that have air conditioners with corroded coils or blowers that are all credit up and we have to help them out of that predicament I

okay that's clean my AC dot com All right let's talk about duct work OK duct work actually is kind of exciting when you get to learn about it\nHe did you know that the department of energy they've done studies that have concluded that the average duck system in a U.S household leaks twenty to twenty five percent of the ear that travels through it\nOkay so there's two different kinds of duck luggage first there's supply\nLeakage that's on the side of your furnace or air conditioner that blows the cold or warm air out\nAt ya so eight twenty to twenty five percent loss means that twenty to twenty five percent of the air that has created at your machine that's blowing toward your bedroom or your kitchen or your family room is lost on the way\nThat's like fives intends and twenties just

electricity in your house this is your home for tips in advice on how to keep your furnace an air conditioner or eat bump running like a top and the show was brought to you by freedom heating and cooling\n\nLet's talk about your indoor blower wheel the squirrels cage the hamster wheel the blower we'll whatever you want to call it that's the part that's responsible for pushing the warm or cold air out of the vents in your home\nNow all the year in your home from floor to ceiling from one into your house or the other it goes through your furnace and air conditioning system over one hundred times a day\nThen I'm going to open up those phone lines again and allow some more people to get that two hundred and fifty two dollar total system rejuvenation for free and you're absolutely going to love the service I promise\nSo here's the deal we're going to call you and give you a two hour window of time for the technician to arrive and when he shows up he's going to park on the street okay now our vehicles are meticulously maintained but at the same time you don't have a leak until you've got to leak right\nAfter he parks in the street he's going to walk up and knock on your door and when you let them in he's going to say I'm here to take care of your air conditioner or your for his or your heat pump\nAnd he'll reach down and put on she covers over his shoes or boots we also called them for savers he's going to wear those each time he enters your house they'll show you the inspection and\nCleaning form and he'll say something like each of these represents a part of your heating and cooling system and as I'm going through your system I'm either going to mark okay or if I see anything or it's going to give you challenges in the future I'm going to market and this column over here\nAnd if you want me to take care of something before I leave I usually can now once he has your approval to do the tune up on his own voice\nAll I'm over here and if you want me to take care of something before I leave I usually can\nNow once he has your approval to do the tune up on his own voice he'll ask you to show him the thermostat and with your permission he'll turn it on and make sure that it's working\nNext to ask you to show him the outdoor unit and then the indoor unit at which point he'll say something like I'm going to start your tuna now if you wanna watch that's fine and if not that's okay too and then he'll start the tuna\nNow his very first task is to take the top off of the outdoor air conditioning unit or heat pump\nNexus to get the leaves and sticks in mocking debris out of the system because all that stuff holds water and Ross out the bottom of your air conditioner prematurely\nNext thing you know your compressors falling through the bottom of unit and you've got to get the new one okay so something as simple as getting the debris out of the bottom makes a huge difference\nNow the next step in my opinion is the best we're going to use a semi high pressure nozzle just sprayed down your coils from the inside out because we've got the top off\nNow this is on your outdoor air conditioning unit right and it sucks air in from the sides and along with it grass clippings and dust and whatnot so we're going to back flush it wash\nAll that gunk back out of there and if you've got all that stuff stuck in your air conditioning system it's just like having a sweater on that baby\nNow listeners if your eyes were going to go for a jog a hot summer's day with a sweater on and destroying our mouth what would happen right our bodies wouldn't be able to release the heat and we'd get really really hot\nWell the same thing happens to your door unit your air conditioner your heat pump if it's dirty it's going to overheat it's going to cause problems you're going to have a compressor fail you're going to have motors fail\nThe number one cause of compressor failure is dirty coils so we're going to get the outdoor coils cleaned up for you\nSometimes we even have to use a foaming cleanser to get all that stuff off and man is that a sight to see you're looking at a good forty five minutes just up to this point so you can see why I say these other maintenance is our drive by maintenance is right if they're there and gone and forty five minutes\nNext we're going to test the electrical components in your system all the connections make sure they're nice in tight makes you you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires because sometimes little things that go wrong with your air conditioning system and furnish\nThey can cause big things to go wrong All right\nYou may have a pending compressor failure because you've got a little started that's about to go bad\nYou may have a
