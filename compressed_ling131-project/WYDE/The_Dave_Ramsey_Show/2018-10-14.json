three o'clock or six episode and we'll be speaking with a two more barrier for gifts or local political issues thank you for listening and we'll see you next Sunday\n[noise] [noise]\nHello this is Adrian Hendricks and Jerry Hendricks of say one more now incorporated our focus is loving to confront all activities this hollering human life created in the image of God\nThere is no greater dishonor to in God and to human life than to reject is eternal salvation only available through to shed blood and Jesus Christ\nThank you for joining us today's messages about falling in love with Jesus part\nTo bar way a review\nToday we're telling everyone about this invitation but to attend you must love Jesus\nWhy would anyone come to a wedding celebration if they did not left the room and the bride think about it Jesus Says at John chapter fourteen first Fifteen if you really love me you will obey my commands are you hoping his commands\nAre you preparing to meet him and his band eternity with him and his hat in the kingdom\nThe Bible tells us a lot about this kingdom\nJesus told his disciples St Matthew chapter twenty five versus wants to Thirteen then the kingdom of heaven shabby like into ten virgins who took the alliance and went to meet the bride crime\nFive of them were foolish thoughtless without forethought and five or wives sensible intelligent and prudent\nFor window foolish took their land they did not take any extra oil with them but the wash took flash of oil along with them also with the lamps while the bride and groom lingered and was slowing calming they all began nodding their heads and they fell asleep but at midnight there was a shout behold the bride and groom\nGo out to meet him then all those virgins got up and put their own lamps in order and the foolish said to the wives give us some of your oil for our laps of going out\nBut the wives virgins replied there will not be enough for us and for you go instead to the dealers him by for yourselves\nWhile they were going away to buy the bride and groom came and those who were prepared went in with him to the marriage sees ender door was shot\nLater the other versions came and said lord lord opened the door to us but he replied I solemnly to clear to you I Do not know you I Am not acquainted with you\nWatch therefore give strict attention and be cautious an active for you know neither today in or the hour when the son of man will come\nEver Barnes is commentary on this last first grade this is the scope or design the whole parable this is the great truth that Christ was to inculcate in all parts of the ... are to be interpreted in reference to this admonition\nGreat truth that Christ which to inculcate in all parts of the ... are to be interpreted in reference to this admonition\nLike the virgins many are professors at least going to meet the bride grown the Lord Jesus Christ like the coming of the bride and groom his ad that will be set and it will be too many at an unexpected time nanny even professing Christians will be engaged in the business of the world\nThoughtless about eternity not expecting his approach and not prepared they will only professed to know him but in works they will deny him so death will come all approaches up the son of God to judgment are setting and\nTo many unexpected so many when they show see him hunting at the death or the judgment will begin like the foolish virgins to be active and to prepare to die but it will be too late\nDays that are ready will enter and and having will be closed forever against all others the coming up the savior is certain that precise time when he will come is not certain as the virgin should all have watched and then ready so should we\nThey who are Christians should be ever watchful and they who are not should lose no time to be ready for and such an hour as they think not the son of man she'll come\nNot all are watchful not all are preparing\nFor his return attendees president and marriage supper and lamb must be properly a tired that requires us to spend time getting reading like right now\nTomorrow's not promised to any of us our next breath or not guaranteed\nAnd Matthew twenty two verses to through fourteen Jesus Says the kingdom of heaven it's like a king who gave a wedding banquet for his son and sent his servants to some in those who had been invited to the wedding banquet but they refused to come\nAgain he sat at a servant saying tell those who are invited the whole I have prepared my banquet my bullets and my fat cats are killed and everything is prepared come to the wedding feast but they were not concerned and pay no attention and they went away\nWent to his farm another to his business while the others seized his servants treated them shameful late and put them to death\nHearing this the king was infuriated and he sent his soldiers and put those murderers to death and burned their city\nThen he said to his servants the wedding ceases prepared but those invited we're not worthy\nSort of go to the thoroughfares an invite to the wedding sees as many as you find those servants went out on the cross roads and got together as many as they found both bad and good so the room in which the weddings he's was hell was filled with gas\nOr when they came came in to view the guests he looked intently at a man there we had on no wedding garment and he said to him friend how did you come in here without putting on the appropriate wedding garment\nAnd he was speechless than the king's there to the attendance tire him hand and foot and throw him into the darkness outside\nThere will be weeping and grinding of tea for many or coal many are invited many years someone but few are chosen\nVerse fourteen says many are invited but here are chosen this too is that our own doing\nReading from commentator Albert Barnes nation after nation has been called but few few have yet show that they were real Christians the elective God\nIt is also true me who are in the church may prove to be without the wedding garment and show at last that they were not the chosen of God this remark and the fourteenth first is the information\nBe without the wedding garment and show at last that they were not the chosen of God\nFish we're marking the fourteenth first is the inference from the whole parable and not of the part about the man without his wedding garment\nIt does not mean therefore that the great mass in the church or simply called not chosen for our hypocrites but the great mass in the human family in the time of Christ who had been called had rejected the mercy of God\nSo many will not be a to marriage separate the limbic cause money education popularity and power have become their guards\nThe border research group has shown that the more education a person has or the more income they earn the less likely they are to believe and godly concepts such as heaven or hell\nThey struggled to embrace biblical teaching on matters such as the\nAccording to this research many committed born again Christian believe that people have multiple options for gaining entry to heaven such as living an exemplary life\nApplying Gray's which they think means that God is so eager to see people from hill but he will change his nature and universal principles for their individual benefit developing their faith according to their feelings on cultural assumptions rubber the biblical teaching\nMany have rejected the mercy of God but not all\nThere are still those who are looking waiting in preparing for his return\nRevelation checked in Nineteen versus seven through nine says let us rejoice and shot for joy exhausting and triumphant let us celebrate and described to him glory and honor for the marriage at the land at last has come in his bride has prepared herself\nShe has been permitted to dress in fine radiant lemon gasoline in white for the find linen represents the righteousness of the saints God's holding people didn't the angel said to me write this down blessing are those who are some and who are invited to the marriage supper or the lamb\nAnd he said to me these are the true words of God\nDefine radiate Lenin represents the righteousness of the saints\nIs not our righteousness but the righteousness which the lord has impeded to us\nIt has the righteousness which results from the Clinton sacrifice of our redeem or Jesus Christ as Paul said some for Libyans chapter three versus eight through twelve\nMore than that I even consider all things to be lost because of the surpassing greatness of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my lord\nFor the sake of whom I have suffered the loss of all things considered that down in order that are making Christ and may be found in him\nNot having my righteousness which is from the law but which is through faith in Christ the righteousness from God on the basis of face so that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being conform to his death if somehow I may attain to the resurrection from that did\nHeavenly father we pray for all these people made in your image with whom you desire to Spain eternity because you lock them we with them all belong to you as it is written and so I'm twenty four verse won the earth is tilted towards and the fullness of the world and they do

possible\nHis one more Chris from Darlene from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania it's a miracle in a tube that truly does take away the pain it works as nothing else I've ever tried it worked quickly and eliminated all of the pain\nSo to me now these are these you\nDo these kinds of responses unusual\nNo really are the usual really usual I mean I must say that it does my heart good to hear these things because I Know what it's like to suffer and I know what it's like to get relief and every time you know I get one of these emails are these letters that just confirms that\nHundreds of thousands of people have used my great results that's great\n[laughter] I don't want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that if you want to try Dr Janet's extra strength glucose mean pain relief formula there's a special toll free number to call give that to you know\nIt's one eight hundred for six seven nine seven zero nine\nAs we've been talking about here Dr Janet's formula is a

six seven nine seven zero nine or give it to you again it's one eight hundred for six seven nine seven zero nine\n[noise] so what do you think folks has a pretty interesting isn't it um you know pain obviously something that that is a huge epidemic in this country I don't think there's many of us or any of us for that matter that has not experienced pain from time to time or maybe it's more serious more chronic\nUm and looking for a real solution here understanding that\nPerhaps the pharmaceutical approaches is now we know is not the best approach at this point because there are so many side effects associated with the with these drugs out there as right but looking at it from a natural standpoint and Dr Janice glucose mean cream\nMaybe make some sense here I mean this is this is again putting back into your body we'd we'd do seem to discover time and time again but when you give your body what it needs it knows what to do with it and knows how to fix the problem it's only if it doesn't get those thing right that you continue to have the problem and\nAgain we've been talking about Dr Janis ... cream and this is this is a number of ingredients that you put together right and and this this good for any type of pain\nIf you have pain of any kind it's kind of make a difference I mean I don't care how extreme it is ... how minimal it is it's going to get you release\nNow it's more extreme of course it may take a little longer ... take your pain from my pen to a five and ... on the line with continue to use ... I'm telling you that's very doable yeah so this has really exciting to be able to share this with you\nYeah again I think one of the things that is that is important for people to understand because very unique this is a cream yes this is not a supplement yeah there are lots of supplements out there and what do you tell someone that comes into your office and says well Dr Jana\nYou know I I've tried this I've tried that I've tried this I've tried to all of these things and it did not work so therefore the natural approach doesn't\nWork first of all for ... or MSN for that matter it takes Ninety Days for them to notice something if in fact they're going to notice anything because they may not be breaking down and absorbing the lightning here taking into early to three months people give up\nPeople in pain they won't release and they want it now right and that's why I developed this cream again Fifteen minutes and I am telling you you'll notice that it's going to the good ... and so I just gave you a challenge you know try it you have nothing to lose\nOkay again we're talking about Dr ... cream here in ... ... ... somebody calls today gets your cream and tries it what should they expect realistically\nSix seven nine seven zero nine\nI'll give it to you one more time it's one eight hundred for\nSix seven nine seven zero nine\nWell that's all the time we have for today thanks again to our sponsor Dr Newton's natural ... you can visit them online anytime a doctor news dot com for all of your supplement need\nAnd be sure to join us again next week for another great show I'm Chris McKay have a great day everybody\nHears superstition one oh one we're committed to bringing equality program and that has a formative as well as paint\nSend us an email we have one on one to be why the dot com and let us know when you think he was super station one on one\nW ... there'll be ...

throw the tubes in the air [laughter] oh wow yeah and he is ... ... words that\nTurn out [laughter] so it was a little\nBit like we always say on the show here people in the south so we like to know you know who you are and who your people are well I\nI grew up here I moved here when I was about six years old um my dad as you said was a Lutheran pastor and that's what brought us to the area and um it was very fortunate to grow up in a in a Christian\nUm my dad as you said was a Lutheran pastor and that's what brought us to the area and um\nIt was very fortunate to grow up in a in a Christian home and my dad was actually I'm the son of a pastor as well and I think that really impacted how both my parents um\nHandled the role of preachers good for me it was a it was an excellent time of growing up and I was thinking about how you were talking about the power of words and and what we say over our children and the first thing that that struck me was\nThat I was growing up you know what I heard was you can do anything and um\nAnd that really did give me um courage and strength um it also though I think um for those first years of my life\nI think I've I left it at you you can do anything and really what my mom and dad um instilled in me and we're and we're saying is you know\nThrough the power of God um you can do anything and he has big plans for you as far as his well for you and that's going to be ... better than any plan that you might come up with so I had to um over the years as far as\nDifferent challenges and opportunities that God presented to to keep that in mind but um I've always been thankful that had that faith foundation right on so I did um under the under the assumption that I could do anything um I did go uh I went to college and I said I Want to be a TV reporter and um\nMy parents were like okay go for it and\nAnd you know looking back on it and it was the kind of a very narrow career very few people you know actually do have the opportunity to\nTo make that leap and and actually be a TV reporter and uh I was very blessed is very competitive it is very competitive it's very competitive but anyway I was I was very fortunate to be able to enter into that career and I can look back also and see how that prepared me for\nUm the later roles that I had\nAs you mentioned as far as being given the opportunity to start a magazine with the health care company and\nAnd that was one of those things to that whole thing of well you can do anything was I had never done really print at all and they said hey we we like you to start this magazine and I was like not alright sure knowing nothing really about what I was too you can do anything [laughter]\nI wasn't home so it was a it was it a fun and exciting time to be able to do that and and to be able to learn really how how to\nPut together a magazine and and I'm being given the opportunity then to take that and be able to share good news about the gospel you know in that in that role so it's been a it's\nInteresting journey for sure yes well you know I we kinda share that that passion for putting together magazines can we do several for for client right I have some history with that in the past as well as as as you know [noise]\nUm I think the thing that I like about it is that you ... you know before you put together a magazine you can sit down and dream Mm right you have the dream session be like oh what can we talk about what can we share what's important towards relevance\nI think God had brain bows out there that I never\nSaw because my head so down especially um\n[noise] and the worst of times um I wasn't even I wasn't aware of those small I'm not just that he was giving 'em and I wasn't open to um to asking him what do you think instead of that um my\nLaurie way of jumping in and taking charge and just moving on board you know just\nPlow it on three baby in wow it it sure made life a lot better [laughter]\nSo you know I don't think I Would have 'em\nCome to that without that difficult challenge\nThat we hear a lot every single time we we have a guest that talks about their store it's almost like they recognize me appreciate that that storm took place in their life because of that\nThe lessons they taught them and then the beauty that perspective it gave them a little a person that had made and you know right there there was there was beating the broken and pain and in in ... in purpose and that pain\nAbsolutely absolutely and and having days where you're like I really don't know I don't know what's next I don't know how to handle this situation\nAnd and having days where you're like I really don't know I don't know what's next I don't know how to handle this situation and\nWatching him better than and figured out exactly what ever\nThey want to say we're at that were at that age we weren't saying what age but we're at that age [laughter] you know we're starting to think about\nRetiring at some point here\nIn the next little while and you know we start\nAt least for me I start thinking more about legacy as I knew when I was working on my book that for me it was like if nobody ever read my book it's okay because it's my legacy to my kids write it fits the gift of all the things that the wisdom and and things that I've collected over the years that God has taught me\nAbout raising kids that I Want them to know write it became like a legacy work for me and that gave it new inspiration when I thought of it that way [noise]\nWhat are some of the things that you are is there anything like that where you've been thinking about what is my legacy what do you want to leave behind [noise]\nWell I think especially in a you know I think about it in in relation to my kids just as as you were talking about\nIs I I Hope that um\nThey will remember the the gratitude\nAnd how in each and every day there is there something special and I'm not to forget that I think it's profoundly affects your attitude I'm profoundly affects ability to for God to use you I'm as a vessel for him\nAnd um I Hope that's what\nThat's what they remember it was a thankful heart\nYou have a very demanding job\nAnd actually before you got divorced your husband worked with you that's right that's why I'm so not only you know not only was in a marriage but it was a partner at the right partner to where you had to pick up the slack\nOn all of that and that became it was a demanding absolutely tuition for you\nYeah I Would like to ask people to me and then 'cause you know came in are both what we call hair on fire\nEvery day and it was like to ask\nPeople you know 'cause I can use the little wisdom in this area and self care what do you do to take care of you\nVery good point I I Will say I'm the biggest thing for me is literally I'm walking out you know the first at least thirty minutes of the day as my time with God and usually that begins you know with a with a short version um I Love\nSiri young is um her message is home to get into God's word often and\nAnd then spent time journal lane um there was a time in my life and you know for young moms I think um I can feel like you have no time and certainly you are very limited\nOn being able to not you know to be able to um get that quiet time man but it's critical and um yes it is that's best for me [noise]\nWell we got music playing in ... pointing out may so we're going to take a quick break when we come back we'll continue with Laurie ... stay with us\nAll over [noise]\nOver over it I'm a very\nSome knowledge belongs to us and us

a long time because we kinda are in the same circles media circles but we don't get a lot of time to hang out so I'm enjoying Paul I have to thank you so much so one of the things I thought we were talking about since your hair 'cause you know [noise]\nYou know you look we talked about dreaming when it comes to magazines and coming up with the topics and\nEighteen years' worth of dreaming yeah on Christian topics and issues and I think all of us you know every day they they're Christian walk is a struggle right at something that we're always we never reach perfection it's about the journey and it's about\nYou know becoming more that Christ with every day yeah to in in the world today a we have\nDisasters\nWe have terrorism [laughter] we have\nA we have disasters we have terrorism [laughter]\nWe have some pretty heavy things right and we do um that were kind of dealing with plus I think we're busier than we've ever been were more distracted than we've ever been [noise]\nUm there's there's a case it could be made to say that we're less respectful and may be meaner than we've ever been to each other as a culture\nAnd you know Christians are part of the culture and so you know there's the things that we're going to struggle with [noise]\nUm I found this this list on the Internet because as everybody who listens to the show on a regular basis knows that I'm like Google queen I just I Love me some good [laughter]\nSo like list I'm sitting there dreaming about the show I like you know I'll enter things into Google just to see what will come up\nSo I found this list and I thought it was an interesting list because a lot of things on this list where just that obvious to me like there were a little bit different so I thought as a\nAs a girls taught us girls can maybe discuss some of these things on the list I won't say how many there are because Dave tells me this is a no no because we always run out at times [laughter]\nSo it's as many as we have time to try to get out", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "14"}
