conditioning systems or two and three and four years old\nOh look I don't care how in efficient they claim your heating and air conditioning system is if it's less than eight years old you shouldn't

just a little bit of money getting it cleaned up operating more efficiently lower your energy bills viewer breakdowns and more money in your pocket\nNow we're gonna talk a little bit about what you should expect from the heating and air conditioning company that's coming out to maintain your system because I've got a feeling that a lot of you out there have been getting the drive by maintenance\nYou'll recognize it it's the one where they come out for twenty to forty five minutes ask you for fifty sixty Seventy bucks and then they're gone\nMaybe they hook up a set of refrigerant

hired one person freedom heating and cooling is very selective about who they put in your home\nI Want to talk about one of the gentlemen I interviewed and keep in mind when I Do an interview I asked them all kinds of questions about how they do the work\nI asked them how to test the capacitor how to clean a blower wheel and sure enough this guy was giving me pretty good explanations he missed one maybe two little steps but nothing a little training couldn't fix right\nNow at some point in every interview I Try to compare our moral compasses so sometimes I gotta get a little sneaky okay so here's the seventh question I asked him\nI lean in and I said how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need\nDid you hear that folks how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need now brace yourself folks because without hesitation he said I don't have a problem with it at all\nI don't have a problem with it at all and the reality is that he had been around and

can do it and if I'm being honest I have done it\nThe company that I worked for required that I bring back a certain dollar amount on every single call that I went on\nSometimes they didn't need anything but if I didn't sell them anything I was going to lose my job and man I got kids defeat\nBut then I got to thinking am I setting the right kind of example for my kids so I had to quit and now I'm unemployed and the market is flooded with heating and air conditioning technicians and it's been hard to get a job\nThat's an example of the type of competitors we have out there guys\nI told stories in interviews about heating and air conditioning companies training there technicians to jump wires on two thousand dollar compressors to sell new systems like crossing wires over to break them\nAnd there are hundreds of heating and air conditioning contractors in this area last time I checked and chances are pretty good\nThat a technician like the one in the story it's going to be coming to your home or your neighbor's home you know you might look down the street today and see an air conditioning technician a heating technician and it might be that guy\nI'm certain that he

more people to get that two hundred and fifty two dollar total system rejuvenation for free and you're absolutely going to love the surface I promise\nSo here's the deal we're going to call you and give you a two hour window of time for the technicians to arrive and when he shows up he's going to park on the street okay now our vehicles are meticulously maintained but at the same time you don't have a leak until you've got to leak right\nAfter he parks in the street he's going to walk up and knock on your door and when you let them in he's going to say I'm here to take care of your air conditioner or your for his or your heat pump\nAnd he'll reach down and put on shoe covers over his shoes or boots we also called them for savers he's going to wear those each time he enters your house\nThey'll show you the inspection and cleaning form and he'll say something like each of these represents a part of your heating and cooling system and as I'm going through your system I'm either going to mark okay or if I see anything ah that's going to give you challenges in the future I'm In a market in this column over here\nAnd if you want me to take care of something before I leave I usually can\nNow once he has your approval to do the tune up on his own voice he'll ask you to show him the thermostat and ...\nOr something before I leave I usually can now once he has your approval to do the tune up on his invoice he'll ask you to show him the thermostat and with your permission he'll turn it on and make sure that it's working next to ask you to show him the outdoor unit and then the indoor unit\nAt which point he'll say something like I'm going to start your tune up now if you wanna watch that's fine and if not that's okay too and then he'll start the tuna\nNow his very first task is to take the top off of the outdoor air conditioning unit or heat pump\nNext as we get the leaves and sticks in mocking debris out of the system because all that stuff holds water and Ross out the bottom of your air conditioner prematurely\nNext thing you know your compressors falling through the bottom of a unit and you've got to get in the new one okay so something as simple as getting the debris out of the bottom makes a huge difference\nNow the next step in my opinion is the best we're going to use a semi high pressure nozzle just sprayed down your coils from the inside out because we've got the top off\nNow this is on your outdoor air conditioning unit right and it sucks air in from the sides and along with it\nGrass clippings and dust and whatnot so we're going to back flush it wash all that going back out of there and if you've got all that stuff stuck in your air conditioning system it's just like having a sweater on that baby\nNow listeners if you're a high we're going to go for a jog hot summer's day with a sweater on and a strong our mouth what would happen right our bodies wouldn't be able to release the heat and we'd get really really hot\nWell the same thing happens to your door unit your air conditioner you heat pump if it's dirty it's going to overheat it's going to cause problems you're going to have a compressor fail you're going to have motors fail\nThe number one cause of compressor failure is dirty coils so we're going to get the outdoor coils cleaned up for you\nSometimes we even have to use a foaming cleanser to get all that stuff off and men is that a sight to see you're looking at a good forty five minutes just up to this point so you can see why I say these other maintenance is our drive by maintenance is right if they're there and gone and forty five minutes\nNext we're going to test the electrical components in your system all the connections make sure they're nice in tight makes you you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires because sometimes little things that go wrong with your air conditioning system and furnace\nThey can cause big things to go wrong All right\nYou may have a pending compressor failure because you've got a little starter that's about to go bad\nYou may have a pending motor failure because you're filters all plugged up and you're not paying

sensor\nAnd most importantly we're going to check your heat exchange or that's the part that is known to crack and leak carbon monoxide that we all know that carbon monoxide can kill you but did you
