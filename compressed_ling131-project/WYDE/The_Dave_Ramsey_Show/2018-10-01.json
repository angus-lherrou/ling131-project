Jones\nInstead call Richard Shelby and asking him to use his influence with Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski Jeff Flake may be\nA maybe last T H Trump but maybe if he chalked Grassley and Susan Collins and Murkowski your phone call might actually do some good ah so that's just kind of my two cents worth that like care what you think about\nYou know that that's a that's a great book you know

that\nWas that not about the time that Trump came out with his short list of possible nominate\nOh yeah oh yeah good clear diamond and it was like three people governor was on there\nYeah uh you know there was a female in that short list\n... to a who was it ... what was her name yeah an honors or\nAnyway I just I'm just curious what did they drum up on her\nI you know it's very interesting because what what if Brett Kavanaugh wasn't up there like there would be something that they would find about either of those two candidates\nYeah that's what our farm boy that's how they operate that you know they can't stand on a platform because our platform\nJust is horrible uh so they have to make up things I have to try to find things to make someone else will look bad or instead of standing up on what the choice to actually\nYou know that's just it it's what we're going to ah continue to see them you\nKnow yeah I have no doubt I told my wife when he'd pay Trump's parsed said a cabin often do you watch like I'll come out with all this\nKind of stuff about a him being a some type of sexual predator or something like that you just watch and sure enough that's all they've got to a

didn't help strip well when he\nSaid that he wasn't voting for Roy Moore and in all\nThis other stuff but say you like I said earlier if we would have um what role and more and we would know by now whether it was true or not um ... out right now nobody knows 'cause everything's been dropped us out of the limelight\n[noise] yeah I mean we're not ever going to find anything out about it [laughter] ... will we will never know what happened how long\nAgo as Doug Jones though at Thirty years to Doug Jones ever like Thirty years ago yeah thirty five is the same thing\nWell in ran an ad of the I'm One of these that if you've been in office over to a two terms I'm not voting for you anyway I don't care how good your\nAh ... the\nTerm limits is something we've talked about before but we have term limits\nWhen it comes to like congressional term limits well yeah it was called voting\n[noise] you're right but I mean yeah but the way people look at it is\nAlways everybody else's guys not our guy yeah well if you guys been in there over two terms it your guy who's making money to spend as you might give money to turn is supposed to be a service you you know it was supposed to be in so that you could go up there and serve and then go back home and make your money\nNow it's go up there and make your money and then go back home yeah you're not really serving\nAny well you're lucky you are serving you are a public servant like you're going up there I Hope for the right reason but it\nTurns out to be more and more and more and more\nLike you you know what what are you really doing well you start making much money you get ingrained in that system you get respect you get um the the kind of power we're talking about and then the rest is history especially when you're you're looking at people who have been there for six terms or\nFive terms yeah see that's two meaning I like what John McCain over what five or six times too many anything over to is too many I mean imagine the kind of power you guy he ever see that's the whole thing they don't need power we're supposed to have the power exactly the people the will of the people is supposed to be the power and speaking of that I
