being wasted first off he's in a karaoke bar an accent tells the waitress she can be as backup singer\nAnd we're finding out about the damage that everyday stress can do to our bodies the warning signs that we should be aware of and what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress and Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and how we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of stress\nIn your kill max formula can help us in this battle against rest I'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium factors in I mean\nI I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nForward talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and well first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium it's probably of all the vitamins I could list magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere's over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that magnesium is involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and for example with low levels of magnesium your heart beat who very important factor in life\nYou would say so\nIn fact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism\nChronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's osteoporosis and the list just goes on and on and on and\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium in the body\nSimply a lack of magnesium ... too so\nIt's nothing to really mess around with now what happens is that you need that many of them in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nOh so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is ...\nThat's right they work in combination with each other now there's many more practical applications of this ... formula mhm first of all like I said you drink it so it gets into your system and one of the first thing we use it for in our clinic\nIs for people who are under a lot of stress and they can't sleep well at night it works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleeping really because it relaxes your body and you do actually fill the relaxation after you drink the after you drink a cup of the ... formula\n... interesting\nNow the other thing that it's really really good for our people who are in pain\nOkay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and a case studies of people actually taking ... formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic Taipei\nFibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of areas that like to discuss with you\nWow that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seemed to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I like to discuss what happens is that when a person has\nA magnesium deficiencies in the Nick we make museum they don't absorb their food as well and so they go and\nAnd I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has\nMagnesium deficiency specifically magnesium they don't absorb their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that use it might be overtime just starting to feel more tired tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more\nRats or whatever right that that's what I Would think that what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that starts to take the calcium out of the bones to start getting on life you start getting um muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah and your body that actually starting to manifest it will\nAll due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nCalcium and now let me tell you and it is simple the problem in being a doctor researchers how do you get the end of the system\nThe formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because it's a powder form\nYou take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in\nYou and your drink is cut down this great my absorption rate\nIs really incredible because it actually goes right into your blood stream\nI this is probably a good time folks if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and try Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to call\nIt's one eight hundred for eight eight seven six five one not kill max is a unique blend of calcium and magnesium that gets absorbed into your blood stream so you can replace those vital nutrients that your body burns up when you experienced stress\nAnd I want to let you know the doctor Pincus has arranged a very special introductory offer it's only available to you listeners so when you call me shirt I mentioned this program and you get a risk free trial of ... again this was only available to listeners and only if you call this toll free number\nIt's one eight hundred for eight eight seven six five one\nSo if you're feeling the symptoms of stress the lack of sleep the low energy pain stiffness in your muscles and joins your body is telling you it's lacking the calcium and magnesium it needs to handle the effects of everyday stress\nYou know if you're concerned maybe about bone health or osteoporosis if you want to improve your heart health your digestive health\nAnd even reduce or eliminate the effects of stress I encourage you try to kill max formula only have to do is pick up the phone and call one eight hundred for eight eight seven six five one\nAnd when you do call today you're also going to get that free book it's called the user's guide to calcium and magnesium and folks this book is packed with vital information about why your calcium needs change with age\nCal seems rolling cardiovascular health osteoporosis diabetes depression fatigue it's all in this very informative book\nAnd I forget it I'm going to give away I grew up my comment to the white collar so it's really important for your listeners to pick up the phone and take advantage of that\nThank you for doing that Dr pain 'cause I really appreciate it most this just keeps getting better and better so you get to try ... absolutely risk free and if you're one of the first one hundred callers you're going to get an extra free bottle plus you're going to get

number\nFor eight eight seven six five one and remember you have absolutely nothing to lose because you can try ... absolutely risk free\nSo that number to call is one eight hundred for eight eight seven six five one I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred for eight eight seven six five one\nWell if you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael ... on the phone today and he's telling us about stress and how important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium and how much of an impact that has on our overall health\nSo I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this is an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time it's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium in their\nBody well that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm you know a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing differences are little trips little leaks here and there and do what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time yeah to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\nDr bank is you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium many of them is excellent for back pain because\nThe calcium goes into the muscles and they need them actually helps the transmitters and the nerve\nAnd when you take this combat formula many times it will calm your back pain wow I Know I I did a couple of years ago I herniated disc in my back ... and I was trying to everything and I took out the comics formula\nAnd I drank it and I couldn't believe the difference within about a half hour I was functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drank it over ten day period and it it completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is or something you have to watch out for both dietary and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone has any history of heart disease or ... even had bypass surgery you should be on this count acts formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing um we talked about arthritis what about joint pain well\nThe arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a can of this lady who was suffering from fibromyalgia where she was having pain and just about every joint in your body\nTo be in or near could be in her neck it could be in her elbow and um and I gave it to her one week and I saw her the next week and I swear Chris I did not recognize her really just to the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later she was bright she had a beautiful smile her eyes were gleaming and I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough she was the one who took a week of ah the formula account max formula\nThe powers cut and Greg offers to sign

I think I mentioned that [noise] um but anyway so let's get into today\nFor us today well you know parenting is always a big cut topic for you and me and I you know it's a big part of it has been a big part of my life so I talk about parenting a lot [noise]\nSo there is a story\nThere's this this thing that they are rising everybody knows about helicopter parents right oh yeah okay helicopter parent is one that swoops in every time that they're hovers yeah hovers but also swoops in to rescue mhm right little Johnny low Suzie Everytime something\nRight every time there's a problem there is a new one on the horizon that we're going to talk about today [noise]\nAnd uh so we're not going to start off with some stories with regards to this topic okay All right here's the headline mother falls federal lawsuit after sun doesn't make high school soccer team ... a St Louis mother has filed a federal lawsuit claiming\nMy mother falls federal lawsuit after sun doesn't make high school soccer team ... a St Louis mother has filed a federal lawsuit claiming that a soccer coach his decision to cut her son from the junior varsity team was age discrimination [noise]\nWow mhm okay\nSo anyway it gets into why her her you know the reasoning for all of this but did I mention it was the high schools soccer team yeah he did so mama bear is in their lack my boys should not be cut from the same\nK already about that\nShe's she claims her son will face to face quote irreparable harm if he is not put on the team\nFrom him irreparably harm because yeah emotionally I guess oh okay I'm wow\n... [noise]\n... [noise] you know [noise]\nI mean this this one just this this gets me there was a moment in my life that I didn't make something that I thought I should\nAnd at the moment I thought my world was over right like ... I'm not going to be able to get up out of bed in the morning\nWell not only did it did do a cheerleading\nNo lowest into cheerleading [laughter] oh I Know some major at the end geek [laughter] um but I didn't make had major at and it was it was a turning point for me I had not really applied myself I kinda thought I was like just gonna naturally fall into it and it didn't make it\nAnd so you thought you deserve something you have worked for when I was the only senior I was kinda like ... natural rite of passage oh you're in title minute yeah\nThat was a wake up call that if you don't practice the junior that did practice is going to get it and you don't and it was like I said it was a turning point for me that it's not just like your place in life it's also how much you put into it\nSo I think this is an unfortunate thing not just for the parents but also for that child because he's probably going to learn a lesson that isn't going to serve him well\nThat mom was going to come and take care of it and we'll just file a lawsuit and everything's going to be OK baby but he didn't learn that you have to apply yourself and your I'd have to work hard and practice and they sometimes life is just unfair to I mean that there's that [noise]\nBut yeah that one's that is a mess so when I was a single mom\nMhm um several of my kids worked out publics which was an awesome place to work if you're a teenager mhm um but they have standards of public's then you must have a belt and you must have certain kinds of shoes\nAnd you must be put together and before you clock in ... right or you walk in and tell you do right\nAnd then you know when you're like you get written up so they don't play a public's they they were on a tight ship over there yeah\nSo one of my children was in the habit of forgetting whatever piece of clothing that they needed to be put together so choose name it right and they would call me in a panic\n'cause they had to walk to get there [laughter] you know what I as a couple of miles away so they've walked several miles to discover that they do not have what they need and they would call me help come rescue me bring me my whatever mhm and I would say you get one\nThen after that you you're gonna have to you know just take care of it or do right don't forget so I Would do the one that was the mercy that was the grace [laughter]

Need my belt or whatever and I'll say start running you know I started running [laughter] I'd make a run two miles home and the run two miles back to work and guess what happened Kim they got in great shape\nThat against what\nHasn't and they also learn should make sure they had all they write remembered mhm right\nBecause the lesson within the pain of having to go home and come back yeah right

author an educator a motivational speaker that's the short list she is also the great granddaughter of the late Dr H E Gaston\nAnd he is one of the south's most notable entrepreneurs actually looked him up and wicked media and had my mind alone [laughter]\nShe received your degree in business administration for miles college in her master's in education from Stanford University she represented miles college in the Nineteen eighty nine miss Alabama pageant said this calendar is not the first time she's worn a Sasha\nAnd is the Nineteen Ninety ... black Alabama us hey she is the founder and

times on the show and we introduce a gas we ask them to tell us a little bit about growing up ... you know you have\nA a pedigree [laughter] in in legacy really yeah I'm I I did I went to a ... and\nAnd looked at your great grandfather what a life that he led yes yes I'm\nSo and people who are maybe not familiar I mean there's the boys and Girls Club right so I think that's where I've seen hit the name a G ... boys and Girls Club that's where I've seen it but he was an entrepreneur at a time\nWhen African Americans were not being given those opportunities right [noise]\nUm and he himself was a grandson of an enslaved person right so you all you I mean pedigree you've all the way back [noise]\nUm [noise] he uh\nHad a number of businesses he started an insurance company which is really interesting if you go to ... see how that happened started construction company a financial company a business school or a motel yeah which Dr King stayed at\n'em and I think he was like there was a plot to blow it up at some point because Dr King was there [noise] um and he himself was actually assaulted kidnapped ... on multiple things yes\nThe king was there [noise] um and he himself was actually assaulted kidnapped ... um multiple things yes it's it's an amazing life an amazing story of his resilience than his um he's an inspiration yes he is is\nUm [noise] you know when I sit in and I'll listen to that I I think about\nI mean to me just like you guys these grand daddy\nYou know [noise] um and growing up that's\nWho he was to me it wasn't until I got older\nThat I started to gain an appreciation for who he was and\nAnd um when he went through what he went through what he ate over paying to\nBe who he was and um and he was so great\nTo so many people and even today now I'm Still I meet people and\nThey'll say you know Dr gassed and did this for my family or got the gas and is the reason why I'm here today you know well he instilled a lot of um\nGreat principals and me and um or people that that docked gas and took me under his wing and he meant toward me and he he he instilled in me some great um work ethic and\nAnd and um different quality different things that are in me\nThat um I Would not have gained if I hadn't been around him so um\nHe has a a quote that it's pretty famous that are pulled\nAnd the quotas I never went into anything with the idea of making money I thought of doing something and it would come up and make money and then it never thought of trying to get rich ... that's exactly what happened to him that he was he was blessed what he put his hand who was who was blessed fly\nHe um he another one of his quotes his mind and he didn't feel it and that's basically how he lived his life everything that he did was to help someone else and\nIn turn it did I mean it created this business that was successful it was successful because it was filling a need for somebody and um but everything into the insurance company you know he and his job someone\nHe he worked um slough furnace and and\nThere were people that were dying and people but there I'm just counterparts had family members that were dying and he was finding out they could do not have money to bury their their next of can't so\nHe created a way to you know give them the opportunity to have insurance so that they can make that happen and that grew into a great business you know he um he partner with um Mr Smith\nTaking advantage of and that way [noise] I I kid you know\nIn that it affects your safe your safety in every area of your life so\nThink for me the talking about my domestic violence story has probably been the part of my overall story that I've hesitated on the most and I think the reason for me is when it happened a long time ago for me\nI'm In it and it was such a dark place I don't like revisiting it mhm because it it's still it's even though it's been this long it's still\n... you know it's still the the U ... relive some of that pain that you went through so I it's not been a part of my story that I've been overly anxious to talk about\nWhen Cheryl asked me to be in the calendar I hesitated [laughter] for that reason that because I knew then I Would be be talking about it but I\nThink how I Would be a hypocrite if I if I'm On the radio every week and I'm saying take off the mask if I'm saying we need to talk about the things
