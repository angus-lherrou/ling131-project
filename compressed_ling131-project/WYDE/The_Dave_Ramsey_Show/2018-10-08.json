I mean like there's a box in front of the airbag that's like two glove box it's kinda cool and\nLike I Love getting in other people's cars and like just seeing what all the buttons you can you imagine pressing the button that made the glove box come down and then you're seeing that note and how frantically hoard either if you're the other guy in the driver's seat trying to rip it out of your buddies hand or are you reading that and trying to act like you never saw it\nUncomfortable that note would be if it got into the wrong hands like at least it was in the hands of this guy who didn't know anything about this actual couple like this is a psycho relationship like that's insane\nMy question is where it was her parents when she was growing up because you know it's obvious they've done something terribly wrong or something as a meal that\nYeah for her to feel that she has the right to put some garbage like that\nLike she can control another human like that holy cow what I'll tell

else should be telling her like get away run away as fast you can because I'm Crazy\nBut I'm not like to the point of crazy where like I'm Still like when I'm Crazy it's cute you know like it's okay when I'm Crazy for anybody else who is crazy it's not OK okay see that's what makes me crazy\nYou get it you understand it are you with American bread and with ya I'm Lindsay okay so I thought this was this was a a pretty cool invention pretty cool idea and when I talk about invention I I'm not talking about the the ... okay I'm not talking about the next ... like like\nInvention of tweets are like the next day\nTalking about the the ... okay I'm not talking about the next uh uh like like\nInvention of cleats or like the next invention of like a hard hat or like a cell phone or the next whatever when I talk about inventions nowadays it always seems like we keep coming back around to the same thing it's a new app right like Britain how much do you use apps use apps pretty good but\nLike you do you have an iPhone and I'm and I'm like in our phone you have to use the ... there's no there's not like a central processing systems like you have to use an app for everything you want to do wow it's kind of how it is an an Android too though like you think you have to use like a wage it to go somewhere to use it or something like that\nSometimes is on that but I've I haven't had I enjoyed it literally forever but anyways yeah no I'm I'm just I'm a part of the sheep all I'm Sorry I Can't see yeah I Know right yeah it's incredible to think of as my my\nFamily's still has moved on their family plan but\nUm I thought this was a pretty cool idea pretty cool invention but like we use apps every day whether it be over whether it be\nAh like the business calling app where you have like your business number on a on another side whether it be ways whether it be ... you use apps more than you think like you can order food on them you can get people to pick you up you can watch\nMaria coller Michael Michael is hurricane Mike okay right and he took six months on one nine nine three three Jonathan with somebody will come in\nOh a couple of things you know a couple of topics are unconstitutional now you're talking about post being crazy yes now for for the younger ones there I'll just go ahead and explains a yo folks crazy it's just a matter to what degree and what triggers that crazy\nAnd what degree they show it to like how much how much crazier gonna show me\nOkay well I'm the type that will put a festival wall but it's the same time that that that's just like a knee jerk reaction goes thirty minutes later I'm so\nWhy I feel like an idiot because now I got to go pay to put a sheet rock up and yeah but it got an exit and um you know all kinds of aggravated about that um\nI I'm the top it'll throw stuff out in the yard you know just just 'cause I get a little agitated about something not working right or whatever um that crazy [laughter] now my wife is a top crazy that will kill you and your sleep and and you won't know nothing about it [laughter]\nA whole other\nOther crazy I so females had that more in my experience has more dangerous crazy like guys we blow up an expo for a minute but you know made it later you know we got all about it we don't even know what we're mad about\nIt for ... for about three four seven years something like that you know yeah it looks like come out and and it's all\nThe facts and that will take a a will will take kind of a grudge kind of crazy to another level\nOh yeah yeah [noise] but ah as far as the folks a video and what not\nAh I urge you to at some point in time of your life a little a big truck dash cam ... uh I don't know exactly what it would be under you know something you say I'm sure it would have them and to see the things that we see on a daily\nAnd you can also see things were drunk drivers do Raul things ah our companies are big on showed us the videos were drivers and ... and then they show you have this job or did everything right and still ended up in a bad situation\nUm yeah and I hate the video but we're such a just society that you know it just is what it is I mean but you know I Will say things that somebody going to say I'm a mom or show or and then I'm going into grounded and I think\nOn a woman [laughter] I'm ain't got to call my wife so arcane come home from grounded and well I Know it was just going to be ... you got to figure it out I mean look\nWe just went through almost a month of it with a with Ford in ... I mean it was a he said she's a magic of somebody who had their phone on that night and we can see new capital actually er Kevin actually didn't do it\nLike it would have saved us so much trouble so now like if they're going to put the journal that phone you might as well use it or you film everything else you do your ... your iPhone listens constantly you're enjoyed listening to constantly like uh I'm sure the FBI listen to the Ford factions drove through every day but they listen to her my phone then when you have to listen I Want to go into the\nHope is that people will show when things are done right as well so yeah because what we're as a society we're so down on each other you know everybody's in the air if I did this\nJoe when things are done right as well so yeah because we're as a society we're so down on each other you know everybody's ... everybody that this wrong everybody that route and we don't show enough of what people did right yeah you don't really need to add up what's going around saying you don't need a pat on the back I get it\nYou know not try to get trophies just for just fighting here but you know let let's keep in mind but not everybody out in the society of horrible\nYeah and what we've jumped to that like if somebody does any sort of thing that is maybe a tad bit off color or maybe a ... bad or maybe they put a tweet ... ... years ago that doesn't reflect on they are now that now they're they're the bane of all existence\nRight that's incredible actually called John ... it took six five five one nine nine three three tally tally what's up for the woman\nIf Ford ah you know what are the the Amazon Echo device I won't say your name is kind of already in on your little a break in the news today 'cause I said my usual a a word play super station wanna lawn\nAnd they refused to play it used\nTo see it on the guy I don't know a less than ... my ...\nMy grandfather was a mayor I'd grown up around the police community there and jobs should be made hard I Love making their job hard you should know every privacy rights to have it and you just play those muscles because the moment their job comes to easy\nWe cease to be the America ... founders vision we cease to be a democracy a republic and we become I Would say we already has become a police state\nSo in in in light of that I Want to say one thing to you don't use this theory short cut or police ... some gotten right at it that doesn't lock your phone up securely what you need to do is hold down the power button and the volume button or if you're an old phone that power five times and that law that secure enclave\nWhich makes it very hard for ... is on force than the getting to your phone and there had been incidents in the past where you can see very clearly officers that confiscated phones illegally just because they didn't like being video yeah I Would put it out there if you are law enforcement officer doing your job\nProtecting the constitution then you're good in the public you're good you're glacier that\nCan be video you should welcome video I Know what to embarrassing to be on video for some people but if you're a law enforcement officer that's part of your job now it just is yeah that's the second amendment right the camera is the new gun\nThe camera is a fundamental God given right to hold governments accountable it's the new Second Amendment is the new gun\nThanks Dalia thanks to the common you bring up a great point though because it is a way to if you're in the right you can definitely show you're in the right if you're being filmed\nYou can if you're in the right and you make somebody get mad enough to start film and you then guess who's going to like the I\nGuess is going to like it they are because you you are film you're getting film like if you're the cop and you're getting film and somebody's blown up when you who's going to look bad over there the person filming\nYou do what you need to do the right thing it's really hard to know messed that up it's really hard to throw a wrench in that if you're doing the right thing the law abiding thing and you're trying to uphold the law when you're a officer\nBut again it's just it's another one of those things it's the age of technologies invention of technology as technology gets better better and better and better we can do more things like we can face time now we can Skype we can only like we can do it to the point where like we can use those as like tea\nMore things like we can face time now we can Skype we can we can do it to the point where like we can use those as like TV broadcasts like the fact that we can face time somebody across the world from its like face time somebody on the dad go moon\nRight like like we can it feels like we're there with that person\nIs incredible and like we can look up every bit of like our value in an app or like we can deposit a check through an app now we can play a song through an African\nYou know like check on our kids in our in our dogs are are are babysitters at home because we have a camera set up in our house that we can check and\nThey don't know about I mean that kind of stuff is incredible like other than\nI guess like opening a door you know like everything else I could probably do it from my house via myself on like I can do the show\nOr my phone from my house and I could call in and do like face time in and do the show and it would sound like I'm at my house like I have a microphone that plugs up to my cell phone that sounds maybe not as good as the microphone I'm Talking to now but pretty ... pretty close\nAnd technology advancement and like the age of technology that we live in today is just a\nIt is such a change it's such a change and it's something you have to get used to it something that uh like I always say something wonderfully new like this is literally wonderfully new like this technology it's wonderful and some sports but then other times it can be evil\nLike other time I was listening to you all the time no telling what I'm going to say after I get off his microphone I Know what the FCC holds me to say\nBut I don't know I'm going to say somebody kept me off in traffic usually I just hope my hornell I don't really ever say anything I'm usually on the car on the phone most of the time and a car but I just\nJust remember as technology gets better at it like also gets more evil and I know it's like a weird thing to think about but it does like it also gets more intense more evil more uncomfortable like you\nYou you're on Snapchat and you're just sending a Snapchat like no matter what it is and you're just sending like\nThis um this encrypted picture a message to somebody maybe you know maybe you don't know like\nWhere do they hold all those pictures where they hold all those messages where do they hold all of their files where when\nYou say something to your Snapchat you're saving it\nNot to your phone but to this cloud right like where's that information going I'm not trying to make you into doomsday forever but I'm just saying not that that's a bad thing big Dave but I Am just saying it's just another thing you've got to think about when\nYou've got new technology new advances\nI mean like guys seriously in another like ten years emails won't even exist like\nLiving off ten years [noise]\nYou'll have a you'll look into the future big they find find me when I'm Talking about\nI'm the owner of the limousine involved in that crash that killed twenty people in that upstate New York incident over the weekend was wearing a ... a was a wire wearing informant into FBI terrorism stings\nOkay so this is from Fox News I don't know how greedy this kid's but isn't that kind of a weird you know what I mean like not like he has any relation to the crash of the limousine like nobody wants to know nobody wants to\nUm but the government credited or shut hot Hussein with rooting out a radical Muslims that mosque in New York City's new Berlin Albany\nAlso while he was working with the FBI is a well paid FBI snitch so he would wear a wire and then go in there or whose son is listed as the owner of the prestigious limousine which operated the two thousand or the prestigious prestigious limousine um\nThe name of the company that operated at two thousand and one Ford excursions stretch limo that crashed Saturday and I'm sure Harry New York\nAnd according to federal records which showed that the four vehicles had been taken out of circulation by the company due to inspection failures over the past twenty four months\nLooks like one was put back in\nThey do to inspection failures over the past twenty four months\nLooks like one was put back in\nA because it blew a stop sign and crashed into a park vehicle I parked vehicle and killed two people at the country store and also the Eighteen people now we're in that limousine\nAs well um but those to those four vehicles including that stretch ... excursion limousine was taken out of service because it felt inspection then the bus broke down and then there's always a customer\nOr to give them a a vehicle that failed inspection that sounds like a good idea\nThat's wild that is a good is a crazy crazy story on our list of records also addressed that ah Hussein um filed bankruptcy in Albany in two thousand three I don't really see how that has much to this but again\nThat crashes terrible twenty people in a in a mummy might as well be a bus and excursions massive but twenty people trying to do the right thing and not drink and drive drive or blows a stop sign and kills all of them have a\nHorrible horrible horrible horrible news\nI mean that is that's just something like you you can't even oh it it's tough to talk about it because like many times have you been in a limousine or like a party ... you know what I mean like you're going somewhere you're going up like a wedding or you're part of the wedding party and\nYou know what do you do you get in the bus and you have a good time hanging out with your friend you're not looking at where the buses going you're not hanging out of there with the job or making sure he's staying awake or whatever and we saw it a year ago in Alabama where we had a church bus rack you know and or ah or the\nField trip bus for that Texas high school band raccoon I ten in Montgomery or ah or mobile mobile area\nAnd like you're trying to do the right thing you're trying to make sure everybody has a good time but they don't have to worry about transportation and sometimes accidents happen accidents truly happened like sometimes things just happen\nBut these twenty people that got killed because of a of a two thousand and one excursion stretch limousine come on\nCome on tell me what actually happened there I'll tell you what happened is they didn't want to lose that business they put up another limousine there and then you can connect the dots you can connect the dots that you can find out what happened because that limousine was crap they knew it was crap and they wanted to keep that business they wanted to hold that business\nI'm not surprised and my dad does stink yeah it's terrible it's a horrible thing to think about\nBut\nWelcome to your America I just it stinks stinks things things horrible\nUm keep keep those people when you're all temporary I Wish I could go through each and every one of them but it it's just a thing of\nYou know just ... what would you do in this situation right I mean obviously you probably would have died if you were in that limo but if you're that family and you receive attack saying this thing's a piece of crap thinks thinks\nRight I mean what's the last minute so I guess we can get another one but twenty minutes later then there's a a collision an Eighteen of him passed away in a limo along with the two bystanders at the apple barrel country store\nLike Britain I don't know about you but like if you had a place where you you would want to be put to rest like right like\nWe always joke about there is like when I die put me like lay me somewhere you know what I mean like throw my ashes in the sea or whatever it is and it's like a funny thing about family does like my dad always says when I die I don't care what you do with me I'll be gone you know you'll have fun I've fought like by by like do whatever you want to he's like you\nFamily does like my dad always says when I die I don't care what you do with me I'll be gone you'll you'll have fun I've bought like by by like do whatever you want to\nMake me a box and throw me in the ground like don't buy me a casket like don't mind meanings and he's like just make it on a pond and throw it in the ground is like who's gonna what is it going I'm going to come back and see what you did not care\nAnd so we always joke around about that but you know these people went to the apple barrel country store and I guarantee you they didn't think it was their last day these people climbing that limited guarantee that and think it was their last day\nYou just never know how fast things can happen never never do so hooked people longer tell them how you feel more tell people you appreciate how much you appreciate them take time to to really and I know this is gonna sound cliche but to to smell the roses\nTake time to take a deep breath and realize what's going on around you appreciate those who help you out\nField for those who need help you know to take the time to you know not not just be a bystander a take the time to like be the person you know you should be because like you never know what's going to happen or how fast\nSomething is going to affect you or how fast something's gonna happen\nIt's just it's an ... very very sad story most from
