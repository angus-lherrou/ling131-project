I I don't know exactly who he is but he's in that whole Hollywood section I'd be very curious this is what he writes I'd be very curious to know the origin of today's full story that bomb was sent to the White House in the midst of all the actual bombs\nVery curious this is what he writes I'd be very curious to know the origin of today's full story that a bomb was sent to the white\nHouse in the midst of all the actual bombs sent that people Trump is called enemies of the state mega has radicalized more domestic terrorists than ISIS ever could\nOh my goodness that last line\nMega has radicalized mega make America great again has radicalized more domestic terrorists than ISIS ever could oh because we're we're constantly getting bombed Danny Boy we're constantly getting bombed here in the U.S by our own people\nWell maybe he's referring to ... now they're not necessarily bombing but they are causing the violence that's not Trump's supporters that people that are reacting to Trump\nSo if you're reacting to Trump we gotta blame Trump I'm I'm not sure I follow his his reasoning aren't the people who are reacting responsible for their own behavior you would think but it goes on Rob Reiner Donald Trump tells his coat\nFollow where protesters are paid for by Soros Hillary Clinton should be locked up John Brennan should lose his clearance CNN as the enemy of the ... of the people these are all the things that he's referring to that Trump has said and blaze and blamed Obama for everything there lives were all threatened you do\nThe math so that's Rob Reiner he's pretty sure that it all points back to a Donald Trump supporter\nSo um another one yes the care of yes the caravan is definitely full of MS Thirteen and Middle Eastern terrorists know the bombs sent a Clinton Obama CNN that are physically in the position of the secret service or not real I miss facts\nI'm not sure I follow that one but oh here's this one George to ... we know who he is from Star Trek call me crazy but that bomb intended for John Brennan he only appears now and then on CNN he's actually signed as a contributor at MSNBC guesses gives an indication of the bombers intelligence\nSo that that goes on and on we've even got Don Cheadle who I like he's a pretty good actor\nI'm the damn sure diabolical diabolical to send those devices to these particular people possibly killing them in an attempt to place the blame on right wing zealots so that um mid terms uh that Trump wait\nWhy would they do it again so he's confused and he thinks that it's not possible that the Dems could be doing a false flag\nIt goes on and on ... she weighed in and\nSaid words matter there's a couple of other people that have let me see if I have my audio here of the people that I recorded maybe not when they have to skip that for a second but yes there have been other people like Brennan who went on the air and that was quick to point it out and uh\nI Do know that the average American the average person understands this it's the lunacy on the on the left their unhinged and they're unable to use any reason\nTo to recognize this and say we've got to clamp down where we're headed towards chaos\nBut then you you would think that they would not want to go there but I I Do think they're so desperate for power there so their identity is so wrapped up in having power that the loss of it puts them in freefall emotionally mentally spiritually\nAnd they just do ... crazy stuff\nYet they have enough organization and devious and has to do things like this uh possibly I'm not saying I'm not saying a hundred percent I'm just saying it's starting to look really really shady and interesting at the way this whole thing is unfolding\nAnd whether or not it you know\nWhether or not on the left side will see so we're waiting right now for law enforcement to follow the trail and bring us a suspect we'll see what happens we got to take a break we'll be back to this is the Ford faction Andrea ties in for Ford brown be back in a minute\nBefore ... making radio greater Jim\nFor your for traction traditions of the original\nThe Ford faction making radio great again [noise]\nThey ... to ... stay traditions of the original state is barred apparel companies their overall scale casual clothing including shirts hats out aware of\nTies shores accessories more subtle stage show us I'm guessing you probably want to represent our great ... real hammer supply company has a great mix of shirts jacket and even more jobs for with the subtle yellow\nBirds that we all know and love\nTradition can be found at the summit in between movie fluids or injure Scott [noise]\nCan you sacrifice a day of your life to change someone else's life forever sign up to volunteer with the Cajun Navy at certain dot com that's s E R Q.

play a song that's a good song to play well I'm In my last bite a taco so that worked out well come into the Ford faction Andrea ties here\nWe've been talking about the whole ... story we can move on to some other ones in a minute here but I Do have some calls I Want to get through so hang on there I see Mike and Ryan and I want to talk to them and just a minute just a you know the latest update regarding the care of then\nOr is that the Trump mentioned it last night in his rally in Wisconsin and he said we're going to take care of it ... you know we'll send military so right now I'm I'm getting a report that the U.S has deployed eight hundred troops to the southern border\nAnd that is according to a zero hedge and CNN and I'm also seeing it on Fox News although it was really brief so I couldn't get any details\nSo that appears to be happening eight hundred troops headed to the southern border in advance of those um the migrant caravan which are also read about this morning I again it was ... very brief so I don't\nHave a lot of details or confirmation on it but\nThe the the quick brief part that I read would that they are slowing down and somewhat ... spending a little more there were seven thousand remember they kind of piqued out at seven thousand but you know traveling twenty miles on foot in the rain and heat and dust and\nAnd remember they kind of piqued out at seven thousand but you know traveling twenty miles on foot in the rain and heat and dust and whatever you know especially if you've got your kid in the stroller yeah that wears on you for a while after a while\nAnd so maybe the glamour and the glitz and got to him and they're like a\nMaybe we'll bow out or maybe I should say it this way maybe the glamour in glitz that the press was pushing\nBy being there and putting them on camera maybe the press has gotten tired they don't they don't normally lead the you know the beltway or the east coast or the west coast and had to Mexico so they got there and they're like yeah OK twenty four hours is about all I can take let's get back out of here\nAnd so now there is no press or cameras really getting up in their face and maybe there's been a lack of enthusiasm more a passion towards\nGoing another thousand miles\nOh so we'll see we'll see if they actually Peter out before they get to the U.S Mexico border Mike welcome to the Ford faction glad to have you\nGood afternoon thank you ma'am this thing on the uh the bombs that are that are have been sent out a in the past\nWhen you had all of the racial ... slurs and all of this stuff that showed up on campuses that turned out to be false or so uh yes\nYes uh how many of those were actually perpetrated\nBy uh the people themselves and or a liberal they love the liberal Mitt most all of them haven't they've been\nUh yeah in in in my memory I don't even know or cannot remember one person to actually turned out to be a legitimate\nA perpetrator or from the other side of you know serve it yeah right yeah they don't\nAlthough right up front it all the screaming was you know this is Trump better Rick and these conservative neo Nazi crazy folks are out here are doing all of this nasty stuff to us for authentic little whatever we are\nNo so I think we're going to find that this again is the same thing if they just do it the legitimacy a investigation and this thing uh\nI Would be highly shocked to find because let's face it most rednecks that are going to do something like this are they know what they're doing in one of those things would have blown up somewhere even if they were functional\nI ... you know or the or they even functional ... uh\nYeah I Know there's that argument that you can be sure it was a me by a liberal Democrat because it didn't work\nYeah [noise] do they do they have a new one hurt\nI mean have you heard were these actually legitimate functional devices are so far at this point\nNo I I what's trickling it and see what the initial explosive headline pardon the pun was that these were bombs that was the initial thing the press was ready to call it a bomb because it looks like a bomb and it's so typical of the press to make that\nAssumption based on looks in ... you know labels 'cause that's what they do\nBut now as more facts come in and the pictures come out and they're talking about what was inside of them it's like wait a second these had wires and glass and pipe and piping and stuff and powder but none of it was ever really truly connected to go off and ah people get really seriously\nDoubt you're going to find somebody of the conservative yeah let's go to that much trouble if they were going to do something like that you can bet your bottom dollar this thing would be functional\nYou're gonna put yourself\nYeah we'll go to that much trouble if they were going to do something like that you can bet your bottom dollar the thing with the ...\nIf you're going to put yourself on the line here uh being caught on her ... valence camera which are all over the place and all the other tracking methods that are out there if you're going to go to that trouble then yeah you probably want to make it hit its market that's if you're that hell bent on violence I'm\n... and you get if you get caught you're gone away for a while\nThat's right so um yeah what why why mess around with the surface if you're going to do it do it if you're not then don't it is it is just really bizarre out the more we talk about it the more bizarre it get thanks so much pollen and I appreciate I'm going to go to Ryan now\nOkay Thanks Mike I'm Sorry I hit the wrong button there Ryan hey welcome to the Fort faction\nOf history at all and he said that because it would not let in college for the need to take that it'd be a show of\nUnity\nOr we already have seen it kind of ramp up\nOver the past couple of ... well from the time that Trump was elected\nAll hell broke loose in these people's minds and they just went ballistic and they've not lead up they've taken some breeders\nEvery now and then and you know gone back to mom's basement and you know spend a couple of weekends you know recouping and then they're back out it again they're tracking down a Trump supporters mega ... holders and and doing all of that causing riots in Berkeley where they know they can get away with it because the\nPolice are unwilling to a really enforce the law and really clamp down on on on the behavior the the sluggish behavior so you know wherever\nThe laws are lax they will expand to push those laws to the limit and do whatever they can which in the case of Berkley is you know smash things and burned cars and a cost people and and cause chaos\nSo this all of this has been ramping up and now we we saw the Kavanaugh case that was like a Hail Mary but they also had other things there have been working into the mix leading up to November and I believe here's why I I Believe that when Obama was in office we know\nThat he weaponized the government agency\nBy filling it with partisan\nPeople\nThe top down creating policies that in sure that the people who were partisan would stay in place and rise to the top just by how promotions and and all of that is done he weaponize the IRS all you have to do is put the right people in the top of the\nThe line there like Eric Holder and Lois Lerner you know you don't have to say a whole lot\nYou don't have to give them instructions and say I want you to\nTo make this lean left with all the socialistic tendencies and desires and plans and policies that I have I Want you to you don't have to say that he just picks the right person who shares his ideology and they're going to naturally do it so he doesn't have to have that in writing\nAnd so we places all these people in agencies turns them over weaponized as them gets them to be\nAble to function hand in hand with the media was already in the tank\nYou've got yourself a cabal there you've got yourself almost a hundred percent control of the government and they were so close to wrapping that up with Hillary Clinton because I tell you what when Hillary Clinton would have got if she had gotten into office people would have disappeared documents would have disappeared and there would have been not a whiff\nOf anybody poking around on what she did with uranium and what she did with the Clinton Foundation and what she did with those emails and what Anthony wiener did with those emails and what who am I Am a dean did with those you\nKnow that would have all gone by the wayside and Andrew McCabe and Rod Rosenstein and Peter Struck would have all gotten their promotions\nAnd there were due reward for helping her out by way of not investigating her and turning the focus on Trump so they were so close to making this complete\nGrab for power within our system it was within their reach and they are fighting spitting mad\nTina is complete to grab for power within our system it was within their reach and they are fighting speeding mad that it was so close and then Trump came in and took it out and they don't know how or why\nBut they they ... they smelled that power\nAnd they're not and they were so close they can't give it up now believe me the gloves are off they're ready they're ready to rule they want to see if they can possibly scratch out something ... if if Trump is given a heavily dominant Republican Congress\nHis winning twenty sixteen will be reinforced again and they can't let that happen they're hoping they can claw that down\nAnd create something that limits that amount of winning for the Republicans because they're hoping to oh totally reverse this thing we know that in the in the first step is the midterms and then of course uh with Trump's reelection I don't know that's my theory Wallace what do you think welcome to the foreign faction\nAge about a moment that a lot of those is virtually a respect a lot of my color plans I Love 'em too much but I said it was allowed to say it again [noise] anything that Charlotte your head to the program is judge Jay Bybee useful\nAs a truly should would be a lot of good\n[laughter] that's not that's all imagery there [laughter] okay All right\nThanks Wallace whoa I Wonder what his experiences with goats I've heard they're pretty wild I've never encountered one up front hey Rogers hey Roger welcome to the foreign faction\nBut you're a ... or ... or first off the dark tower called rollercoaster a troll ... years covert ... implied that photo taken off to the ...\nAre you serious I\n... yeah\nThat that is upsetting to me because it was I did not catch it I could not understand what he was saying this has been a my problem ever since he ever called the first time I work here I Can't understand what he's saying so that surprises me in shocks me and I'm Glad I dumped him and I wish I'd done it sooner\nOr later it on the earth that's for sure but\nIt was sort of show on the bus but all of a computer and and more about your style of all\n... all that stuff I looked up the socialist party one time and I don't remember to amend the editor lift their lines and all and I talked to a Democrat or who you're sharp raw made and I enjoy the same yeah\nI actually probably not surprised but just reaffirmed [laughter] I mean what we've always suspected\nOf type ... computer look ... look up for the ... of their crawl shortly after the bills that Florida\nAll right thanks Roger I've I appreciate the call yeah that would be an interesting exercise we really are I think Kevin McCarthy was the one who said it I could be wrong but he ... he said recently is not really Republican Democrat anymore it's American versus socialism\nIt's what we believe is American democracy which is apart from socialism remember we were founded\nOn a representative republic we have a constitution we are not socialist we never were founded that way and the progress we've made for the past two centuries plus has never been attributed to socialism so for us to take\nProgress we've made for the past two centuries plus has never been attributed to socialism\nSo for us to take on socialism now is absolutely the most whack a doodle thing that we could do when we see before the evidence of what socialism has done in other countries ... a Venezuela\nOr Russia USSR Cuba\nAnd all these other ... countries that are applying it they are doing well they are at the top of the economic and freedom\nPile we are\nThis is the thing that bothers me about ah the people I don't fault the people who are leaving Central America\nI I'm not I don't have any please understand me I'm not being hateful I I don't have any feelings it just bothers me that when anybody leaves their country and says they want to come to the U.S for its benefits but they don't attribute the source of those benefits which is primarily God\nAnd Judeo Christian ethic\nBut if they don't even attributed to the government system that had guided us as a country for the past century that they can't even voice an agreement with that than\nWhat does this do you have why why would you do that because you're only going to carry

of the Ford faction tomorrow crate a Greg Keely will be in as the host and uh I'll be back sometime next week to uh not going away yet so in the meantime\nUh since it's up on the TV on Fox News I thought I'd just update you on this whole bomb suspicious packages I should say because they really really are not turning out to be bombs or they have all the\nMaterials that would make one think maybe they are at first glance but\nAnybody with any knowledge is looking into it and saying yeah none of them went off and none of them have all the connective elements that are needed for an actual bomb\nSo let me up to you on that uh there were two packages first of all that were found in Delaware or somewhere in association with\nA former vice president Joe Biden\nAnd investigators are saying now because they were so crudely made\nWhich is another way of saying they were incompetent they weren't actual bombs they they're so cruelly made that they have a just a lot of valuable information for one thing they're going to be swapping DNA from the stamps and they had a ton of stamps on him from the labels as well they can also um\nTake fingerprints from from the different elements and also trace the chemical markers that they find within those packages so there's three things right there that they are busily working on as we speak and I I don't think it'll be very\nHard or long for them to find someone on my question quite honestly if you want to go conspiratorial my question is when they find that person will he be alive that's my question because remember when the guy sent the rising up to the Pentagon and the White House and Ted Cruz's house or\nA ... it was just within three days max tops they had him in custody we don't hear a whole lot about him is why you did it it sounds and he\nI think he was former military sounds to me he was ... had a great courage within the navy cause a navy admiral was\nWas targeted I Can't say that I really followed up on it because once they caught him I was like well they caught him thank goodness just get rid of the guy I don't I really didn't care to know what his political issues are because we did was absolutely hideous it doesn't matter\nWhat his\nI mean it it could be informative in the sense that it it would just add to the growing list of evidence that the left is more unhinged than the right um but quite honestly when I heard about it I was just glad that he got caught because I mean that was serious stuff that rice seen\n'em I mean what just a fraction of a gram can kill so many people crazy so that's what's happening\nRight here with the with the suspicious packages and that whole story that's being played over and over and over again on the press and in the media because you know I find it very suspicious that CNN was included in that whole packages all the Democrat leaders and then CNN it was like\nWe're going to make a real obvious that this is dangerous potentially dangerous stuff we're going to make really on you you can't miss it we're going to have big labels big writing big stamps\nDangerous potentially dangerous stuff we're going to make really on you you can't miss it we're going to have big labels big writing big stamps and when you open it up is going to have all these wires and things that look really deadly so you can't miss it you can't you know for a fact that it's a\nA bomb but you don't really 'cause it's not\nUm and then ... ... to make lists really really a backer ... up and listen to CNN because then we know we'll have twenty four hour coverage for the next seven days on this because you make them a victim like Jim Acosta and all those people that CNN if you make them a victim or target or even give the a whiff\nOf doing that they will assume the mantle of being\nA victim number one and they'll play with it for as long as they need to so that was a clearly a strategy on the part of whoever said those packages if I Want to make sure this gets out in the press got it includes CNN\n'cause they're all anti Trump all the time here's something else that developed in Charlotte North Carolina as you know some of these states are involved in early voting I Am so glad that Alabama doesn't do it I Know that it can be troublesome to get out within one day\nHey well well well well [laughter]\nOr a faction really got you into the studio Andre I look I
