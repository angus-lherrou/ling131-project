or radio or faction [noise]\n\nRussell feeds Jessica Ford faction on a friday\nAnd the one o'clock hour begins and make that distinction because then it begins\nWith a drastically different emotions for me than just one hour ago Jessica oh wow really\nAnd I\nI didn't have this written down this is just this I'm just telling you how I feel organic organic here's what I mean we had callers and I can't remember which specifically said this is just the kind of person who calls it as they see it I think it might have been Jim saying that and\nI Want to do the same but oftentimes the\nBest I can do is just tell you how I'm feeling what my gut tells me I don't know if my guts right or wrong or even knows but in the moment what am I feeling\nSome on the show yesterday I was telling you that I felt that there was going to be one or two Republicans who are maybe going to surprise us with a no we had some swing votes out there but I just thought\nSomeone was going to have their Ted Cruz moment you remember at the convention two years ago when everybody is offering praise for Trump as he accepts the nomination from the Republican Party\nTed Cruz takes the stage he wanted to be different things and vote your conscience you didn't they vote for Trump he said vote your conscience got booed off stage John McCain had indicated he was going to vote for the repeal of Obamacare until he didn't he gave the famous thumbs down killing the repeal effort\nOf Obamacare we spend a lot of time on this yesterday those were my thoughts of yesterday of the victory lap and I was hearing by Republicans I felt was premature\nLet's go back to just one hour ago our show began ... an hour ago and I was telling you how to geek up it felt like a game day felt like the super bowl I wasn't even really caring about the historic nature of it as much as that was just excited by all of the energy right we talked about that for twenty minutes\nThen comes a word that an hour from now Susan Collins will announce which way she's going to vote\n\nIt's hard to make predictions because either go your way or they don't write I don't know and you can laugh an hour from now if I get it wrong I'm telling you right now and one of the five in the afternoon I think an hour from now she tells us She's going to vote no\nI think there's very well could all come crashing down in an hour and whatever goofy energy I was feeling an hour ago and now we're real nervous is not for the sake of the show not saying for the sake of a segment and our from go an hour ago were laughing about it if you're so gravy\nKeep the craziness going my gut tells me\nAn hour from now it could all fall apart senator Collins has lunch with a leader Mitch McConnell I don't know that you'd having lunch with him to say I'm voting yes right I think she might\nBe saying you can't count on me\nWell and I thought it was kinda strange that she came out and said she was going to make a statement today on the on the head of the vote and what's the purpose of that and I don't understand if you vote yes to go ahead and move forward to have the vote then why hold a press conference to say which way you're going to vote\nHead of the vote and what's the purpose of that and I don't understand if you vote yes to go ahead and move forward to have the vote then why hold a press conference to say which way you're going to vote sure because it would seem if she's going to come out and say because I'm battled with those myself it would seem if she was going to come out today and say I'm voting no well why did you vote yes to\nGo had to have a vote tomorrow yeah I mean that doesn't make any sense but then again if you're going to come out and say she's voting yes what's the point of telling us that right\nAnd I think you can have a yes vote to let's get to the vote was kind of wrap this up what your final answer who wants to be a millionaire style of\nVoting yes to move the final vote to me I don't necessarily think is yes I Will vote for this person I think it's just let's get to an already have enough information right uh made my decision\nAn hour from now you can call in and say your big dummy we knew it was fine and the victory lap can continue a head of the vote tomorrow\nBut sitting here right now my only emotion is I don't think there's going to happen\nWell there's one or two trains have gone up had it's either a she's going to go hat and lay out her her reasons why she's voting no when she wants to go ahead and clear the deck and make sure she saves data or it could be the exact opposite it could be that she's nervous about her yes vote and she wants to make sure everybody knows why she's voting yes okay so she can walk away with the clerical yeah\nAnd that may be I did see a headline or maybe it was a an opinion piece of at the FBI didn't clear Kavanaugh as much as it allowed for Republicans to have clear conscience is when they vote for him for confirmation happy to get your thoughts that's all that's all we have here um\nIt's you know we're not professional prognosticators were just sharing our thoughts we all read we all watch we all listened and we

[laughter] gosh can you imagine\nAs good a buddy always good to speak with you I Do appreciate it two oh five nine four one one on one one toll free one eight six six by by one Ninety nine thirty three\nVoting today fifty one forty nine to advance the cabin on nomination Jeff Flake Susan Collins voting yes to move forward the final vote on Kavanaugh tomorrow as the Democratic Senator Joe Manchin voting yes eight and no from Republican senator of Alaska Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins\nOf Maine I Believe it's Maine right or will be offering her\nHer plans on her vote for tomorrow I'm nervous I think next hour we're going to find out that she voting no when Jessica I Do like\nThe um kind of the different scenarios you laid out there maybe she doesn't know or maybe this is her way of saying I'm voting yes\nBut has to have me too I'm Still with you or I don't appreciate how Dr Ford has been treated I don't like that she's been ridiculed or whatever this is not a complete and total endorsement of Brett Kavanaugh himself but they have enough information to vote yes so maybe this is her trying to save face however she chooses to vote\nIt would make sense if she did that I mean because that's kinda what they do they're all about protecting themselves and their image\nYeah meantime a President Trump continues to tweet I Can't wait to get his reaction later today to see what he has to say he did call the protesters\n\n\n\n\nVote to do that you're you're saying let's continue on I don't know what she thought could be achieved by continuing debate well butter allegations could come for I guess ... but he the here's what she said after it did the woman's all over the place like she's just a\nDeer in headlights going you know between the the dotted line like just both sides yeah because she said afterwards to reporters basically indicating\nI did vote no for on this cloture vote but that doesn't mean now I Will vote no against him\nBecause she said afterwards to reporters basically indicating I did vote no for on this cloture vote but that doesn't mean now I Will vote no against him\nWell yeah I Know the call instead of the same thing about her yes vote so it's a weird thing is is almost it feels like to me and maybe I'm just fantasizing you've got these two women\nAnd it's like they're trading off votes like I'll vote no for cloture you vote yes then when it comes to the real vote you vote no and also yeah all switch or it will do a switch through and that'll just show how conflict we are and how we had to wrestle this through and we weren't quite sure I don't know I had\nHeard is that the agreement was they're going to go in the same direction of let's agree yes or no that we vote the same way so there's not one person standing out as a sore thumb right but rather be a group of people flipped out together or stood strong\nRight so I I'm not quite sure what the reasoning all is in that but it just struck it struck me as interesting because Murkowski and Collins tend to work together there you know Bob the twins and um and Murkowski said no calling said yes let's vote it's through let's get it to a final vote and then um and then we're counts he's like yeah\nI'm not a hundred percent in ... not so I don't know what these girls are plotting honestly it's kinda crazy this\nConversation today conversation yesterday and even last friday isn't always breaking down what happened but really trying to\nPredict what might happen I've been talking on the shows a day that my emotions are kind of all over the place at as the show began at twelve hours pretty excited just the whole spectacle of at all\nThen at one o'clock when the news came of here's the time two o'clock hour it'd be three eastern but two o'clock for us when Susan Collins makes known her plans on how she'll vote I suddenly got nervous have you Andre ... have your emotions kind of gone up and down here and there are you pretty\nMuch locked in however you feel about things\nIt's really much it's just a a wait and see hold my breath I'm In hold my breath mode and I'm just holding my breath not letting the emotions come one way or the other right now I they're they're not going to vote until four o'clock tomorrow because they have to wait thirty hours\nAnd I calculated that they completed their vote right before Scott and came on so he comes in at ten\nSo you twenty four hours of ten AM and then you had six and it's going to be around for pm that the vote\nAnd anything can happen I mean I some there was one point where when Collins said she would vote\nYou know vote for cloture but that didn't guarantee that you would vote yes\nFor the final confirmation it sounded to me like she was just simply buying time like I'm going to vote yes here but don't assume anything because I Need to get back to my office [laughter] clearly without getting a costs to buy a myriad of screaming women blocking me in the elevator and you know making me feel bad do you\nThink that they would get interest in terms of the protesters and the pressure from the public and people literally screaming in your face I Know that this has historical and that maybe we they haven't seen that level of protest you know first hand\nBut but at a certain point it as as many years of some of these senators have been in place you'd think they kind of be used to the public pressure and be able to navigate through that without it you know knock on the back and forth I mean it it kind of surprises me that they're not a a little bit more accustomed to that\nYou would think that they would be Jessica but at the same time think about how often they skate through on doing things with their little shallow surface explanations right and nobody calls in to the carpet on it for example who's a costing Doug Jones right now\nBecause Doug Jones gave the most shallow answer about why he voted no on her\nSimple who's a costing Doug Jones right now\nBecause Doug Jones gave the most shallow answer about why he voted no on her and um it it's in raging when you think about it when the the a majority of people here in the ... in Alabama want Kavanaugh\nAnd want him to vote for Kavanaugh and he's a senator representing us and he's voted no so how you know nobody chasing him down roughly\nWhat what did he say you want to give a direct quote but just his his reasoning for did he\nOh well see I happen to have an A. P. our area and let her go to their yeah let me just whip it out\nThere it is yeah I ... a piece story Jones is saying you know what this is what makes me nauseous really he says there's been unprecedented ugliness this is true okay on both sides\nAnd I just I'm Sorry I I fled disagree I'd like to know the ugliness started with dirty Diane and her little letter whipped out from wherever she was stashing it and and the ... the the ugliness started with dirty died in and it went on with Spartacus and Kamala Harris and\nYou know um what's his name\nWas it was the nickname for um ... the Rosen guy who claims he's Vietnam I Can't oh I Know you're talking about hung dang dang [laughter]\nFrom Vietnam right okay All right anyways it just kept going and going and rolling through on the Democrats' side I beg to differ senator Jones who was ugly on the Republican side yeah who was ugly I Know\nIt is strange that Democrats in this situation seem to be able to say whatever they want and any pushback is seen as being mean yeah you know what I mean that you can say all manner of things about Brett Kavanaugh the man and then when he gets heated\nI get bloated ... look out why can't you just sit there are a lot of ... and just smile about it\nAnd wondering what kind of man would sit there and in the face of having his family ripped apart you know I mean think about the ah the conflict and and the pressure that must cause inside his home I mean just as from his wife and his kids and how devastating these accusations have to be I'm sure they know they're not true but still it's\nIt's going to have an effect on your family and then you put him in that situation\nAnd you put them in before the the very people that have orchestrated all this and you expect him to to be a completely perfect human being that's ridiculous\nAnd yes and then the act\nAct with this sanctimonious a judgmental spirit\nLike ooh I don't know that temperament oh it might flare up in the middle of a courtroom he might throw his eyes well\nYou know what they were saying to their own MSNBC there were just like you know I just don't I don't know you know this was like a job interview and and he just did not perform well and I thought how many times during the job interview somebody asked you if you're a gang rape is literally never happened to me right\nOh I Know right now and the thing is if anybody on any given day released video or some sort of undercover coverage of current day senators and what they do\nWhen they're off camera and they're not any does come on are you kidding me I mean ... ... yes believe me it it would come around real quick and they\nThey would be caught for the hypocrites that they are\nAndrea ties we don't want an ambush you but when we come back we're going to embrace you is it about that Halloween\n[laughter] listening yes I years are and I forgot to bring that up and what'd you call her dirty\nDiane or [laughter] you know it is between dirty day in and you know Dr fraud or I mean Christine for oh yeah yeah you see I'm here's what I'm thinking ... easy enough to get a blonde wig and and\nFraud a mean Christine for oh yeah yeah you see I'm here's what I'm thinking ... easy enough to get a blonde wig in a in a suit and then just have one of those really super big big cans and wrap it was a cover that says one beer\nWN [laughter] like it's a brand name one beer alright and goofy glasses and some frequent flyer miles tucked in and sticking out of your pocket and oh that'd be fun send them to trim wires hotel you my my lie detector wires hooked up to me I'm so afraid just because he's telling the truth I Know and I know\nI Know but I just think here's a thing as a female and and I mean again I I'm kind of going on here but I Would just send the thing that if you were in a situation where you had been you know attempted rape or a year and that type of situation\nThat you would go to the authorities I mean I Would you know and and since she didn't take that for their statute of limitations in place here so she she still had that open door to go to the police and say hey I'd like to you know you ought to investigate this if if you were truly wanting someone to have to answer for what they did you\nI Would think that that would be the greatest stuff you could take was to go to your local authorities and and do it there and not put it out\nI could even appreciate the fact that she thought he shouldn't hold that place in the Supreme Court I can appreciate that if if that had really happened\nBut don't you think you should seek justice in the form of going through the proper route and then they even said well you know you need to file charges and she just didn't and that makes me think that she didn't fall charges because you can get in trouble for falling a false police report\n[noise] yes and that was the same thing that came up between you and me Russell remember that why is a person who has a doctorate\nNot going through the proper channels the normal channels the logical channels for how you deal with something if you feel it's worthy of attention by law enforcement or need even be brought to the Senate you still want to ... you know establish it with law enforcement there is actually a crime\nAnd it's much like the Roy Moore thing it's like Roy Moore didn't all of a sudden
