I'm not a hundred percent short and that's that's my take on yeah I'm I'm really ambivalent he was there was there\nHe um [noise] you know he he was ... yeah and I guess that's what you know\nKind of does his thing yeah it's it's kinda hard to make sense of of all that he says in in what that means because he's such an enigma and he does his own thing like we don't really have a a frame of reference he just kind of does and says his own thing which I applaud at least he's willing to do that\nWell it's a lot like Trump maybe but in a different arena that unpredictability you just never know where his mind going and what it's going to bring up\nI think with Trump at least as president we have a little more\nIdea where he's going to go because he's in an agenda mode right and he's signaled what his agenda is I'm In that and that's a little more I don't know I take more comfort in that now than I did your yeah the when he was elected because you're like what does he really but she was ...\nAnd that's a little more I don't know I take more comfort in that now than I did your yeah when he was elected because you're like what is he really ... but he was I don't really follow him so I\nI don't know I mean he does seem unpredictable I seem to have that same level of ego maybe that Trump\nUm hajj and so they probably get along great\nIt is interesting the the atmosphere that we've reached politically where politics and pop culture collide in a way that they're almost indistinguishable from one another\nYou got Trump junior and Michael ... challenging one another to an M M A fighter like mixed martial arts and part of me thinks they're being silly but then just as easily it can be for real you know\nYou never know what part of the WWE throwing down of the uh the guy in charge of that I Can't remember right like McMahon yeah I mean\nIt's funny to think that I and I know he didn't do so when he was as president but you think of a\nObama slow jamming the news with Fallon or doing between two ferns with Gallup and access and before that you had and that was that was well it was president sure and I was thinking about um Bill Clinton on the saxophone on Arsenio Hall ... years ago\nUm but yeah it's just I I was watching the news and we talked about Trump just about every time we're together Andrea but just seeing him it's not that I actively dislike it I just can't believe he's our president it's just wild and not just that we\nI guess I keep waiting I keep waiting to wake up you know what I mean the end it's not because I'm Upset with anything he's done it's just I cannot believe we reached a place where Donald Trump is president of our country I just it's it feels new to me it's almost unbelievable even though we're two years and\nWhile you know what amazes me really\n\n[noise]\nYou want to do just with your house to address and joined us every Saturday morning we got a great show is going to be a lot of good information on the phone from riffing through foundation truly basements across races whatever's affected your homes or if you knew the answers to show them how does it mean to you know every Saturday morning tend to\nRun your own superstition woman's job would you um [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nEverybody to join us on friday night from from a dog on the best in high school football [noise]\nWe'll have special gets coaches interviews and take your calls thing is you're ready for college for the call center\nRight here on your high school football league and all of Alabama [noise]\nYou know\n\nWith with the wandering I only because I'm not sure which one to look at and you you don't want to chase\nThe moving one but part of me wants to only because I Want to know where it's going if you've got the one that wanders get it almost work to your advantage if you had that because think of like you can see more than the average person in terms of just you know field\nOne that wanders get it almost work to your advantage if you had that because I think of like you can see more than the average person in terms of just you know field\nOf vision ... going on a road trip see in the world that's what I'm saying you don't even someone out the window you just you're always looking out the window like the panoramic feature on your iPhone I think this is a very undiscovered advantage\nI mean to be talked about well I think we don't have enough lazy I've in college football held a lazy I I thought the lazy I was when it just was lays\nYou know you have\nYour attention here in Denver\n[noise]\nAll right it is the hometown store here at ... I weigh two\nEighty hope you'll come by they've got a handful of locations and we would love\nCertainly love to see you Russell be Andrea ties here as well we're having some fun and we would they get cut off their from Minnesota is pick right back up ... big Dave uh in Studio ... jak here on location Brittany with us as well and [noise] um\nAnd the wind and the when the weather's good I mean I take it because it felt like summer\nWas going to go all the way so Thanksgiving I thought we were never going to go down\nI Know I saw a headline a weather headline that we've gone like a hundred and sixty days without temperatures heading down to this point okay you know since the beginning of summer yeah so it's been a long\nStretch it was kind of nice to wake up this morning it'd be a little chilly I'm not much of a jacket guys so it can be snowing and still probably wouldn't wear a jacket but I did feel good knowing that that the sun would rise\nAnd the sun was set and I would not sweat one time today which has not been said probably since April [laughter] not in Alabama at the that is so we we did get cut off a little bit but we were talking um\n[noise] ... yeah the the clash of politics and pop culture another kind of blend together and they're almost woven together I don't know how we can separate one from another\nRight but I guess at least for me uh the reaction of the media has been more appalling and shocking uh I mean do these people forget that are beyond say and Jaycee walk the halls of the White House do right they're acting like ... lost his mind\nAnd uh I don't know that he's any different than he was you know three years ago he just became politically outed himself and that's all the different ... and it's\nInteresting and I do want to be careful not to attach myself to ... to much politically I appreciated his\nConfidence to speak his mind but remember back in the time of Katrina ten eleven years ago he said George W. Bush doesn't care about black people because if we let him do that was him complaining that you didn't do enough to protect\nThe people of New Orleans I get either before Katrina or after Katrina and he's the one who's rushed up on stage for these awards ceremonies and been upset because Taylor Swift right or I\nDo remember that yeah you have the aged her in a sort of self there\nYeah I don't really I Would never ascribed to whatever ... maybe pushing yeah but the fact that he is breaking from the monolith of the liberal left in Hollywood and in the music industry and and in the in the media\nHe's breaking away he's thinking for himself I applaud that the problem is the interesting part is watch everybody else just ah go into these reactions he's\nA staff to make ... reactions of him separating himself from them and and and do it\nIn part as watch everybody else just ah go into these reactions he's\nA staff make right reactions of him separating himself from them and and in doing so they feel the need to you know basically do what Trump does and character assassinate Hitler going crazy [laughter] and like you know it gets attacked by the Washington or New York times the failing\nNew York right right it is funny how he\nCan be seen as an artistic visionary and now he suffered some\nMental illness as some sort of\nIntervention and we got to take Kanye and they're making fun of him\nAnd yeah it's okay to you know a straddle that line between uh insanity and artistic like as long as it doesn't get political sure they'll let you go wherever you want to go on that right but um yeah you can go into religion and do all sorts of crazy stuff all in the name of artistic [laughter]\nAll right but don't go to the light and uh it is interesting how\nI think sometimes as people and that Republicans are just people in general we\nOn some level seemed to be made and nervous by people who think for themselves but don't we don't need that right to somebody who they just see it's a little differently they live at I get a friendly\nBecause she she dared to talk about this uh to these reporters and and a media outlets so uh\n[noise] so does now does our history as an elementary school child is it protected like OSHA I mean is it are they the sort of\nAbout us off limits talent some cute stories about the kid when he was eight years old do I care I don't care if she violated his his privacy argue against it what do you say\nWell I think it's just petty and silly and they're trying to drum up some sort of insidious implication from that that you know he's weird and so the White House has weird people in there and so you should be even more afraid than we've already told you to be [noise] um yeah I you know my question is\nIf they're going to catch up with the teacher and suspend her which the spokeswoman said they are concerned about ... release of student information including allegations that the release may not have complied with the political laws and district ... okay so there you go there's the fish will\nDo that they're trying to cover their own high yeah yeah I mean I get it I guess it does seem it seems a little silly so not knowing the legality of it\nAnd you have someone high profile whether it's President Trump for someone who works for him could be a celebrity it seems pretty standard to say who knew him before you know he's he's this person now she's this person now as a grown a person of influence as an adult all wonder what they were like as a kid\nAnd if you're gonna find their third grade teacher they got a funny story here or\nThere that's good enough right I mean it's I'm not going to change my vote\nFor or against whether he glue are now and he was nine years old\nRight I agree uh I think every average normal American will look at it that when they have a laugh but where where's the accountability I guess my question is where the accountability for the people actually published this and made it a try to make it look like it's a legitimate story\nAnd I didn't need accountability and may we chuckle if click bait it'd be funny I like um I'm I'm I'm if\nI'm appalled you're not appalled reporting on it\nBecause this woman got by the way let me\nRemind you that uh Fisk happens to be a registered Democrat and she supports causes associated with liberals according to gr Facebook account\nSo yeah there is not that political there [laughter]\nThat political Amy as political arguments political or not it's\nFunny if let's see let's say someone wanted to get the goods on you Andrea ties was there a particular teacher or Sunday school teacher whether somebody\nFrom your childhood who might have some stories that would surprise us [noise] um gosh I don't\nKnow I probably [laughter] um my my family member that there'll be there'll be it would be the first to go to I think of my\nScience teacher and I have a hard time remember I remember who she is she was ... cook I Can't remember if she was my eighth grade science will be my last year in middle school where she was ninth grade science first year of high school\nBut she's in that early ... she's in that early on your high school years and it was run around the time that I decided I wanted to figure out my sense of humor that I went from a pretty quiet\nCompliant kid church\nTo figure out my sense of humor and I went from a pretty quiet compliant kid churchgoing kid didn't get in trouble at home and\nI never got into ugly trouble at school but it was it was kind of that first time runs out I was going to be the funny kid I was going to try to be at\nLeast oh are you saying establishing or expand I\nWould say establish I'll Try to establish\nIt because I wasn't particularly funny then I'm not certain about that funny now but that was the first like year part of my teenage life like I'm going to try there's a particular girl in my class I wanted to make her laugh and so I didn't I care what ms cook did to me [laughter]\nI said what he said this is science so I'm I'm anticipating that involves formaldehyde\nIn a frog for ... I Would like to say so no I don't really get into crazy trouble it was simply I was if there was gonna be a kid who got sent to the hallway\nFor speaking out of turn for making too many jokes for not waiting till he was called that would've been me at that time a column saying no there there were no pranks involved nobody got their cells burned by a Bunsen burner or anything like\nThat what was his teacher I have to say about your brother that I was\nA a might it\nMight have been annoying you know [laughter]\nThat would be the only person I think she'd be the first teacher to say that I think they she was the first of many who might follow\nWell it's clear you're going to have to go back and reach out to her and and have her sign a nondisclosure agreement I think you know take me down I think\nIt would happen uh it's it's no good here All right let's take a quick break shall we we got a big day in ... control Jessica Andrew shown up here\nAt ... ... is here with me and we're going to be joined by a member of progress bank here in the two o'clock hour it's gonna be fun they got some good things going on with their mortgages that you need to know about\nA a good time for real estate whether you're looking to buy or refinance ...

today but a great opportunity as you tell me there'll be people listening who like hey I heard the name but I'm not familiar\nPerfect Russell you're exactly right many people you mentioned progress progress to\nProgress has new to Birmingham they actually are here as a result of a purchase I made last year with first partners by okay and uh actually I was part of what's the what's the name change first partners has actually south Citibank started vis Davia hills Alabama in two thousand seven so\nUh but as as a result the merger progress has actually out of Huntsville their general bank\nA lower ... assets and we have a seven locations in Alabama too in Birmingham winters are highlands office one of the state of your branch and we have two and a Florida ones in Dustin once in a beach where Shirley Justin's open but in the in the beaches of this morning not NATO and so\nAnyway well here the course of our time Steve I\nInvite you to speak to me in the the most basic terms 'cause I have a couple of questions about when it comes to choosing a bank and maybe we'll talk mortgages a little bit and that you're not going to if you make it super sample that's not a bad thing that's a good thing it's probably good to talk with when it comes to choosing a bank we can go with like a\nSuper big national bank or local bank what are the differences and and what are some of the\nUh the the valuable sides of going with the more local but well I think\nWhen you boil it down and comes back to people were not a big bank here obviously we\nI think we have maybe a twenty five or thirty people in the Birmingham area so it's not large but a lot of people like the fact that they get then we get to know them really well ah people a lot of people have been around a long time even though we're just new to the ... they do a lot of folks and um\nI think people look at it because we can give the services that they may not get it a large institution right and a lot of times people will come in and so I'm just tired of wherever that may be for different reasons and uh a rival to hopefully capitalize on that and really make them feel welcome and uh\nYou know that they're that they're part of of a group that cares about them and their success\nAnd I apologize for this yellow jacket that's wanting it to make yourself feel welcome 'em when we talk about people when it comes to our money and these\nSo and I apologize for this yellow jacket that's wanting it to make yourself feel welcome 'em when we talk about people when it comes to our money and these big decisions I mean money's an important part of our lives whether we like guys on um do you really have the flexibility does it help when you know your customers that come into play\nIt sure does a because all the decisions are local here and uh we had the ability to depend upon you know if it's somebody already banks were there ... there are new to the bank and what they're trying to do that we have the capabilities to be I Would say much more flexible than a than a than a big box player\nThat's uh that's good and you think about it you know whether it's you're checking your savings it could be credit cards I presume you get into investments and you get into mortgages\nIt's just all these ... these big areas of our life and um I think some of us maybe art in banks simply from ... you know we chose a bank and ... and it got up by somebody and it got by by somebody and now we're a part of a banking institution we ourselves actually didn't choose it just kinda got gobbled up\nHow do you encourage people to make the jump from a bank that they just kind of ended up with the progress and that's a great\nPoint because personally I was at the south press by wishing as it was a big bank headquarter out to Birmingham and then it got purchased by what Coby embracing it went to Wells Fargo\nIn the market we've been in with house process that you know I saw the great recession overweight nine ten where they kind of depth but they've all come back and Birmingham has been a great example I think we've been stronger than ever and uh\nBut that being said I I mean I was just talking with a young person the other day I mean what they're paying rent\nIf they can just get into the home yeah the payment oftentimes is maybe just slightly equal or slightly above so\nAnd and it gives them a chance to set of being there five ten years that you could build some equity and that may not be there forever home right but it can help position them maybe five ten years down the road when they do move to the next one to have some equity versus just feel like they're kind of\nI mean I Know rents a big deal a lot of people they can't they just can't get into home yeah but I think generally that I Would say that homeownership is still a great thing if you can uh uh participate in\nSome of the tightening of restrictions in the aftermath of the economic collapse of ten years ago have any of those been lessened is it easier maybe to get into a home now than it might have been seven years ago or is it still tight as their opportunities out there\nI think it's still pretty tight yeah I Know I hear about a President Trump relax and regulations on the corporate side I trust that some kind of falling down to the mortgage side and the bank side and general ...\nBecause it's tough for smaller banks especially not that it's easy for the big bang again because it's not but yeah I think ah the regulations though I mean\nFifteen Years ago you could have stated in income and you could just\nLike I say he's about you press easy but\nIt's not like that you had to prove it all out and you you know from having a great credit score but asset your income and and they're still pretty much that day you know that white a day now you know obviously some lenders may blacks that but um we\nWe're we're pretty tight and I think most people are today it seems to me that is where a a local bank really helped write that you have someone who is working on your behalf whereas if it's a big national bank maybe that's just working in volume if you're not an obvious candidates you know hate about where you go somewhere else you're\nOut on a ... step in because I'll you know I\nI help people from the very start to the finish you know how I got to just do a little bit in front of an and forget about it yeah of course that's probably true of most people I mean you have to be engaged is a is a process is not easy right I think some people want it to be easier than it is sure well I've already giving you that well now we need\nHad one the other day a few need bank statements need to four months all pages it can't be five or six or ... even though the six pages or when you use to balance your regular you gotta have it doesn't matter\nSo you know ... you know still a lot of that but that's what I Do and try to help\nPeople you know uh get that information in in a timely fashion and make it where we can make a good turn time say thirty days or less we've been\nTalking here with a Steve a little from progress bank and I want to talk if I can about just Steve demand about because what you say is it just speaks to my heart 'cause I Am that guy and he will tell me they is it the documents yesterday and\nAnd about just Steve demand it back because what you say is just it just speaks to my heart because I Am that guy he will tell me these are the documents yeah and I get I get in the ballpark there's so much of my life is in the ballpark it's close enough to have all these ... and I feel so back here and I know you're right but I'm that guy it's close enough\nWell I mean there's a sign of a red at the anyway a guy said you know you remember your parents growing up and they said well why do I need to do that because I said so right\nYeah look this has to do this and you can't be close and aggravated right all the pay is not not one or two or is that the right and it and it does frustrate people in times\nThings or the last minute and that's typical but are can be typical but you know if you if you get on the front and there's always gonna be something but hopefully just her miners get but you're exactly right is\nIt that way to say it's not\nNot as a representative of the bank just you in life have you always been detail oriented this way the come naturally to you or you you had to learn the discipline\nWhen I Need I Need help and help help me [laughter]\nI'm the first child I wanted I got two brothers that was the first child more responsible okay I don't know about detail now my wife very detailed and all that she's a tech person or has been in her past life but uh but you know probably just my nature I guess you know I've been in the\nSort of an insurance ... actually I tend to insurance side and kind of morphed into banks side and I have my security ... and my insurance uh those licenses he'll use that to see so now they're mortgages which doesn't have anything to do with that so much in a way but yeah that's maybe been part of my baby\nIn a row in the documents and this has the right and this has the right and for me so much of my life in my career has been\nI guess more by feel then exact you know of what I eat in hospitality or an odd caster ministry you know it's and that's it has its areas but they're not necessarily the precision yes exactly\nRight cause this is pretty much like either lung condition early here's\nThe conditions and you know you gotta do this I mean there's some but I'll tell my bars are Clyde say look this doesn't make any sense but look just do it you get to it and they just do a show or in any way that's good let's give you an opportunity to let those who are listening\nTo our conversation and you've been a delight thank you for having here uh what's the best place this the best way for them to to reach you to learn more about progress bank if they're if they're interested in the mortgage can they contact you directly\nYeah my direct well so I give up my number here welcome anyway however you want to do that I'm at the highlands\nLocation we have to in Birmingham and that's our Birmingham corporate office okay and moderate number seven oh five one six six eight ... sixty eight lay the general number seven five Fifteen hundred to the bank\nOf course you can Google that or make sure that's the correct one yeah but uh you know we were right there and I'll be glad to talk with anybody in in any way I can almost\nGreat so the survey the office right here highlands um and then we've got seven locations in Alabama's that rise up and the zoo and Florida one didn't make it out so good at her I ain't got\nTo hear and the guts to see what's that may five and by Huntsville Madison Florence\nDecatur ... anyway I mean we've got a lot of location as good as super station we reached Birmingham in up in the hospital so just a what a what a great fit progress bank is and again we've had time with some of these hometown tours we just get out in the community as much as as your bank does\nAnd uh it's good and you know we talk about money\nWe talk about home ownership and it's a valuable asset whether you're looking to buy refinance the one that you have\nAnd uh it's good and you know we talk about money\nWe talk about home ownership and it's a valuable asset whether you're looking to buy refinance the one that you have it's just such a big part of who we are I think all of our memories oftentimes\nTraced back to home and family and where we were and yeah we just you can't really remove ourselves fan and we shouldn't yeah I don't think now is Alabama home for you to live elsewhere\nNo actually I grew up in Kansas I was born actually in Las Vegas how we got nice and my dad was a pilot and the Korean War Sudafed his or her just turned ... is still with us my mom's not but uh we had a big birthday celebration for him but I was born in Vegas actually on males Airforce base okay moved to Huston Kansas\nEarly on for a couple of years and we moved to Wichita to high school there in school in Springfield, Missouri Drury college which is what like Birmingham so okay Audrey [laughter] ah so it's like that but I've been in Birmingham for gosh thirty I'd say thirty seven\nHundred I feel like it's home yeah think after thirty semi oh yeah yeah it's great\nI've kind of bounce back and forth from Birmingham to Atlanta back to Birmingham couple of different times but uh so I was born and raised the George Forman Birmingham is home it just it's just like\nGun ... I used to kill people I'm On my way since I was doing the big are going to the keys\nBut yeah I think I'll start you know you're right that's a good idea but they're going to ever saying with the hurricanes of an okay and\nUm but now it's kind of wine with the hurricane seeing a place a lot of as a vacation I Know we love el shores and Orange Beach but man Panama City Destin ash met so many numbers there\nWe got friends in Mexico beach to yeah God trying to sell this house it may not be there right now one of our bank partners I just yesterday said that she had friends just a month ago moved to Mexico be hall so and they ... they went to mobile I don't think yesterday I couldn't get back in yet you know\nNot good for any of those people just pray for them and yeah\nAnd we talk about you know being sometimes underwater with your mortgage your house your look quite literally was Eddie being your ZIP Code being underwater yeah it really is a crazy Steve thank you for taking time with the ... it's been fun to see an old all with the progress bank my progress bank dot com\nAnd uh if you're looking for a mortgage if you look into by looking to refinance Steve it's got to talk with a progress bank one of our\nPrompt sponsors here of the home town tour which continues on superstation one on one W. I. D. E. we're at a time he wants highway to eighty I don't know if you've tried Steve one of these uh but I'm\nGetting ready to go into the ... are good and they've got these nachos which are really good is God's spicy tuna on top of the re does but it is so good I've already eaten lunch but my habit they're telling me they're going to bring me one of these desert options here in Vietnam I read this to you\nRight before he had to break into a hit here in the next minute or two and that is a fruit sushi option they call it fruit she appreciated his coconut\nInfused rice and the tele strawberries apples and some more rice and uh that's\nPretty good everybody ... Dave and master can show up at all of those yeah check it out of state thank you so much for your own little progress\nAnd it's just it's just a whole lot you know can't we just try to treat people nicely I may not have the exact terminology right I'm not trying to hurt anybody I'm a Christian believer I'm trying to spread the love of God as best I knew how give me a break if I don't use right terminology\nRight and I think that's probably why they use the even the word try because it it does fracture yeah of using that try ballistic um mentality\nBreaks these people into very a smaller groups with their particular set of identity markers if you will and you know you're right it it it's very hard to keep track of all of that which is the beauty of just saying hey I'm an American right it just and it's only competing and hopefully we get back to that and what's interesting\nAbout that particular study that I've heard some people talk about it is that this is not just white people complaining about political correctness but black people are complaining about political correctness right and Hispanics and straight and gay and there's all these different areas of\nYes we all need to be nicer and more understanding of one another but at the same time we're all just a little weary of being lectured to buy a select few who are telling us our actions are wrong our motivations are wrong our privileges wrong our words are wrong everything is wrong\nAnd and actually even want to go so far as to remove you from your job or your position or or wherever you are your status whatever just for using those words in ...\nYou shouldn't be discriminated against but at the same time they're saying\nOlder white guys need to give up their power and just let us have a turn while I'm Sorry it's just not really how it works I mean if you if you can gather a majority of people to vote for you or a candidate who shares a similar position that's how it works you're not going to get widespread people resigning saying you know what young lady you're right you take my position and\nIt just doesn't work that way I Know it's not very practical yeah\nBut they would love to make it we'll power because believe me if they got away with it on a regular basis it would only increased quite honestly anyways I thought this was interesting because it it interviewed eight thousand people a lot of people so it's not just a small sampling\nSure any in the bottom line is again not to go into all the details of the just basically eighty percent\nSo like you said it isn't just a particular race of let's just say you're\nPatriarchal white European\nAncestors sure type people because eighty percent of the population is an all white yeah so it's clearly across the board\nSo it was tough is when you can you can hear in someone's voice when they say something\nThey're not quite sure if they're saying it right well you can hear the question mark\nAs are saying do I call this person black ... first African American\nYou know we're not talking about slurs which is like actual terminology dress in my wife and my Caucasian\nI don't even know what to say anymore and so you hear people sometimes with a microphone in their\nFace and you can tell they're nervous they're they're treading lightly they're walking on eggshells they don't want to get in trouble they don't want to go viral moment and they were trying to make a point about something else but it's distracting that you can tell there's fear in their minds as are talking about an issue\nYou know I think the the general rule that a habit if there if there is a character flaw today where someone's motive is is is bad or\nFull of malice that will come out yeah I mean that and good always comes out and it'll come out in the form of a habit so\nYou know get the person the benefit of the doubt and I can guarantee you they'll trip up again if if it's really the motive is at heart and and it's a problem they'll come they'll mess up again it always happens eventually\nWhen it comes to political correctness one thing that is\nInteresting to me one thing I think about is what is my own motivation of I Do want to be a good representative of what it means to be a faithful Christian so I Want to be a peacemaker I Want to be kind I Want to give people latitude you I just I don't want to be a stumbling block to them right\nSo I Do want to be kind and if there's a term that they don't like to hear I Want to try not to use it for the sake of Christ\nAt the same time I don't want to be guilty of letting them brow beat me and to not speaking my own mind you see what I'm saying like I I don't want to be political politically correct for their benefit but I don't want to be unnecessarily rude or unkind or [noise]\nUm I don't know rough around the edges\nOr easy when I was getting that you can just play into their manipulations for example if someone we don't have this here in Alabama and necessarily but if someone comes up in his eyes demand that you call me Zee and sure I don't know\nI Do right I Would be like that's a sure fire way to get a lot of people to avoid you yeah because who wants to deal with changing the pronouns that they've used all their lives to the kids you know what\nThe pronouns things like I really really tried to even understand it's like some of the terminology I'm\nThankful honestly I'm not in middle school right now trying to go through those basic things of of what these terms means because you know what's coming up in in school public school right so they're teaching\nA little school right now trying to go through those basic things of of what these terms means because you know what's coming up in in school public school right so they're teaching our kids all our own editor teaching them and grade school\nDon't even know what that means that there are boys and there are girls I Wish\nI think that some of this could have been avoided if we're allowed for a broader spectrum of what it means to be male or what it means to be female and what I mean by that is\nWe sometimes have these narrowly defined expressions for masculinity or femininity so then people who didn't fit into those narrowly defined terms now have rejected the whole notion of gender and so they just oh I'm not this so I'm not I'm going to be this other thing instead of\nGiving people weekly wiggle room and what I mean by that is not every man is going to be the mainly is man that you've ever met but that doesn't mean he's not a man and the same with a woman\nThat they don't have to all have the same interests have all the same dress the same mannerisms and I think we've done them a great disservice by calling them names and alienating them so then there pushback is fine I Want my own new term you tell me I'm not\nFeminine enough you tell me I'm not masculine enough well then I guess I'm not a man and must be this other thing so in some respects we've kind of created the problem we're now crying about I see what you're saying I I think I um I Want to play a Barbies and I wanted to be okay or that\nThat are headed toward eating glue [laughter] and I ... I don't know what the described that the gender everybody does that maybe too much clip art is to forty six were going to take a a find a break here on the Ford faction we've got Andrew Jessica coming up at three hundred ties hanging out may Russell big it's a ... it'll continue next\nThe Ford faction making radio great again\nAnd head out to tell whether they get super speedway breeze weekend October twelve to fourteen ticket holders for the with thousand votes dot com five hundred can enjoy camping in three different camp grounds around the track this is more than a race this is ...\nDo you want to melt fat yet shown and have the body you always wanted then you need to check out science try fitness through high intensity interval training and nutrition education I even tried to heal the trend setting gain muscle\nIrons rather currently looking for forty ... do you want to participate in a free six we challenge that is guaranteed to get the results [noise] with that challenge to get a cut the new plans\nPersonal accountability grocery list and so much more as long as you ... the challenge is absolutely free contact your closest tried today to find out more\nHey guys this is Thomas ... we're talking about our service milk for meals which is\nReal prep but you could pick up on Monday afternoon so what we do is we have meals and we have food pounds which you can take it home and have food all week\nLong what this does is it makes your life easier it keeps you out to dry food and keeps you also point with what you're trying to disrupt ...
