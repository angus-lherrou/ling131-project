I Believe in Alabama you lucked out I saw this falling out of it you know I think after the after the Kavanaugh hearings there's really been a tremendous amount of energy for the Republican Party I think they are frustrated with a you\nKnow how he was treated and I saw all it was lost on it tends to Republicans from month to go up now just look Republicans frustrated at what's going on and how he was treated\nHow you know Democrats play from the same play both you know they don't hang up really good policies on how to solve things on an attack people what I think that shameful\nI'm Walt Maddox ... here in Alabama okay I got to work just to try it out with a state Marshall not going to work a laptop has been quiet but ah\nYeah I think people see three that I think they realized that\nIf Democrats don't have any policies that are going to leave our state board and a best of luck yet\nOur states even right now and unemployment is very low a opportunity in the private sector or is that an all time high yeah hooking caught a rolling excited about the direction of Illinois governor outage doing a good job of\nYou know he didn't make sure we elect Republicans and keep the momentum\nWill look I'm going to say one thing that surprised me who actually no surprise me disappointed me or you know I I've seen 'em won't medics or who's going to be running against governor Roy the or the governorship of Alabama a couple of times we'll have\nTo think that really struck me he was old doom and gloom like it was you know I wrote an op ed the yellow him a news a sign that he would like Chicken Little in the sky was bowling when he's had\nA big old so uh he seemed in ... bomb more liberal than what you see on these commercials on TV we do think that's accurate I'm only just missed reading it\nYeah it is I mean I think the waltz polling in the thirties and doing well at all and so on\nBarry ... oh yeah very ... news you know like that is good I like that now tell me we're going to be cold is on the phone or Tony Tony welcome to a woman to the fact that\nHey guys I appreciate it I got two things are real quick um the first thing is uh I was spinning independent uh since I was Eighteen years old and I'm thirty six now or I even voted for Obama up both times I I I regret it to this day uh but\nUh this is the first time ever that I Will be voting straight one political party I just got to check that box Republicans because in my opinion man the or the left is just to ... right now they haven't always been they probably won't be in the future but as of right now they are budget looney tunes\nTelling you what do they tell you what do you think why do you think that is\nA well they're trying to uh they're trying to out in their opinion crazy a truck I don't think I think they're trying to pull pull a truck\nA but in their own uh you know left um [noise] a fuse I guess and so when they go that far in that direction it just it just it just it's limited to me\nAnd I think ah to to most of the population I think it's going to be a red wave to be honest with you this is these midterms\nTony let's hope you ride thanks so much for calling you know really appreciate it and uh it and it makes it much easier if you just click the red Republican\nThese midterms well Tony let's hope you're right thanks so much for calling in a really appreciate it in the ... and it makes it much easier if you just click the red Republican button doesn't\nSay I can't I Can't do that though I I I don't I'm not saying I won't vote all Republican but I'm going to take my time and I'm going to circle each one of them in because it to me\nThat's my right to do that and I know they're making at least you can you can check all Republican but I Can't do that I have to go down the ticket and I have to circle each one\nOh yeah back in the ... this whole you know just voting the ticket thing doesn't happen because I agree with you entirely you should think about it think about who you're going to vote for and vote for them based on their merits so now look we talked to a little bit earlier in the show about uh you know this I'm\nJust despicable a shooting or this mass murder in uh Philadelphia at the synagogue in the in the house of worship you know the the the the rights of St\nCoward as being you know obviously arrested in identified as my policies with these things I'm not going to say is nine but he's a Trump hiding anti Semite and according to our next guest or an admirer of Hitler\nA you know he's uh forty six year old resident of Pittsburgh and he was arrested at the same uh he was yelling anti Semitic or rhetoric I'm sure you've all heard everything all the nasty bits and pieces\nA but who investigations according to an ... more field of the Daily Caller and town hole a show that this guy\nWas a ... was a rabid anti Semite a Trump ... and ah you know regrettably he needed only a few minutes to carry out the deadliest attack\nIn us history killing eleven people ... against to the Jewish by a killing eleven people inside that Pittsburgh\nA synagogue a we're joined by Scott more field of the daily cola or ... is a columnist for town hall and if you guys uh don't check out the Daily Caller in town hall and in particular Scott work\nAre you really missing out ice ... you've been covering thanks for joining us you've been covering this case from the get go or can you run through a you know it might be the latest news and and the background as you've been covering it\nSure um yeah everything everything you said it's correct I mean we're talking about if you if you a\nCheck off a check lifted checklist of the uh\nThe extreme quote unquote right wing\nWhich they're going to label him as as a right winger unfortunately Enron were not going to obviously we're not gonna climbing a but let any sort of you know the Holocaust denial I'm anti Semitism racism hate all that stuff was out there for everybody to see he posted on a it's a\nIt's sort of a Twitter alternative called gab ... and most of most of his postings lack of solving supposed things are on there and ah so ... [noise] from the ... somebody was able to um\nBefore they shut the account down somebody was able to actually save all his post\nYeah that was Robby Robin Starbuck wrote the movie ...\n... or ... or he uh have the right one of the name came out you know immediately scouring the social media and of course he was he was really prominent and that and that community so [noise] um you know some of the stuff he\nHe would say talking about cue yeah the conspiracy theory a little bit ... it was a little bit\nSome of the stuff he he would say talking about cue you know the conspiracy theory a little bit wrong it was a little bit critical of that um reached waiting a lot of ... I guess you can read gabbing or whatever they call it re posting a lot of the things that they are that they were talking about ... and what's interesting is\nA lot of this he was he was very very critical of president\nTrump because this is something that I've not seen a mainstream media like animal ... no ... told me like I I saw I was reading done cool yesterday day before and that's when you know I should that eight mile unlike hang on I haven't seen anything about him being critical of Trump to tell us about that why why is this not out there\n[laughter] well it's not out there because they want to use this hit Trump or the right um so that it's the same as the pipe bomber\nIn that regard it's up it's a it's a little harder here I mean it's it's hard to\n... when a for an anti Semitic attack when Trump is putting the embassy in Jerusalem\nAnd um you know Nick seeing the Iran deal um [laughter] so that with some of the issues that this guy had with them and the fact that Trump apparently isn't isn't the only enough about immigration um and the caravan an Elvis things kind of come together and so you know he was rabidly anti Trump\nA disguised hosted anti Trump rhetoric all every social media right\nOh yes yes I'm ... and ... and it came down pretty quick but this stuff if you looked at my mom post there there's a link to a\nI N G you are only even know how to pronounce that but it's a uh just basically screen grabs at the bottom you can you know go through them and look at the screen grabs of the things that he uh of the things that he said\nWhat's your uh ...\nUh ... mine I'm\nSorry where he is or ... ...\nOh well I'm actually you know it actually posted that my posted there but my Daily Caller all you\nCould look there are guys don't always go to the daily call ... or are you arguing courage looking people don't read daily cold on a daily basis in the millions they really should run\n[laughter] [noise] Oh absolutely we we uh we have a a great group and a\nRecover stuff as it happens and a lot of this stuff that we cover our reaction pieces you know this person said this about the you know and so we're on the cutting edge of of what's going on so what are the things you know he wrote hearing equipped Trump is the global is not a nationalist um you know and trying to\nTo portray Trump I don't know where he gets that stuff but uh and then there is no magic as long as there is a A R K e infestation\nUm you know just just some really sick stuff um that he would post and of course you're not going to see that in the mainstream media at all your or or or maybe on Fox News but you but you're not going to see that at all because they want to use this\nTo try to hammer Trump I'm In advance to the midterms I I I don't I ended up what's what's interesting too is gab are you familiar with\n... you know what until I read it in your a article a yesterday on Saturday I I'd never even heard of it\nYeah it's um it's sort of a poor man's Twitter a I mean it it works kinda electorate Twitter works\nAnd uh what's what's interesting is the um gab has been the platforms as a result of this and to me\nEverything that's left is in response to the things is too far is is not even just too far it it's absurd so they're going to bring out anti gun arguments which is what they always do they're going to try to politicize this stuff instead of just being a solidarity with the big\nSerge so they're going to bring out anti gun arguments which is what they always do they're going to try to politicize this stuff instead of just being a soldier with the victims and and trying to figure out what you know what motivates these people and how we can stop it and uh maybe working on some you know ways\nTo harden salute places where the ... yeah so the real solution you\nKnow we can harden these places we can do some things that are going to stop crazy people or we could put the ... how about we put the crazy people in mental institutions where they belong or they could get ill\n... shut down because no one wants to pay for it\nExactly nobody wants to pay for ... and ... it's it's not politically correct to cut them and mental institutions are so we let them run around and then they get a hold of crazy whether it's right wing or left wing you know crazy beliefs\nAnd then they go to town with it so you've got ... who is a free speech platform and and I think that's good to be a free speech and and I'm I'm you know that that's fine\nBut their solution is going to be listed the platform anybody unless shut everything down that any sort of anti you know not politically correct and that's the wrong answer also\nYou're grieving ... ingredient story\nIs that what we need to be engaging these people and talking to them and say okay you know here's where you are wrong and a lot of times if you look at his exchanges\nBig guys having a good cliches in the control room there\nYeah by the hour we gotta we gotta figure to but to answer my question marks question\nEven if I Am going to vote all Republican I'm going to sit down at that table or the voting booth and I I'm going to circle each person and I'm going to look at them\nBut that's what makes the country great as you can do that because I mean if a lotta people look at it Shelby was a Democrat at one time and ... and he became a Republican so you know there have been\nI I and I know it sounds crazy but there has been times that I've liked a Democrat governor or whatever or a Democrat president [noise] no I haven't I've never liked the Democrat\n[laughter] I was just about have to jump in there and\nAre you off you know there's other people that are Democrat that I have a light because I Am new stuff about the Republican and ... and I asked them my own questions\nWhen you look at a state like Wyoming\nOr you know that's one of the along with Alabama are probably two of the rate of sites and the whole nation\nRight more often than not\nThe Wyoming a state is led by Democrat because the bugs they like to have a bit of a balance of power kind of deal so all legislators are all Republican everyone in\nAnd say I don't have a problem with that voting for Republican a governor and a Democrat lieutenant governor 'cause to me what I'm going to check the other one show and you know and like I said I mean the majority of the time I Do vote Republican and you know\nI have found out that you can mark Republican up there at the top ... that you're voting strength Republican and go down the ticket and vote for Democrats and it and it will\nVote right in that era that is right but not that I'm encouraging anyone to do that\nBig guys well no I'm not either I mean you have to do you have to think about this stuff for yourself of course you know and that's why I'm kind of different than a lot of people on this station but that's not sure I I Am not going to strike again and I'm not strike anything I mean 'cause then you the truth I don't like neither party\nNot any anybody not at all and\nCooling number is non for one one one one zero one one you'd like to call enjoying the show you know we we had our\nPrevious guest on Scott from uh the Daily Caller was talking about the shooting up of the in the mood or the mass mood or in the house of worship in Philadelphia\nAnd the way that the the media have refused to acknowledge that uh the mood or a that crazy coward in Philadelphia or was being ... Lee and tonight President Trump a I think the media needs to report some of the facts\nAre some of those facts you know President Trump has Jewish grandkids and the Jewish daughter\nPresident Trump's move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Israel against a huge amount of uh international pressure not to do so President Trump deported a Nazi deported a Nazi from the you know\nHuge amount of uh international pressure not to do so President Trump deported a Nazi deported a Nazi from the United states when Obama refuse to do it President Obama wouldn't do it President Trump did\nPresident Trump canceled the Iran deal\nWhich was a I think not just a threat to Israel's security but also a threat to the\nGlobal security particularly here particularly Israel but also uh the ... Iran's neighbors and the United states\nPresident Trump was the first sitting president the first sitting president in history to visit the or wailing wall or the western wall in Jerusalem [noise] so I just want\nPeople to think about that I loved the mainstream media to think about that uh when they go um you know\nMaking all these crazy statements about President Trump or in this uh this atrocity in Philadelphia\nA shortly we we may have another reporter on line or a good friend of mine Virginia accrued over who has been covering or the or the the mass murder in uh Philadelphia in\nThe meantime out called the number is non for one one zero one one we can talk elections we can talk what Halloween cost cost me got away this year my gene a finance firm big dive well he's going to be going to Halloween as this year or we can talk about this uh the mass murder of course in Philadelphia\nA and and the pot bomber slash strict but I'm only I'm not going as him I've [laughter]\nI Know I was going to go as a\nDemocrat but I couldn't get my head to far up my but to be able to do it so I think I Would just be me like the so you're just going to be your hand or you get a handout candy to share\nA will probably go with the little man a ... yeah I mean you know since he's the only one we have I don't have to spread my time around so that's good will probably go to their house and go with them out while\nHe's trick or treating will I bought to trick or treat candy to she normally I just lock the doors and um and close the house up [laughter] but that's not really in the spirit of its or a boat trick or treat candy this year I'm an address Betsy Ross the Doberman up as Betsy Ross\nAh to scare off or a folks we don't want to uh [laughter] we don't want to hand candy at a\nUm an interesting comment from the ... defense secretary a mad as a last night when I think he's in in uh Europe\nOr he called the ... synagogue the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter a coward who pride on the defenseless\nA and a and really in an attack this is Secretary Mattis on the foundational tenants of the United states that have freedom of religion is the exact quote this is a coward he is not a man by any definition that we use in the department of defense\nThis is one reason I Love Secretary Mattis a you know is that they called him mad dog a marine or you know he's a he's a hard man the polls that like it is and I agree with them entirely you know there was one person responsible for that massacre in the in the house of worship in uh Philadelphia there's one individual\nSecretary Mattis one third one was a man I went to him as a man matter of fact she went on to say he was the porous excuse for a man you could ever come up with who would use a weapon in a house of worship on unarmed innocent people\nAnd the secretary Mattis hit the nail right on the head he doesn't mention that he\nI'm innocent people was secretary medicine hit the nail right on the head he doesn't mention that he was a Republican or a Democrat or independent or anything else he just talked about the cat would react and addresses that uh you know it's right on I think that's great oh we'd go

have a my mentor who was a ... a federal senator he went on to become president of the center go I go down focus and he was like Greg don't do it\nYou won't be able to do it it's one more time and you're thinking we're I'm like oh come on center will be fine\nHe makes me go and work with one of the state Senate is is you know just as an aid for three months and after that three months I was like holy cow I'm not doing that and I went to a hospital [laughter] and uh yeah and you you got thrown in like the deep end you're on the impeachment committee for basically right\nYes that was something you know it was it is funny Greg you get down there and people say look you're going served three and a half months that's how long the session is as long as there is not a special session\nI had three special sessions in my first two years in addition to the to general sessions and then as you just as you just said in my third year I Am on the impeachment committee or for our governor which is you know there's only been to and the first one was in Nineteen ...\nAnd the impeachment committee or for our governor which is you know there's only been to and the first one was in Nineteen fourteen involving a secretary of state or where he had I think bribed his opponent to get out of his race for a thousand dollars\nSo that was the only other impeachment him and we didn't really have any rules so we were faced with these challenges so here you do go to Montgomery and you do think about state issues mhm but you don't really think my goodness\nThree special sessions in your first two years and you're going to be on in the peach and you're in preaching the governor wander there and peach peach Mitt committee for the governor and we didn't have any rules to do so ... so I actually had to draft with my colleague ... friday we had to come up with those rules to even put the committee in place\n[laughter] that's quite a quite a bit too yes now David I Know one of you'll you'll you'll you know personal the issues up up in the uh a district district forty six is education school security\nUh you know we've seen in the last month a share of high all has has now put a an a a school resource officers in every school how important is that do you think for you know school safety and and the education says\nIt it's extremely important and I want the people of Alabama there no certainly the people in my district so I say it wherever I go to let them know\nThat's super ... we care about the hard work you vote in the room your lips and that's why our advertising partners are people we take the time to battle you don't have to when you go to the white lie can check out our partners you can trust that you're doing business with a right to feed

business right way super station one on one that what are you why do you use\nA Birmingham thanks for listening super station one one [noise] [noise]\nTo be in a\nHard abdominal ... drinks a lot of trouble mailing\nI'm\nDown down down to drop shots\nHey welcome back to break killing with you on the fourth director on this uh some a lovely a Monday afternoon or I really liked that one a big ... and her family have shoot him here comes the thunder who I liked that a lot\nThat might be the fiber run for office which I never will use that as my uh are you going to be like thunder from down under\nThat would be a good one that\nPeople would like to see that but ah that's where it would probably do I read the Brandon has been a hanging on the line very patiently Brendan programs program\nOut doing a uh just want to talk\nAbout the about the whole issue going on we got it set up to use a\nSynagogue right and you know I'm a I'm a Democrat or not a liberal Democrat and or\nAt least it's a mainstream media was still a lot of different media outlets so there's this outlet right is a ...\nA lot so thanks for listening charge you attract\nMuch a barrel things but I personally haven't heard anyone say that all the reserves or just or do we do\nKnow or Brennan a tool and all of the plays a role model is a valuable person\nIt's on CNN that's on the Washington Post that's it\nRented a tool and ... from my listening or could you not evil person\nOh it's on CNN it's on the Washington Post ...\nActual person that did not this is what I've been here ... ... what I have\nBeen hearing is which is a question that needs to be ... else's and it is a good question to ask about it is\nIs the ... there's going on right now that Trump's spew out all the time the way we talk and be great different groups of people ... like he had\nIt at this point in time or in our politics hate crimes have grown up since ... been shot and does he is ready to ...\nHave any but I don't I don't know if that's a that's an accurate in Des let's accurate\nAnd listen and that that's the question that I have been hearing\nOh oh media outlets that they've been asked\nRight let me ask you what marriage is Raymond ... do you think you're just coming from the ... and the left\nOh it's bad writers oh both side right I think you're right no doubt it it's crazy on both sides\nI agree with that one hundred percent it is\nCrazy people ... in a real Republican side too\nWell and and I agree with that and we're talking about the ... already with that one hundred percent there's crazies on both sides that's why I'm an independent ... that way I can do both of them and I don't have a problem doing it\nYeah I Know and that's exactly what that ... Brandon's point is exactly what we're talking about at the top of the show\nThat yeah it's a Brenda thanks so much for your call I think you are you rise to a very good point uh on the line now we have a literally a ship ... ah she's running for ... circuit court judge in place twenty seven uh literally welcome to the program\nThank for having me hey thanks for taking the time [noise] uh no\nYou know I live in a in Jefferson County in in in Avondale ah and I've seen this flown out or or ... whatever you want to call it\nA which I don't have it in front of me unfortunately\nBut it seems to me it was put out by the Republican Party it seems to me that it it just the the message on there and you might be able to explain a little bit bitter about listening as a wouldn't be helpful for somebody a running in a sort of the booming him area\nNot helpful I owe on you know other than that by on one side of it which\nMight not campaign the other side of a flyer and I'm just not an accurate trial or not campaign not an accurate trial of who I Am as an officer at the core um that's\nI don't support that can't negative campaigning or scare mongering which I feel like well that's what this ad is found hypocritical that were camping either side of the same thing that we're angry at them for keeping us or just\nThat makes it does um yeah so I think that that's it yeah it's very thin carrots that that we have cross ever support independent support in Jefferson running for an office in Jefferson County ... on the judiciary\nAnd yeah you ... yeah exactly and also as a judge we should maybe be running a party's been re I agree with that entirely yeah um you know I was at my\nThey shouldn't have been running applied to send the way\nI agree with that entirely\nYeah and you know I was at my background the foster care and that was the prosecutor accent and consider I never did consider a party that what will it for like ... ... ... and I to judge what she slipped sat right Bonnie shipping outside of politics at all\nI'm into that lately so this this fly a ... a ... and I've seen it a good friend of mine actually sent it to me um [noise] this planet you know I think you're right I think it's the talk of partisan and that's just being put out by the by the Republican Party had nothing to do with the right\nSet out to stay\nPut up for this and and I don't know one thought to run it boy you maybe or [laughter] that seems just\nYeah I haven't seen that before you know and I don't know you know campaigning I didn't see him hanging on by side anybody back not yet\nYeah the ... that that law say go straight straight I checked just like business as a second ... sent me and I think we all want that if I'm yes\nAbsolutely ... uh literally shipment more is running the circuit court judge in place twenty seven or you know uh for everything I understand about ... is that she's very measured she understands the issues that are facing a community\nA and a and and promote my a friend Christie told me um you know it's certainly not\nA proponent of anything that must have been put out by the Republican Party on her behalf and without her knowledge literally thank you so much for taking the time to call in\nOr we will follow this up and a political into the Republican Party and just see what they have to say about this but good luck on Tuesday next week we hope you a hope you get up and alone\nI thank you\nThanks lately uh we've we've got time for one more quick call before we go to break I Believe let's go to Brandon Brandon with them to the food facto\nHey there's me but you also formula called you up the salt\nOh no we were going to that and they just had to get away with a view right okay\nOkay well yeah my my point was that I was trying to make was that oh what I have a problem with it is that you know on both sides you help people like\nWhen the shooting happened or against the congressman it was a Democrat follows the way they saw reason why they have no there was a crazy man and then now the other side is no balance like\nThey're crazy on both sides is not the Democratic fall is not a broad fault you spot on her and the question that has to be\nAbsolutely crazy a crazy right it yeah\nBut like if there's a live in a\nIn a hate crime then we have to try and figure out why why it happened and I think is a fair question to ask all I think so too later on oh I think that's and that's all either side and then when I was on my ... is it because of the Democratic side or the Republican side is the ...\nGreg good afternoon glad to be all\nSo Tim uh we do have to ah there's a there's a big a dark cloud hanging over the studio at the moment\nWe had the last week the fifty most powerful influential beautiful people in Alabama event uh at Ross Bridge which was a fantastic yellow him a events uh you know the governor has asked speaker of the house was there [noise] gosh I was there you were there\nWe die wasn't their team what is going on\nWell um I obviously you must have added the beautiful people element\n[laughter] analysts televised me having been there that definitely was not a and I also think that if I Know that you said at the bottom of every hour I Would have called in much sooner to hear that as well\nBut the question is is why we're was my invitation this is big day where it was my invitation to be there\nThey day you're only list\nAll of it is oh say we're not a a [laughter]\nI was afraid that your list on to yourself\nWell and I'm sure is because you're afraid I said everybody else's food and that's fine I understand that's why they call me big day for\nFood was really good at food was really good at that event but\nTreat everybody else's food and that's fine I understand that's why they call me big day for\nThe food was really good food was really good at that event but to Tim look thanks for joining us today I Know your super busy with the election and uh you know you don't want him a news is the source and ah you know everybody has\nA ... you know it's the old and use it or you have to print kind of deal or you know this election coming up I I've been a citizen here in the United states for a gosh Fifteen or sixteen years now\nOr certainly in my lifetime\nOr my my lifetime my time here in the United states is probably the most uh you know important election that are being a pot oval been involved with\nA is certainly um for me to him that would be absolutely one hundred percent accurate\nWhat are you feeling of what's the what's the your gut feeling on the on the you know election here in Alabama how to striking out\nWell you bring up a good point gray is that you know outside of Alabama I'm there are going to be some base is getting the term elections that I think people will be very quickly turning to people in Alabama will be looking for on election night because one of the I I said the predominant thing\nOn election night here in Alabama for our state races to me will be no surprises or do you remember going back more than a year ago probably\nI'm In the ... really are probably a less than in the way close the Doug Jones ... Doug Jones alerts and put us then suddenly the day\nOr you had had a feeling that wow in South Alabama there might be some sort of really worried you know the Democratic party might be able to capitalize on that the minimum after Doug Jones election in really that is all just dissipated and say really to me one of the predominant things is going to be no surprises and I think it starts at the top\nI think that that the debate going on right now amongst political insiders is you know with regard to the governor's race with Kay Ivey is simply will be her margin of victory is it going to be sixty percent is it going to be fifty eight will be sixty two are higher\nWell won't buy the cars just proven to be a a flash said a leftist candidate\nYeah in in ... his campaign certainly flat line at this point in time but you know reading one of the things about ... ... is that she's a master communicator really one of the best I've seen in Alabama politics in quite some time um she she's so reliable\nAnd you know she does such a good job staying disciplining her message\nAll the things you want from a candidate you made a yellow hammer power services and the other night\nYou know my my wife and I was speaking to K. Avi at that event and you know as I'm sure you've been probably also know that sometimes our wives our spouses who are not as quite as close to all this stuff ... sometimes the best judges of candidate and my wife's observation was\nThat Kay Ivey is one of the most of the light of all politicians that she recalls so she there's there's no air it's just she's been related already whether it's a corporate CEO working a job at a factory and she can relate to everybody in between and I think that you see that the election results are probably going to bear that out\nI think you're right there and we talked about this on the show on friday\nYou know I saw won't Maddox at a at a business luncheon or you know last week you know he turned out what the flanks of a you know sort of Fifteen year old a stop is kind of be the governor of Alabama turns up to an an event at a hotel and apart from her security detail who were very\nIt was kind of be the governor of Alabama turns up to an an event at a hotel and apart from her security detail who were very discreet and have to be a she didn't have any stuff\nShe just walked into the room and just started mingling with folks and ... who you were and I think the other thing that\nA impressed me and my wife was there and the first time she'd seen a a a governor IBM person the something to impress me when she was inspirational\nYou know against the wall medics and it's all doom and gloom the sky's falling you know a Chicken Little ... suit up there in front of what a few hundred people or the you know the the most powerful people in Alabama and didn't miss a beat she didn't speak off notes and she uh\nInspired about not only what Alabama is right now but about where it's going and I thought that was really refreshing\nIt ... and I think that's right and that's the way she's always been a better are probably going on sixteen years now\nAnd she's always been that way she's always been a woman with an incredibly positive as credibly positive outlook ... feet off that voters and that sort of reassuring to voters think that that is such a contrast to the sort of um\nApproach that Maddox has taken with the campaign and you know\nK. obvious had the benefit of this autonomy this roaring and she's got jobs numbers that back up the things that she's saying in terms of where she wants to do with the state and things that that she wants to try and highlight around the state and that positive message\nComing from someone who was such a vast communicate or I mean it really it translates into third grade and you don't see that on election night there's no question\nYeah sure hope so too can you were just about to go to break new a stick with us absolutely and Ellen is waiting on the phone and we'll get to Alan tried out on the other side of the break if he's got a question but Jim this is the fact that you would ...\nThe Ford faction making radio great again the following it does not necessarily reflect the opinions or abuse of Crawford Broadcasting its employees affiliates or advertisers\nGary Palmer understands that America needs a strong military and\nAnd honor our veterans and there\nHe is acutely aware of veterans the military and helps us in every way that he can he has done great things for us and he will continue to do great things for us\nCongressman Palmer is committed to a meeting the needs of these events in\nPalmer for Congress identical leadership hurting Alabama I'm Gary Palmer and I approve this message\nDo you want to melt fat yet Tony didn't have the body you've always wanted to send you need to check out science try fitness through high intensity interval training and nutrition education I even tried to get help the trans fat and gain muscle\nI even tried to currently looking for forty ... if you want to participate in a free six we challenge that is guaranteed to get the results [noise] with that challenge to get a new plan personal accountability grocery list and so much more as long as you read your home late that\nChallenge is absolutely free contact your closest tries today to find out more\nHey guys this is Thomas ... we're talking about our service Milford meals which is\nMilk forever but you can pick up on Monday afternoon so what we do is we have meals and we have food ... you can take it home and have food [noise] all week\nLong what this does is it makes your life easier it keeps you out to dry suit seats you also point with what you're trying to see ...
