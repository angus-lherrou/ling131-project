I mean we would never act on it or anything but it was just kinda funny watching his phone get blown up like\nLike naked guys pictures and date offers and stuff yeah 'cause I have a picture of like Ryan Gosling ... doesn't think that guy's attractive like George Clooney you know what I mean like these idiots these ... never know what's going on\nAnd so I started doing it with my buddies cars and I would listen my buddies cars and then I Would put the car like five thousand dollars below what it was actually worth and we get hundreds of emails and calls and then we could just blown up for days and days and days until they finally figured out that it was me\nWho was doing it because my car had been the one put up yet I felt\nIt was hilarious I mean it was ... that was one of my better jokes oh you think so Britain yes you you think after you've realize of what\nIs this is my like my twenty third year of messing around of playing that I don't realize that I play too much but you think this is bad right now I used to I used to really play a lot like when my dad and I would would get to joking and messing around\nNow what do you mean he said well when you were eleven\nThis is why I got matched up with you and I I didn't realize it three three kids wrote a letter and they and they basically they matched him up with three kids so every each one of us read a letter and he said the reason why I chose you was because in your letter\nYou know in and let me give us a call from the press by saying I played sports and all that stuff and my mother was never there because she was always working and my dad obviously wasn't there at all and\nHe said in your letter you said I just want someone to come to my game now Andy was a coach so he loves watching sports and that guy came to every single wrestling match every soccer match that he could even when I travel\nAnd I didn't know that I didn't know that that's why he was making that effort um and until I graduated high school and honestly it was because of anti that he really instill confidence self worth of me that would enable me to do whatever I Want to whatever I set my mind you on that really attribute that to him and uh and him and and him changing the structure of my life\nWhile but it's an incredible story so big brothers big sisters I'm sure it's something that's near and dear to your heart to this day\nNo question and I look I think anyone out there that's less thing if you're a a mentor or you're speaking out a mentor cooking we can all use mentors or whatever we're doing I I continue to do that 'cause I Know the value of it but if you're a mentor in your health and so I was never underestimate the impact that you can have a little bit of your time your your wisdom and your attention on someone like\nLet's go back to your career in the navy when you went off to become a Navy SEAL you went to ... and you wanted to be a marksman you wanted to be a sniper from the beginning there\nI I Know I didn't I didn't know having\nYou're in the navy when you went off to become a Navy SEAL you went to bloods and you want it to be a marksman you wanted to be a sniper from the beginning there\nI I Know I didn't I didn't know how many emissions of being a sniper per se I just wanted to be a seal\nIt and I got to tell you when you go there and you're Eighteen years old and you know everything's overwhelming right so as soon as I get there and I think the first work out that he did like\nThe first hour the first part of the work out with a hundred pull up to her my cat my cows rip than I was like holy\n... what am I got myself into but you know when you're Eighteen everything is is just overwhelming so it was just one thing at a time you know with um one one evolution at a time let me just get through this let me just get to lunch you know it but I'd probably thought about ... thought about putting like every day right but not seriously because\nYou know I always thought about back home and and everyone back home to what I was doing and and I was like there's no way\nThat I'm I'm going to let these guys are make these guys make make me go ring a bell free time to quit now but it's not going to have that feeling\nYou mentioned you were injury earlier talk a little bit more about some of your deployments or do you have the most memorable deployment\nWell I mean that was certainly the most memorable to the point that um you know I I went there and it was a it was interesting because the apple tunes were there and they were at the time like a thousand five times tunes were\nGuarding the president and prime minister center out of Iraq you know so they were kind of doing like Secret Service work if you will know missions like that of course but I went there is like this augment T of Cyprus I didn't really I didn't I wasn't attached to a specific platoon which was also\nBasically I Would go out and find work with the army and Marines that you do over watches or or you know to try to find folks and then I go grab snipers from the tunes which they love because they were tired of you know babysitting the prime minister at seven and then we they'd come with me and and we do we do missions and stuff and then I went out to Ramadi which was\nPretty bad times or play around with right before Chris Kyle by kind of air I'm sure your listeners have seen that you know the ... American Cyprus also Ramadi was kind of like a Mad Max and the thunder down the pike place\nThough I mean just the post up off the top the top ... on a place but um it was it was fascinating and it was interesting to do and you know that that obviously\nThat mission that's where I got injured was I didn't remember everything that was passed out but it's but obviously they into my mind and basically it's nothing nothing too sexy it was just you know we're on this mission and we brought up in the streets in the middle of night and we're going to stay in a building for three to five days deserving the intersection that was known to have\nAn enemy to launch now they're in and conducting a tax on coalition forces so we go in and of course when you go in and you're still having nightmares and goggles on no lights signature you don't want them to know that you're going to the jury and there\nYou do it quietly and and as we were clear in the building to make sure that was no enemy inside\nI had turned a whole security on the third third deck stairwell\nFell through the floor on twenty twenty five feet or so and and I didn't know exactly what it happened 'cause I was out cold it instantly and I I saw this petty officer who was who was the medic basically he told me what happened a couple of years later actually and not that I fell down and hit something along the way down and like face down when he got to me that\nHe couldn't hear or he could barely hear my reading was very very labor so he inserted a day to even open my airway and basically saved my life and stabilize my back and then um gave me some morphine and called in the matter of acts and loaded me onto that all day the Marines came in with the Humvees and he he actually wrote with the marine\nTo make sure that I got basically a helicopter and what's what's important about that very selfless I think is you know they that that road that he had to get to from the from the building to the helicopter we've lost like I I think if my memory serves me correctly eleven or twelve and read that year alone and what happens a lot of what happened a lot of time is\nThe first calmly goes through and that wakes up the bomb maker you know and then and then the next causeway gets hit so he had they went through the air dropping off a helicopter and then uh\nThere's ... goes through and that wakes up the bomb maker you know and then and then the next car gets hit so he had they went through the air dropping off a helicopter and then uh and he had to drive right back down that road to reach me the team and thank God nothing happened to them I I Would have everybody forget myself if I'm happy I'm On the way back when he was able to do that\nBut then I remember the first time I woke up on the helicopter\nI couldn't move very well because of course I was trapped in and I couldn't feel anything is a morphine and I just thought to myself oh my gosh I'm paralyzed paralyzed and so I packed back out and I wake up again I'm In a lot and hospital\nSo I grab grab my legs I grabbed in between my legs and I said thank God so you got 'em [laughter] but that that's what I Would have to say that but that's my most memorable a supporter of course\nI can imagine so and a lot of guys that I talked to that have been injured they they say the once they come through and they check the first thing they do is they check and see if their limbs or they're like you just described and then they say that they they they worry that their time down range or in the field maybe over the debt cross your mind\nI didn't even think about that to be honest with you and I don't think I was thinking about that I was a you know ... I was breathing down a new ... in the hospital and at a slow but the nurse stuff like that [laughter] I don't think I was thinking about that\nShow after that did you see any more deployments after your injury or death is that when you came\nBack to I was I was already I already previously been doing a teaching partnership or Hanukkah and I just went back to that and then I thought that was my time was out of the navy I lifted\nInitially into the navy in Ninety seven I was planning on doing the ... and then coming back home and going to college and then I got home from a deployment overseas in August of two thousand one so we all know what happened in September so I I actually re enlisted early to go were added another another\nAnother listener and if you will so my time was up and I you know wanted to do different things as well two of my life and so that's I just I just finished up my time and got out but then of course I found myself\nThat like I said back in Yemen for about ten trips if you will because it was as civilians are not necessarily to play it but I went there ten times during the ... in the Arab Spring and everything which is very interesting as well it's kind of hard you know you kind of I think a lot like a lot of folks that that were in my position or in a similar background\nYou find out if even if you get out of a deal like leaving when you know because you're drawn to that kind of\nWarrior Wednesday is brought to you by its dream concepts broad view and killed ... more of our conversation coming up next with former Navy SEAL and US Congressman I'll tell you what white here on warrior Wednesday [noise]\nThe Ford faction making radio great again\nOn a crisp Cuomo show he had to Kavanaugh classmates he brings him onto a sense the character I'm Brett Kavanaugh\nWho drank ... vice again Barry Bonds hail lengthening Amir among ... like a slap me drunk devil's triangle I never saw Hans ... actually in ...\nHe moved some [laughter]\nI really question any air for me ... now and ...\nI've seen him eat dinner he did not throw out around I gave him a medical examinations once he is definitely not have only ... painted a stomach and then ... followed by a famous when he was around ... cutting ...\n... these small that you I thought that's a hard line within ruined Jessica bones superstition one on one\nDuty Saturday morning in sixty\nRegulation mental she's followed by this\nOn superstation one oh one\nDuty Saturday morning thinking\nRight ... mental she's followed by either has landed on the little regulation I Alone was around ...\nListening rag races\nHey this is the milk and I'm Jonathan food and we want to invite you to listen to our shows the land show with David Johnny every Saturday morning jumps and we have right gifts regular segment\nFarmland timberland money from\nHow much you love land you'll love our show this is the show for you to tune in every Saturday morning for the ... show with John\nDelusion Saturday mornings with my\nSuperstition one woman that there'll be why de do news Saturday at eight o'clock\nFor a full hour of the more white show right here on superstation one oh one W why usually\nOn a Sunday that new insights bill Wilson right here on the one who won W windy\n", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "10"}
