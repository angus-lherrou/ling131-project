about your heating and air conditioning system we're going to talk about what to look for in the heating and cooling contractor and then we're going to uncover the keys to making that sucker\nAnd air conditioning system we're gonna talk about what to look for in the heating and cooling contractor and then we're going to uncovered the keys to making that sucker run for ever\nHave you had somebody come out and tell you that you needed to replace your furnace or air conditioning system\nI interviewed a guy one time who said that the company that he worked for required him to try to sell new heating and cooling equipment to customers whose heating and air conditioning systems or two and three and four years old\nOh look I don't care how in efficient they claim your heating and air conditioning system is if it's less than eight years old you shouldn't even be having the conversation\nHow about your energy bills do you have energy bills to just keep going up and up and up did you replace your air conditioning system maybe or your furnace and not see the energy savings that you were promised\nI Want to talk to those of you out there who have a furnace or air conditioner or he bumped that six or eight years old and you've been told to junk it\nIn my lifetime I can count on one hand how many six year old systems that I've seen that needed to be replaced\nMost of the time they just needed a really good cleaning it's going to take you years to get your money back out of Newark conditioning system do you have six or eight grand just lying around that you want to Chuck it your heating and cooling system\nOr would you rather than just a little bit of money getting it cleaned up operating more efficiently lower your energy bills viewer breakdowns and more money in your pocket\nNow we're gonna talk a little bit about what you should expect from the heating and air conditioning company that's coming out to maintain your system because I've got a feeling that a lot of you out there have been getting the drive by maintenance\nYou'll recognize it it's the one where they come out for twenty to forty five minutes ask you for fifty sixty Seventy bucks and then they're gone maybe they hook up a set of refrigerant gauges maybe not if somebody's not spending at least Seventy five to Ninety minutes you need to get somebody else\nA freedom heating and cooling to not usually takes between Seventy five two hundred and twenty minutes from start to finish\nThat we call that cleaning or tune up a total system rejuvenation and it includes cleaning your outdoor coils and inspection and documentation of about sixty to Seventy different components in your furnace and air conditioner\nSome of you are going sixty to Seventy different components that's a lot of stuff right\nWell when our guys show up\nThey spend an average is Seventy five to a hundred and twenty minutes working to get your heating and air conditioning system as close to factory fresh condition as possible\nNot to mention the criminal background checked and drug screen to to did you know\nThat the number one and number two trades being out in the prisons today we're plumbing and air conditioning\n[noise] that's right folks\nThe number one and number two trade being taught in the presence today\nAre plumbing an air conditioning not listen folks I'm not saying that I don't believe that people deserve a second chance I really do believe that if you made a mistake and you did time for it when you get out you should be able to get a job\nI just decided I wasn't going to put them in your home now fellas if your wife's going to be the one that's on when the heating and air conditioning guy comes by do you want to take a chance that that person as someone who\nOh no fellas\nIf your wife's going to be the one that's on when the heating and air conditioning guy comes by do you want to take a chance that that person is someone who learned heating and cooling in the pen\nDo you have kids how 'bout them did you know the fifty percent of the guys that I have interviewed can't pass in nationwide criminal background check folks\nI went through over one hundred resumes in a period of three weeks and only hired one person bring home heating and cooling is very selective about who they put in your\nHome I Want to talk about one of the gentlemen I interviewed and keep in mind when I Do an interview I asked them all kinds of questions about how they do the work\nI asked them how to test the capacitor how to clean a blower wheel and sure enough this guy was giving me pretty good explanations he missed one maybe two little steps but nothing a little training couldn't fix right\nNow at some point in every interview I Try to compare our moral compasses so sometimes I gotta get a little sneaky okay so here's the seventh question I asked him\nI lean in and I said how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need\nThis year that folks how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need now brace yourself folks because without hesitation he said I don't have a problem with it at all\nI don't have a problem with it at all and the reality is that he had been around and worked for enough other air conditioning companies in the area that operated that way that he thought that that's what I wanted to hear\nFrom the table I shook his hand and I said or the interviews over we won't be offering you a job but I think you for coming in then I interview another guy same questions he's doing a pretty good job\nAnd when I lean in and ask him my little trick question how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need\nThis guy did hesitate\nTo kind of dropped his head and then he looked back up and then he looked back down and then he said\nI can do it and if I'm being honest I have done it\nThe company that I worked for required that I bring back a certain dollar amount on every single call that I went on\nSometimes they didn't need anything but if I didn't sell them anything I was going to lose my job and man I got kids defeat but then I got to thinking am I setting the right kind of example for my kids so I had to quit\nAnd now I'm unemployed and the market is flooded with heating and air conditioning technicians and it's been hard to get a job that's an example of the type of competitors we have out there guys I told stories\nIn interviews about heating and air conditioning companies training there technicians to jump wires on two thousand dollar compressors to sell new systems\nLike crossing wires over to break them and there are hundreds of heating and air conditioning contractors in this area last time I checked and chances are pretty good that a technician like the one in the story is going to be coming to your home or your neighbor's home\nYou know you might look down the street today and see an air conditioning technician a heating technician and it might be that guy\nI'm certain that he didn't decide to quit the heating and air\nDown the street today and see an air conditioning technician heating technician and it might be that guy\nI'm certain that he didn't decide to quit the heating and air conditioning is this just because I wouldn't hire him and remember there's more guys were that guy came from\nHe got his training at one of those unprofessional heating and air conditioning companies\nNot listen we'd go out to customers houses all the time that have air conditioners with corroded coils or blowers that are all credit up and we have to help them out of that predicament I mean for crying out loud that's what we do\nWe make furnaces heat pumps and air conditioners last longer we lower energy bills we give you cleaner fresher error we increase Airflow we

actually is kind of exciting\nMy AC dot com\nAll right let's talk about duct work OK duct work actually is kind of exciting when you get to learn about it\nHe did you know that the department of energy they've done studies that have concluded that the average duck system in a U.S household leaks twenty to twenty five percent of the ear that travels through it\nOkay so there's two different kinds of Doug leakage first there's supply leakage that's on the side of your furnace or air conditioner that blows the cold or warm air out at ya\nSo eight twenty to twenty five percent loss means that twenty to twenty five percent of the air that has created at your machine that's blowing toward your bedroom or your kitchen or your family room is lost on the way that's like fives intends and twenties just floating up out of your dog work\nSlipping through the cracks then there's the other kinds of leakage return leakage\nNow this is a little more serious because our returns sometimes go unnoticed because we don't ever feel them doing anything that's because the returns don't blow air out they suck air in\nWell returns are the worst leakers instead of blowing cooled air out or cheated air out into your attic or your crawl space like supplies do\nReturns suck addict or basement or crawl space air in to your system and then blow it into your house it also pressure rises your house in a way that you don't want your house to be pressurized okay you're pulling contaminants\nWell what's the first thing wrong with that other than sucking Erin from those areas how about the fact that if you're a doctor works in the attic\nTemperatures can easily reach a hundred and thirty degrees sucking in a hundred and thirty degree air into your cooling system is like running your air conditioner or your heat pump with all your doors and windows open\nYou want to know what else is bad about sucking an addict recall space air well in the attic and sometimes in cross race as to how about the fact that it's got all of that fiberglass insulation and it just take yourself a bright flash light up there in the middle of the night some time okay you'll see what I'm Talking about\nIt get sucked into your returns and circulates through your heating and air conditioning system some of it lands on your coil and it gets you coil all clogged up and then when you're laying there sleeping at night with your mouth open it's raining down on you it's going into your lungs\nYou breathe it all in\nYou know that stuff's says that it causes cancer right on the role or the package that it comes and don't you\nAdd to that all the toxic rap poisons and bug poisons that the bug companies spray up there and then crawl spaces that we find sucked into these duck systems and you've got yourself one heck of a case to seal your duct work up\nEver wonder why you or someone in your family keeps getting sick or plugged up on a regular basis please look at your environment before you go shoveling

was brought to you by freedom heating\nAnd cooling All right let's\nTalk about your indoor blower wheel the squirrels cage a hamster wheel the blower we'll whatever you want to call it that's the part that's responsible for pushing the warm or cold air out of the vents in your home\nNow all the year in your home from floor to ceiling from one into your house or the other it goes through your furnace and air conditioning system over one hundred times a day\nThen I'm going to open up those little minds again and allow some more people to get that two hundred and fifty two dollar total system rejuvenation for free and you're absolutely going to love the surface I promise\nSo here's the deal we're going to call you and give you a two hour window of time for the technicians to arrive and when he shows up he's going to park on the street okay now our vehicles are meticulously maintained but at the same time you don't have a leak until you've got to leak right\nAfter he parks in the street he's going to walk up and knock on your door and when you let 'em in he's going to say I'm here to take care of your air conditioner or your for his or your heat pump\nAnd he'll reached down and put on shoe covers over his shoes or boots we also call them for savers he's going to wear those each time he enters your house they'll\nShow you the inspection and cleaning form and he'll say something like each of these represents a part of your heating and cooling system and as I'm going through your system I'm either going to mark okay or if I see anything ah that's going to give you challenges in the future I'm In a market\nIn this column over here and if you want me to take care of something before I leave I usually can now once he has your approval to do the tune up on his own voice\nAnd if you want me to take care of something before I leave I usually can\nNow once he has your approval to do the tune up on his invoice they'll ask you to show him the thermostat and with your permission he'll turn it on and make sure that it's working\nNext to ask you to show him the outdoor unit and then the indoor unit at which point he'll say something like I'm going to start your tune up now if you wanna watch that's fine and if not that's okay too and then he'll start the tuna\nNow his very first task is to take the top off of the outdoor air conditioning unit or heat pump\nAs we get the leaves and sticks in mud and debris out of the system because all that stuff holds water and Ross out the bottom of your air conditioner prematurely\nNext thing you know your compressors falling through the bottom of a unit and you've got to get in the new one okay so something as simple as getting the debris out of the bottom makes a huge difference\nNow the next step in my opinion is the best we're going to use a semi high pressure nozzle just sprayed down your coils from the inside out because we've got the top off\nNow this is on your outdoor air conditioning unit right\nAnd it sucks air in from the sides and along with it grass clippings and dust and whatnot so we're going to back flush it wash all that gunk back out of there and if you've got all that stuff stuck in your air conditioning system it's just like having a sweater on that baby\nNow listeners if you were I we're going to go for a jog a hot summer's day with a sweater on and destroying our mouth what would happen right our bodies wouldn't be able to release the heat and we'd get really really hot well\nThe same thing happens to your outdoor unit your air conditioner your heat pump if it's dirty it's going to overheat it's going to cause problems you're going to have a compressor fail you're going to have motors fail\nThe number one cause of compressor failure is dirty coils so we're going to get the outdoor coils cleaned up for you\nSometimes we even have to use a foaming cleanser to get all that stuff off and men is that a sight to see you're looking at a good forty five minutes just up to this point so you can see why I say these other maintenance is our drive by maintenance is right if their mayor and gone and forty five minutes\nNext we're going to test the electrical components in your system all the connections make sure they're nice in tight makes you you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires because sometimes little things that go wrong with your air conditioning system and furnish\nThey can cause big things to go wrong All right\nYou may have a pending compressor failure because you've got a little started it's
