master control a big baby you're telling me a story off air which will tie in nicely with what I wanted to talk about a couple of things are relating to family\nParental behavior child behavior you hear that kids can say the darnedest things sometimes they say the most hurtful things and I'm curious how we respond when it when they do that\nUm sometimes parents do some pretty dumb thing there is one mom in Ohio actually got arrested her dumb parenting behavior but I Would argue sometimes it's okay to be dumb it doesn't have to be criminal share that story with you\nBut the one you were telling me about is a young in a little taek apparently is burning through mommy and daddy's cash\nOr yes a two year old toddler\nShrewd money\nThat they've been saving a that's not good yeah I mean you know mom and dad was you know when they have Joe ... those showing a phone you know here ... and the shredder yeah well they had one thousand and sixty dollars I'm Alone blow up\n[laughter] and the dog or women the drawer when they were looking and decided he was going to continue to shred own little uh the Benjamin shredded I Can't believe that\nI'm just proud that they have a thousand dollars and sixty and bringing it up\nI think so I think Dave Ramsey will be brown read the little nest egg\nWell I Hope the warden in there you know in their little ...\nWho wrote [laughter]\nBut as

Sunday Morning program at CBS in the morning I don't know what it's called um\nA number of months ago that could actually help this couple who they had their cash shredded there's actually some sort of department for cash recovery so if you have some bills that let's say they accidentally get cut in half\nOr they get burned or they're staying something happens or damage you can't use them you can send them in and they can be accounted for put back together and then new money can be returned to use so it's not a complete\nLoss cause I don't quite know how you turn in a\nWhile if ... you gonna put them back together to get a oh way around [laughter] I don't know but I think I Would really be trying to learn how to do puzzles [laughter] [laughter]\nIt's funny because when I went to Washington DC is a little kid we went on a field trip and fifth grade and I remember buying a bag\nOf shredded cash you know I don't know is it a couple of bucks and you got whole bag was like a hundred dollars or shredded gas so maybe a bit shredded they can't repair it because you're right at that point anybody can be turning in the uh the shredded and they're trying to get back money for it but uh that's no good when I tell you about this mom\nIn Ohio\nAnd you tell me whether what she did is dumb or if it's dumb and criminal cannot think we'll probably agree that it's pretty dumb

also ended viable to put it on Facebook which she did\n\nThis ten year old mom got tired of her son asking for something and asking for something and asking for something against you just couldn't

won't quit asking for something and so it seems to me it wasn't like she wanted her kid to have it she just wanted the kids get rid of the peace and quiet and so it meant she was going to have to risk

that I could say yeah I'll put that on there for ever\nFor the San Diego chargers I get it I understand ... okay it'd be pretty good um yeah it's a it's what's odd to me is not so much that more and more people have tattoos but the number of young people who have them in what I Would describe is kind of odd places\nSo you girls with a little thing behind the ear ride or the ankle or whatever\nBut having been around a lot of twenty somethings working at a restaurant or not too long ago\nGirls are getting stuff on there not goals I mean there are no they're not golf I mean I've seen the risk

in Iran and and he voted yeah no report also so a show that very much does what [laughter] benefit them at the time I\nTried to ride it does seem that way how do you think the cabin are confirmation will go this weekend I\nMade the case last hour I think we're going to have one or two Republicans who might surprise us with a no vote what do you think\nUh yeah I think that match in West Virginia I Believe it or a vote for it and say OK yeah and I believe in women's done All right right yeah so I I feel I feel\nLike this actually fired up through a lot more that was\nAll this started downhill very quickly on about July the town\nWhen Schumer said that we're going to do everything we can to stop this nomination and you can look back eighty seven days and you can see that everything but whether he's qualified to serve has been brought up brought up\nI tried to come and I think are carried out what I promised immediately that we want to have a fair and thorough process we had a\nFair and thorough process and I think that's vast demonstrated by the fact that we the minute Iran about who the person was in the Feinstein ladder Dr Ford\nI read about her name and the paper we got on it right away to provide the forum she wanted an intern we provide the same forum for Kavanaugh\nBut what I've been dealing with since July the towns the downhill slope that show has put us on Israeli dealing with a demolition derby [noise]\nAnd we're seeing just about destroyed a good person to be on the Supreme Court\nSo hopefully we're forty eight hours away from having a new person on the screen for [noise]\nA certain endorse everything that's a\nLittle jump in here that sounds good a Republican gathering talking about the uh the process it was funny we both chuckled off Mike there but the demolition derby is how ... grassy revert to the breath says from the Democrats he says he feels pretty good with the forty eight hours from now\nYou sound a little a little irate in retrospect when he's looking back at all that he had to go through in order to be at that point\nOr how they came out he wasn't on hands but there was a level of get off my lawn [laughter] there was a very short so we'll see let me let me uh Andrea\nLay out kind of the the feeling that I've had today that I've shared is not a prediction it's just kind of my guts is my gut right or wrong who even knows we'll wait and see [noise]\nI feel like we're going to get a Republican or to\nWho to position themselves for the future and to not that any of us can determine how we're remembered but we all try to make the case of how we want to be remembered I think you're going to have a Republican or two on Saturday who's going to surprise is with a no vote now I don't know that's going to be ...\nI don't know if that's going to be Jeff Flake I don't know who is going to be exactly when I was making the case that you had John McCain saying he would vote for the repeal of Obamacare begin then coming back to Washington to give it a thumbs down yeah to kill the repeal\nWe had when Trump with getting the nomination at the convention two summers ago Ted Cruz taken the stage and not offering an endorsement of Trump but rather vote your conscience and everybody\nAt the convention two summers ago Ted Cruz taken the stage and not offering an endorsement of Trump but rather vote your conscience and everybody boot because when he was saying this vote but you may not want to vote for this guy [noise] I just wouldn't be surprised if we have a Republican who might want\nCabin out to be confirmed but doesn't necessarily want to be linked to this mess and to position themselves for the future might vote no am I crazy\nI anything's possible anything's certainly possible but I Would think\nIt would be an absolute crazy suicidal political move because let's say ... for example he comes from the state of Nebraska right the people in Nebraska as well as people in Alabama want Kavanaugh can for confirmed a lot of the red states that\nWere in favor of Trump voted heavily for Trump won the state for Trump want Kavanaugh in this has become\nUm this has become a much deeper this guy's become almost a folklore he wrote because he's a guy who likes\nBeer and baseball and as you know been a a faithful husband to his wife number I had been discovered on that end he's treated women with respect he cares for his two daughters he coaches other girls and there's not a smidgen of\nCorruption other than what this thing was drawn up from thirty six years ago there hasn't been proven so he's a folk hero in a sense do American people so is Ben Sasse wants to ... committed political suicide he would go vote no\nThis is what I Wonder that in the past it seemed as though he was going to vote yes and still may you still may but Ben Sasse\nOn the Senate floor said early in the summer I urged President Trump not to pick cabinet I told him for a variety of reasons really yeah me too I think if you're trying to be cute is he trying to have it both ways it'd be pulling a Jeff Flake of\nOur vote but I'm not ready to vote I Need more investigation before I can vote what has been trying to communicate\nYou just simply virtuous virtue signaling okay he's basically saying I ... I could we my wonderful wonderful insight you would have prevented this like heck it would\nHave to ask because the Democrats\nWould have gone over he could've he could have nominated Mother Teresa incarnate and and they would have gone against\nA that nomination so you just you just basically saying look I my wonderful wisdom and the the moderate position that I liked to have [laughter] I was able to receive this problem if they had only listen to me we could we could have saved ourselves to three weeks of mess that we just had and so\nI'm just putting it out there\nMy wonderful virtue signaling a form of you are you are you in person and hammer me I [laughter] I'm not good at it as I Know that I really meant to be added to 'cause I Am\nProbably guilty of that as well of we want to play in the middle of I'm voting but don't read into my vote to me too much and that's kind of it for me and my whole life of\nI think we want to be known obviously by our actions and our words but also our motivations right because particularly in politics people's votes can then be ascribed motivations that were not intended\nSo I don't think they've been fast wants to be seen with some of the treatment and commentary that Dr Ford has had it's not that he's saying she's alive but it's like hey I like Brett Kavanaugh I think you can do a good job I'm going to vote for him but don't that don't take that as me calling her a liar you know what I mean\nA yes they want it both ways right basically I like don't don't pin me down is that whole that don't make me have to really\nI mean a yes they want it both ways right basically I like don't don't pin me down is that whole that don't make me have to really\nReally decide squishy on the [laughter] that's what I think ... might be doing that but uh I think ultimately he would be an absolute\nIdiots to vote no yeah I I don't I don't see it happening\nLet's take a break when we come back we're we've got other things to talk about I Do want to get some ah thoughts Amazon\nIs raising the or what their pay for for minimum wage another company has been a a four day work week I wanted to talk about maybe next hour\nOf if you could choose between more pay more time off like three day weekends or vacation would you prefer but between now and then I Want to give an opportunity if you don't mind to share with us some of the thoughts because I Would love to watch your transformation\nFrom Trump is a crazy man who jumps may be my hero because even one thing to watch over the last couple\nOf it really has happened that cannot believe that our our old friend Jim Moore is laughing right [laughter] maybe get only or a bad cell\nPhone number here two oh five nine four one one one one toll free one eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three recipe Andrea ... is big David support faction today\nAmerica where common sense is not so come and\nDo you want to melt fat yet Tony didn't have the body you always want it then you need to check out science try fitness through high intensity interval training and nutrition education I even tried to get healthy trend setting gain muscle\nIron thread is currently looking for forty locals who want to participate in a free six weeks challenge that is guaranteed to get the results [noise] with that challenge you'll get accustomed meal plan\nPersonal accountability grocery list and so much more as long as you read your home late to challenge is absolutely free contact your closest tries today to\nFind out more head guys this is Thomas ... we're talking about our service milk ... meals which is middle forever but you can pick up on Monday afternoon so what we do is we have meals and we have food by the ... you can take it home and have\nAll week for what this does is it makes your life easier it keeps you out to dry food feasts you also point with what you're trying to ...

protector against al Qaeda who we are aiding 'cause they're the ones masquerading as rebels\nWell I'll tell you what do the whole situation with Syria is a mess and it was created as a mess long before Trump came in and I think right now only right now do you write about with that\nYou're right I ... a a bomber started aiding them and unfortunately I don't know that Trump I think is try to

they're not being rude\nBeg your Danny for the call we're going to move on to jak that was pretty bad I Apologize forgive me see ... percent of ugly things jak welcome\nEighth thank you for taking my call I Want to take just to vote in a talk about what I call the fake Trump caviar let's hear it and that's the one where\nPeople say well you know I like what Trump's doing and and I like a lot of these policies but boy I Wish you wouldn't I Wish you wouldn't treat ... tweets that much and I\nI Wish he would say several of the things he says and I submit to you that there is a very substantial percentage of that population that says that that actually really likes that tweet and they like court he says it does\nBut they don't want to say it to get into arguments and offend people and I think it's that on a scientific sample of at least one\n[laughter] I mean that's what I Am a\nI have I have supported Trump verbally to a group of people and then I put that\nCathy auto and to just tamp down a little bit short and I can tell you I get\nA lot more satisfaction out at Trump's tweets and comments that I Do this satisfaction so I I Believe that theory and I think there's a lot of people and I think that's one of the reason the pollsters get so far off the air people\nHedging on Trump and there are only doing it for self protection and that's kinda my thought that I'd like to hear yours on that I'm older I hang up relatively tall\nAlright thanks jak for the call I think he's absolutely right in that sense I think\nHave been halted dated into\nI think he's absolutely right in that sense I think we have been\nCultivated into our culture has a it's certainly the ... the liberals and Democrats have cultivated this idea that we all have to be nice\nNice is that a good faith and even nicer good thing nice\nIs not a virtue no it's not a virtue nice is simply\nThe way in which you present a thought or idea so you can nicely put forward a hideous idea right you can nicely put for a fourth a good idea or you can really do it either way\nSo that is really the choice in how you present whether it's going to cause a lot of fireworks or\nOr maybe cause people to think um or cause people to go on the defensive and try and figure out where they stand so nice is just simply avoiding a conflict that is all it is not a virtue I'm Wondering if not a character\nUm it's not a character asset if I should if that's the right word a character what's the word I'm looking for\nA personality trait yeah I guess yeah it's a decision on how you present that's nothing else\nSo why not gone through my whole life thinking I'm supposed to be nice is it 'cause I was infected with liberalism other young age what happened\nWell I Know it's not necessarily a sign of liberalism I just think liberalism in part of our culture even Christianity has has put forth this idea that\n... if we're really uh it's a virtue to be nice\nWhen it's not when we're presenting truth is going to butt up against the opposite of truth if we present a certain idea it's going to be in conflict and so we don't have to present it in a nasty way but that doesn't mean we have to be nice\nI don't I don't disagree with that and my problem with Trump is it all the way that it's not simply knife sometimes it seems\nMain end untrue you know what I mean\nI just think he labels people as enemies as liars he dismisses dismissive of his critics often times he will say something\nIs proven to be untrue or it's opposite of what he said in the past then evidence will be offered to show that is untrue okay but he attacks hang on let me let me just\nLet me just say this has he insulted you think is so way off that it didn't turn out down the road that he was actually right say again who did he who has he\nInsulted you feel was so way often so opposite of the truth that we actually down the road found out he was way off\nIt's a whole fake news thing because sometimes he will label things fake news that are false like something is misreported but fake news is when someone deliberately goes out of their way to prevent something that is false sometimes ah yeah but\nThey're telling you there is fake news even in the mistakes quote unquote of ...\nBut ... but he ... he seems to he's seems to me to label to just a huge broad brush and at some point we often make generalizations not every time can every single person's\nSkin to individual comments but I feel like anything that is negative towards him is in described as fake news it can be it was on complementary\nFinding this thing the way they ... they found it\nI didn't think it'd be a Republican you got to vote yes you may never get another opportunity because if the midterms don't go your direction and we don't know how twenty twenty plays out you may never get another chance to put a conservative justice that would really tilt the balance of power\nOn the court so I think if you have a vote you vote yes for Kavanaugh\nBut and you let me ask you this let's let's say he does get confirmed whether it be by one vote majority or even a couple when it comes down to his first couple of years on the court\nHe's going to be viewed and scrutinized in articles that can be written about him do you worry that that will sway him to perhaps\nRule in a more moderate way that he might have had he had to smooth confirmation\nOr what do you mean what do you mean moderate are veering away from the right to the end it'll yes now I think it I mean if if it's going to have an effect\nIn in reality I don't think it will\n... he's going to go more against the left\nThan anything because the way he treated and I'm fine with that I think that's great I that's that's the silver lining\nHere ... going to go the other way and say see not that he would come out and say publicly but kind of by his ruling the y'all were wrong about me I'm not the monster you say\nNot only have ... the Democrats have a bad guy and Kavanaugh because he's a constitutional as they've made him a a an enemy just from the way they've treated him\nGuy and Kavanaugh because he's a constitutional is they've made him a a a an enemy just from the way they've treated him yeah so now not only have you got a quote unquote conservative going on the Supreme Court you got a conservative they hate your guts because of the way he treated\nLet's see what misty has to say it's Ford faction Russell be Andrew maclean a big day but as well misty go ahead\n[noise] All right I got Kay thanks for you ready one the caller before me on it about the cut out I was going to call it remind\nYou live you don't need to remind me of a beautiful\nCut out of Hillary\nI think you were staying away for sugar at the economy we're just getting a little calming you didn't really know what you're doing\nAll right so\nAsk you this missing and then we'll get to a point number two you got another but time so you were in my position you show up at a dinner party this was in downtown Birmingham with a friend of a friend of a friend so I'm with a friend that going to a party of her friends friends\nFree loading of somebody else's party like Democrats\nDo I do this all the time when I arrive\nPeople don't know maybe they don't know my friend they hardly know my friend's friend but I'm eating their food am enjoying them every day and I look in the corner and hey look you there there's a cardboard cutout life size of one Hillary Clinton that's the most interesting person in the room\nYou can take a photo now maybe\nI shouldn't have had the warm embrace and the smile on my face in one leg hiked up around or the way I did but it made for good photo\nI could think of the other thing that would have made\nFor [laughter] I don't know these people I Can't to face\nThe cardboard cutout of Madam Secretary I had to be a man of genteel nature I had to be ...\nI Can't I Can't get over the fact that the guy that I made a big production out of pictures with Hillary Clinton was the free motor at the bar to [laughter] I Can't get past that [laughter]\nWell maybe he's hoping to get on Hillary Hanan like help her when she all went down and everything\nThat's right and there were some honey bunny liberals there and they did not care for me they didn't care what I did for a living I was ready to tell them about how I Am a radio star how I Am Andrew maclean\nIs what I was going to say but instead they didn't care who this guy whatever it is fun very misty what's your second point I'm sad [laughter]\nMy second point is whatever the dust that big David playing it usually is also at it but that last thought I Would rather hear hear Hillary talk then listen\nTo our oh [laughter] oh she's having none of your hip hop\nAnd now he can't go [laughter] [laughter] I think usually do a great job will\n... mother fans Russell we were talking about the rubber and he asked is all I ...
