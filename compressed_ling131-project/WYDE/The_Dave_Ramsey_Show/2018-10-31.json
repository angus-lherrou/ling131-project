some of the spooky soundbites of political leaders out there or political wannabes a more more in keeping with Obama 'cause he's out of the picture now or at least these I Wish you would be\nHe tries to get back in tries to camera hog every now and then um bad news for ABC\nThe Connors which is an episode of TV episode without Roseanne remember it's the ... where she dies because they just couldn't tolerate\nHer one comment about Valerie Jarrett\nAnd the way she looks\nSo they kick Roseanne to the curb and they re boots the\nThe Roseanne show to the Connors well turns out that the ... came back a couple of weeks ago maybe they've gotten two episodes out I don't know I don't watch but everything that whole episode has plummeted in the ratings I mean\nPlummeted it's not even showing up I think on the ratings graph in the church so ABC has only ordered one more episode\nSo that's the Halloween news for those on the cast of the ... they're they're about to head into the darkness and be taken off the air in just a matter of one episode that's how bad it is\nAnd that's what the ... where they've brought in writers and everything to try and make this happen pretty pathetic that that they couldn't see this coming is just amazing to me\nThey were too blinded by their desire for revenge on Roseanne and The Revenge or their sanctimonious punishment of her\nNever ... never mind all the pedophiles that are roaming through Hollywood that they won't lifted a finger against including the guy who had all do really creepy tweets and I can't think of his name he's the director for\nA guardians of the galaxy\nCan't think of his name and I'm I'm not interested in Googling it right now because I don't I'm mad at Google and don't want to use it let's go to Brenda hey welcome to the Ford faction\nHigh of almost lost my train of thought I think that's so funny what you just tell them\nOh really [laughter] okay that this has the consumer has how\nYeah you're right that's a good point Brenda finally it we should remember that we do have power just the power of not watching\nAnd and dollars ah when I go out to shop and find clothes at night any anything like that if we really choose type ... or whatever eventually might be it shows up [noise] okay I have my aunt just scrambled I'm not talking about ... unfortunately\nI talk about you guys going off the air\nUm so I I began to hear something I Want to think a couple of years ago a rush them out and talk about that it might be that\nUm I've actually shows like he is in yours would not be allowed to be on the radio and it was just kind of hard to imagine that would be a time now I don't know the ins and outs why you guys are not going to be on the radio and I think this has absolutely nothing to do with that but then when you say what you did about Google and\nYour associates said aren't going to be in different areas on the Internet\nWhat you did about Google and your associates said are going to be in different areas on the Internet\nIt concerns me that maybe they won't be able to stay on their maybe they'll get it because of their um believes and what they're willing to put out there if they still do it and the form that they have on this radio station all these years you know I spoke the truth and\nRight and the other thing is people\nThat don't have computers I mean\nThey your show is meant so much to give people the facts about politics in particular or when we didn't really know who was saying why and it gives us a little guidance to think about and search for ourselves to know who to vote for\nThere is just going to so many people are going to lose it because you you won't have a radio which is so convenient and plus you know maybe if you're doing something outside or whatever and you are\nYou put of turn the radio on and you can hear it wherever you are on the outside but\nThat you don't have a computer and so there is going to be hundreds and hundreds of people that are going to lose your altogether and that's just a big concern for me as conservative as a Christian\nYeah Brenda I hear you and I don't have an answer to your concerns I Wish I could\n... you know a lay them but I Can't I'm I understand your concerns completely I I Believe\nThat's a legitimate this station has a huge tower that covers half the state and the ... radio has ... ... is an incredible medium\nThat's why I like it so much it's a companion for people they can take it anywhere while they're doing anything doing the laundry walk working on the car doing dishes walking the dog\nThere is no ban on you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy band so what do we do about that\nCan you believe this [laughter] a travel ban he's well there's no travel ban [laughter] off white guys gift as Don Lemon is\nMarried to a white guy in case you didn't know that\nBut apparently all the white guys out there are being radicalized I Wonder is is is he sleeping with the enemy like that ... that movie that Julia Roberts was in who he needs to start in a remake stern\nDon Lemon sleeping with the enemy I'm going to play this again I Want you to get the full effect of this\n[noise] hang on ...\nYou have to stop every game and I think people and realize the biggest her for in this country is white men most of them radicalized ... fell to the right\nAnd we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nThere is no fan on you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy band so what do we do about it\nAfter ... okay so the first part is it's unbelievable how he contradict themselves first of all he says we've got to start we've got to stop demonizing people okay\nSure how do you demonize people you use words you use very very uh unflattering\nFalse labels extreme labels on people in order to demonize them because basically the whole essence of of demonize is to create something far more evil and insidious in someone's actions\nThan what's really there right so don't demonize dawn says don't demonize\nLet's demonize [laughter] that's what he's doing how can you talk\nTo both sides of the mouth in one thirty second statement and not get kicked off of CNN for failure to just even be a consistent journalist never mind making sense he's just not even consistent\nSo\nCan't demonize people we need to stop but at the same time I'm about to demonize a whole group of people\nWhite men there radicalized okay that's a that's a label what does that imply when you use radicalized that these people are in their basement building bombs ready to kill people here in the U. S.\nThat imply when you use radicalized that these people are in their basement building bombs ready to kill people here in the U.S white guys\nJust flat out white guys he he doesn't even give them a political leaning just everybody except maybe as boyfriend I guess he's the only guy he trusts\nSo all the white guys out there are radicalized and they're all ready to do damage\nTo their own country I mean that is what radicalized means\nSo that's Don Lemon that is a scary scary soundbite I'm going to go towards the middle and then play one more\nTime and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nThere was no ban on you have a Muslim ban there is no white guy ban so what do we do about\nOh so we've got to start doing something about them lemon Don Lemon because we can't ban them\nSo in this case the bans good but we just don't have it however the Muslim ban that was bad\nEven though it was designed to stop the actual radicals from coming in oh I get this lemon lemon this is great this is just perfect sense Mike welcome into the force action what\nDo you think well two things there are a few things that are demonize less in this country right now than\nConservatives whether it be male female white black oh you've got to do is be conservative and your thought\nProcess and you're automatically demonize\nYes isn't that a tree and then with\nA Marsha Blackburn I Would uh [noise] I Would question whether or not you could pull up any of footage of any of the uh antifa protests\nAnd uh\nIf you could surely to goodness from what I see they are far more vile than what this ad is what you hear from them and see from them if there's footage of that on there that I Would sue them for discrimination and use that as my basis\nSure yeah in fact there was a guy uh who recently was\nPart of a rally he was part of the antifa and the woman in front of them they were crossing the road this is the video ah found out was just raining this woman and it turns out she's the widow of the nine eleven\nA firefighter and she mentioned that and he just continued on with unbelievable profanity directed at her\nSaying it was a good thing or husband was killed in nine eleven it was it was just horrendous what was said yeah it's it's amazing that did at her own rally she ... covered this incident she didn't pull it or take it\nFrom sources unknown or that she wasn't authorized to do she ... she took it from her own rally where it happened and she didn't doctor it up in any way and yet they're telling her you know\nWhat happened to you wasn't legitimate and you can't use it for your own campaign it's amazing amazing\nBut they do they put something as as file as any protest from the or antifa movement or on their uh system yeah and that's fine\nThat's fine\nBut I mean you hear all the all Garrett jeeze long at every body at these in chief up\nA ... well I call the riots more than anything you're right they're not a march there were riots\nAnd the and that's okay now we can watch that all day long uh every little\nAnything you're right they're not a march there were riots and the and that's okay\nNow we can watch that all day long uh every little bit of it but to see somebody shouted down a and it's the only reason the only reason they do it if they agree with the fact that she was shouted down because\nIf they were in any way at all outraged by what happened outraged by the fact that they it during a moment of silence they would put that out there but\nThey're not no so you know\nNothing more than a political leaning on their part and a full body you have the wherewithal to start up another oh system such as theirs they might be surprised at the exit is that the that they experience for their services\nYes yes Mike I Would love to see that happen I really would thanks for the call I appreciate it a Google needs competition because they've gotten too big and they are willing to throw around their weight in their leverage as\nIs evidenced by what they just did the black burn in Tennessee and her Senate campaign trying to use actual coverage at in an add to\nIt they have the right to do what had happened on in and around their rally so they have every right to cover it and yet they're telling her that it's just it's too disturbing and it doesn't fit their standard Google standard no it means they're liberal leaning and they are\nThey're trying to to squelch things ahead of the mid term there's no doubt about it and unfortunately we don't have an alternative right now in order to fight back and take our loyalties elsewhere and not use Google\nI Do use duct that go on my phone just as a it's a search engine that you can do I never tried it on my computer 'cause I don't know I'll have to try Karen welcome to the Ford faction thanks for calling\nHi I I have such issues with this um with black people tongue into\nWhite people and um when you consider how many people in the public sector nowadays uh including President Obama are are part white and and some of them obviously so\nHow can they um look white people and it's and assume that there's no black in them and I want to know\nYou know since not only are a lot of them part white but they're married to white people\n[laughter] how about they they say what percentage of white it's OK eat you know or or and they have to be pure white and who can prove that they're pure white it's just\nYou know it just doesn't make sense\nYeah it's just amazing that he would label a whole group he was very very broad in his labeling and there's no there is absolutely no kick back on that he will still retain his job I have no doubt about it but\nIf someone else on the other side someone like oh I don't know Megan Kelly\nWho mentioned it lacks face in went into that whole thing which I don't\nFrom what I understand she was just questioning why it's a is considered offensive for Halloween because it's still part of a costume I'm not quite sure of that whole thing but nevertheless she's gone at NBC they found a reason to kick her out they already planned that and they just use that\nAnd that and they just use that to a painter as a racist or or insensitive at the very least to get rid of her it's amazing what the other side of getting away with\nInsult apparently and she's like what happened why\n... why in Twenty years has it has its switched so she just raising a question and now the CNN person takes that as a an ... masking\nOf Kelly as a full fledged racist or out of the closet racist is what she said I Wonder if the same woman rocks and Jones is going to say anything\nMuch less anything critical about Don lemons remark that categorically lumped all white men as radicalized people who need to be banned but can't unfortunately he wants to use the ban on them but\nForget the travel ban they can't be banned but something has to be done\nSo lemons gonna go Scott Free on this oh maybe I Can't use the word Scott because that's referring to this particular\nSo lemons gonna go Scott Free on this oh maybe I Can't use the word Scott because that's referring to this particular I don't know how to check my political correctness the dictionary I don't have it I'm In trouble\nSo he's going to walk away he's going to skate free\nAnd are you going to continue to pull a paycheck and work on CNN meanwhile CNN gonna castigate Megan Kelly\nFor those comments and and read far more into it that she's a racist just for simply asking the question it's also interesting on Twitter this is what a Megan Kelly recently tweeted out as it today\nAnd I noticed is on daily mail because I scan that in the mornings they had these pictures of a Megan Kelly with donuts\nAnd the and the headline says Kelly trying to bribe media with donut says she heads out and then it showed a picture of her husband looking out the window as she leaves\nAnd so she tweeted this for a week paparazzi has been lurking outside my home day and night finally today I took my kids to school I went out a loan first offered them doughnuts and beg them to just take a picture of me and then to leave my kids alone when they emerged\nAll of them were nice except the daily mail and then she goes on with another tweet the daily mail went on to publish photos of my husband in our home and then a a foot of a pick of my kids they trailed my daughter they trailers to my daughter's school and secretly videotape my seven year old child along with a classmate\nAnd posted it then she puts in all caps this is not right I agree I I agree Megan Kelly this is wrong to be to be done her child has been stalked and videotaped and posted to a major media outlet\nAnd it is wrong for her to be treated this way and all the while in that same city Don Lemon is going to walk around\nAnd no one's going to do a thing it is a very very scary double standard Toni welcome into the Ford faction what'd you got\n[noise] hey I'm so in that same vein that you said we're like you said that you saw the uh [noise] you said about begging Kelly the liberals are uh some liberals hate\n'em conservatives are in that same vein of it's just an observation this isn't a call to arms or anything like that just a simple observation I'm not even saying that I'm left leaning er right leaning but an observation it seems to me that some of the radical left are begging for civil war\nAnd my question to those people are\nOf a forgotten which side owns all the guns just love the race and you'll have a good when I'm going to miss you guys\nAll right Thanks Tony I appreciate it very much [noise] All right onto Henry Hey welcome in\nOh thank you um [noise] what I'm concerned with as a citizen has the United states is how could Don Lemon and make a statement like that and with all the Caucasian men in this country they don't posters and demand that he'd be taken off the air\nOthers are another thing that concerns me is that President Obama never in my life which I'm Seventy five years old never seen of president leaves the White House and constantly criticized\nAnd go against the president's that's anger now ... never seen that in my entire life and I don't see how our entire country can see through what's going on and the other thing is I just saw were veterans of protesting that Donald Trump\nWhat's going on and the other thing is I just saw where\nVeterans of protesting that Donald Trump president Donald Trump has decided to send a soldier's down to the border to protect all boys I thought that we were fighting for when we were overseas will bite and protect our borders I just don't understand\nHow good Christian people in America black or white I'm not talking about color or working shit by watched a Super Bowl running around doing that there was talk on the phone and not pay attention to what's going on our country\nHenry you bring some good questions to the table\nI I don't even have the answer but I'm Glad you brought 'em out your right why aren't if these people the white people that don't limit the white men that Don lemme refers to are so radicalized how come he's walking around a without any\nBody guards or you know he he's able to continue on with his job without threats like ah like Megan Kelly is not\nIt it it is amazing he's demonizing the wrong group obviously Henry thanks for the call I got to go to a break I really appreciate your bringing it up I think there are good questions\nObama is out there mocking the president and the Republicans who mocked him when he was in office that had been in the White House before George W. Bush no George W. Bush was busy painting pictures in Texas\nLeaving him alone Obama never had to deal with the conflict or the opposition that Trump has to deal with from the press from the Democrats and now from him\nAll right we've got to take a break I'll be back on the other side this time it's flying by we got lots of talk about still more scary soundbites ahead below sea Hillary Clinton spine chilling keep you up at night on this Halloween\nAmerica where common sense is not so come and\nDo you want to melt fat get toned and have the body you've always wanted then you need to check out iron try fitness through high intensity interval training and nutrition education or you're trying to get healthy trend setting gain muscle\nIron try this currently looking for forty locals who want to participate in a free six we challenge that his parents is to get the results [noise] with that challenge you'll get a cup of milk plant\nPersonal accountability grocery list and so much more as long as you reach your goal wait the challenge is absolutely free contact your closest tries today to find out more\nHad guys this is Thomas Koch for milk ... we're talking about our service milk for meals which is middle forever but you could pick up on Monday afternoon so what we do is we have meals and we have food houses you could take it home and have\nAll week long what this does is it makes your life easier keeps you out to dry food if you also point with what you're trying to see ...

really not I don't need to I don't need to add any more frightened to what we what we could have had in the White House again if if Trump hadn't been put in place I'm going to play it again\nWell let me scroll through here all started in the middle here we go\nWhen he walked out she says that in and choose the and we're just three of us in the room and then the one person that she brought something him and it wasn't or pleasure and that's one of them\nSo you are alone with Hillary after the black guy bring something good Hillary does of like and she said to you that an word ...\nYep there you go wicked witch of the west exposed more and more each day\nIsn't it appropriate that just a few days ago when she was doing some sort of question and answer\nAnd Eric Holder and Cory Booker were brought into the mix and was confused by the lady mentioning then that she corrected the lady and then said oh you can't tell them apart or they all look alike\nSomething to that effect and now we have this yeah the wicked\nWitch of the west exposed right on Halloween candy for her Dwayne welcome into the Ford faction\nHey are you there Twain yes okay higher but that's that's all right\nUm

didn't want to say anything until I could confirm it but yeah that's what I read\nAnd the thing is is that you know I cringe at the fact is that that's the image I mean you already have people that say that Christians are so full of hay and I credit is the fact that she is representing us as Christian\nIt's very cringe worthy along with those Methodist ministers who hijacked the speech that Jeff Sessions was doing calling I had to literally ... I'm throwing the Bible at I'm really trying to uh\nThat's what his ministers who hijacked the speech that Jeff Sessions was doing calling ... I'm a throw in the Bible at I'm really trying to uh you know virtually shame him into doing something that he has every right to do as as a government official as an authority that is God given authority\nUnbelievable yeah I Know it you're right it's it's pretty pathetic that she was that was her focus she's so hate driven\nThat wall her neighbors are grieving and all they need is someone to come along and hold them and hug them and help them\nThis is what she'll God's love yes ha not ... not yeah it's not an opportunity for you and your political hatred no and she had an opportunity to love and guess what she chose yeah it's it's pretty sad that that is one of the more disturbing sound clips honestly\nBecause she's doing it in the name of Christianity as a Presbyterian minister is pretty pathetic\nThanks to wait for the call I really appreciate it Charles welcome to the Ford faction\nJolted along the ... I'm doing great what you got\nTo do for a loan ...\nYeah you are Charles you were but you were bashing my guy for brown and I'm about ready to hit the button again so you better get to the point\nYou got ten second most or All right bye Charles\nYeah this is a radio show we have the right to a determine who called in and who doesn't Charles have a happy Halloween\nUh let's see what else the as far as scary soundbite oh yeah this one this one is very scary to me\nAh because it's these other people are kind of second bench players you know they're out of the game Obama's out of the game\nDon Lemon should be out of the game but he's ... he's on CNN so how effective is he\nHillary oh she's nasty thank goodness she's out of the game but this one oh this one is scary because this woman she's ready to get back into the game\nOh she's a big player I Know what she should dress up as for Halloween I'll tell you in a minute but let's play what she said just last night while a guest on Stephen called bear here we go\nNancy ...

gonna run down photo and Sam\nSam wide and all of the buddies there and get that ring back all those poor little hot it's just trying to get the power all those Republican hobbits trying to get the power dispersed from the big government\nTrying to allow for Americans and the inhabitants of ... of ... to have more say in their lives and not be controlled by more door and Nancy Pelosi ... gold polo see trying to track him down Jesus screaming ... race\nThat's what she is that sends chills up my spine and it should yours [noise]\nYeah there you go now to\nNancy Clark welcome to the forward faction\nHi how are you today\nOkay until I was listening to policy I'm not going to take a while for me to get back you know my composure it's scary thought\nThat you should avoid unpleasant Samuel ... as much as ...\n[laughter] yeah um I'll Try after the show I Will I'll start I'll stay away from news altogether\nWell I don't know about all that so I Apologize if you made a statement on this because I've been in and out or the radio is for the past couple of hours starting next week the you continue to do your avenues for other stations or what is your you're going to be\nYeah Clark's good question I appreciate you asking that I Will continue to do the news and we do have thirty five stations that use yellow hammer news outside of divvy Whitey eat so I don't know at this point whether Whitey in its new format we'll continue with that news or not but I Will still be putting it out there on other stations\nWhat are you talking about I'm Sorry I didn't quite you're you're real low and volume on I'm not sure are you referring to the two guys that were involved in the recent bomb and who didn't\nKnow what I see the scariest soundbite that you are playing yeah thank God but one of them decided to go kill people they see multiple multiple packages to the phones is one of the place of worship the killer [laughter] [noise]\nYeah I'm Still not getting it who met I appreciate that moment you'll you'll get it All right All right\nMaybe I'm dead so I'm not quite sure where he's headed with that bill can you help me out this is a force actually bill what what did you think of that [noise] well\nI have this kind of ironic uplifting moment as you were discussing Mr Clinton Mr Letterman's racism yeah or just truth pastor Birmingham Fire station we're in the real world there were six strongman\nReloaded who's on a fire trucks mhm working hand in hand together black and white\nThat's a good picture to bring to our mind built it really is because you're right everyday people are going about doing their thing together regardless of race and it's the people at the top\nAnd in media that can't abide by that they have to stoke the fires amen and\nLet me just say this on yellow hammer news in other outlets there's a a great article that you might want to read you know if the if the soundbites I played were a little too much and you need to a dose of the real world where people Americans love each other\nAnd are caring for each other on yellow hammer news there's a a article about a man who are helpful or a a young mother with her baby\nAnd there's a race difference and it didn't even enter into his thinking he helped her hold her the baby while she filled out or medical forms it's a great story and it's a great reminders as well as your call ... as well bill that that the everyday person is out there doing their job and they are not racist or hateful they're caring\nFor each other as fellow Americans it's a good thing it's a good reminder thank you bill appreciate\nIt and while we're ending\nHerring for each other as fellow Americans it's a good thing it's a good reminder thank you bill appreciate it\nAnd while we're ending this we're headed towards the end on a good note let me play this clip from Lindsey Graham because I'm telling you he has become quite the gladiator ever since honestly ever since John McCain passed away at sorry to say that\nI don't want to I don't mean to speak ill of the dead but something went down in the grave with John McCain that was related to Lindsey Graham there was something their documents pictures information that McCain carried to the grave\nAnd released Graham from his prison because he is a new man I'll tell you ...\nFrom the capital confirmation on this guy's relentless and he's out there a\nPromoting Republicans and just blasting Democrats for what they did with Kavanaugh and I'm In what they continue to do so I'm going to play this sound\nBy but all the main anything if you don't want any more Kavanaugh carrier assassinations\nOf and you need to reject what they did and hand them the faith they deserved they want power so badly the media is in the tank for them and the all the way they'll get it as for the American people send a loud and clear signal that we're tired of you tired of their time there's other lemming every Republican for everything yeah blaming\nEvery Republican for every thing out there even the stuff that you're doing [laughter] even the bad stuff the Democrats and liberals and socialists are doing that throw it all on the Republicans if you accuse them first then clearly clearly you're the righteous one\nYou're the accused first stand back\nUm and um make it look like it's them and the fact that you pointed it out first money's the water makes everybody think you're the you're the one spotting evil first year the self righteous person who's so quick to the draw to spot evil um let's accuse them first of the very thing we're doing\nThat way you know it seems to be working for them in in some cases\nSo grams pointing it out and saying you look these tactics of becoming more and more regular therefore we can spot them see the repeats and do you really want to reward it do you want to reward\nThe tactics if you don't then don't vote him back into power they have\nLost the right to rule they have lost our trust they've lost their credibility they are so inconsistent there's no way that you can predict how they'll behave in the future because there there's erratic an irrational so do you really want to put the keys to the car\nIn the hands of a of a maniac and then get behind in the back seat because you can't get out of the car this is America this is a democracy this\nIs our government and we can't get rid of it and we can't leave and I don't think we should I think we need to get rid of them\nSo kudos to Graham is the the final sound but I have and I figured let's let's go out on a upbeat note as we head into Halloween\nThat someone else sees through these costumes and masks that had been put on by the Democrats and the the smiley face they covered their\nTheir face their real true colors with a they smile\nThey play the game but underneath they are um they're on a path to destruction there they're consumed with hate\nAnd I I I just feel that we need to point that out as we head into the mid term elections now I Know ... ...\nAnd I I\nI just feel that we need to point that out as we head into the mid term elections now I Know Alabama Alabamians are are are strongly conservative in and see through a lot of this so I'm kinda preaching to the choir\nBut you know if you're listening and you have people in your family that are in other states\nThat um possibly maybe it's a a liberal state or a Democrat leaning state and they are reluctant to go vote because they don't think it'll count for anything they got to go vote they've got to they just got to take this exercise in in in ...\nAllowing their voice to be heard even if it doesn't do all the\nDamage or effectiveness that you want it to do it still has to happen we have to re enter this process\nOf demanding better of our leaders\nWe have to re enter this and the minimal\nWay to do that is simply by getting our butts off the chair and walk and are still down to a polling place and voting that's the least we can do to stay a part of this representative republic that we belong to and we have an obligation\nTo maintain\nThis democracy by being part of it got to take a break last segment coming and then we're headed
