I appreciate it very much\nYou're welcome to join the conversation nine four one one zero one wind or eight six six foot five one nine nine three three\nAnd then I had to a break in just a minute here we're going to continue the conversation about this growing here at the end we can't call an army we may not even be able to call it a caravan I'm thinking maybe this in in light of everything that we found out through Eighteen\nArmy we may not even be able to call it a caravan I'm thinking maybe that in in light of everything that we've found out through a pie and how they had to apologize for just using the word ragged army\nOf migrants that we better play a really safe so I'm thinking we call them south of the border trick or treaters\nThat's all and that that's safe nobody should get upset or\nTheir trick or treaters south of the border they're just coming up they're trying to find a better neighborhood to trick or treat and so can you blame them people do it all across America on Halloween they're just doing it early\nThat they're going to maybe try to be here in time for Halloween certainly the elections which is their treat\nSo maybe that's what we need to do you tell me whether I I it is it too harsh it might be too harsh apparently you know a pie was too harsh polling them ragged army\nWe don't want us well of course we know we we we're concerned they might get word of that word that description pre made piano I'm sure that'll just put the brakes on everything they're just gonna say whoa wait\nWe don't want to go to us it that's what they're going to call us I'm sure that's what the media was concerned about I don't\nKnow Don welcome to the program as soon as I hit the button hey are you there\nYes I Am here you know I Try to think critically and logical you when you look at the first of all if you never see pictures of African refugees and look at these people you weren't seeing impoverished\nRagged dressed these people are fairly fairly close or clean it got good shelters\nEvery now and he's got a backpack yes I'm throw another kid\nPot rushed third world area that these people are coming from okay they're fairly well dressed so they made me rag tag and that but they're not\nRagged and for them to say and then and if you're marching if you're marching and you have your country flag is the editor your line that is an army by definition I'm Sorry I'm\nAnd when they when they are outnumbered twenty to one males to anyone else\nOr younger male this that and when you hit somebody's border and you start being violent and you start tearing things up you lose all ... all ability to call yourself a refugee at that point you are invading force\nAgree so ca to press ooh they they got scared by\nI don't I don't care I'm not I'm not anything bud politically correct I Will call it what it is it is an organized force of illegal alien national ... coming in dark and wanting to come into our country by force\nIs necessary and they are time and I don't believe in coincidence timing is right now to coincide with coming here with our elections coming up so that when we play them at the border\nAlthough at this in this country are you going to go shady look what they did they don't care about any one at all especially these poor little refugees and I think these people or anything but or little refugees well\nDone I agree with you I this is all a political leverage we know the liberal the left the list they they they don't care about people with the only use people for the sake of their political leverage and\nExactly how to use that us Dr Ford they use ... or the other two women\nTo to try and down traveled all it just didn't work so this is their next bullet\nThey used Dr Ford there yet or the other two women\nTo to try and down traveled all it just didn't work so this is their next bullet in a gun of their of their plan to try and take over the elections in November\nAnd it's all about that in any way any way we can\nAll the political ploy dawn and I and hopefully we can stop it early the earlier the better I I don't want it to be a showdown at the border or close to the elections I Want it to be stopped early for the sake of these people\nThat before the hundreds of miles from home they need to be sent back but let me ask you this dawn um do you think it's going to backfire like Kavanaugh did\n[noise] it's hard to say where did you get the Mexican federal rallies they tried at the southern border if they can get on to the northern border of Mexico and make them stand to\nBasically shut violence or the or the crowd is coming up here and when you like you said it's gone from three thousand seven thousand the fourteen thousand\nYes it's clear dead or any more and more people here and the other caller brought this up who's paying for this how are they getting shed our it'd be a house\nAt night where they can be protected from you as much as you do is full of cartel people and it's one of the most violent areas in the world so they get from the drug\nCartel has it in and these people don't have any any uh it'll it'll giving about going wrong for New Mexico and drew the oldest cartel country\nTo get to our border and shopping is telling me that pitch base is to set up I just you know I have to think critically logically about this and I like I said I don't believe in coincidence\n[noise] no I agree I if anything they should uh I Would like to see the Mexican police target this these groups in the dead of night only the men leave the women and children let them work their way back or offered them buses after it's all taking but take these guys out with whatever tear gas is necessary to disabling load 'em up\nShip 'em back in a bus target all the nails and get them out there and then you\nKnow we're here to provide the buses right\nRight thanks for the call Don I appreciate it All right you're listening to the Ford facts and we have just a couple of minutes left before the bottom of the break um\nWe were talking about the Associated Press in their ... their immediate regret an apology for using a certain term it was too much it was just too harsh and if the if if word got back to these caravans that they were using the term ragged army I mean gosh it would just\nCompletely break their hearts it would completely offend them completely turn them off even coming to the U.S maybe\nBecause I mean ... calling you ragged armies that that's low so um so I proposed the idea that we we called in South of the border trick or treaters they're just coming up\nTo the U.S 'cause it's a better neighborhood and they're picking a better richer neighborhoods to trick or treat and they're asking you you the taxpayer\nTo start getting ready\nTo get those treat bags ready All right we're going to talk about that what that treat bag looks like\nOh you taxpayers out there listening going to and from work today listening to the radio you you need to get on it because they're coming and they're only a few weeks away\nAnd they might even if they get help you know from Mexico and all these other people's George Soros they might have some buses are on the sidelines you know you never know the people with some pickup trucks and they might get your sooner they might get it right into ever Halloween if they don't get here and time for for for the November ...\nI'd lines you know you never know and some people with some pick up trucks and they might get here so they might get it right into ever Halloween if they don't get here and time for for for the November midterm so you're the taxpayer money you're being asked to get your little treat bags ready\nNo matter where you work what do you got to contribute you will be contributing whether you like it or not so let's talk about this treat bag that come in for you it we're going to do that in a little bit\nBut for now do we need to take a break the Brits are my\nWell it's almost that time we have about\nThirty second thirty seconds I got to fill it just as I Would leading up to a nice drop the Mike moment which is\nI mean that's the sign that I'm not the professional I Need to be having law are so anyways um as I speak I'm looking at um\nOh that's right I'm looking at Fox News by the way a tonight President Trump's going to have a huge massive rally in Houston, Texas\nOr his campaign manager Brad par skill tweeted last night I caught my eye a hundred thousand RSVP ease on line to the rally in Houston that's just those who made the effort\nWell here's a way in which they inadvertently or indirectly get those comes back because if you are given a tax cut\nBut you're working to pay off the taxes\nExtra taxes ... you're losing in so many ways you're not getting any of the tax money that you pay for taxes is not coming back to you is going to other programs other people and you're not going to see any benefit from there is no return on investment\nIn the taxes that you are currently paying so apparently according to fair the total government expenditure on illegal aliens\nI I I don't see numbers this high on a day to day basis so I'm I'm gonna have to count over okay so we've got a million so forty F ... an forty five billion eight hundred and Seventy million\nFour hundred and Seventy four thousand three hundred and thirty two that's federal\nState and local cost expenditures eighty eight billion nine hundred and Ninety two million nine hundred and eighty one thousand and thirty two ... for some total costing all Americans across the board state and local and federal\nOne hundred and thirty four billion dollars every year so far one hundred and thirty four billion eight hundred and sixty three four hundred and eight hundred and sixty three million four hundred and fifty five thousand three hundred and sixty four\nDollars so far that was twenty Seventeen that's never mind if we added one more person into this country don't don't even think about one more let alone\nFourteen thousand at this point so one hundred and thirty ... thirty four billion dollars I'm just gonna rounded up actually a hundred and thirty five billion would be more appropriate a hundred and thirty five billion dollars a year\nNow some of these illegal aliens somehow pay taxes through sales tax and things like that\nAnd they've calculated that to be Eighteen million so it it was rounded up Nineteen million so it does not make much of a dent in a hundred and thirty five billion Nineteen billion versus a hundred and thirty five\nBillion so you take away and it basically it's a hundred and sixteen billion dollars a year the taxpayers are paying\nSo that's the treat bag we've got to get ready it's going to go up that treat bags got to be beefed up more candy in it police\n'cause we got fourteen thousand people coming towards the border now so that's that's just the prior tax the prior treat bag that we were required to pay for these people these south of the border trick or treaters you know so um\n[noise] so you know if you want to carry the analogy even further and you want to throw in some um special candy bars just to help you remember\nHow illegal immigration and jumping the border and breaking the law affects everybody did you just can't turn a blind eye to it because once people come in and they they tend to like to eat\nThe border and breaking the law affects everybody did you just can't turn a blind eye to it because once people come in and they they tend to like to eat and they tend to like to drink and they tend to like to move around and they tend to like to have close so\nThey tend to gravitate towards government services to help them eat and they tend towards black market jobs where they can get paid cash under the table in order to have the money and the housing and and all that jazz\nSo so maybe we ... you know in your mind when you're thinking of the ... bag that you're paying for you know think of some ... those payday bars because if you're a business owner you're gonna feel it\nIf you're a roofing contractor if you'd have a roofing company construction company lawn care company you're going to feel it because you're trying to pay your make your payroll you tried to pay your guys a decent wage pay off all the payroll taxes\nBut here comes the group another group into the market your area who's going to undercut you because they're paying their their guys they're illegal workers\nFor less money there painted in cash they don't have to report it they don't have to log in payroll they don't have to pay taxes they can ... your your next did get the job\nAnd there you are so I say you know make sure we throw in some payday um\nCandy bars into that treat bag as a reminder that small businesses are going to get hurt by this\nWe we should also throw in some smarties I don't know if he likes parties I Do ... and that that's a reminder to all the teachers in education that that the things that programs and things that they want to use the budget money for for the students they have the legal citizens they have\nYeah that's not going to happen you're gonna have to read avert\nRedirect that money\nBecause now you've got to treat\nThese newcomers in a way where they're accommodated to learn English and they're\nSlowly somehow assimilated into the into the education program and that takes time and that takes specialty teachers teaching English as a second language and devoting their time to that\nAs opposed or whatever else you want to do just keep that in mind for when some smarties\nMaybe some uh lifesavers 'cause I'll tell you what medical system going to get taxes well\nYou're going to have to pay for\nPeople in their emergency room visits and whatever else brings them in not to mention the long term effects of all these unknown diseases\nThat are coming in that's right\nLifesavers as well if you have a candy you want to throw into this treat bag and you want to explain why feel free to call in I've got James on the line hey welcome to the ...\nTo afford faction\nHate in Salt\nWater got hurt and I'll take it so much it costs me ... let us know managed to declare martial law and in the dirt and the and it's like for all you do are you where\nDo you think that they should do it on Mexico's land\nOr each other across the border\nOkay wow you're you when

let the u._s. troops come in and do do it on Mexican soil a do it we're in a position to are choosing where they have the best military\nOptions available to them and that may or may not be at the U.S

calling them ragged army of migrants so he's he's learned he's step to step to back\nTo a\nControversy caravan controversy so good on you ship Smith but I can do better I can do a lot better I'm calling it the south of the border trick or treaters they're coming to a new neighborhood they know that there's good candy over here and they're coming and they've got their little Trojan Horse named

hit\nFor the medical community\nA\nSpree haven't had those ... years if ever really but that has to go with crime because crime going to have some sprees was going to be crime spree I Want to throw in another one\nBecause uh another caller alluded to the fact just a little while ago that a hundred terrorists ISIS terrorists\nFrom the middle east came all the way to Guatemala why because they love the food no because they know this is the entry point to get into Mexico to get into the U.S [noise] so a hundred ISIS\nTerrorists were captured in Guatemala alone we don't know what happened is happening in El Salvador which is\nEven worse than Guatemala when it comes to cartels and violence and ah the gang corruption that's there and then you've got Honduras to 'em there in the Central America they leases also there are who knows what's going on there\nBut if terrorists can ... ah if terrorists can target\nWant a mall or you know they're targeting others as well because they're all easy pickings so I'm thinking we need to put in some atomic fire balls\nInto our treat bag rent to pay for him because we got terrorists\nThat have already shown their hand and how they plan to get into the\nSome of the some of them have been caught but not all\nWe've got what seven thousand now at least at minimum or maybe it's fourteen thousand it's hard to say Washington Times is fourteen thousand fourteen thousand people eighty five to Ninety percent men\nIt's hard to say Washington Times is fourteen thousand fourteen thousand people eighty five to Ninety percent men marching towards the U.S border so what percentage you think are ISIS terrorists in intermingling\nAnd what their goal they'd gotten tired of the Guatemala food\nWant to try us is that it\nSo we're gonna have to throw some atomic fireball because I'm telling you it's just a problem when a\nNap and whose terrorists are in there and we're going to have to pay for whatever they cook up here in the U.S since you have some\nTreats you want to throw into this bag that the taxpayers are going to have to pay for you can certainly be a part of it and call in let's go to Jim oh let me see if I can get what are you there

helicopter that comes to the White House\nAnd he's talking to the press right now and I was reading the closed captions he was really sticking it to one of the\nOne of the reporters who was questioning this caravan in in in Mexico and Trump was saying how you go you go take your cameras you go into the middle of that and tell me that there is an is Thirteen among them\nAnd he was challenging oh basically he was a challenging the journalists to do their job\nThey they're much happier on the periphery you know the anti from a balcony or the top of a building or you know behind a

coming from because we know there's ISIS terrorists caught in Guatemala we know there's MS Thirteen throughout Mexico Guatemala El Salvador the whole the whole dang place full of them is Thirteen\nAnd

Louisiana congressman we haven't gone back there [noise]\nIn other ... congressional numbers are seeing this either they got their members of Congress and they're getting violence against them or they're running for office\nAnd they're getting violence against them but here's another list I found a list start in June of twenty sixteen we have protesters jumping cars throwing eggs that Trump supporters at a rally in San jose California\nThose supporters those Trump supporters ended up suing the the city over you got a uh in July twenty sixteen and Hillary Clinton supporter lights a flag on fire and attacks a Trump supporter in Pittsburgh August twenty sixteen\nTennessee man has assaulted at a garage sale for being a Trump supporter he just wanted to go to a barrage I bet you his wife made them go so he probably didn't even want to be there and self is he probably drive and his wife around guarantee it so he just looking at all the junk\nInnocently supporting his wife\nAnd he gets attacked at a garage sale wow a Trump supporter New Jersey was attacked with a crow bar on the street\nUh September twenty sixteen protesters in ... California chasing beat up a Trump supporter October twenty sixteen a GOP office in North Carolina was firebombed and spray painted with\nNazi Republicans get out of town or else they love to use that word Nazi don't they [noise] um I Do I Do continue down this list maybe I'll just take a break let me go to ... see what he has to say hey fails welcome to\nThe Ford faction Andre\nI Do I Do continue down this list maybe I'll just take a break let me go to ... see what he has to say hey Phil ... will come to the foreign faction\nHey Andre you know the thing that strikes me is how ignorant they're showing themselves to be\nAnd how and who are you referring to the media\nThe nose the liberals who are attacking all these Republican yes I Gotcha okay [noise] because Republicans as President Obama referred to as a are guns so ... Bible something conservatives\nYeah right and they still are they all your they've so far it seemed like feel they've all restrain themselves in their counterattacks 'cause they these people could have easily been blown away\nExactly so so they're showing their ignorant right there the other thing is is why are we not surprised by the U.S it was just a matter of months ago or even weeks ago that the former Democrat candidate for president\nA gay the funding to a intimation that the Democrats could be more court civil\nCourt was that that sort\nOf like a call for them to be less civil now so that when they get elected they would be more civil or and then at the\nSame time and and um I Know you're you're referring to the ... who got off her broom and and sat down for have you okay yeah\n... and then and then at the same time a year ahead of the former Democrat attorney general saying when they go low we kick them\nYes\nAnd and so you know why we're not surprised by the fact that the liberals are being very on civil and and why we're not surprised that the Democrat leaders\nAre trying they seem to be at their dead level best trying to instigate some type of uprising and civil war so that we can have unrest in this nation and then they can blame it on the Republicans\nOh yeah definitely we're we're fighting a two front war here because we've got a civil unrest here in within the United states and then we've got these attacks from the outside by way of the Mexico caravan a flash trick or treaters that are are headed towards our border and you know as long as\nThe people that are out there stirring this up get away with it it's going to continue\nMade like George sorry yes and I have most of the protesters\nI buy believes that's what we're going to find out for sure because it is awfully organized for it to random group of people that just happened to all meat or on the street because they were all ... at the same time from some uh unforeseen violent act of the government that we haven't heard out in the news yeah\nWell and not only that he's ... he's paying the caravan he paid the protesters he's paid his cabinet all protesters we know that I\nHighly thirty one year in Alabama to instigate all sorts of laws against a Republican candidate I mean George Soros is the prime rang a leader in developing unrest in this nation\nI agree but uh I don't want to yes he is prime but I also don't want to be diverted from the fact that there is also a one block Obama Eric Holder who have created organizations designed to do this very thing as well maybe not to the level of paying them\nYou know maybe they're just at a volunteer basis but they're still volunteer thugs ... and ... and Eric Holder gave it away when he was talking over\nYou know maybe they're just at a volunteer basis but they're still volunteer sucks right and ... and Eric Holder gave it away\nWhen he was talking over in Georgia to those Democrats in and he let slip that whole concept when they go low we kick them\nLike that and that was a week ago Phil that's out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speak and if he can let that trip off of his tongue so quickly in the middle of a of a a discussion with democratic operatives that is what he thinks and breathe every day of his life this is what he ...\nWhile they that's why I think that like any longer up because they were like yeah\nThat's right yeah you you let the mask fall and we know it that he's out to kick us tickets\nSo um and he's buddies with Obama so I Believe that they're working on on on their end to do whatever they can to disrupt up it's it's it's an amazing little tactic or a lot can be accomplished through confusion and chaos\nIf we fall for it thanks for the call Phil I appreciate it and the reason why I'm a bringing up a lot of these stories is to hopefully pulled back\nThis facade so we don't fall for it\nLook here's the stories of what's happened in the past two years alone twenty sixteen to twenty Eighteen violence people being attacked basically the bottom line is this from the liberals the socialist the hardcore leftist this is their motto don't don't if you if you\nDon't
