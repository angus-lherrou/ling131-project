again next Sunday at three o'clock for results with Richard ...\n[noise]\nHello this is Adrian Hendricks\nAnd Jerry Hendricks of say one more now incorporated our focus is to loving to confront all activities this honoring human life created in the image of God there is no greater dishonor to in God and to human life than to reject is eternal salvation only available to to shed blood and Jesus Christ\nThank you for joining us today's message is about falling in love with Jesus park one we will present part to next week\nThe lord God wants you to know that he really loves you and that among other things he created you to Spain eternity with him his love for you is so great that he took it upon himself and the person other it's only got one son Jesus to pay for the corrupted nature is holding this would not permit\nGod has expended every effort for us to know that we can trust him but like all other personal relationships we have to learn this is true\nOf all we need to understand what the word laugh really means the cut our culture tends to confuse it with last\nCs Lewis said this about love being in love is a good thing but it is not the best thing there are many things below it but they're also things about it you cannot make it the basis of a whole life\nIt is a noble feeling but it is still a feeling\nNow no feeling can be relied on to last and it's full intensity or even to last at all knowledge can last principals can last habits can last but feelings come and go and in fact whenever people say the state called being in last usually does not last\nIf the old fairy tale endings they lived happily ever after it's taken to mean they felt for the Next Fifty years exactly as they felt the day before they were married and it says what probably never was nor ever would be true and we'd be highly undesirable if it were\nWho could better living that excitement freezing five years what would become of your work your appetite your sleep your friendships but of course she seemed to be in love need not mean ceasing to laugh\nLaugh and the second chance love as distinct from being in love is not merely a feeling it is a deep unity maintained by the will and deliberately ...\nStink from being in love is not merely a feeling it has a deep unity maintained by the will and deliberately strengthened by habit reinforced by Christian marriages the grace which both partners ask and receive from God\nThey can have this love for each other even that those moments when they do not like each other as you love yourself even when you do not like yourself\nThey can maintain this last even when each with easily if they allow themselves be in love with someone else\nBeing in love first moved down to promise fidelity this quieter laugh enables them to keep the promise in his on this laugh that the engine of marriage is Ryan being and laugh when the explosion that started it\nJust quieter love his action and was abundantly demonstrated by our savior for us through his son was life death and resurrection it is further exemplified by the yet to come merits sucker up on the lam\nSadly there is a dark side for those who do not love the light Jesus mentioned and John chapter three versus Seventeen through twenty for God did not send has sent into the world to condemn the world but so that the world might be saved threw him\nHe believes on hand is not condemned the he who does not believe is condemned already because he has not believe in the name of the only be gotten set of God\nAnd this is the condemnation that the light is kind of into the world and men loves darkness rather than to light because they're D's for evil for everyone who does evil hates the light and that's not come to the light less his deeds should be exposed\nThis darkness will keep all those who refuse to believe away from the lord and by association the marriage separate the lamb\nToday we want to make sure you know that the lord and once you the year with him and you have an opportunity today right now to secure your presence at the most glorious of celebrations if you're absent from the thing that it will have been your chores\nWe will explain America suffered lamb shortly but first allow me to share a brief testimony about my marriage to Adrian\nAdrian I were married forty three years his parents or goes after nearly the first eight years I discovered that Adrian had another man and her life yes as great a husband as I thought I was she had fallen for another man\nAnd all the years prior to my finding that out we focus on pursuing riches and things the world says are important now she was willing to give up everything for the new man even money one of our biggest arguments had to do with her given him money to help further his agenda\nAs some of you can a test you can tell right away when something is a with your loved one their interests take a sudden turn and they become enamored with something for\nPeople in Adrian situation suddenly care enough about the event taking place around them and many of the things people say they should attend to they have a new love they walk around with smiles on their faces and there's almost nothing you can do or say to upset them\nThis was the one thing that route me most I could not make her upset\nEventually I had to face the fact that someone has sold in her from me we're not getting along at all and I was sure that we would not be together much longer the truth is I wasn't sure that our marriage mattered much anymore\nI was hurt and bothered mostly bothered because his men I was not everything I thought I was to her\nI could not make sense out of what was happening I did however managing\nSo he bothered because his men I was not everything I thought I was to her I could not make sense out of what was happening\nI did however managed to rationalize the situation and thought that as long as I had money a job with a position of power and material things I Would be fine\nWell that worked for a little while we both had careers and Adrian had an opportunity for promotion to a position in a different state we had no choice and then so we agreed that she would take the promotion we sold our house from purchase two condos one in each state\nI figured that same patron had someone else had her life and things once important to ask a boat or an important to her any longer we needed some time apart\nWe visited each other approximately every two weeks and we're actually beginning to grow closer in spite of being a part in geographically\nI don't remember talk much about the other men in her life when we were together but as time passed it became more and more difficult to be away from Adrian and I began to pray to or lowered to bring us back together again and I trusted him to do so soon\nI express my belief that we would be reunited to people and they thought I was crazy the general response when something like the lord is going to do what\nWell as the lord so fit eleven months and two weeks later we're back together again\nEven while we were part it was difficult for me to do anything wrong you know those on godly things lifted in relations five Nineteen through Twenty one\nI had no desire to go clubbing or the other women my routine consisted of going to work and watching mainly Christian television I later learned that Adrian was meeting with other relievers and they had me on their prayer radar\nThey knew what they were doing because James five six team says the effect of prayer but righteous person accomplishes much today I Believe with all my heart to my life with spirit through the prayers of my wife and the other believers\nAs for the other man in nature in life I got to know him well during our time apart its name is chief says I learned a few things about him is the way the truth and the lines at John fourteen six\nHe's our creator John won three seasons three nine collages one's sixteen and three ten he's our redeem are relations three Thirteen first Peter one Eighteen and Nineteen revelation five nine\nHe's love at first John for eight and very sixteen he's fateful a second that's alone Indians three three Hebrew to Seventeen and chapter three verse to revelation one versus five\nHe's Victoria's revelation three Twenty one\nHe's awesome revelation one tenth through Seventeen he's understanding he Bruce for twelve through sixteen is powerful over death John ten eleven through Eighteen and needs to great I Am at John ... versus fifty a\nSo that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship is his sufferings being conform to his death if somehow I may attain to the resurrection from the dead\nNot that I have already received this or have already been made perfect by press on if indeed and they lay hold that for which also I was laid hold up by Christ\nI'll point today is to help each other or prepare for the marriage suburban lamb this is too important a mad or to assume\nHow do you prepare we must you know we have been invited to participate and prepared with diligence the lord is asking all took calm\nPlease let him know that you're preparing for him and will attend to married suburban all am please say yes I Will be there to his imitation the one who loved you to death and back is waiting to hear from you\nLet us pray although there are many listening today believing they are Christians who will not be present at the wedding separate than I Am\nWe pray for them now and I said you grant them repentance has stated that acts eleven versus Eighteen to see their sins to change their minds about their fans and to turn away from them forever you made it clear at second chronicle seven fourteen if you're a ...\nChange their minds about their fans and to turn away from them forever\nYou made it clear at second chronicle seven fourteen\nIf you're a people were called iron name show humble themselves and praying and seek your face and turn from their ... that is to repent their sins then you father will hear from heaven and we'll forgive there's fan and you will heal their land\nMany believe they love you but according to your work they do not Jesus tells us that John fourteen Twenty one the one who has my commandments and keeps them that person is the one who loves me\nOne who loves me will be love by my father and I will love him and will reveal myself to him\nMany believed there said that because they deliberately violate your command without heating warnings about their actions they do not love you and are in danger of being separated from you as they are not asking you for help to stop their central practice it\nSo many others are liars when it caters adulterers worshipers appalls gods and practitioners witchcraft\nSome who call themselves by your name are captured by hatred of their brothers and sisters that are in Jesus some are responsible for the murder of people babies through abortion others via euthanasia\nThese people are guilty either directly or by complicity through their agreement with those who support governmental policies which allowed these and other deadly practices\nSome are confused about how you made them and engage in lesbian and homosexual behavior that the faces your image\nWe ask you to grant them repentance so that they may turn to the only one who can save them from the rat to calm according to your word collage and three versus five and six\nPut to death therefore your members which are one day or sexual immorality unclean that's their prey passion evil desire and covered his nose which is a dollar tree for which things fake the wrath of guy comes on the children of disobedience\nThere yet others who meet with your children as if they belong to you but they have not breathing outside of the way they think will take an empty and\nThey are unbelievers among your sheep and their condemnation issue or according to your word it's used for for there are certain men who crept in secretly even those who were long ago written about what this condemnation\nOn godly men turn into grace of our God into indecent thing and denying our only master God and Lord Jesus Christ\nWe absolutely did she let them come to the awareness that belief and your holy ... Jesus will be the only means of deliverance for them\nTheir father please bring your light all these and let them demonstrate what your servant John says that mad to three per se to bring forth fruit that is consistent with repentance and let their lives prove their change of heart reflecting true repentance\nHeavenly father we pray for all these people made in your image with whom you desire to Spain eternity because you love them we with them all belong to you as it is written and so I'm twenty four verse won the earth is to Lloyd's and the fullness of at the world and they do well in

myself as well I mean I had to function and raised three children during that time\n... ... let's talk a little bit about what's in your glucose mean yeah cream\nWell I did a lot of research on glucose I mean I knew how good it was\nSo I came across um the fact that emu oil is a powerful natural anti inflammatory and can carry most any ingredient right through your skin and deliver relief to your area of pain I took a new oil\nAnd glucose ... mhm I use Boswell law which is an Indian herb that's an anti inflammatory okay realm Elaine that's an enzyme known to be an anti inflammatory less than a natural organic solver\nThat is also just as important as glucose in Maine and rebuilding and repairing our joints and so I put that altogether and ice cream\nThat actually has no odor it's grace list it doesn't freeze the pain it doesn't burn the pain it doesn't irritate your skin\nGoes in Fifteen minutes later you have for relief\nAnd so that's why I'm here to share what I Know and

depending on the area okay of pain of the nation that sanitary you know ... so you don't have to worry about it becoming rancid okay\nNow I'm In terms of this getting into your body then I'm you're talking about a couple of things right here not not only relieving the pain but also rebuilding re read the rebuilding port so how does that work\nOnce you apply the cream to that area that you're going to target ... okay you get the information to go down in the body heal itself\nThe body heal itself provided you give it the raw materials that needs I'm giving you what you need for your body to take over and do the job it was meant to do and that's he'll okay\nAnd this is safe enough and you have to worry about I have\nTo worry about a thing if you're taking a drug for pain it won't

with your product my feet and legs are usually in pain from being overweight and on my feet all day at night I can hardly get to sleep from the pain I discovered by applying glucose me to the painful areas I'm able to get a good night's sleep thank you so much for making this possible\nHis one more Chris from Darlene from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania it's a miracle in a tube that truly does take away the pain it works as nothing else I'd ever tried to work quickly and eliminated all of the pain\nIs out to me now these are these you\nDo these kinds of responses unusual\nNo really are the usual really usual I mean I must say that it does my heart good to hear these things because I Know what it's like to suffer and I know what it's like to get relief and every time you know I get one of these emails are these letters that just confirms that\nHundreds of thousands of people have to use my great results that's\nI also want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that if you want to try Dr Janet's extra strength glucose mean pain relief formula there's a special toll free number to call give that to you know\nIt's one eight hundred for six seven nine seven zero nine\nAs

programs this is a one time or\nThe number to call is one eight hundred\nFor six seven nine seven zero nine or give it to you again it's one eight hundred for six seven nine seven zero nine [noise]\nSo what do you think folks as a pretty interesting isn't it um you know pain obviously something that that is a huge epidemic in this country I don't think there's many of us or any of us for that matter that has not experienced pain from time to time or maybe it's more serious more chronic\nUm and looking for a real solution here understanding that perhaps the pharmaceutical approaches is now we know is not the best approach at this point because there are so many side effects associated with a with these drugs out there right but\nLooking at it from a natural standpoint\nAnd Dr Janice glucose mean cream\nMaybe make some sense here I mean this is this is again putting back into your body we'd we'd do seem to discover time and time again but when you give your body what it needs it knows what to do with it and knows how to fix the problem it's only if it doesn't get those thing right that you continue to have the problem and\nAgain we've been talking about Dr Janis ... cream and this is\nThis is a number of ingredients that you put together right and and this this good for any type of pain\nIf you have pain of any kind it's kind of make a difference I mean I don't care how

you ... I'm telling you that's very doable yeah so this has really exciting to be able to share this with you\nYeah again I think one of the things that is that is um important for people to understand because very unique this is a cream yes this is not a supplement yeah now there are lots of supplements out there and what do you tell someone that comes into your office and says well Dr Jana\nYou know I I've tried this I've tried that I've tried this I've tried to all the right things and it did not work so therefore the natural approach doesn't work\nFirst of all for ... for ... for that matter it takes Ninety Days for them to notice something if in fact they're going to notice anything because they may not be breaking down and absorbing the airline industry here taking into early to three months people give up\nPeople in pain they won't release and they want it now right and that I had developed this train again Fifteen minutes and I am telling you you'll notice that it's going to the good ... and so I just gave you a challenge you know try it you have nothing to lose\nOkay again we're talking about Dr ... cream here in ... ... ... somebody calls today gets your cream and tries it what should they expect realistically\nSix seven and nine seven zero nine well that's all the time we have for today thanks again to our sponsor Dr Newton's natural ... you can visit them online anytime a doctor news dot com for all of your supplement\nNeed and be sure to join us again next week for another great show I'm Chris McKay have a great day everybody\nWhen it comes to parents than there are no perfect home because you don't have the perfect pan the camera on your jacket on\nFor more information on adoption does it have dumped us kids do toward a message from the U.S department of health and Human Services adopt us kids at the council\nW one bill W ...

harassment the whole me too\nTell us about you like we say in the south everybody everybody wants to know who your who your people are kind of thing [laughter] a little bit about growing up would that look like for you\nUm [noise] growing up let's see [noise]\nOne of the well I went to a Christian school that's kind of foundational from a a very ... profit small Christian school we um we're church folks we we went to church when the doors rope and we were in the church Sunday Sunday Wednesday\nUnless you were thrown up or had a fever you know you were there right I'm [noise]\nLooking back on it and now I realize a lot of what I learned in those years wasn't exactly solid but uh you know I think it's a foundation\nThat obviously helped me become who I Am today\n[laughter] [noise] well um [noise] I can relate to that I mean we we were in church I mean in back in the day too I mean we had church in the morning we had church\nIn the evening the church on Wednesday we had a prayer group we had were I mean we're always at church and waiting and I said that the danger of that is church just becomes routine ... right and uh\nYou know so that's that was part of my challenges with that um what was\nHow did you get through the divorce what was your anchor in all of that\n[noise] you know I'm I think we all have specifically growing up just had this picture of what my life would be like I Would meet the right man we would get married we would have to point five kids and a dog and a white picket fence and you know everything would be dandy and um [noise]\nThat when that came crashing down that was really really difficult not to mention my circumstances with you know being pregnant and having a toddler and um [noise] I think that was really as far as my faith is concerned that was the first time in my life that are really had to\nLook God in the ass so to speak and say I can't do this I I and I'm very independent and that was tough for me but um that was really the first time that I that I knew that I was in the midst of something that I could not do on my own um and I literally just had to turn it over to him\nI mean people ask me in the days you know following how are you up how are you walking around how are you functioning and I just said God's carrying me 'cause it it was really true like in a supernatural almost way\n... yeah I think in the midst of those top the storms [noise] um we discover a different kind of relationship with the father mhm which is why we have the storm sometimes yes\nUh yes and I hate to even say yes but I don't like the storms I like having to go through those things but you're necessary to teach us\nAnd I hate to even say yes but I don't like the storms I like having to go through those things but there are necessary to teach us into deep and the the relationship that we have I wouldn't change a bit of it\nI think for me I'm like in in the middle of my divorce was really the first time that our experience supernatural things\nThat were happening mhm um\nThat was the first time my life where that had happened where you know I and I'll give you one example I was supposed to sign divorce papers the next day and it was in my room so Sunday\nAnd I was just taking a minute to pray before we went to church\nAnd I was like I needed neon sign here I Need to know that I'm doing the right thing by signing these papers [noise]\nUm and I you know so I was just praying neon sign because I'm just in that place where I just have to have that and I thought I Would get up and read some read my Bible before I went to church\nAfter after I made that per so I went in search of my Bible and it was um in another room and when I found it had it had to cover I had a cover on it you know that you can close up\nBut the cover was um had an extra flap who went around and the flap stuck inside the Bible which I never would have left it like that and I'm like you know so I immediately I'm thinking what kid is messing with my Bible like why would it be left that way\nAnd so I got it in for ... it just struck me that there was a reason why it was stuck where it was stuck and when I opened it up it was at X. twenty and I had the mothers devotional Bible and there was a devotion on that page and the devotion said when to know to say goodbye\nAnd I was like now inside [laughter]\nSo X. twenty is when post saying goodbye to the church at court\nAnd the devotional was about the positive aspects of saying goodbye and how it like it helps you to move forward to better things how it helps you heal from past moons like just spoke to where I was in that moment\nAnd it felt like God just did that well for me 'cause I that's an example of what I Would consider a supernatural moment did you have things like that\nOh you were the the main one which literally literally defined\nMy life from that moment to today is I remember standing in my kitchen um it was almost Thanksgiving time you know like just one of the greatest times of the year for me a lot of Thanksgiving that's like my favorite holiday and\nUm ... this at all just come crashing down you know like you said hormones pregnant you know toddler just what in it's overwhelming Oh yes so overwhelming and for some reason with the holidays looming that just made it even worse you know that that everything was falling apart and at that particular time and I just remember\nThe ... the lord just spoke to my heart like it wasn't a it wasn't an honorable thing but it was like I could feel it I don't know how to explain that I'm sure people understand that but he just spoke very clearly in concisely to my heart and said you know maybe this part\nOf your plan didn't work out like you wanted it to maybe the wife part maybe the marriage part um but I made you to be a mom and that hasn't changed [noise]\nUm and I knew in that moment that I Would adopt Sunday [noise]\n[noise] I don't know how it translated you know\nWhich is a crazy thought to have when you when you have a baby and a two year old and\nAbsolutely and yet but it it gave me I hate to say a purpose because I already had a purpose already\nYou have a baby and a two year old and\nAbsolutely and yet but it it gave me I hate to say a purpose 'cause I already had a purpose already had to you know one kid in one on the way to to raise and love and care for but it gave me a um\n[noise] new purpose a new purpose a new journey you know I wasn't any longer on this wife you know marriage I think things are going to turn out perfect path I was on a different path kind of redirected you're focused and I needed that I needed something else to look towards\nSo ... how long was it was a was it until you really ... pursued that\n[noise] um it took a while it on we so I had obviously two small kids and my parents and I ended up buying a house together I'm just so that they can be there to help me and they were wanting to get over on another side of town and financially it was best for all of us so\nUm we didn't expect it to last as long as it did um we actually ended up all living in the same home until very recently so it was over eleven years that we all live together um and and it was an amazing time but I had to consider them\nIn this decision to which you know I didn't expect that going into it so um they were not on board at first at all especially with adopting a child with special needs um\nI I had that conversation with my parents do hey I'm adopting a sibling group before you're like oh\nYeah yeah yeah I don't um and you know I mean my dad God love him\nWhen he had a solid point now in history looking back but uh what is this going to do to your chances of finding a husband which you know obviously and worked out but [laughter] you know I mean they had a lot of concerns you know financial concerns and um you know our Ayman al Ahmad biological kids going to deal with this and\nI'm so it took awhile for everybody to kinda get their mind wrapped around it\nUm collectively right so it was about six years before I actually stepped out and and started the process\nWhich was about five years ago yes right [noise] so um\n[noise] ...\n... talk to walk us through I don't want to get ahead of your story 'cause it's a great story and it deserves to have the time to be told well so tell us about the first child that came into your life [noise]\nSo my plan [laughter]\nI always think this is so funny because you know we always have these plans and then God's like ... ... you know and and God no no no\nI'm my plan was to adopt a child from China and specifically with Down syndrome and that's just what God laid on my heart and through a series of random events\nUm and I knew very confidently that was what I was supposed to do with adopt a child with Down syndrome so\nI thought you know China there's so many kids with special needs um that need to be adopted and\nYou know maybe a child between the ages of three and five you know that out of that baby phase um would be a great need you know like I was trying to not only do what got called me to do but sort of step it up a notch almost and be like All right you know I'm not I'm not going to do this I'm going to do\nThis and this great things are going to be so proud of me [laughter] um and so you know I stepped out in faith and and and said this is what I Want to do and found out very quickly that um I wasn't financially stable enough to adopt from China they have very specific\nI wake up I'm like are you ready to throw it out all my best get and make good old ball military\nAnd I see no pan\nOut walking around looking I look at dawn on me to look in the dishwasher surely nobody's been but\nLet me let me let me let me let me stop you there

I'll be honest with you there was a part of me that\nWith everything I had been through with the with open heart surgery and all this stuff I sort of considered myself a doctor on the fire and so I thought you know that that just can't be right like well you know maybe he's not the maybe he's got a heart condition but surely in this day and age there's something we can do about it you know he just hasn't had the right mama\nTo advocate for and you know so we we sort of knew that he was really sick\nUm but there was a part of me that that really thought I could fix it\nIf I'm being honest and and so that that was a difficult conversation with my kids and my parents um\nYou know knowing that we were going to be bringing a child into our homes that\nWe very likely might have to bury right um so\nThat took a minute to consider a we had an Eighteen year old in the house at the time that we're fostering as well and she's\nAfter Barry right um\nSo that that took a minute to consider a we had an Eighteen year old and the house at the time that we're fostering as well and she was very much against it she was like why would anybody do this you know and and [noise]\nAh what I always tell my kids is um if you don't do what God says you get followed by a giant fish and [laughter] nobody wants Logan nobody wanted that so\nUh you know we were sure that this is what got it asked us to do and and we said yes in charge forward um and you know I expected to bring home this really sick frail little being\nUm and he was a feisty little kid I had just a ton of fight in him you know one of those kids that just kept bouncing back and bouncing back and bouncing back and\nUm he ... he kind of rock to our world a little bit like he was um [noise] not the easiest you know like you would think a kid the that sick with you know literally a terminal heart condition um you'd just be able to sit in love and hold him and he you know he would growl at you and swat and\nUm would he was always on oxygen and he would just roll around the house until he was completely entangled in his oxygen tubing and you're like come on man you're supposed to be sick like well what is this what are you doing [laughter] but um yeah we we loved\nHim he um he fought really hard and we fought really hard alongside him um but he passed away on June twenty ninth of last year so not this past summer that the the one before that keep doing that um and\nBut but it's a very sad story but also a beautiful story because we got to do on his funeral I'm actually spoke at the funeral and\nHis parents were there um and they at the time were battling to get their kids back they had five other kids that were in the foster care says well in various homes\nAnd his mom told me you know she was like I made a promise even before he died I mean like heat she and I literally were there together holding him when he\nPassed on to the arms of Jesus and she said I made him a promise that I was going to do the right thing and I was going to get my kids back and and that's what I'm going to do and so I was able to talk of the funeral and you know their extended family with their people that you know probably had not heard the gospel either ever or in a really long time\nAnd so because of his fragile little short life\nPeople were changed I mean he his parents were changed they've got all their kids back now there are cases officially closed with the age are um and their families reunite it and you know I think that was his purpose that was his purpose\nWow it changed all of you absolutely got experience which are we say on the show lot nothing is ever wasted\nNo no his his life was not waste and that's for sure and you know now we're being faced with a decision on about another child that that could potentially\nHave the same outcome that could potentially die in our care um and both of my kids were just solid yes as the question yes\nWell one of the things I wanted to ask you about is um 'cause you know it was a question your parents had for you will ... what about your two biological children what about the impact to them 'cause I got the same question\nBecause I had one biological and then adopted for so she was out numbered mhm by by a good bit [laughter] and um and if someone\nI had one biological and then adopted for so she was out numbered ... Bye bye good [laughter] and um and if someone asked me that question I Would have an answer I Know how she was impacted positively in the things that challenges that she faced as a result and how that changed her for the better\nHas that been for your kids [noise]\nUm it has been a positive impact on them and so many ways like I Can't even go into all the different ... you know I mean just adoption alone\nIs such a picture of God and how he loves us and called us into his family and it's something that you can't just I mean you can explain it with words but when you can live it\nIn front of your children and they're living it along side you know this is their life just as much as mine and\nThe lessons are phenomenal and then you add you know kids with special needs and then I have learned so much and they have learned so much about being advocates and warriors for people who are different you know people who look different than you or\nWalk different than you or talk different than you or have different needs than you I'm\nI mean it it's just radically changed both of them it\nBrought a new perspective I Would imagine\nNew perspective and just the depth of the understanding of um you know what it means to to be a cry fall or not just to be a believer but India Christ fall over that's something we talk about a liar and it's not just where it's a two two different things you know I mean the Bible says even the devils believe you know the demons believe but", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "07"}
