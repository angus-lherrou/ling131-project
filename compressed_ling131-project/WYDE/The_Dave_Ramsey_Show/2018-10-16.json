race now\nLike dude you've dealt with a girl like it's not the worst type of guy you know double the girl and then he talks bad about her after you chose to do that you chose to go down that road\nI

then can we can we just touch on Elizabeth Warren just for a second like just give me one second okay trumping the Cherokee Nation respond to Senator Elizabeth Warren's ancestry test so the strange move involves worn releasing a video that declared the results strongly support the existence\nOf on a mixed Native American ancestor an ad\nMixed Native American ancestry from six to ten generations ago which meant she was between one sixty fourth and one in one cell\n[noise] from six to ten generations ago which meant she was between one sixty fourth and one and one thousand twenty fourth Native American\n[noise]\nI'm a tad confused because like if somebody said they had strong evidence what would it sounds like like if I went to a grocery store and I stole what's your favorite candy but like if you like if you were going to like diving a pool full of candy what would it be\n\nChocolate shock ugly kind of ... give me a brand name truffles trouble I don't even know what that is that near tackling okay truffles and so if if I was going to tell you that I went into a grocery store and I stole truffles\nAnd I got away with it and I came out and somebody came up to you and said I have strong evidence that he stole twenty dollars worth of truffles what would you think that strong evidence would be\n\nLike you think it would be video you think it would be the manager seen me put it in my pocket like that would be some kind of strong evidence somebody snap chatting me around\nUm around that area around that Iowa and then all of a sudden twenty dollars worth of truffles is missing right like that would be strong evidence and you don't tell me you don't come up to to you and say her Cambridge I saw you afford and I've got strong evidence that he's the one who stole those truffles\nAnd you say well what's your strong evidence well we had a thousand a twenty four people come in the store today and we have twenty dollars with the troubles missing and I'm pretty sure I have strong evidence that Ford was the one to do it and you say again what's your strong evidence well he came in the store today\nYou realize that's what they're doing with Elizabeth Warren you'd do allies that that's what they're trying to tell you is that six to ten generations ago this woman\nShe had a Native American in her family a Native American native of America and even on the ancestry dot com or the men twenty three or whatever your your source for ancestry history maybe\nEven there they have a disclaimer that says look we can't really know if you're actually Native American because the Native Americans don't let us ... they don't let us or the NATO genes their history\nAnd we respect that because we respect that culture\nSo\nIt's less than one percent of it like point oh eight six or whatever it was ... percent of it she has America blood in her which we probably all do but in her right that doesn't even tell us if it's South America or North America you realize that right\nThat doesn't tell me is if it's Asian Pacific Islander and what about the land bridge does anybody put that together to what it what about Eskimos what about the land but what what about the the native people of this land like it's not just Native American Native American Cherokee Nation like\nWelcome back into the ... vaccine live\nOn a Tuesday in foreground eight six six by by one nine nine three three let's go to Brandon Brandon all commit how're you doing\nOh I thought oh good buddy going to talk to you what's going on then\nI won't talk about oh a little more along the ... the ... in basically in North Dakota where they're going through getting the right both each year like this is the craziest thing I overheard him along\nLike the fact that it's taken this long no that they voted for their sell\nIt to the last two times we'll go and they're mainly to count the suit try try to counter mostly democratic\nGot like eighty percent ... I see I don't know the store brands to have to walk me through a ...\nOkay well try a lawsuit and basically what happened is older speaks a democratic senator one by one point three Thousand Oaks\nOh they win all too like I guess to try and do something about it because the whole state is majority rule book like I'll just stay out of state auditors were\nPretty red state yeah at what ... and what happened was they made a law where\nThe state house space out it is a\nPretty red state yeah and what ... and what happened was\nThey made a law where you have to have a bill look cool trees in the state of PO box not work that's the law they may directly targeting the Native Americans growing\nNew had that you have to have an address have\nTo have a ... or ... not work\nAnd this is a crazy thing for how in the world would not be a Supreme Court\nOr this or ill ... the Supreme Court upscale ... well that that's that's so on American man\nLike hold on hold on what state was this then again I've got to find out more\nInterested in this is in North Dakota and then a alone is how a voter suppression slope\nBecause I I think I don't think a lot of\nPeople that this in a Republican order\nCan't know about this type of stuff is going on around the nation a story of black college in Texas uh right outside of Houston that saying though I think the county ... county oh a universe this call peer review ANL\nThey are in about a ... now with the county because it's so red county but\nThat's a black historic ... to ... percent blacks and at a school they're fighting with him about the almost the exact same thing the university has given all the students\nThe universe the address to be able to vote they don't have like a physical address like stay on campus like ... so yeah they gave them just a a university uh ...\nWell they can cause so much get fusion because they saying that's not that doesn't work like it's not going to work and they wait for the last minute suits cited so\nOkay hold on let me let me get back to this or was it South Dakota North Dakota yeah it was a Dakota North Dakota guy he is a part of the turtle mountain this job reading this kind of specific story he's a part of the turtle mountain band of\n... power we Indians in North Dakota and I'm pretty sure what I'm saying there on\nUm anyways he is a a he's a veteran he's United States veteran and he was denied the right to vote because he didn't have a physical street address I'm\n... and it wasn't as Iron Man ...\nOkay hold on hold on to wasn't it wasn't listed on his ID so okay Dave ... so it's not like you have to own land to vote or something like that you have to have any physical address on your ID okay\nYou know they ... they live they don't they live like they always you know they don't have a three day I have the ID card they are part of this tribe stay in this area is profit from this why don't you think what it's called\nSomething oh I've got a point where it's like a card and no one would you say I mean you know and now they're saying that Lee life because they have this new law\nSo yeah so I'm looking in here and if if okay if that law as ridiculous as it is like if all of this is in place and ... and like they're not allowed to vote\nI'm looking in here and if if okay if that law as ridiculous as it is like if all of this is in place and ... and like they're not allowed to vote why don't they put a address like for\nTheir physical strength address be the area that they're in and then they get in a loophole around that time well\nThat's what that's what they're trying to do now but it would be a turning general state\nThan he wanted to I Can't ... like just give everybody a strict just go through the journals that he cannot respond to look good litigation and there were like I made it out at least\n... will cook do litigate\nSo he'll resell into three weeks after everybody moved\nExactly so I mean it's just crazy man and a lot more stories like that going on in and out ha\nSo ... how I look this up I look this up and the the first Web site the pop up is\nAn A. R. S. dot org and civil rights group news news maven dot Idaho um KFYI or T. V. dot ... this is not being picked up by even the big guys like CNN or image you know\nThey they don't they're not going to ... I mean they're not going to pick up on what\nWhat I did a little bit of it oh\nI tell you more parts they have picked up on you pick up all got out of north ... I'm Still trying to look at oh Rachel Maddow she she had a little bit North Dakota ... weeks ago\nSo this kind of sounds like the John Oliver thing you know when John Oliver will pull up like a a problem going on in our society and they'll try to fix it\nSo John Oliver was the guy who we like had to watch when we when we did speeches debate because he would come up with these topics that weren't right in America that he thought wasn't right like everybody disagrees agrees with south whatever wins\nBut he wouldn't he would do stuff like this but it never really preach like national media attention if I'm On the left or if I'm if I'm On the writing on Fox News and I want to act like on down the middle I picked this story up and run with it like I said I'm I'm confused as\nA lot of a lot of people do not know this stuff is going on around the country so I'm In it so on American like it is saying that this type of stuff as well and also didn't allow it\nTo lead a little toys and note that it is no way you can say is not\nYour own satellite but no way of trying to hide it\nThe only thing I Can't get past this I'm looking at a map of the turtle mountain reservation that's ... that's where this group of CIA power we in the urge to power or however they say Indians that's where they live on this reservation why don't they put the address on the reservation on the ID cards and then get around it you know what I mean like I just\nThat's what they're trying to do right now or that's what they're trying to do but like I say the attorney general state say he cannot even respond to their wedding yeah because it's in litigation\nThat assassin rented thanks for calling and telling that story it's that's really really interesting but the thing is like we talk about a random but nothing's gonna come of that like ... you know what I mean what we talk about it and\nIt's a good target nation was like yeah people need to pick this type of stuff man because people really don't know and I think okay yeah\nIt's a it was like yeah people need to pick up the man because people really don't know what I I okay everybody everybody the right you know Spanish data citizen\nAnd like we've gone that far to try to like accommodate Native Americans because of everything you did to their ancestors when I'm like what happened initially I I just good night that's incredible brain we gotta get to calls by wow we just know break breaking into\nA let's go to Mike Mike sorry for making your way brother walkman\nNo problem I think that ... law Chippewa out on the good night [laughter]\nI if any was there listening to the program I'm so sorry I I truly about a\n... and it's a list of this foreign thing you know you look at a generation of being twenty years so what she's claiming that somewhere between sixteen Ninety eight and Eighteen Eighteen there was a half breed and her family clinic which\nI mean to\nPut this into perspective that you can relate to\nYes maybe there was a half rate not not not known for an absolute\nFact but then you know it might be interesting if somebody could go back and and I did to her lineage and find out that her family wasn't even in the country during that period would that be something\nJust say who's you think you are and what are you hot yeah\nAnd voters many times you watch it that that's what the Democrats foie is because they're losing everything else and if we can actually get the centers racial situation under control they're going to lose ... million votes [noise] Everytime [noise]\nMartha thanks for the job rather good to talk to him and just start thank you sir\nBrings up a great point look I always love\nGetting two sides of the aisle like I always love getting both sides think Brandon's like article he brought up like a story brought a thought provoking as all get out like it makes you think like it makes it makes you the bullets are pumping right then Murphy comes to it and says\nWell the the people in the Indian reservation I mean what what are what are they do you know like do they deserve the right to vote do they like the government just takes care of them I mean since those kids to colleges face of the colleges like\nOutside of that reservation they become a normal citizen inside that reservation it's protected land where they're kind of\nTheir own people so what is the fuel for that what is the precedent for that what is the set up that's already there\nYou know I just I Wonder I think to myself why like there's going to be an argument is going to be a conversation there's going to be a a debate that has to happen that says okay what\nIs it what are these people what are these people are going to do what are these people you're for\nI was an uncomfortable debate and do those people deserve the right to vote I mean I I don't know I don't know if they do not I mean do they pay taxes like are are they here for the betterment of society like if\nYou're talking about a Native American who lives outside like I used to bar to end with this girl named Nancy\nAnd Nancy was a couple of years older than me super tall very pretty\nUh enter mom was a like true Native American like what are they real like war bones around her neck like a necklace kind of thing and like always talked about our ancestor like our history right\nBut you could literally tell she looked like a like a like an actual like lived on a reservation like she had beautiful skin tone dark black hair\nAnd she had all the accessories and ... when I went along with it she lived in ... you know like she was still like a Native American she's still follow some of the traditions\nAnd stuff but she was like a citizen of the country you know so great point by ... I also think are talking about the voter registration and voter id and all that stuff I if you argue with me like I had somebody argue with me this week that we don't need voter IDs you should just be able to come there and say your name and vote\nLike if you want to vote go get an ID like get an id buddy thirty bucks like a state idea I think it was like Fifteen bucks to get an idea that says your name on it\nThis law everything they're going through yeah put the reservation or put the reservation address on there but like these rats\nNow this law everything they're going through yeah put the reservation or put the reservation address on there but like these reservations or like their own separate little communities like the government didn't problem up they they couldn't do their thing they couldn't live\nEight six six five one nine nine three three how it's going to Jonathan one more thing to\nKnow the thing about the the college campus thing I guess I wasn't listening as close as I should have been\nUm if college kids state that is their residency and they want to vote there than they should be able to show that they're staying with someone who owns property they're like whether it be the school or whatever but then their right to vote somewhere else should get pooled and would get ...\nBut if you're only there for three years than just you\nYou're still going to vote or your residency that where you grew up or were your parents lived or whatever property they own or wherever they stay they rent whatever it may be\nIn that other\nState that that other country but it does bring me to think what if you live in an RV\nAnd you just have a PO box is where your mail goes and you just travel around the country you're an American citizen and you don't have a I D that has a solid address on it so what happens to them\nI don't know just something to think about Jonathan what's up buddy welcome in how you doing\nI uh as long before so they're no she's going to laugh\nWell darn I Want to say get aid in mama for now and I also want her not listen why kind of you don't get a little bit oh true America now Brannon might a racial issue out of that and you let him get away with it without really holding his feet to the far on it would last\nA worry said this is only benefits one group of people less real about that\nI now let's think about this from this perspective I I don't know where ... where he lives I think branding us from Florence\nOkay All right so random suffered floors now me and a few hundred of my friends from Coleman decided to go to Florence and get PO box is in this hour we're going to vote and floors to influence Lawrence's elections how cool is running and going to be with that\nProbably not very cool\nExactly because that would be voter fraud that's why we don't use the oh boxes that's all we use actual addresses the say yes this person is in this area and it should be voting on things pertaining to this area\nIt's a good point I just I mean it's\nNothing racial about that that that benefit anybody racially that benefits every body as a hole in their area just because you don't get what you want your area doesn't make that racial issue\nI thought his point was more along the lines of it was left versus right and it was a man hey hey hey glad it\nAll with the Republican stuff and then he said and it's only been a fast one group of people that you can guess that is\nAnd I asked her brand and on his radio several times I and I tried to get the ... but brand that will make some racial and and that's the thing though this is not a racial issue this is a common sense issue\nI you don't won't make comedy influenced sure elections no different than you know I Want somebody else influence ... mile actions in my area\nAnd with that whole reservation and everything like that I don't I assume those people get the right to vote but if you just hand them everything and they don't contribute anything back to paying the government or whatever what what's the point of them getting to vote if they're ...\nFree thing and they don't contribute anything back to paying the government or whatever what what's the point of them getting to vote if there had been handed still\nHeavy have you ever been on or around a reservation\nThough I have not I think I've been around when I take that back I think I have been around when I'm ... I think it was in Texas or something uh but I've never been on one\nI Would explain to your reservation that I was on I I've been to a reservation driving I threw one [noise] so ah [laughter] sorry about that so you ... have you ever seen the pictures on the news of a third world country\nYes doors hanging off houses and things of that nature\nYeah and it houses look like they are about falling on each other if they're not made of like the earth that surround them yet\nThere's reservation life ah that is reservation life\nThat theirs because they're given a given and given that people have no want or need to get up and do anything to fix our better their situation and I'm telling you from somebody whose dad lived on a reservation for several years\nBecause there's it's kinda like like communism socialism like why would I go work can be hard like why don't why wouldn't just be the the trash keeper where are like well when I got to be a doctor when I can just be a garbage man to make the same amount of money like why would I ever go to\nYou did on the head when he said it socialism and that's really sure what it is\nBut the government because of the issues that they had a [noise]\nWhen they put India's on reservations they said if you'll stay here will give you everything you won't have to go do nothing which is what ... the spirit away from the Indian people are ... the fight the drive everything that made them who they were\nThat took that away to hunt creators ...\nThat's that's the very same thing as modern day\nGovernment entitlements is the very same premise\nAnd why people cannot understand this hour we'll never know but the very same premise the government takes away your dry your need your your spirit of getting out and doing something for yourself to make you better to make your family\nBetter because they're going to give you something you want to stay in this area so you don't want to make\nToo much or whatever because that's grown affects your rent or your housing or or your insurance costs or whatever\nI just are that's just\nMy granddaughter or you're good you're good Jonathan I Want to take it all in because like I've never been to an Indian reservation but I've seen pictures like I'm looking at pictures right here and I'm looking at Indian reservation in uh whereas this Oklahoma and the kids using a cell phone like obviously we've strayed a little bit far away from what they we truly\nSold Indians like when you see him in history books or stuff like that and like you actually learn from you know what I mean in the\nSeventies my dad was offered to stay on her reservations I'm supposed to have a sister from\nBecause you ... if they're saying these people have fall and all the wars here and it's amazing these people who have held\nAll they want it was all they want is to live their life and and they're laying in the way they have always ...\n... ... brand and things are going back but we got to go to break

mean right now is well we're talking in the break\nAnd we're both kind of like\nI don't because I'm listening to both sides\nLike you should do with everything and I'm thinking about some\nKind of in the middle kind of in a gray area and hug you know most of the time I'm not agree yeah\nIs is that that's a hard decision and I know you you\nYou know what I mean and like I understand both sides like I get it and I understand what kind of a path they took to say look anybody without a a without this ID\nOr whatever it is like without this uh this address or whatever it may be you know\nThey can't vote so I go to look it up I'm reading deep I finally find an NPR story about this okay and hook asked me during break as the question again hug\nAt about the Native American\nI'll say on the Native Americans can run for president if that was born over\nAnd so of course the Native American run for president they've been citizens and had the right to vote run for office since that I'm Indian citizenship act that will just mentioned the Nineteen twenty four right so\nI of course you'd be able to do that and so I'm looking I'm looking through these articles I'm looking through some stuff um but\nThe state government has come out and said and again this is from an ... NPR report about\nAll this and if you're just now tuning in we had Brandon drop the Mike and walk away and we had Brennan was talking about um these two tribes these two counties in North Dakota or they passed a law and it was up hill talking about you had to have a\nAddress on your driver's license to be able to vote or on your your state id you had to have a a\nAddress on your ID to be able to vote and so that is the big uproar because these I'm Native Americans on reservations don't had address\nSo my thing was okay why can't they just put the address of the reservation well you can't do that right now either because it's going through litigation because they're challenging it right there is suing the state they're challenging in this so\nI'll look it up I finally found a source as talking about the state government says the residents without a street id should contact the counties nine one one coordinator to sign up for a free street address and request a letter confirming that address\nA group called native vote indie has been sharing those officials instructions on Facebook\nJamie ... the tribal chairman of the turtle mountain band of um ship a wall Indians says his tribe has been preparing for this shift ever since they saw the law passed\nYears ago but the final decision just coming weeks before election day the timing is horrible it's a daunting process\nOkay so there is a way around it\nBut again I mean if you have to have a address the past that and you're going through litigation and everything and you have a right to vote that that's crap\nLike I think I finally found out where I'm looking at this from if if you are a citizen like you've dual citizenship and you have an idea just doesn't have an address on it why can't you vote\nWhy did the state passed that did the state passed that because all of a sudden they just they they're having a voter problem or whatever it may be I mean maybe she usually maybe there's a there's a problem with um who's actually come to the polls to vote but\nI mean if that is going after that ... those two specific trust\nIt's usually maybe there's a there's a problem with um who's actually come to the polls to vote but\nI mean if that is going after that ... those two specific tribes those Indian reservations they have the right to vote I mean there are American citizens that you just heard walmer get emotional over the phone I as a Nineteen twenty four\nYou have the American Indian Act or or the Native American or whatever it is the Native American citizenship act the Indian citizenship act and\nIf they have the right to vote they just need to follow those rules and now if they follow the rules they have to jump through a couple of who's to vote maybe they can do that and then get it done and then figure out okay what are we going to do are we going to put the reservations or address on here how are we going to are we going to figure this problem out\nBut very interesting look I don't have the answers I'll be straight up with you I'll be honest with you I don't have the answers ... view of the answers to this\nIs interesting to see on hospital play out within the next for you\nBecause you are kind of you were literally actually you're in the same exact place with me you were talking about what they don't contribute\nThen what's there right you know but I just it's such a gray area with that\nAnd it's something that obviously the state has gone out and try to say okay this is how we can control it and I don't know\nThe right way ... what do you why do you [noise]\nBut most was when George W why [noise]\n\nTo go forward faction live on a Tuesday talk AS dot com\nHeating and AIR Studios Alabama license number one eleven twenty call cast today two oh five three two two nine zero nine zero for all of your heating and cooling needs call kids today two oh five three two two nine zero nine zero\nSo there's Amy Schumer thing like a lot of people always say like no\nI don't want any more money like I don't want to be more attractive no this one always gets me I I Love this one hug and and pushed me when I'm wrong because I'm sure you'd think the exact same way about what I'm saying\nI'm no I like my car I don't want a new one boy\nIf you don't get all the way out of you with that guy yes you want a new car you want to be more attractive you want to or you want a higher salary\nI called out false humility it is it is it is because I tell you this the only thing that I wouldn't want right the only thing that I wouldn't want is like um yeah like when I hear somebody say yeah no I don't\nI don't want a more attractive wife or something like that it's like you love who you love you love your soul mate right I'm ... and like stuff like that like\nI don't want my kids to be any different like I Believe that kind of stuff because that is what you were blessed with that's what you were given like I I I get that but like things you can or like\nI don't I guess it is kind of the same thing like things you or you can kind of control right like I Want more money I Want a new car I was like things you want right like not necessarily things you need or like things you were you were like given that you can't change like I Want to be more attractive\nLike you're going to try to change that what you're going to try to change your cell or you're going to try to change whatever car you drive whatever home you on like that's why you buy whitening strips that's why you buy makeup that's why you put on lipstick before you walk into the office that's why you you stop and talk to your boss for five extra minutes a day\nLike their reasons everybody does any like nobody's doing stuff that are the kinds of your heart like I Love the people like my sister is a great example my sister Camille she's what\nBut he's doing stuff that are the kinds of your heart like I Love the people\nLike my sister is a great example my sister Camille she's what Twenty years or something like that I don't I don't know how she is she I Know she's my sister I I can tell you that I can tell you she's my sister I don't know how she is I Love her to death but I just were two different ... completely different people like\nMan she talks like this yeah I think I'm going to big sky ranch to go work for the summer man like that she's just she's a hippie\nBut like I said it's all the time hug you can't be a hippie and have a full bedroom set you know like it it doesn't exist you can't be a hippie and buy new shoes once a week just as now hippies role like you can't be a hippie and drive like a a like a\nToyota Camry to your to your waiter jobs I mean she might be a new era hippie maybe that's what it is she's a new age she's a modern hippie millennial that in his you hit a millennial hippie Huck\nCould not have set a better myself but the thing is like you would never hear somebody say like man I don't want to be smarter than I Am right now\nNobody would ever say it's the same thing was like man I don't want any more money than I have right now my sister out he says it all the time she's like money isn't everything it's like yeah but if you had money you'd be going on trips he'd be going to different places to be traveling you buy a Subaru Outback or whatever kind of car she won't you straight in your camera get an outback like\nEverybody always wants like the next thing and like even the\nGuys who are at the very top of the game like Jeff ... those who owns Amazon rights were billions and billions of dollars why do you think he's continuing to improve on ideas and continue to make more money I was never an off\nOur nature human is never satisfied in a way\nYeah as more and more and more and more and more like your ... whether it's a more alcohol more drugs more sex more um I Want to and not even the bad things like more opportunity more um ways to make money more\nSituational you know linked up place like whatever it may be like whatever it is a more networking like what whatever it may be like you always want more right and so like whenever my sister goes man I'm good I'm like no you're not you're saying your it's fake humility like you said\nAnd you know why that's the thing right because why do we have a lottery in in in most states other than Alabama and Mississippi for that why is there a lottery because millions of people by a three dollar two dollar lottery ticket\nTo become a part of that one percent\nWhy do you put your email down in a car raffle and put it in the box at at the Galleria or at a mall because you want that nice new car\nThose opportunities wouldn't be out there if it wasn't in our nature and in our blood to want want want more so for Amy Schumer to come out and say I would never want to be any more attractive than I Am\nI'm a fake humility we live in an all or judgmental side yeah in with Facebook and pull it off you know people say all type of thing [noise] well that's definitely not you know the fake humility\nLike instead of better myself because you you were in this\nThis mindset where like I've got to improve twenty two I've got to be done with college my twenty four I've got to be married twenty five and my first kid Thirty years old to kids house and elaborated All right like that's\nStopped like nobody realizes that everybody who does anything they're processed\nAnd elaborated All right like that's everybody's still like nobody realizes that everybody who does anything they're processes different like it's okay to be different it's okay to have a different plan it's okay not to be a millionaire about thirty\nAnd I think a lot more people need to realize that like it's okay to work your tail off like it's okay to not have friends it's okay to be a workaholic it's okay to follow your dreams to follow your passion like it's okay to do crap jobs to work for free to get where you want to be\nAnd I think a lot of people get caught up in the sense and the the fact that\nWell I have to do this like\nYou have to follow somebody else's planner timeline like if you're forty five years old you're a kid\nLike if you're fifty you're a kid you're thirty more years left on this earth to be awesome\nLike Sylvia awesome\nI'm saying well I my kids are here like if you if you love your kid you make time for your kid and you make time for your passion you make time for your work\nLike you have what Eighteen hours a day to work Seventeen sixteen hours a day to work and you're using eight of those to work at your job what are you doing with the other eight hours\nYou watching Netflix take an hour long shower you um your text in plant iPhone games Facebook Twitter or whatever it may be\nDon't sit there and tell me you want more and don't go work for it but like just the thing with this Amy Schumer when I got a little distracted but just the thing with this Amy Schumer like I don't want to be hotter\nYeah you do\nJust like everybody wants thirties a little water a little straighter a little bit less belly fat one more ab one more a muscle that pops out when you're at the pool\nThat's what people want\nJust like people want to why do you think tanning bed salons or in business\nSo you're saying that she says you don't want to be no more beautiful new shoe\nShe doesn't want to be any more attractive roaches because she feels bad for hot women\nShe feels bad for people who are hot because they get raided with sexual intention to all the time\nShe says quote women are mostly scared of violence because you know one in six women are reports of being sexually assaulted but really it's more like one in three so we're not even like is is it going to happen or like when is it going to happen a woman\nAnd we run home at night we live in constant fear of violence especially hot women\nAnd she says she would not change a blinking thing\n\nNow maybe Amy Schumer is telling the truth and she wouldn't change a thing because he's a millionaire you know like money is very attractive like like if you don't look the best and you have money I guarantee you get a couple of points on the dang richer school I didn't make you high\nI don't see this report and I see the story everybody wants to be more attractive everybody wants their hair placed in the right way everybody wants to teach straight or the teeth wider a little less fat\nAnd they tell me one person Huck that would say you know what no I don't want to look like Ryan Gosling I Want to look like for brown\nI was um I was talking to this guy was like a year ago and it was before I got my show year or two ago whatever was forgot my show and\nHe was talking to me like dude I Want to do this I Want to be a radio shows I Want to be a producer like I Want to be anything but I'm I'm nervous like I'm scared like I was scared to talk to you today like I'm scared to put out like material and I'm thinking to myself you you can't be like you can't be you can't let what others say about you\nBe you're defining factor now if that's all anybody says about you than than maybe there's a problem there like maybe there is a problem with your content but like if I put out content and I'm worried about what my friends are going to say about the content I put out and I don't give that to my fans here in North Alabama liked to the Ford faction fans\nLike I'm only cheating myself\nIt's the same thing with putting stuff out on Facebook or Instagram or whatever it is like if you want to be a brand and build confidence and things like that and you know you you get nervous about what other people are gonna think\nYou've already lost the battle it's the same thing like with Trump ... like look at Trump like like you think Trump ever gets nervous about what people are going to think about 'em you think Trump ever gets nervous about the opposite\nLike look at Trump like like you think Trump ever gets nervous about what people are going to think about him using Trump ever gets nervous about the optics of something no he he doesn't and it's very self evident\nBecause look at everything he's done over the past two years\nI mean it's obviously pretty clear that Trump is a wrecking ball and he he's a he may be a ball of mud who's the ball to get stuff done and you can throw them or do you want to eat them it's not going to stick it's going to slide off of them because they already as much\nI I don't know why I got off on that tangent but I just I thought to myself\nIn this world of communication and then in this world of ah of we follow Instagram celebrities and we follow these Facebook stars and we followed these are\nThese massive um these massive brands are people like\nInstagram and Facebook and Twitter people follow people they don't follow brands like they follow people like you're going to follow your um your favorite NFL player you're not going to follow their team\nThat makes sense like you're going to fall who's what NFL team where you are you the bucks ... falcons how are you on the books that the other day I just like the\nCalls I ... I well opposing team okay\nI Will give you say so I don't how in the world can you be falcons fan and river somebody in that division\nNow I'm not roof or was it like they close to ... mile smoker\nWho that by the way hug who that nation temple yeah okay well we didn't win this week but we didn't lose weight or by week so that was nice forgot about them or fantasy game by the way nobody cares about your fantasy team forward start talking about it is or got out a way so um\nAnyway you're you're going to follow Julio Jones during the fall the falcons ... you're gonna fall Matt Ryan you're not going to follow the falcons like maybe you follow the falcons but you followed more players and you bring up a liberal yeah yeah like you follow brown you're not going to follow the Lakers right like you're in a few followed your your guy like Judy Smith Schuster like I'm going to look at his subway more than I Do the Steelers\nI can tell a brands and and who you fall and so\nLike I get caught up in that we're in a lot of times I get caught up kind of thinking about that and it's just something that I see a kind of in this media world\nHappening and growing in these brands are investing in these people because if these people believe in these brands and the people that are coming through the athletes are the stars of the models or whatever they are they're going to see the brands they use and want to use those same brands\nLike marketing these past Fifteen Years has changed so much because of social media because of Facebook because of Twitter because of ... because of\nThe every day I guess licks Google everything that's the new Jack ... more than it is but it's it how do you control the world of marketing in this media frenzy world like anyone can now be reporter like anyone can\nYeah they was talking about I was reading an article today they were talking about journalism everybody's if you've got a phone call here John\nYeah everybody like Twitter or Facebook Instagram bio's like you can research stuff on those different platforms only the intro Web like whatever it is\nYou can find out like you can see\nWhat's going on like you don't have to travel to California and sending some bushes ... like there's going to be somebody that you can contact to that is going to know what's going on\nWe definitely living in the information's interests\nAnd like an information overload generation to like just the fact that I can sit here and I can hold down a Syrian button and say what's the capital Wyoming\nOverload generation to like just the fact that I can sit here and I can hold down my Siri button and say what's the capital Wyoming\n\nOkay well usually she tells me with a capital is but I ... I was absolutely it's tough it's tough to get around but like the fact that you can do that in most of the time it works I Can't believe it didn't tell me what capital Wyoming once but most of the time it works you know at the Capitol Wyoming is by the way\nI don't think either\nI'm trying to outlaw I'll look it up real quick\nUm but like just the fact that you can sit here and like I type it in a my computer and in literally like half a second it immediately comes up shy and you know what I mean like just the fact that you can\nDo that and and we're available to all this knowledge and all this marketing and all these ads and\nWere available everywhere is just incredible I get is insane\nAnyway so I I had a great weekend and and met a bunch of people met a bunch of influences and and stuff like that and it's just the\nFact that we are so bill to walk to have our favorites celebrities or like our favorite people are like people we follow people we keep up with 'cause their lives are so much cooler or so much better like that's the world we live in today\nAnd like again it all goes back and it all relates to hey I don't want to be any hotter okay well then why do you follow Fifteen girls that looked like playboy bunnies on Instagram and you're a girl like you want to look like them you want to see what they're doing you want to see what they're eating you want to see how they work out\nLike why do I follow you know every single saints player because I think though the coolest people in the world and I would love to be just like them\nI Love the St ...
