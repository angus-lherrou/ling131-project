V. so he was going to this is what he wrote some sad news this is his quote a on on Twitter some sad news\nOn Thursday November first at the Roslyn holiday in at noon we will reveal the first of special counsel Robert Mueller's sex assault victims the first of one\nSo apparently had more in line I applaud the courage and dignity and grace and strength of my client\nHowever we now have the Boston Globe I'm Sorry the Atlantic coming out saying well wait hang on this is all part of a scheme these women are being paid off to fabricate sexual assault allegations against special counsel Robert Mueller\nAnd the FBI is now looking into the matter and they named\nJames Berkman as the person who offered this one woman twenty thousand dollars because she had worked with Muller in the past and he was looking to get her to make an accusation of some sort of workplace harassment or a sexual misconduct by Mohler at the hands of Miller and um\nShe was working as a paralegal for him until she had her first child and so that's what's going on there we've got two conflicting stories so this is going to be interesting to see how this pans out and who\nPrevails I guess with the facts\nUm if you read the Atlantic story you would say it isn't a non starter that these women were paid from the beginning to make it up fabricated and all of that however you've also got this guy a jak Berkman\nWho is going to do some sort of news conference and you would assume and hope that if he does do that he's going to present credible ... witnesses were credible evidence but we're in this age now where\nThe app store on apples apples I tune zap store and whatever else is out there for the opposite which is Android I don't know I don't have an Android I assume they have a an app store as well and I don't know the name of it but\nGo and download the yellow hammer app now it should be really easy to do I did it today on my iPhone\nAnd you will be able to get some news stories right away the app is functioning however there's going to be upgrades in the near future that are going to change things up and make a whole lot more of the stuff we put out\nBy way of a written\nAs well as audio make that available to you\nSo you want to get the yellow hammer app to track things and and uh see we're we're going and what we're doing and you can also go to yellow hammer News I'm sure that you know any news items there will be a available\nFor you to continue listening to yellow hammer so yellow hammer Abbott's yellow hammer news in the in the app store go get it you'll see the yellow bird you will\nKnow right away there's none other like it and then that's the ... you want to get let's go to Mac\nAnd see what he has to say hey welcome to the Ford faction are you there Mac a Mac it's me\nI don't know I have a problem hitting buttons I hit it but I didn't hit it you know what I mean [noise] are you there okay good welcome in what you got [noise]\n\nAre you there okay good welcome in what you got\nTo talk about a change [noise] clarify that [noise]\nAh I Can't because\nWe don't want to go off the air as yellow hammer any sooner than we are going to so suffice it to say things will be changing at the end of this week and the best way if you want to keep up with yellow hammer news and yellow ham radio is to go to the website or to the app to get further\nInformation on how to continue and I would also say the same for our good friend\nScott ... got beaten dot com or maybe he's got these radio dot com I'm not sure but those are two ways that you can keep\nTrack of of both of us come this the end of this Friday\nI really want to one person who is this [noise]\nI Can't address that 'cause I Am not a one on one point one\nEmployee so I I have to say I can't I Can't really speak to that max but I Can't say for yellow hammer we have an app follow it so you can keep up with a\nOne on one one was just [noise]\nI Know Mac I'm Sorry for that I really am um I hate I hate to leave listeners hanging and wondering ...

[noise]\nYeah right now it is it's the circular reasoning we're going to fix the problem we created so that you need to put his back in office so we can fix it [laughter] yeah it's basically what they're trying and I I don't think it's going to work but hey I guess I I don't know which is worse making false promises are are just whining and complaining I guess\nYou alternate between the two because after a point people can't put up with either one I you know and it's all they've got\nThe millennium follows [noise]\nYeah but it will see thanks bill for the call I appreciate it\nAnd let's go to a V. who's not on the line ... what happened and I see your number they're\nCalled back brutal put you on the line in the meantime I'm oh we were talking about Hillary that's right and um [noise] this whole thing\nThat she was referring to uh she basically said you know Cory Booker Eric Holder can't tell them apart ha ha ha and what what was alarming to me was what she said even before the woman the interview we interview were was referring to Cory Booker\nBut but what she meant to do was referred to Eric Holder but did you hear Hillary Clinton basically saying I adore Cory Booker did you hear that I've played again she's she's like oh no I adore and then she stopped in in ... it was like OK well who\nI can only assume that you were going to say you would adore Cory Booker because who else where are you talking about let's play this again\n\nA in maybe oh sorry Britain was on the line she needs to open up that uh channel their ... can you uh play my computer let allow that to go through\nAnd get it started here we do that is that's child what do you think of Cory bookers and kind of having a ... what do you think the\nFact that I Do I Do [laughter] that makes me laugh that makes me laugh\nShe adores Cory Booker\nCome on Spartacus is what is he died in\n... that is that's child what do you think of ... and kind of having ... ... what do you think about ... actually start to get to that kind\nLike well that was Eric Holder ... okay yeah I Know they all look alike [laughter]\nOkay so\nHillary Clinton says oh they all look alike and that's her form of humor the real humor of Hillary Clinton I guess because you know and she's now in uncivil mode she's given herself permission to be an civil\nAnd which is funny because she was pretty nasty before she gave herself permission so who knows what she's gonna what's uppers leave now so she's given herself permission to be on civil until you give her power back you know and she is even considering ... running for president she put that out there too\nSo she's laughing that's her humor okay the woman here that in automatically says no they are\nRunning for president she put that out there too so she's laughing that's her humor okay the woman here that in automatically says no they are and I agree they are you can tell the difference between Cory Booker and Eric Holder a mile away that they're totally different she's like no they are and then\nShe realized that oh oh oh oh oh Hillary's making\nA joke I may I have a let's laugh laugh laugh and oh then she says a good good one or something like that lets platelets\n[laughter] oh well done boy she turned on a dime no they are oh oh oh You're Joking Hillary well done\nWow\nI don't know what to say to that except just to put it out there like you hear it and you I guess you come up to your own conclusions but uh it's amazing I thought humor with humor regardless of\nWho does it but apparently um it wasn't humorous to the interviewee and then she decided oh I guess I I guess in this case I better be funny because it's Hillary talking\nWhen it comes to roe v Wade but but him if Trump wants to say hey no wait ... I'm In for a more into this that this would not intended for just anybody but it was intended for legal\nCitizens who gave birth on land for their children to have those seem right on their own away oh you're don't don't clarify that don't in for too much they're they don't like that we don't\nKnow what I think Donald Trump is always a few steps ahead of the left\nAnd I I think he is you know there's another understand another caravan or mob all I Want to go it forming down in Central America\nAnd it kind of like the uh the coach you know in a football game when the two minute warning\nIs founded and and you're behind a few points uh I think he's decided no one's going to do anything with him and uh and of course you know they thought he could not pass the ban on what the six or seven countries\nBut that finally went to the Supreme Court and and it was focused and I think he has very good judgment so I think I think this is a perfect time\nFor him to start the procedure put a stop to this food ... or ... yeah I was I said well fifty years he has a good judgment to people and situations\nOh you're in you're absolutely right he has to do something to this incentive by these people because he cannot wait like I said last week\nHe can't wait for them to come to the border where there's a clash that where the orders are going to be there with their cameras you know fifty cameras aimed at every single angle to catch whatever happens and where it out there and of course edited and make it look bad for Trump he can't wait for that he has to set up you have to take drastic measures\nTo did art and apply them from even coming and say look I'm not only sending five thousand people you're going to have to face off with when you get to the border but I\nJust 'cause you get to the border and if you managed to get across you're not gonna just plop your baby down there and say you're now a citizen\nSo it has to do something\nAnd you know I think this may be a even a retroactive you know to the uh\nYou know to what was at one point eight million they would go out and they refused to agree to that\nUm I think this can actually be retroactive if\nIf if he wants it to be but you know I think the second thing is you do is cut off all fun and so the three Central American\nCountries as well as Mexico where do you have a five hundred million dollar stole for those three countries or Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador and we're getting almost two hundred million to Mexico that's a heck of a lot of money for people that do want to follow the law\nI think it's ridiculous to get over one medical you know the way they're treating our government and our border and\nUh you know in general that have\nNo respect for us\nAnd you know eighty or Seventy or eighty percent of these people are actually me and it's been reported than in years now yeah\nAbout thirty five years old I mean they might be armed and there'll be Clint pistols or not you know these guys when they when they get to the border um most of them have really education I heard yesterday they don't even speak Spanish but who speaks streets Spanish probably less than us\nSo that was really education or the yesterday they don't speak Spanish doesn't speak street Spanish or the last week and that really education those skills\nI mean if it is I end up and I think what a good move today\nThanks ... shape the call I really do and the complements uh uh you know pay later [laughter] All right um yeah I agree he has to do something and he has to put the squeeze on 'em and here's the other thing he he should be looking into not to mention I'm\nChanging the funding or at least threatening to remove the funding for these Central American countries in Mexico but he needs to be looking into finding out who is helping these people along the way if it's just Mexican citizens that are there\nOkay let them do it you can't stop them but believe me the funds are limited when it comes to a Mexican a native who's just along the roadside handing out water they can only do so much I mean we're talking thousands of people here but there are other groups that are helping them that are providing the water providing the or\nSome transportation and in other things like tents and all of that not to mention what these people have cell phones and pretty nice shoes and strollers and all of that so something's someone else's involved in this and I would find that\nFind trace that Web as far as you can and and knock it off because they're they're just egging these people on and if you get rid of those people that are aiding and abetting from behind the scenes than believe me\nPeople will get tired and hungry and thirsty real real fast on their own\nAnd they only have limited funds they can't get very far\nThe fact that they could go a thousand miles through Mexico when they're poor fleeing a country that they claim is because they don't have jobs ... they can't do that on their own there's someone else helping them and we got to find out who it is All right we got to take a break Britain told me so we'll be back on the other side and Mike I'm coming to you right after

they're talking to different people associated with the synagogue where the shooting took place over the weekend or that were eleven people were killed it was tree of life synagogue in squirrel hill\n... the president and the first lady are due to arrive in Pittsburgh at any time now I Know that when I first heard of this shooting which would have been Monday\nThe initial headlines in some of the places that are ... was reading were was saying that that Trump was not welcome in Pittsburgh\nAnd it seemed really odd that that would be the headline I mean the headline the news is really the shooting and did they find the guy not whether or not the President Trump was welcome in who assumed that he was going to become an they're right off the bat anyways so odd headline\nAnd it turned out to be a false headline it we had to be corrected because ah\nThey it was really just put out there to to to suggest that\nI don't know somehow Trump's being seen as a contributor to this by the Jewish community I don't I'm not quite sure it was all just a very poorly place to headline because in fact MSNBC was interviewing the\nThe synagogue leader the rabbi of the synagogue and asked him point blank is is the president welcome there and he said most yeah\nBasically he didn't say it like that 'cause he's grieving so he said yes he's welcome he's our president I'm a U.S citizen and and he's welcome and so the fact that Trump is going there is also indicative of the fact that he's welcome a Trump's\n... have a daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared are ... ... Jews I mean Jared Kushner is is Jewish by\nA religion choice of religion as well as DNA he he's got the Jewish blood in him and then of ... is ... is a convert to do to Judaism and they raise their children that way so it it doesn't make any sense whatsoever to try and and suggest that Trump is either responsible\nTo do to Judaism and they raise their children that way so it it doesn't make any sense whatsoever to try and and suggest that Trump is either responsible\nFor the shooting or somehow anti Semitic doesn't make sense but hey they're always going to try and see if it sticks that's for sure um it's always amazing to me how quickly\nThe press was out there trying to caution the no no I I Can't even say that they were out to just flat out accused and blast him\nAbout rhetoric because words matter and I agree however they do the same people who want to imply that\nYou know round about indirect\nWay Trump's dog whistling\nHis words somehow were were interpreted to mean you know anti Semitism white supremacy to those who were willing to listen even though he never said at point blank they're always trying to imply that his indirect words go directly to the heart of the worst person possible and inspires them to do bad deeds\nBut yet when they say things and they use miss\nCame to a conclusion that that's what he needed to do we're we're not even finding out that the shooter was a Trump supporter or necessarily but just that the ... trying to imply that\nHis rhetoric has caused this violence to stir up in people's mind\nUm so you don't say I just don't feel to follow their logic\nThat you you say one thing and somehow that leads to a completely non related action on the part of an of a of a madman but when I'm Out Maxine Waters says find them in restaurants and make their life miserable and people do that exact\nThing and we catch it on video and that yeah that's the snowman related where\nWhat makes what makes it even worse though is when I hear people on the right to\nCome out and basically echo and maybe they don't attempt for it to sound like they're saying we all know of right on the right needs to change\nBut it comes out sounding like that because they get swallowed up and the whole uh we need to be better than that we need to be peaceful and all this other stuff and I'm not disagreeing with that mindset especially as a Christian were called to be at a at a higher standard right but\nJust the idea you know I mean I carry a gun though because the bad guy does something bad with a gun I stopped\nRight oh right oh I Know she you know we're always being told that we need to cater you know or comply with the tone that they want to set in 'em I say sometimes we need to push back and say you know that that's not that's not the logical answer here so we're not gonna play into it\nAnd I totally agree and it's not\nThat I Want to have confrontation at every turn\nAnd it's not that I said the Michael the other day since I've been carrying this got I find myself being entirely more polite that I was before ... because of the simple fact\nThat I Want to I don't I don't ever want to use my God I I Want it to just need something heavy that I carry around all day long lasting case right I Would I never want to ever have to use it but I'm prepared to use that if I mush\nBut I find myself being even more polite in order to avoid the chance of even using it\nWell that's that makes any sense absolutely because um because that's yeah right you're you're not letting the gun dictate you know where where you go you're dictating that so you're obviously going to use ... and where you go to avoid the conflict in and other problems\nThanks Merv I appreciate the call but when you call in\nUm I I Do want to at some point talk about something uh that happened to Jeff Sessions because we were just talking about this whole thing about how you know we we as Republicans and conservatives can\nKind of feel like we have to weigh in on these things when the left comes out and says oh the rhetoric it's causing this violence and we feel like if we don't say anything or somehow\nI'm condoning the opposite it's a weird\nIt's a it's a fallacy it's a bad way of thinking but we've kind of condition herself to always feel like we have to chime in and agree with them so that to show you know to to virtue signal that that we we are looking for violence we aren't looking for violence and if we are\nSo that to show you know to to virtue signal that that we we are looking for violence well we are looking for violence and if we aren't looking for violence and we're not looking for confrontation and we're not looking to destroy our enemy just because we disagree with them than rest in that and go on with life\nI don't I don't I don't see why we should always at every moment have to come in there and say oh me too I oh yeah I don't want violence well\nUnless unless\nUnless something's changed from the time that I said you know five months ago why why do I need to constantly be reinforcing that that I there's no evidence to indicate that I've changed my mind so why should I have\nTo always be responsible for responding to their claims because they claim it a lot and they do it as a means of controlling the conversation and the narrative\nAnd I just don't like the fact that they throw that out they break it out whenever they feel they need to to you know get gain control of things and and I don't like playing into it I just don't\nThat's my opinion um I saw I Want to talk to a I wanted to play some audio that happened with just sessions talking in Boston and I had a queued up here Henry I see you're on the line I'll get to you in a minute and maybe you want to make a comment about this but here is what happened in Boston to Jeff Sessions he was\nDelivering a speech to the federalist society of Boston the chapter their local chapter and a Methodist minister from that area stood up and felt the need to\nInterrupt rudely and her rang sessions with these claims that sound really good because their church words and\nWho who wants to um go against the word repent or love I mean nobody wants to\nTo be the person who you know down plays that but if it's taken out of context and it's used inappropriately than it needs to be challenged anyways let's listen to this guy hopefully the audio is loud enough as it gets louder as you go so here's the\nOther fellow United Methodist [noise]\nTo care for those in need [noise]\nTo remember that when you do not care for all your body\nRight [noise]\nWell thank you for those remarks and attract but I Would just tell you we do our best everyday ... Mars another minute vaudeville during farce the laws are and I started [noise]\n\n\nAll right we're\nOkay so you hear that now they this guy\nThey plan to interrupt they did so right before he started his speech but there were people within the room that wouldn't let him continue or will they let him continue but they interrupted them as well they kind of gave him\nYou know tit for tat they fought fire with fire a one of one of the ministers said or something like it you know you're not showing the love that we at all as Christians here want you to show and and the other guy yelled how do you know that don't speak for me um so\nSo these people came in and um\nWant you to show and and the other guy yelled how do you know that don't speak for me um so so these people came in and um we're interrupting the sessions and throwing the Bible at him in a in a way that I just it it appalls me here's what\nWe have a ... a separation of church and state and that is designed to keep the state from mandating a particular religion or face or way of\nBelieving mandating it across the board that everybody a government sanctioned or endorsed religion\nSo the government cannot be part of that because from that becomes all sorts of favoritism and government abuse or by endorsing any particular church or religion but that doesn't mean that the church\nPeople cannot be a part of government cannot carry their face with them and how they act and conduct themselves in government nor does it eliminate or restrict them from proceeding to do what ever their faith dictates for them to do\nSo this minister was trying to basically ...\nRather than recognize the separation of church and state for what it is and how it frees up the church and protects the church\nIs basically trying to foot waste church doctrine and and theology on the government\nMaking them do what the church is supposed to be doing so he's he took the time out to interrupt this meeting when he could have been out and doing what he needed to do what he was telling sessions to do to begin with which is what he should have been doing he's the minister\nIf he wants the church to act a certain way and he wants Christians and Methodist\nTo feed the hungry and the poor and he was referring basically to those migrants than the illegal immigrants that are coming and then he can go out there and do it no one's going to stop him\nIf he wants to run down to the border and be laying and wait for those people he's welcome to do it no one's going to stop 'em although you still have to comply with the laws are of the land regarding how you behave at the border which I Would assume is a is a different way than if you're just in the interior of the United states but\nYou know he didn't do that he felt the need to go and basically virtue shame sessions and say you're not doing it and we're calling on you to repent Sessions is doing his job as a government official\nTo enforce the laws of the land which is also biblical in command it\nOf Christians so I don't know if it drives me crazy I Can't believe it it it's not ... and I hesitate to even discuss it because you know you're you've got this guy talking really lofty terms very valuable terms repent love be their hands and feet of Christ yes yes\nThe perceived a presentation that you're required to do the political dance that you're supposed to do to gain the vote and instead he just blew through in both both sides and said no I'm\nI'm Talking to the American people straight I'm telling them what I see I think they see the same way and sure enough we did\nExactly we felt that he was real that he was given to us like we would talk to each other about these things at the dinner table\nWe would argue him you know and we talk about 'em as families as committed communities\nAnd we have problems existed just like when they tell us right now but illegal ah um criminal aliens are very nice people and uh we should protect them over the uh original citizens in the cities\nThe sanctuary cities you you're going to tell me you're going to vote for somebody who believes that an illegal alien criminal should be protected\nUnder the constitution before the citizens that voted for you now how do you get along with somebody who believes that how do you ... you go ahead and make agreements or change your way of talking to them if the if they don't believe in the constitution itself\nAs far as a gun rights as far as the whole thing is that they know am I supposed to get along with my buddy who believes so opposite the way I Do right and the only thing that they wanted\nRights as far as all the things that they don't almost supposed to get along with a lot of your show opposite the odds are you're right you're saying that they want to do is shut me up because I disagree with him on my bed words are the words that I'm ... shows\nOr the right to bear arms is a must get points\nFor the love because it will use them to violence\nAnd show if I'm shy of words like that why am I about a person\nRight thanks for the call Henry I appreciate your calling in and I really do I'm just trying to insert myself in there and regain control because Henry is like the stolen rolling colon he just keeps going\nUm but I agree with him I I Do agree with him that you know we're when when people are when the less comes out and and they're in favor of these illegal immigrants and they're trying to massage the law in a way that will allow them in\nOr re interpret the law in a way that would allow them and they they're signaling how little they really value American citizenship\nAnd the Americans here and so and it's actually they're they're saying you know you don't matter we're we're not really concerned about what your problems are or establishing you hear in the within the borders and the people that are here we're not going to care about that we just want to bring more people in\nAnd and so by doing that the the that immediately makes ... at least me suspicious that it's not about either groups\nBecause if you can't care for the people in your constituency if you can't care for the people under your leadership you care for other people outside than really\nYou don't care for either there's something else a foot there's some other motivation because why would you ever go outside of your jurisdiction as a as a member of Congress why would you ever go outside and grab another group\nTo and bring them in there's there's something else at play here it it's you know I mean we\nWe all have our plates are plates full\nFrom Congress on down we all have enough to do to make it from one day to the next from one paycheck to the next to make put food on the table and keep your kids in decent shoes and going to school and and not sick in in ... in vaccinated and all of that we all have enough to do\nWe don't need to go out there looking for more trouble or looking for more\nPeople to take care of so when they do that when the left does that I'm immediately suspicious that like what\nYou've got enough to do here to make our uh you know bring the economy up help people get back on their feet get them into jobs helped people will be independent and self sustaining and a proactive and creative and productive\nAnd yet you're to drop and everything and going after these people from outside the border outside of the United states\nYeah that's not going over well I think it signals a\nWhole nother ball of wax and um\nYou don't it doesn't take long I guess after a while you figure out this this isn't about people this is about power this is about um maintaining control by whatever means possible and if we have to give up one group of people in order to get another people on board because we think they\nBy whatever means possible and if we have to give up one group of people in order to get another people on board because we think they have showed promise in keeping us in positions then we'll All right we'll do it ends justify the means it's not about\nThe rule of law okay I'm told by my producer go to break so here we go we'll be back in a minute and take you up to
