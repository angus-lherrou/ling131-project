me\nAnd it tell that truly does take away the pain it works is nothing else I'd ever tried to work quickly and when they had all of the pain is out to me now or at least are these you\nDo these kinds of responses unusual\nNow really are the usual really usual I mean I must say that I guess my heart that he had these things because I Know what it's like to suffer and I know what it's like to get me three and every time you know I get one of these emails are these letters they just confirms that\nHundreds of thousands of people have is my great results that's great\nI folks that want to take a

zero nine I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred for six seven nine seven zero nine [noise]\nWhat do you think folks is a pretty interesting isn't it um you know pain obviously something that that is a huge epidemic in this country I don't think there's many of us or any of us for that matter that has not experienced pain from time to time or maybe it's more serious more chronic\nUm and looking for a real solution here understanding that perhaps the pharmaceutical approaches is a now we know is not the best approach at this point because there are so many side effects associated with a with these drugs out there are a threat but\nLooking at it from a natural standpoint\nAnd Dr Janice glucose mean cream\nMaybe make some sense here I mean this is this is again putting back into your body we'd we'd do seem to discover time and time again that when you give your body what it needs it knows what to do with it and knows how to fix the problem it's only if it doesn't get those thing right that you continue to have the problem and\nAgain we've been talking about Dr ...\nHow to fix the problem it's only if it doesn't get those thing right that you continue to have the problem and again we've been talking about Dr ... cream and this was this was a number of ingredients that you put together right and and is this good for any type of pain\nIf you have pain of any kind it's kind of make a difference I mean I don't care how extreme it is mhm how minimal it is it's going to get you release\nNow it's more extreme of course it may take a little longer ... take your pain from ten to a five and ... on the line with continue to use mhm I'm telling you that's very doable yeah so this is really exciting to be able to share this with you\nYeah again I think one of the things that is that is important for people to understand what it was a very unique this was a cream yes this is not a supplement yeah there are lots of supplements out there and what do you tell someone that comes into your office and says well Dr Jana\nYou know I I've tried this I've tried that I've tried this I've tried All right things and it did not work so therefore the natural approach doesn't work\nFirst of all for glucose in Maine or MSN for that matter it takes Ninety Days for them to notice something if in fact they're going to notice anything because they may not be breaking down and absorbing the lightning and so you're taking into early to three months people give up\nPeople in pain they won't release and they want it now right and that's why I developed this cream again Fifteen minutes and I am telling you you'll notice that it's going to the good ... and so I just gave you a challenge you know try it you have nothing to lose\nOkay again we're talking about Dr ... cream here in ... maybe ... somebody calls today gets your cream and tries it what should they expect realistically\nWithin the first Fifteen minutes as you used the cream you'll notice that pain diminishes and just to slowly as you got out alive mhm\nYou'll start to see yourself come back into life and you'll see you'll want to call people like and you'll want to talk on the phone\nYou know you want to go see your neighbors you want to go make your kids to do what you want to walk your dog again you want to do all the time and just simple things you wash the car things other people take for granted right right you'll be able to do\nRight but on the other hand people want to know that um this was not just using this they want to know that other people out there have been in their situations in in in right I've gotten results\nWill I have letters and emails from people all over the country that's my heart good about a year to hear back I have an email from ... from New York she says I have

security so yeah I'm much throwing that out the window right yeah oh yeah possessions gone home gun going off to a country that's unfamiliar ... yeah what was that lately\nWell you know in the beginning when we first got married we kinda both that said yeah we never gonna end up ever sees and then when I found out I was pregnant with my first child that kind of changed the way I felt about things you know all of a sudden I was thinking oh wait\nOh I don't want to be on the other side of the world away family and friends and I'm just kidding never mind about that [laughter] living overseas as your wages\nBut my husband was still just as passionate about it just is convinced but it kind of slowed our process down because I was like and do things [laughter] um but really I'm so thankful we look back at that time it was such a ... type of development for us we really weren't ready to go overseas at that time\nAnd so it's kinda slowly slowly the lord was inching up and moving in my heart\nAnd and my husband's too so um eventually he he made it really clear that Britain Australia was where he wanted us but it was an intense time of grief\nUm I think I I think I cried for a year and a half before we left [laughter] oh just anticipate anticipating it yeah and it really felt like we're stepping into this like big black hole because we didn't we didn't know what it was like what's going to look like\nI'm going to have a chance to go kind of survey the we did things before you move yeah yeah we had that\nWe did yet but I'm I Am\nThe we did things before you move yeah yeah we had that we did yet\nBut I'm I Am very I'm a risk adverse really and I don't like change change is hard for me so it was really a process of submission\nAn a continual process of taking my fears to the lord if I thought what is it looked like to be a parent overseas where in the world are we going to live I don't know how to\nHow banking works or is it I don't know what the money is like I don't know how to shop you all these different than any you know let alone we won't have any family we don't know anybody and um [noise] so it was it was an intense period of time of making that decision going in and\nSettling the button and it really brings you and your husband closer together because of all ... data and on you because it's like you're my lifeline [laughter] the only person I have here absolutely you know it was funny I think for the first like three months\nWe um you know at the end of the day we will be so exhausted because you're trying to reestablish alive in another country when you don't know how to do anything that you're trying to learn\nAnd even though a strong and speak English accent is so intense and the wording and so we'd have to listen\nSo hard and pay attention you stand out oh yeah yeah [laughter] and uh so at the end of the day you know the kids are finally asleep we would zone out in front of like have you ever see much yes yes we had like the first season on DVD and that was already [laughter] like if we can make it to psych\nWe [laughter] we and as as a psychology grad I got a kick out of bed to\nEnded up being the best decision we've ever made\nA transplant from Canada really not as much of a culture shock from Canada to the U. S. but the thing that got me over [noise]\nYou know the first six months really lose a lot of little things and it's like suddenly I don't have anyone I Know to cut my hair yeah I Know it seems like something silly or to take my daughter to be I don't know pediatrician like everything you've got to do you now have to figure it out because and\nIt's not something that's just part of your life or the added over time it's like all of a sudden everything ... and even the money threw me off because everything was the same color\nYeah [laughter] yeah Canada's color coded so blue name and as I as a you know well\nYeah so you you have colored money you use is usually ... you know how much it is by the color it is versus having to really so there was a time I had a heart attack where I thought I had tipped a taxi driver a hundred dollar bill instead of a one hurdle Ken\nAnd um I had this momentary heart attack because all the all the money was just looked at the same\nTo me ... [laughter] turned out I was okay [laughter] so I can kind of relate on\nSmaller scale yeah and um yeah culture shock way it was the the biggest thing for you do you think cultural yeah shock was [noise]\n...\nIt's a hard one\nUm [noise] maybe I think\nComing from the south going just really a um you know in the south everybody super friendly and everybody knows every and even if you don't know each other you act like\nAnd so they already had this whole life and in experiences and relationships and ties and things in their past that I didn't even know about and I'm trying to become their mom ... and so it was very into I mean when I say intentional I mean right down to\nA apple cinnamon smell was everywhere 'cause I heard that the strongest sent tied memory was a smell ... so like our dish detergent was apple cinnamon in our\nWhen decks was apple cinnamon and our ... I had a little these little sticky that went on the filtering furnace to blow apples and see the house so every time we went to a Cracker Barrel there'd be like some common here mom\nI'm which that's the part that right you know tend to look at your right\nNow I'm In you know a movement you know so when I even though they were older and not a baby when I hugged them I Would sway ... and hold on to them and sway and when I was cooking I'd be like come taste that I'd be feeding them and yeah you know the active feeding is very bonding\nYou went through that with your daughter and on you have a blog actually let's let the listeners no way they\nYeah you know the active feeding is very bonding you went through that ... with your daughter and on you have a blog actually let's let the listeners no way they can get that as dinner for Phillips blog dot com which is nice and easy to remember and you have to Ellen Phillips [noise]\nUm I was on their reading the other day and there was a an entry in your blog where you talked about that progression of bonding with your daughter Sylvie I was like where's the Kleenex [laughter]\nI was having a moment [laughter] can you share a little bit about that that process with that look like for you yeah\nWell like I said you know before Lucy initially didn't want anything to do with us and um you know she had spent the first Fifteen months of her life really isolated\nIn a ... um she wasn't used to touch she wasn't used to the way we smelled or spoke or sounded or look for anything and and so overwhelming yes so overwhelming and so everything with the sensory shock to her\nUm and terrifying because you know she'd been taken out of this very small world that she needs to into bigger experience and\nUm and I and the extra layer of challenge and that is that we were going through this crisis you know of being separated from the rest of her family and\nUm it's really interesting you know I think got during that time [noise] ah well one thing that she would do is she would put her hands up in the air and she would lean back as far as she could go to get away for the if I Would try to hold her and she would literally do back then in to get away\nAnd when I was going through all that the crisis of being separated from our family trying to figure out how to get home I was mad at the lord and I was leaning back as far as I could go saying you're not good I don't trust you I don't like this\nAnd as a lower began to to break me and and continue to pursue me three that I started leaning in interest\nI was doing the same thing with her so even though she was leaning back I Would continue to pursue pursuit present a uniform picture yeah it really was the the most clear the clear skillful picture of our ... you know an allergy I I'll ever experienced um [noise]\nAnd to see you know had no matter what no matter how far you lean away I'm going to continue to love to continue to pursue the same things continue to meet your needs to continue to give you a section and\nUm you know speak truth over you over and over and over and over and I called the ... the waltz the fault of safety trust stress safety trust stress safety trust stress you know to\nHelp her feel safe by by providing for her needs an intern she would take a little bit a tiny tiny step of trust and then she could rest and when it when she was a baby it was a very physical thing even her I'm relaxing enough to put her head on my shoulder\nWhereas before she would tense up and so\nBut it was a continual process it wasn't just all we've done it okay we're bonded and she trusts me now and now we get to go it was\nSafe you trust dress like Detroit stress safety ... stressed 'em again and again and really you know five years down the road now she's six years old and she oh my goodness I mean she's come so far we are very bonded\nBut there are moments um where we still have to walk again and again ... stress and I'll always remember you know if I'm tempted be discouraged if she's pulling away or reverting back to some you know behaviors I remember you know how I was ... an hour\nShe's pulling away or averting back to some you know behaviors I remember you know how I was at least the un I read this far back from the lord during a time when I did not like the way my life was going\nAnd he can teach pursue me with grace love faithfulness not encouraged me to do the same [noise]\nIsn't that amazing how what you thought\nRight was a terrible mistake why is this happening we had to play and it was a good plan it was a solid plan and now my plan is not working out [noise]\nAnd now in retrospect you can look back and see that God did that ... was orchestrating this this beautiful picture for you this opportunity to bond and I and I know because I've been in the situation\nYou don't take any of those moments where they rest and relax on you for granted ever know right [laughter] you know how hard you work for the ... right\nAbsolutely and I can't even see that I guess on some level of it if you kind of get way up above and then looked at the at deaths from a different perspective lady from God's person like that and that those two and a half months that you saw it as I'm separated from my family back in Australia\nI'm only here with her and just the two of us um maybe that was God's way of finding just the two of you yeah in order that there were no other distraction yeah\nAnd I think you know sometimes we see things as it completely negative\nBut in the bigger picture in has so much purpose ... because I can imagine once the two of you were reunited with your family and you has a completely different bond and you would have yeah have you been there together yeah all ... all of you together ... know rigidly absolutely yeah\nMy attention wasn't divided right like it would have been maybe that's exactly what did she needed in the first two and a half months yeah\nYeah I Would definitely agree wow well\nYou look at this from every life circumstance we've ever gone through ever [laughter]\nRight you know God always sees the other side but all we see is the mess we're in and the moment ... and um it it it exercises that face muscle having gone through this experience you can now you know ... draw from that when you're going through another experience you know\nWhen people listening you know maybe I've gone through [noise]\nYou know an illness of themselves for themselves or a loved one a diagnosis that's scary or a job situation or whatever it is in those moments we get we get fearful right and we were like questioning God why is this happening why are you letting this happen to me but then we get further down the road and we can look back and say\nHe was there the whole time just riding I doubt it looks like\nAnd every time we can get through that and and look back and and know that we get stronger when we head into the next one right because we say dancing in the rain is out\nYou know the storms of life and and we can dance even in the middle of the storm because we know that there is joining the journey we know he's got us ... and you'd definitely learns that for your hand in that yeah variants\nHow is it like for you you're a husband and your kids when you were finally reunited what was\nWhat side [noise] we have a video of it and it just it makes me cry every\nTime I'm like at the airport and airline or earlier yeah they had the signs and\nMy little six year old who it was definitely the hardest on her so um ... you know every day I Would call her when you know when we're still separated and she would say are you coming home today mama\nAnd I said no baby I don't I'm not I don't know when\nSo um yeah I mean they just we just collided with each other at the airport and actually I'm a funny part of it is I I was ...\nUm yeah I mean they just we just collided with each other at the airport and actually I'm a funny part of it is I I was pushing the luggage cart so it's like holding Lucy and when are pushing luggage cart and as soon as I saw them I just let it\nGo so I don't even know who it took out and [laughter]\nYou know the luggage cart roller [laughter] you know you had your priorities are odor I thought that I can see my duly\nSpark man reached out to you to go out there the crazy train with her\n[laughter] because [laughter] the victims of\nHow we have a plan yet that goes awry and then really the only thing we have control is how we're going to respond to and right exactly right um does a little bit about the book and then I Want you to share about your cars you spent seven years in Australia and then came back to Birmingham and then you had this grand plan for your kids first day back to school\n[laughter] so we'll get to that but tell us a little bit about the book first [noise]\nWell I'm here at so Julie reached out to me we didn't even know each other I knew she was I had done a couple of her studies um [noise] and but she's been following my block and she said Jennifer you write how I Would write if I could write but I Can't write so would you help me right [laughter]\nIt's a lot of right and I know right [laughter] um\nSo she had this lecture series called an hitching from the crazy trained funding arrest in a world you can't control and she said would you help me put it into a book and the concept of the book is we all have a picture of how life she go and it can be a big picture\nOf you know our kids are going to turn out and what our marriage is going to look like and what kind of job are going to have and it can be tiny pictures of I'm going to get to work on time or you know my children will appreciate the meal that I cooked them tonight [laughter]", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show",
