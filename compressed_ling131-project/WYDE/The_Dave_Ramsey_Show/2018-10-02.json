nineties due to potential military applications of take now here's the thing that scariest about all of this\nIs that all of our stuff always comes from military advances\nI Know around our last uh yeah all all of our stuff either comes from like like a\nGovernment studies somebody trying to make the government a a better product because our government overpay for something in a heartbeat\nAnd all of our stuff comes from these military advances so you you know what that tells me big days like I you know what that tells me about cell phones and radio waves and TV waves and microwaves right\nYou know what that tells me that the military has technology that we can't even fathom right now\nIt's always like we're ten years behind the military right because we get something like we get GPS will GPS is like always off right when you're driving it's all just a little bit notice that the past couple of years GPS has gotten more particular more decisive more more kind of on point\nRight oh yeah can you imagine the military is GPS how specific in point it is\nIncredible absolutely incredible\nAnd can you imagine though the smartest be an\nIn your house\nMean all the walls and all they

everything that's happening in the house I don't care how much tape you have over you're you're a bone camera saying that they're going to be able to hear anything and everything\nAnd a lot of this technology is being being done for Generation Z you have the millennials in the have generations the yeah they are working on it for them\n[noise]\nI'm telling you brother big Dave I I Can't tell you there there are points where I hear stuff like this\nAnd I think like isolated living isn't that [noise]\nYou know what I mean yeah and you wonder why he is out in the middle of nowhere yeah yeah you wonder why people want to go off grid we gave you this is not going to it doesn't matter if you're off grid or not they're still gonna be able to hear that's terrifying have you ever been down a highway one fifty like when you're going to ... you know what I'm Talking about it every day that's why I go home\nAnd is it really yeah so how we one fifty ... and uh you pass that guys like complex on the right\nWe wanted to do when we put it up there for more than saying America we are proud of it and we go through storms together and we survive we hang on and we failed\nThat message of hanging on is what resonated with the Caruso family they place a winning bit\nOf ten thousand nine hundred dollars in an auction to take home the hurricane Florence flag in honor of their brother Kevin who passed away on Sunday I\nThat is the coolest story that is so so\nAwesome and and just this that story made me think this morning like\nIt did everybody else that sold that flag like if you if you watched any Hurricane Florence coverage you saw that flag like right big day you know what I mean like that flag was everywhere like that flag was all over and so\nIf you leave that alone if you I'm trying to stand up big day my backyard it but it's so if you need to have a stand up Mike over here you know what I mean he's talking to swap real quick\nYou you need a bailout base in and get the ones that has the headphone in with it well I Love that one a long way you could just get to sit down and do whatever you know I still\nHave in my backpack 'cause we want to plug it up but I I uh I I was I was watching the hurricane Florence coverage and everybody kept talking about I Can't believe they're left that flag up there and I was like that's the coolest video image\nPicture live stream of all time I remember watching that live stream and it had twenty five hundred viewers at one point just a random point in the morning\nAnd I thought to myself what an inspiration like sign like what a point to make where you leave that to you you leave that flag out there and say you know what this is like the American spirit or this is like the Carolinas\nOr during this tragic timer this event and I just thought it was so like such a cool image in such a cool\nThing that they could put up there on a on a live stream cameras that you could literally watch Hurricane Florence as the waves increased as it got bigger you saw the flag wave harder and faster and start to shred and tear up and it sold for ten thousand dollars began a kind of thought it would sell for a little more\nYou know is it is that bad to think of me I got the ten grand's a little low\nSounds about right for me it's a pretty cool tattered flag when you've had that kind of money ten grand would be like\nOh I don't know if it's not a lot a lot it's not like the ones that come from Afghanistan and yes I have flown but it is pretty cool like you you had a family member like obviously it's not cool the family member died in that storm but it is a really cool remembrance of what happened\nDuring that storm in and all the damage it caused it it's kinda like some of those things like from Hurricane Katrina my dad was one of the first um\nNot waves but it was like one of the first groups from his company 'cause obviously he's a police officer right so he's he's a police officer and he was one of the first people from his company has like a company please I was not like a like a city or\nPolice officer right so he's he's a police officer and he was one of the first people from his company has like a company please I was not like a like a city or state or like a\nKnow like a deputy or anything like that he works for a company but he's also police officer 'cause\nThe way it was set up on the railroad building out west it's really really cool and so he was one of the first groups to get to go down to New Orleans to make sure everything was safe while they were laying knew a rail line when they were land new tracks for the railroad and so he went down there and it was like a\n... it was either like a wasteland or it was like people were just trying to survive like people were just trying to make it through until they could do something her family could come get them or whatever it may be rough and so he brought back so many different things from Katrina and it was just the coolest stuff like there was this no trespassing sign\nHad bullet holes all in it and it was like seven feet tall right and it shows the water line\nIt's still hanging up in our garage and it shows where the dirty water line was on that side\nAnd we have an hanging up on our garage kind of around the same height that it would have been out in New Orleans ... you know it's not like it's a really cool thing and obviously didn't pay ten thousand dollars for it they just kind of took it because the sun was all tour of anyhow\nBut it was just it's one of those things that it it was just a really cool like remember and from that and so like I saw that story this morning and see that store and I just think you know Hurricane Florence it came in and left and\nIt costs so much damage will order the reports anywhere from twenty billion to forty billion dollars a took over like thirty five lives I mean it was it was a massive and we made it out in for three days we covered Hurricane Florence um because\nWe had people traveling to Alabama where people traveling throughout the south everywhere trying to get away from this storm trying to evacuate and so it was just something awesome like it was just something so cool that I'm\nNot that we could cover and that we could see obviously was Deborah it's devastating but anytime you have that kind of a powerful storm hit or that's what your country is going to be focused on and so I thought that was story was awesome and just kind of a\nA reminder of Hurricane Florence bought for ten thousand dollars and obviously that money goes back to rebuilding a North Carolina and I'm a little bit of South Carolina too but while I was up in Charlotte this weekend days there was\nSo many mentions of Hurricane Florence like the grand marshal Ron Rivera was there the Panthers NFL coach or talked a little bit about it they talked about it during the drivers meeting they talked about it they basically all we can walk\nYou know you talked about I just you just keep everybody that was involved in Hurricane Florence in your prayers just just make sure you are you remember those people who are still displaced from the storm are still affected\nAre that are still affected by this storm and it was just a really really cool seeing that story there this morning I have another Hurricane Florence story as well okay\nAnd this one is

of earth I got a big day loves the name of big they are but I I was so into watching Trump talk about his time on The Apprentice\nWhile he's up there speaking in Philadelphia today and I was so busy watching him talk about his time during the British when we came back in ... break I was just ready to immediately start talking about that that show when was the crap\nWill jumps that after he loved it failed so\n... a ... voice was\nThe immediately started talking about that that show wasn't worth crap will Trump's that after he left and failed so\nThere was a fairly approved a voice was butter let's go to lives there he's been waiting for a wide six of us we want to move the new nickname yesterday nine nine thirty three to five or nine nine three three was it was a lifesaver lives there with a buddy woman\nHey what's going on that day thanks for the new handle buddy up or shut [laughter] You're welcome wrote it\nIt can appropriate I just retired couple of years ago Thirty years law enforcement\nSo I think you know so much so so you were a lifesaver\nWell I don't know about that but I guess it was pretty good I caught that just were you disconnect hey listen you know I made the call yesterday after the opposite got through voice my opinion but I had already sent a center Jones an email a couple of weeks ago well I finally got her reply back this morning\nUm to go through all the BS that he put in there but he basically said that he found Dr forward to be credible and courageous and he was concerned about it how confirming Kavanaugh would send them as wrong message to sons and daughters and victims of sexual assault\nYou would be no I Love that word credible\nLike that where it stands out everywhere you look like say like before any of this even happened on Capitol Hill oh you saw was credible allegations and I always ask the question ... what do you mean by a credible\nLike when you say credible what what is your like what point are you trying to get out or are you trying to\nSay it in a way where it makes your self actually believe it you know what I mean like you know how you talk it into kind of existence sometimes like hey I'm going to have dinner is actually going to have dinner when do you like I'm going to have fast foods and I write and then before you know it you've talked into existence like you're you're off you're not write\nLike that but that's like telling a lie long enough and sooner or later if everybody believes as true yeah to be critical you have to have some\nFactual basis and that word that word credible has just eat me up these past two weeks\nOr something else I've thought about her testimony to because she is a PHD in psychology\nPsychologist study how to read people how to address people to make them feel a certain way so as far as I'm concerned and what I can tell in my experience and talking to people interviewing witnesses and victims over the years she put on a show\nAnd I think that will evidence by the

stupid dude I'm Sorry [laughter] maybe we have different radio takes me to uh I I think maybe that does poorly what it is and it was funny I mean\nEvery day every day was two minutes two minutes after three hours a day of nothing exactly ... that was the point why did you have and\nThen I I don't know I think among guy said now go all the cat and I'm all go out time like the way you\nDo a lot of and it was always a whole lot of those ... that was the point big Dave our number eight to ... nine nine three seven first your whole three hours was the whole [laughter]\n[laughter] [noise] oh what does this um Reno your Ford's team\nSays they've reached out the FBI multiple times and still have not been contacted this is just like this even that is like a he said he said she said moment\n... ... like even that right there who were even prove that they have like reached out in the FBI just hadn't contacted back and I got to go do we know that even a valuable source like a good night is there anything that you see and you're like oh that for sure happened like\nWhat do you look at it in your everyday life and your and you know for a fact that that actually happened like things that you do like how can you trust any of this stuff going on Tony what's up rather welcome in the ...\nAre you guys um well I uh I just want to ... saying that I the only reason I'm Sharon I the only other people that know that my best friend and white lady mentioned\nSharon are you able to do their best friend and white lady here but\nOregon I'm I'm\n... that must be now it it's something that I'm ashamed to even though I Know that I shouldn't because I didn't think it just those people that think that uh you know Kevin Olival liar in any body who claims statements actually assault right whatever so I'm not\nA ... and they're right in the\nTony I lost her brother I lost Tony Tony was about to make a great point hooks looking at me like he just saw a dingo running at each of baby\nTalk I'm Sorry brother Tony recall back in the second major when somebody goes by and I and I wait until next break to take Tony so you'll just let him do that hug\nOr lost Tony there I was I was looking forward to what he was going to tell me but I'm like it's one of those things you know phone signal not always great but when it is we're rolling\nI'm just again I I look at this the the cabinet or confirmation hearing and I know\nI Am supposed to get on here every day and break it down and tell you all sides of the story and and I've been doing that but just as a as of lately it's felt like the same\nThing every day like the he said this she said that\nYou've got kind of on the on the fence\nSenators that don't know what they're gonna do you're trying to to figure out what direction this country is going to go in\n... even like this is such a weird time of the country 'cause even like McConnell looks a tad bit confident today you know I just it's one of those things\nThat and and here we got this what I was not McConnell pledges vote this week on Kevin all good and it it's one of those ... yeah we congratulated McConnell thank you it's one of those times right now where it is\nIt's just it's divisive it is what\nIt is a and I don't know why this word comes to my mind like spicy you don't need them spicy in a in a kind of hits you but like you you you kind of like the\nAfter taste of it still a little spicy and and then you're good like this whole event has been a little spicy like even if you're completely for judge Kavanaugh right just seeing this kind of hits you a little bit\nI mean the story that first of all I feel a little bit better now she has to be honest with you but but also to those people out\nThere they say that if the ... ... ... ...\nIs one hundred percent right all the time your dad Raul you've got to look at you you got to look at a much\nTony drone drunk down again Tony thank you so much for the call I ... I kind of go off what you said you got to look at the facts you got to look at both sides and you've got to figure out what happened and obviously with Tony case completely different\nUm because you like years later you went back and you realize that the girl apologizes and says I'm so sorry everything in that I put you through um but yeah I bet your friend that we could do the same way you had relations\nWhere's where's my my music that big Dave\nWhere did that my board is so mixed up now you had [noise] relations with [laughter]\nWow ... ... victims of that who Ohio wasn't ... hot\nAnd I had relations with your best friend that's probably why I never looked at the same way\nOh it is still again one of those things were\nStinks thing and you can't do anything about it 'cause you you work in the as soon as there was an allegation like Trump said I'm In front of the White House this morning where he got on the lookout for you are guilty until proven innocent now you're not innocent
