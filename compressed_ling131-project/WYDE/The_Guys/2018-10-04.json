you gotta really work to unpack a lot of what he says but it was the last caller was exactly right it is by faith through a migration do face not of works lest they mentioned boast which I tweeted that to you and um\n[noise] it but it's also a faith without works is dead justice works without faith is dead that side of James chapter to actually that is well yeah\nBut you know Henry mentioned the law and the only the only law that was actually fulfilled\nWhich Christ kept all the laws he's only man ever to walk the earth to keep all the laws are written in the Bible but the only law that was truly fulfilled under Christ was the law sacrifice and whiz ... unless you're a Jew you know it's\nThe Jewish laws don't apply to us and that's not to say the ten commandments doesn't because Christ did save you love me you'll keep my commandments up\nWe don't talk to your point\nWe are your God and country ... ...\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\nWhat about in the wake up call ladies and gentlemen listened before we get into what we're talking about you\nKnow we're talking about we got to wait to see what we're talking about just first I Want to tell you about my friends over a meal for dot co WWW dot ... dot com that's where you need to go\nIt rhymes and it was a crime I'm Sorry I Can't stop this I sound like Dr seuss so\nYesterday super busy\nDrank two cups of coffee I used to not drink coffee uh started drinking coffee this week I become like an addict at this point so I Would I drink coffee and so I I was going back and I needed to grab a some food literally three minutes before I went to class walked over\nPop the meal fit in the microwave two minutes took it out they didn't like sixty seconds and was eating it while walking to class you just can't get better than that because guess what it wasn't like a bar\nYou know everybody everybody goes and they eat they eat a bar or it wasn't like all these other things that we always go to\nIt was good restaurant quality food it was smoke chicken and Jasmine rice I\nDidn't know a Jasmine tasted like but I ate the rice Jasmine rice tastes like popcorn I'm just going to go out there and say I don't know why they call it Jasmine rice I called popcorn right because when I hear Jasmine writes I wasn't going to eat it at first but when I hear popcorn rice I'm him but I'm totally but\nNevertheless you need to go check on my friends were meals that dot co WWW dot mil fit ... is a place to go\nAnd we check 'em out let them know the Baylor from low wakeup call sent you eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three is the number to join the conversation again that's eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three\nSo before we went to break a I told do and and uh I was telling\nEverybody else that you know from a legal perspective from a political perspective whenever I make an argument I like for it to not\nUh I told done and uh I was telling everybody else that you know from a legal perspective from a political perspective whenever I make an argument\nI like for it to not I I like to have a religious side do it right because obviously your religion influences your value set your religion influences your morals it your ideological subset an atheist and even an atheist right they had these ideological subsets\nI mean they're not faith in a higher being but still they have these things that define how they're supposed to live as does any face that including Christianity so I like to have an argument it's based on those states that's right I like to have that but at the same time\nI Know not everybody agrees my faith and therefore I Want to have the discussion from a non religious basis is the true meaning of success serving others in making the community around you better I think it's really interesting question because my argument\nEarlier it wasn't really an argument my statement earlier my stance earlier was completely formulated around religion so if we remove religion from that\nWhat does it do eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three to join the conversation eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three to join Oregon a hop skip talk on my one skipped Doug how're you doing\nA good morning John them yeah this is these are really important uh topics on the on the matter of are serving others um\nI I Would suggest that the free markets and a voluntary charities or does it does a wonderful job no matter where you are on the religious spectrum I think the markets and and charities are wonderful job\nUm otherwise you're just sacrificing a you're you're giving up or something ah without much in a way of return for this world and and I wanted to talk a little bit about the um the issue of um this world this natural world\nVersus um the the supernatural world and um [noise]\nUh I I let let neat to see that some you know there is a face out there that is important people are and it is in Contra distinction\nTo the real natural world they're they're they're side by side they really don't mix well together but I what I Would ask is this is serious legitimate question no matter where are you on the ... or ... a religious spectrum is a very important question\nAnd it has to do a with opportunity cost we talked about this very important that are a last week it's it's very essential with our limited resources in time\nAnd the question I causes mess if you have\nThis very important values system called face at a resides alongside the real world how old are you know when to move from one to the other how does one decide\nWhen you've prayed enough or look for enough mirror costs are spent enough time on your knees or looking and not a scientific book to deal with\nReal physical medical problems but in the holy book and and how does one decide how to allocate their time [noise] um I I I think this is a\nIt's a it's a real legitimate question because\nI got an answer people okay great let's hear\nIf not a binary everybody puts up as a binary right you can either spend time in a or spend time and be the best thing I've ever heard was that I'm from a religious standpoint when you're going through your life you're supposed to be living your life in prayer and living your life in prayer me this constant communication with the God do you live your life with God walking\nAmong side you that's why religious people quite literally believe that God is leading you on a path um\nConstant communication with the God you live your life with God walking among side you that's why religious people quite literally believe that God is leading you on a path\nUm uh I forget the specific birth a verse but it talks about I'm On the path that he guides me like a like that's the whole principle and that God is walking alongside you said this life isn't meant to\nBe where we put God in a box right and every like thirty minutes to an hour we look to God and then we looked at the world and we look back to God and we looked at the world we live through the lens of God with God guiding us through that\nWe go into the world that makes sense well\nA ... let me let me uh pursue this a little bit further into their ah ah you know um when you're confronted with a problem in this world yeah and you struggle you have one of two choices you can I continue to pursue this in a scientific\nA rational fashion or do you advocate that and you can immediately\nLook to a higher power and search for miracles prayer and and that's and I get I understand that but the ... falls but then when you pray Wendy's one decide when to give up let me ask you thinking\nAnd and and ... and ... you're valuable time and you're valuable thoughts off to the supernatural\nSo let me let me ask you a question so if somebody has cancer and they're in a cancer ward and they're being treated for cancer they're being treated by people that have read the medical textbooks are following the regiments given to them they're following the medicine\nBut at the same time they're praying that disproves the binary you're saying because not only are they huh I'm Sorry go ahead\nSir gentleman you cannot do two things at once you cannot be thinking about doing surgery a scalpel and imagining a that that something supernatural at the same time you need to be tending to this world you cannot be distracted by something supernatural\nYou but I don't really I don't think it's a distraction and I think the idea that you can't do two things at the same time as wrong because like we can walk and chew bubblegum at the same time you know like I I mean it just the idea that we can't be thinking about\nTwo things at once I I just think that's wrong because again when you view it through a lens right I don't view it as God's going to heal me just out of supernatural power five can survive a broken leg or I Need surgery I view it as God has blessed this person here\nWho has the passions and have the talent and therefore has gone to medical school and has\nThis knowledge this knowledge that have come through the world the world that God created and he\nThrew a blessing from God is going to heal me you can look at it in the same and it's not this binary that set up to where you have to either be in God or be in the world I mean I think that bind area's really falls\nI think that by area is essential and it really a a really a determines how this world is is going to the um pursued now um [noise] if if if the supernatural\n... let me let me ask you a question when you are so I I mean I Know we're not going to agree on this\nBut I just want to go ahead and say that I like to hear enough I'm so atheism in and of itself as a theology ... theology my apologies that was a mess that was misspoke a misspeak atheism in and of itself is a um it it is an idea it's an ideology right there is nothing nothing to prove\nAtheism just like there's nothing to prove religion there is nothing to disprove either of them so atheism in and of itself is an ideology\nTherefore are you pursuing the world with this idea are you entering what you would call the world and its binary with the view of ideology of through your ideology\nThey prayed for that Dr right they prayed\nFor the blessing of that doctrine that Dr increase their lifespan exponentially might've also walk through with somebody who beat cancer right I've walked through that journey with them and they prayed for that Dr ... we had prayer circles where we prayed for those doctors that we're working on him\nBut we we pray I mean you always hear whenever somebody is going into surgery we pray for the hands of the doctor to work as seamlessly as they can to work fantastic in there to be no mistakes et cetera you don't pray\nFor essentially just a miracle to happen and God to he'll he'll young spot sometimes you do and that has happened with some people right but largely enough it's these it's like the people that don't get their children vaccinated\nBecause they think God will protect them I personally think that's really stupid I think God gives us the knowledge\nIt's like the people that don't get their children vaccinated\nBecause they think God will protect them I personally think that's really stupid I think God gives us the knowledge to look and see\nOkay this vaccination inherently helps people this vaccination that God gave somebody the mental cognition to understand and come up with this vaccination and it keeps you safer and improves your lifespan\nOne guy's creations made that with the knowledge got put in his head so you should use that because scientists conclusively proven that it helps you not get sick\nRight it it's just it's it's a basic idea and so I think that binary is inherently false then he was saying look there's scientific truth and there's and there's what religion believes and he said two plus two equals four\nAnd I I I took some I push back on that and then he tried to make the argument or using two plus two dozen equal for I'm not saying two plus two dozen equal for I'm seeing two plus two does equal for but two is inherently a unit of measure right we're going to have something plus two of something equals four of something\nIn that unit of measure isn't entirely\nMan made just like the construct of time we didn't appear on this earth and then there was time like there's night and there's day that's the only time that is natural\nRight these these twenty four hour cycles we operate on I mean it has to do with the earth rotating right or what we perceive it does it does have to do with the earth's rotation was not a perception of the earth's rotation it is the earth's rotation but nevertheless\nA lot of these things a lot of these contracts especially having to do with measurement are manmade\nSo Dylan you had a really good point on this as we were going to break so what do you think of that idea because ah you you took ... I saw you like pop up you're like I got this I Know the answer when he was like two plus two equals four and I was like it's actually a unit of measurement by man what do you think\nAbout that okay let's go back to the time for just a moment yeah you said that night and day is the only measure of time that we have yeah well natural measure\nOur long and that I Would even argue against that because I told me one night and day or the manmade contracts to ah\nDesignate I uh I guess would be the proper word which a side of the earth you're on that's currently facing the sun or not yeah so we're just on one big ... that spinning in or orbiting a massive ball of fire\nYeah that's about where\nThe non main made a description in ... yeah\nEverything pass that that would like lead into time yeah is completely manmade night and day hours minutes second ... years even that's all manmade yeah\nSo in your major I Know you do a lot having to do and you have studied this a lot a lot of having to do with numbers and calculus and things of that nature so what do you say to somebody that says like two plus two equals four obviously that's true but can you break down is that a man made measure is not a manmade measure\nOkay so number systems are completely manmade there are number systems out there where you can say an be valid that two plus two equals ten\nThat two plus two equals eleven ... I think there is the only to alternate on honestly but there are alternate a number system ... number system that we currently use is known as the base ten mhm okay\nSo\nHow does this work is you can look at you\nIt's known as the bass man mhm okay so\nHow these work is you can look at each value as being different exponential of that base number though and depending on what you change the base to you'd have different values like a a\nA base to number system is all one ... zeroes ... whereas a base ten is anything from zero through nine in each place value\nAnd that makes sense because everything is alternating going up by tens and I ... I really like the fact that we're able to bring that up because I think that ... and I made the claim during last conversation that a lot of atheism is a faith set rise not faith in a higher power it's actually the opposite it's a faith that there is no higher power\nBecause you cannot prove God nor can you disapprove God just like you can't prove there is no God and you can't disapprove there is no gun both are\nEntirely sat around a state right you have faith that this is true\nAnd you can point to things that you say are evident cheery basis is for these claims but at the end of the day the proof isn't conclusive did get thrown out in the court of law you cannot prove either beyond a reasonable doubt\nSo the question then remains a ... it\nReally strikes the heart of this binary that you can either view the world through the world through objective fact when a lot of the things we perceived to be fact art in fact man made the way that we view the world right and so this is a really really\nComplex idea but I'm Glad this conversation open up because this is something that we cannot\nOverlook\nAnd when we come back ... are going to try to break down the conversation of\nOur our service the way to success\nFor non religious standpoint that's how we're going to close up the show we had some news to bring you but we can bring it to the more I think this is a really important conversation and I want to pursue this conversation the final Fifteen\nBut we're about to get a banana here's a live from recall chaos heating and AIR Studios Alabama license one eleven Tony is the wakeup call you're listening to the wake up call\nRaised in Alabama educated at John Carroll Sanford university you a big and Birmingham School of law you've seen my face off thousands of billboards but did you know that over twenty five thousand of your neighbors have trust me when they needed help the most\nThat's what I'm thankful for I'm Alexander ...\nA man for the people I Want to be your attorney call me Alabama representation\nIt's maintenance quality legal services be screaming and those lawyers [noise]\nForty of 'em the Ford faction stay traditions of the original state inspired apparel company they offer upscale casual clothing including shirts hats how to wear ties shores accessories\nWas subtle stage civil West I'm guessing you probably want to represent our great yellow hammer stay real hammer supply company has a great mix of shirts and jackets and even workout floating was a subtle yellow birds that we all know stay traditions can be found at the summit imagery lowly Pulitzer into Scott [noise]\nYou want to melt fat and get him didn't have the body you've always wanted to send you need to check out iron try fitness through high intensity interval training and nutrition education I even tried to get help these trends Saturday muscle irons rather currently looking for forty locals who want to participate in a free six we challenge that is guaranteed to get the result\nThey'll be trends Saturday muscle irons rather currently looking for forty locals who want to participate in a three week challenge that is guaranteed to get you to go\nWith that challenge you get a cut the meal plan personal accountability grocery list and so much more as long as you reach your goal wait the challenge is absolutely free contact your closest tried today to find out more spring\nThe whole family out to a Talladega super speedway for the kid the PAX Syrian kids twelve another tissue from a number of great options behind the scenes like guy garage doors pre race but a lot more there's more than a raid Talladega\nThose super station is coming to your home to go to one or one W.

moments ago from one of our dissidents to the north\nAre all caps oh lord Ron Paul presidential alert [laughter]\nJudge Kavanaugh approved of the CIA kidnapping and torturing a foreign nationals more relevant that anything he did or drank forty years ago\nAll caps again this has been a test no action is necessary\nThat's from Cali\n\nTaxation is theft yeah no war for oil\nIt's always a good guy though he's well he's one of those got a guy who does love disagreeing with and he always does or respectfully and it was kind of funny\nYou know at the original name for a um a while I was ... what Operation Iraqi freedom of the war you know the original acronym wants to know Operation Iraqi liberation and they changed it because it's spelled oil oh no\nI I Am dead Syria that nice that nice All right I Want to kind of a circle back briefly the stuff that you brought up a few moments ago\nBecause I think in ... I'm going to just do this in\nAs monotone voice as I Am I'm capable of because it's one of those things I could go off very quickly pulling up information on the I won't get into the composition of rice and but I Want to read this to you\nRight soon causes severe diarrhea and vomiting and victims can die I'm circulatory shock or Oregon failure inhaled rice and can cause fatal pulmonary edema or respiratory failure\nNow that was sent to the office of Ted Cruz and the White House\nAnd the Pentagon and the Pentagon Madison as well get a letter\nYou people realize that these are attempted assassination attempts I don't think they do I mean I just wanted that to hang out there for just a moment\n\nNow these are attacks coming from a\nLeft leaning and misguided individuals but the national news media is not playing it\nFrom a left\nLeaning and misguided individuals but the national news media is not playing it\n\nFor the attention that it deserves now there is no chance in heck that a ladder is going to make its way to the president's desk without going through several channels so it was an ill fated attempt but an attempt it still was\n\nNow that's not to suggest because there was a lot more attempts on rock Obama's life in the news that morning and I assure you there's been a lot more on Trump such as this that are not ill fated but not nearly as close to home considering that the White House\nThese were tempted acts to kill a senator a president and a cabinet member\n\nPonder that for just a moment that that's where we are in this country today that's what this argument has degenerated into and I'm I tell you in in a marriage the cloak terms I can think\n\nIf political dissidents or on the left wanna fight\n\nPolitical patriots on the right will give you one\n\nWe will go wall sons do you don't know the reference Google it sure you have your iPhone right there in front of you\n\nAs you selfie an Instagram you holding and\nUnloaded twenty two that you're saying is an AR\n\nWide the funny thing is I Know you saw [laughter] so it's a ... yeah do they have a chainsaw attachment [laughter] [noise] uh-huh ... like\nThis big guy like a wire coat hanger for a scope it was it was really you know pretty inventive\nMhm\nI don't ever foresee this country going to anything remotely close to a full fledged civil war as we now and there are people out of all we could never that that could ever well it's happened before\n\nAnd frankly you could make the argument for a less emotional topic or issue that we're currently into\n\nThere was the you know obviously slavery but that may or the economics of the south versus the north not going to get into a debate about the civil war\nBut the lab legitimately feels like they are about to be killed harassed imprison aborted et cetera et cetera does it give you an idea of ... idiotic it's gone with them there is a story that perhaps we'll get into just a little bit later on\nWhere some groups on the left are concerned about a person that Trump is going to appoint head out the Census Bureau and the concern from some left leaning groups\nThat this person or what a lemonade the counting of elite\nIm a concern from from left leaning groups\nThat this person will eliminate the counting\nOf illegals or undocumented people for the purposes of voting\nThat's how far afield they are and to protect that power the power in the halls of Congress or wherever it is they will go to great lengths and they will employ their armies\nAre brainwashed ignorance sicker ferrets to carry out their dastardly deeds\nDirty deeds done dirt cheap\nI mean sorry Paige we don't pay that well\nWell y'all want to go there hey\nBaby weaker locked and loaded that's what you will turn it into the menu of attempted assassination\nAgainst the president of the United states\n\nAnd some of our more urban areas there is the possibility that we can see the limitation of martial law in some of these larger cities\nThat's going to really really sent some heads of spending\nBy whether or not you know there is a start to be a\nWholesale arrests or suspensions of Haiti is corpus or anyone of a number of uh\nA political strategies you know that is that is just something which is kind of you know you got to be seen and hard to foretell but I Do feel that there is a something in the wind at least on a minimal to moderate scale and we're just going to have to buy our time where we can really comment on any further\nWhat part of part of it comes from the all the field indictments they keep a referring to [noise] um [noise] what else for I think in um [noise]\nThe fact that a Trump some of the ... or executive orders were very specific in uh in their wording like they're targeting they're gonna they're gonna use it to get somebody\nRight and uh [noise] I Can't help but hope I I mean it is a bit of a fantasy but I've been I've been wanting these traders brought to justice now for eight years\nWell I don't think a lot of people realize particularly from the left that if you if you box Trump ... any further into a corner you know they think that he's been out there swinging now we ain't seen nothing yet good taste something this man is enjoying himself\nI agree [laughter] and you were mentioning guns which is a kind of poignant because uh one of the aspects to undo the element of surprise and I think he's working on that\nYep rings superior forced to bear always take the high ground\nYeah\nEven even Nathan Bedford Forrest he he referenced sons doing some of his strategies you know he didn't say bring superior forced to bear but he did tell us troops one time that one of his drowsy is was get their first with the most men\nHave now and didn't didn't come and go to a military school or college\nI Am I on I honestly do not know I honestly do not\nBelieve you did [noise]\nHe might have dirt good call thanks for making it by by\nYeah I think that there's going to be some kind of response that might catch some folks off guard\nBecause if the safety and security of this country because you got to remember something that and again I'm not going to get along for a debate about the impetus for the civil war but we we do know one thing about you know Lincoln's ideology and that was he was not going to allow the country\nTo be fractured he was not going to allow the states to permanently secede from the nation and that was a big inspiration for him\nAnd if you see something along the same lines as it relates to Donald Trump's frustration\nThere could be a backlash again I don't think it's going to be nationwide or you know I mentioned to ah to James in the parking lot that it might be something akin to the days immediately following the assassination of Martin Luther king even in in if you remember back during the uh the Rodney King trial\nAnd I lived in Atlanta at that point in time and I remember going into downtown Atlanta all that was going on and you would see windows\nBy anti at that point in time and I remember going into downtown Atlanta while all that was going on and you would see windows were big sheets of plywood over them whereas with the the merchant might've spray painted black owned\nYou couldn't even go into some parts of town\nNow in that period in my life that's what that was the early days of my um my contracting training if you will I was in the contracting sales industry than cops short going into certain parts of Atlanta the postal service in a while and but I was a part of my job\nAnd I saw firsthand the right some people were reacting and we're we're going to see something\nNow it's going to be not so much the predictable response from the left but the unknown response from the right it's going to determine what this becomes because up to this point and I think you'll have to admit this is true\nI Do this point their response and a lot of these rallies has been tested\n\n'cause I'm gonna tell you right now I'm going to die of going to reveal to you a character flaw of mine somebody gets in my face the way they've done with Charlie Kirk and so many others\n\nThis old white haired privileged guy is gonna go son zoo\nI'm Sorry that maybe that German Irish New Yorker temporary mine\n\nAnd it's like you know well I won't share that with you a little bit too revealing\n\nBut um it's gonna be interesting to see because if we whether Kavanaugh nomination peaceably now we can get this thing going here in this country and really start doubling down on the policies that are going to benefit us all\nBut if we get distracted from having some kind of a ... by civil unrest this for a longer protracted versus the economy's gonna tank jobs will be lost businesses will start off loading employees\nStocks will fall it will not be ready as I'm On the high price to pay for one Supreme Court nominee\nAnd one is really no more right wing and several others currently on the court but that's what's at stake at this point let's get out the ... river we take our next break heck mark how are you\n[noise] hey I'm doing well my own yourself oh just okey dokey\nSo you know between the potential of a ... D a press conference that come and I think we're missing something truly historic that may have just happened\nDid the Republicans just game the Democrats on this thing I mean\nWow if that's the way this thing happened and you know victory just didn't kind of fall into their lap with the a job that ms Mitchell did and the way everything's falling apart for the dams\nI'm really impressed\n'cause I mean you know my biggest knock on the Republicans is they had no game for a very long time\nWell you know there there was also send\nIt was I mean you know my biggest knock on the Republicans as they had no game for a very long time\nWell you know there there was also some debate last night about what Democratic senators might also flip\nIt over years Joe Manchin has been very popular in a write in his race he's down by thirty points he almost has no choice but to vote for Kavanaugh\nYeah I I you know if ... here's the way I see if you have two Republicans that will vote no then any Democrat that vote yes\nIt's going to be vilified forever and so it won't happen but if you have fifty Republicans\nThat vote yes then you'll have three or four Democrats at least right you know we won't have a situation where pets needs to come in it'd be the top breaker oh because they know he'll do it and what you got I Can't mention McCaskill\n... there's at least four of them right now but they need those votes oh and yeah they'll definitely will just to get those votes\nWell you know it's it you know sort of Clark and uh these these clause I historians out there that have their head up their backside don't realize that there was a time recently in this country where the confirms Supreme Court nominee you\nHad to have sixty votes to the affirmative that was changed from sixty to fifty one you know who did that you made that change that's exactly right Harry Reid\nWhy don't you know one of the uh the Democrat's biggest heroes so now it's just like with the nuclear option they employ a certain strategy that when it's potentially used against them they start screaming found\nWell really got to think about changing the rules of engagement when you have the upper hand because you might not always have that upper hand and then those rules that you might come back to bite\nYou and that's exactly right part good call turning a breakup you have a wonderful day\nCare man you to stick around coffee pot for me we'll be right back\nSaving this tribute Michael has his doodle it's a good day on superficial one oh one you want to be\nEvery business needs good partners to help them succeed and meet their goals vertical solutions media has been working with small to mid sized companies in the Birmingham area for over ten years in fact they've been the trust that marketing partner for this very radio station for almost three years\nVertical solutions media has experience working with a wide range of industries with companies of all sizes small retail stores ... corporation their approaches customize to the needs of each client whether offering occasional projects support or fully integrated day to day marketing operations in addition vertical solutions", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Guys", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "04"}
