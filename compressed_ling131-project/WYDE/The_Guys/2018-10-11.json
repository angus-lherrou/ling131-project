they use the N word\nNot the N. word that is commonly referred to when people say the N word modern society but the N. word that is referred to when people uh that that is the Spanish word for the color black\nThat was then that term was then morphed into what was used during the times of slavery\nIt was used on CNN multiple times the other night in people laughed they called Kanye West the token and that word\nThat's not me inferring something that's a direct quote and then a former congressman came it came out and said that's what this is a quote I Can't get this wrong because I'll get fired it says quote\nKanye West is what happens\nWhen that word don't read\n\nAre you kidding me if anybody else use this ever anywhere else would there not be repercussions\n\nBut Republicans are the

school my town in my state on the map\nMhm I promise you I Would have gotten the national news coverage\n... from a current event happen on CNN ... with the other way around it was like you say nothing on base says it would be\nFunny all these little old Joe y'all are taking that the wrong way yes you know at a Republican do it\nAnd it's oh so wrong let's pick and choose who don't who are both\nIn isn't that absolutely insane that that standard the standard of blatant racism only applies to Republicans\nAll it only Republicans all along just trying to do what's right or trying to save a jury\nAnd doing a pretty darn good job of ... and uh\nYou know all we weren't if I Want to know we're always have war that said if Trump gets elected a move now Joe citizenship de ... when you all you know\nYou know\nAll of what you say do what you said you've shown to offer got their Democrats their life is\nThank you thank you bye\nAppreciate it [laughter] All right we're going to help out the Jackson online too if you want to join the conversation eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three again it's eight six six by by one Ninety nine thirty three who's going to Jackson my mind to Jackson\nHow you doing man what's up how you doing\nYou said that you would be fired and she said that word rat correct a knife is blackie would I think a double standard is the white and black blast going to say the Spanish word for that day they\nWere just starts for a new ark I honestly don't know what they're saying it's just not a not a rat\nI honestly don't think so I think on superstation one on one whether you're white or black and he said that words you'd be fired hound and that's the scenery probably more it's not something that we've put in place\nYeah um Santa cross across the board by people can say well this wherever lacking Nobel out to say the word ... they just said a word it they're talking a anyway they want to say\nBecause they're so called their word because editor lab sound you hear just about will say that we should be a few times in the south\nThat's OK why would they can't say though wow why is that why is that\nI mean you're you're right Jackson hey why don't you want\nTo say this is what are they a de sad if there's such a horrible why or why are they still say that my black so who is the black leadership on either side coming out we're gonna we're gonna just abolished just word\nOn a habit either by not use it and and we're in ... you know so there there's a problem right there I mean\nIt's very accurate Jackson\nOr and what is that what was that any by Republican area by on a ... coming out now\nUm you know some Caucasians had been in life so we cannot use the word Caucasian if that's the basis for your a target you know terminology for that particular group of people so you got to be consistent about it\nI Am being consistent about it I'm ... I'm saying exactly what I'm thinking that terminology has been used when it's being referred to as slaves you can say the Caucasian word has been used book that I'd like to see it I'd like for you to point that out to me\nThe Martin Luther King in his speeches he used the word energy or oh hey if you use it multiple times I've heard him say that and very speeches so uh you know there's no consistency about it\nCorrect but he was going back he he was in the civil rights movement he was talking about getting equal rights for all people he was taking that word right there had been used to refer to slaves in trying to make all people equally it's entirely different\nDon't know why he used it but he used a Baylor and so I'm just saying we have to be consistent I'm not arguing about it um but most people I've been around that using a black people and uh you know the word with ... jeeze um and I don't know many people use the word any G. R. O. unless it might be Spanish people\nPeople and uh you know the word with ... jeeze um and I don't know many people use the word any G. R. O. unless it might be Spanish people are so you know there's no consistency about it and I guess the thing to do this not use any form of it\nAnd that's exactly what I'm calling for I think that there should be no use of the word I think\nWhat was said by CNN was wrong I think what's sudden rap songs a lot is wrong I think it's wrong across the board I think that words words in and of themselves aren't bad until a motive is assigned to them weren't no word is bad the word for donkey used to not be bad in fact the word for donkey was used in the Bible\nRight however when a different meaning is ascribed to it that's when a word becomes what is considered bad biased society\n... let me tell you this one time I ask a friend of mine who was a he's a professor in a in a university here in Alabama I said how did your people uh you know um determine whether you use the word African American or black\nHe said well he said we use the word African American the term African American if if the people had relatives who was former slaves you know years ago he said we use the word black if they are\nPeople who just migrated to the U.S immigrated to the U.S you know after the civil war days so you know there's all kinds of interpretations of how to use the word or even the word black offend some people so so it's a very touchy subject or\nIt's not just the N. word but even some people say you can't use the word the word black\n... because that's the basis of it in English you know but it but he came from the Latin word in a GE or that was the original word for black and you know Latin is the basis of our language so ... so a ... orange translate the various languages and it took on different spellings\nVery wandering point pardon I said very interesting point\nOr so you know I I think people the basic premise the I think we're all too sensitive about everything you know it's just a a ... we'll get to the point of just\nUh being super sensitive about some things that don't really uh uh are not meant to offend people and I'm a a lot of mine just stay out of ignorance you know uh\nI disagree entirely because I think that that word and like it's not a case insensitivity that word was used in a derogatory term when people were defined as property I don't think that's an over sensitivity issue whatsoever\nWhich were you talking about\nBoth of the words that you owe reference to both of the words start within\nNo that's not true or or the one who ends up oh a used around the world even nowadays but other other nationalities\nYes but we are talking when you look at a worm right you're looking at it\nFrom a societal perspective right I'm\nTalking about the American society in which we exist in was that where was it or was it not use during the time of slavery to denote somebody that was viewed as property\nWell but they say yes or no question hundreds of years it's a yes or no question I'm\nNot only then even hundreds of years before that so you cannot say that that was the base it on the\nI'm Talking about it from a societal perspective though the society is what deems the word is that there are many words throughout history that have had different meanings\nYou think we should stop using oil Caucasian because a lot of Caucasian people have been slaves ... had they been in slave in this\nHad different meanings oh you think we should stop using oil Caucasian because a lot of Caucasian people have been slaves\nWhat have they been enslaved in this country and has Caucasian been used as a term to be derogatory towards them as a means of property in this country\nA lot of hours that it it's a yes or no question of Irish or slaves in the U.S so we cannot use what were they called Caucasians yeah of course yeah\n... listen there is no evidence Uri basis for that you show me that then will then we'll have a discussion on it\nTo do is go to the owner breached dictionary which is one in the library about a foot thick\nAnd look this up I'm dating myself and then you'll understand the history of the word\nYou're cutting out some information is true and so you're Russia's falls uh so you may still be a little bit and you can't just give up your phone I mean a lot of it at first I thought it was it was not totally correct you know where that definitions and all that so if you go look at the British dictionary the largest look in the library\nThen you'll see the basis for these words\nOkay Jay W well there's also a Harvard professor that says the history that you're bringing to the table is wrong a Harvard professor then I listened to when talking about this video ... who is whole area of expertise is words relating to race so I mean it's just a difference and opinion\nIt's not a blatant falsify the but I appreciate the call we're going to go out to Murph online to measure of how you doing\nRight you've got to get buried and semantics and it and it gets you nowhere because ... is not progressed\nAt all and uh here in America if you want to talk about white people were called the slaves that were called Irish so does that make Irish racist I digress\nI'm the issue here though because you have a\nPanel of black people talking about another black person is not a racist statement ads bigoted and derogatory and all that jazz but it is elite is it gives the issue is not an issue of race they have ... use race to drive a when\nI get is a and I want to ask me minded people I I Want to ask you a question because I think it is now that word is supposed to denote skin color right and this reference it's supposed to know the color black\nNow I've heard this a lot of times when people say white or black\nThere are very very few people that are fully white and they're very very few people that are fully black so in that you're seeing the exterior of somebody and you're just saying well your this because you kind of look darker is that not in of itself discriminatory off of the way that somebody looks which\nWould be raised when it's discrimination off of skin color\nSo oh jeez look\nIt if if somebody comes up and mugs me and I'm Talking to police and it just happens to be a black man that bugged me then I'm going to tell a place a black man mug me\nYeah I'm not being racist I'm telling effect if it was a Mexican that did it that's fine if it was a white person that did a white person whatever it's a descriptive terms so that you know\nI Know when it now but when it's being used to group people together and speak derogatory the derogatory towards them that's a different concept\nBut you're you're lost and the semantics because it's elitism\nRacism is derived from the idea of the theory of evolution which comes out of\nTrying to say that one group of people is better than certainly started as animals but idea that we evolved from whatever single celled whatever or we evolved from monkeys and somehow one group evolved more than the other\nThat we evolved from whatever single celled whatever or we evolved from monkeys and somehow one group evolved more than the other\nAnd it was a white guy named Charles Darwin was postulated this and so he's saying that white people evolve higher than black people and that's just not true because there is only one race and that's the human race and that's biblical ... the idea here is you have a group of people who are\nOverly educated overpaid and eh belonged to one particular party and they are of one mind set and they therefore think themselves better than everybody else they're our callers that call into the station who are black\nWho tried to play his pose themselves as morally and intellectually superior to all of us white racist Republicans\nSo the idea here is elitist some rock Obama did nothing for the black community black community actually got worse under his leadership and he was a black man even though he's half white so the idea is not even racism its elite is\nIf you have a certain level of education a certain amount of money and a certain mindset you're better than everybody else whereas on the conservative side of thought\nIf you you know everybody is basically the same I stand next to doctors lawyers and CEOs as a\nIgnorant truck driver with no education and they are my equals where I stand next to them now I might work for them or they might be my customer and I treat them with

Hernandez sophomore and she was arrested on battery charges so\nWell can we be even remotely shocked about that when you have comments such as Hillary Clinton's that uh it's time for Democrats no longer be civil with the geo pay and that's got so many people rankled that even Heidi Heitkamp who is a Democrat herself\nHas called Clinton out on this and several others have is well\nWhat about Eric Holder yesterday the video that leaked of him at a little gathering or what ever said\nIsn't several others have as well\nWhat about Eric Holder yesterday the video that leak of him at a little gathering or whatever said uh well is it um\nWhen they go low we go high right he said no no no no no no no when they go low we kick them yeah so I understand he might have been speaking in a metaphor metaphorically speaking people don't see that\nWell let's take the metaphor thing back a few years and recall when Sarah pale and use the word tar the phrase targets on their ... and the Democrats took that as\nLegitimate physical shoot them where they are targets on their ... and that is you know it's it's funny because the Democrats employ these strategies and and they accuse us of victimizing them with the strategies that they themselves authored\nNow figure that out because there's anybody when the sound of my voice or in this room remember a time politically speaking where it was as contentious as it as an civil as it is right now that is all being all third from the left\nI don't remember anything like this growing up I remember in the eighties you had the pockets of idiots out there like the um\nMost of those for a Klan members immobile yeah that hung a gentleman downtown the black gentleman downtown and Jeff Sessions was the attorney general that's on friday and they got prosecute and all that mess but as far as politics now I don't remember ever seen anything like this and\nIt's getting worse and worse and worse in the media is they're the ones that are pushing it and getting it out there and they are and and they're they're the ones that are culpable I mean if you look at it Rand Paul came out I think it was it yesterday or day before he came out and actually made a statement quoted the shooter at the ball field\nOf what he said now this was not in the FBI or the D.C police report was released to the public or anything like that the guy started shooting and screaming this is for health care right why weren't we made aware of all of that because the left does not want\nThe troops to come out ... really and truly they don't want the truth that come out now the Fox news and the other right leaning places sugarcoat things are sometimes ... yeah sure but who doesn't more like Baylor was talking about this morning CNN look what they were giggling about about Kanye West the right\nNow you're exactly right then an interesting op dad came out yesterday about the five different strategies that the\nThat the Democrats are discussing asteroids to Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court and we could elaborate on this research is one of them is packing the court the court packing plan another one that's being bantered back and forth\nIs impeachment against a city and the Supreme Court justice was only been attempted one time in the history of this country there is a constitutional I'm loving this\nConstitutional overhaul the Democrats are now suggesting that we read write the constitution\nOK\nMhm there's also putting that term limits on Supreme Court justices which kind of parents back into rewriting the constitution says that as they constitutionally protected right and finally enforcing what it's called the McConnell\nRule the debate centers on Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell's decision not to hold hearings for Merrick Garland if\nYou remember that back in two thousand sixteen to replace a Antonin Scalia but ...\nIt's a system not to hold hearings for Merrick Garland if you remember that back in two thousand sixteen to replace a Antonin Scalia\nBut here's where the Democrats and not not the Democrats here's where the left is don't realize what they're talking about I don't understand what they're talking about\nSupreme Court justices attorney general's ambassadors they're appointed they're not elected so they don't have terms\nTheir point to the position so really and truly a G. or any ambassador ship in any judge or any appointment is a lifetime appointment until you get fired right after the Supreme Court but it until you get fired or quit\nCongress is elections we have tournaments for president if they're going to say oh we need tournaments were Supreme Court justice well guess what you do need to write term limits for yourself Oh absolutely\nAbsolutely and you know we often has started talking about the recall votes or impeachment votes against these very people but I I think it's important for folks to understand\nThat the Democrats are are so panic so far afield so freaked out there talking about the possibility of a constitutional overhaul which was basically a rewrite\nThe change either the terms on the Supreme Court or the electoral college I'm going to tell you something these people have lost their minds\nAnd I I don't I don't want to say it's funny but it's funny\nI mean it's it's so it's so unbelievably ignorant and you know the thing is\nIf you if you look at the United states as as a map people you know there are obviously family for tonight as America\nBut when we talk about it we're talking about the philosophy\nThe philosophical aspects of what it means to be an American ... probably even more accurately a United States see in because I hate to break this to people but Canada as part of America so as Mexico and\nTechnically somebody from Brazil and call themselves America you know there are\nMany Americans are pretty pretty big place you know it's more of a ... kind of thing [laughter] but you know when you look at the United states of America the experiment the philosophy that was embodied during the revolutionary war ceases to exist\nYou were talking about in my in my little rag doubt pocket constitution right here are ending numerous structures within the government itself mhm they and and by the way if you put term limits on the Supreme Court you know what else you've done\nYou have a ... for all intents and purposes the third branch of government it becomes subordinate to do that Congress yep so have fun with that Democrats\nSo they don't care because you know whenever you get elected or whatever officer and operated anyway so it took\nHim feel like yours on their ... well the conversation we had yesterday with um with my more guy that wrote the book on the family and the FBI and your pajamas ...\nAnd I don't think people realize that what he was he said on the air yesterday I Am the deep state he is a security operative for the very people that Trump is accusing of and this guy's come out and come clean he said it's so bad I'm a deep state guides if you want to think of the movie or a team I'm black forest\nI'm I'm pike I'm Lynch and I'm telling you it's bad because they're trying to completely up end to this and if you were to have a constitutional overhaul\nAnd I'm telling you it's bad because they're trying to completely up into this and if you were to have a constitutional overhaul the implementation of social policies that he was talking about the uh the voter turnout\nThe mid term at you all just on your bought from Trump's got this big deal don't worry about it this is what we're up against\n... speaking of voter turnout did you see that MSNBC quip reporter from MSNBC went out to California and a lot of the students I think the was at a UCLA a lot of soup for sitting on the wall waiting for the boss and he comes out of a on film so for men B. C. and we're trying to do a poll to see who's going to vote this midterm\nCrickets and so he walked right up some are you gonna vote you're probably not why not because I don't know what's going on so why bother ... and then another guy he asked he said yeah I'm I'm probably what the Democrats want the vote\nThat's stupid however\nThat's stupid\nHowever this is the city as insisted that look cops will be actively seeking out trick or treaters but a visual said the ordinance is in place as a safety precaution\nHow about the kids who hit their growth spurts early because I wasn't the grade school with some guys who are eleven years old they're almost six foot tall right so they're gonna be discriminate height discrimination they're going to be stopped because people don't think they're sixteen or Seventeen years old\nWas he really doesn't bother me anyways because with the dogs we have\nWe don't want people knocking on the door ring the doorbell ... drives me insane when they want to protect us from nothing right so we just have a big old college or in in the front stoop a cauldron it's actually it's a big old college and we put out in front suit fill it full candy\nFull of candy and put a little sign that says please be conned other trick or treaters can only take one or two pieces\nRight and that's it well\nAn aspect of this would have threatened my friends from years ago just to pay police will focus on making sure that everyone is safe\nThis was on their website by the by for example a Thirteen year old safely trick or treating with the younger sibling is not going to have any issues however that same child taking pumpkins from porches and smashing them in the street more like what are you well I Would have done hard time\n[laughter] hard time\nThat's what\nI mean what if you're taking the pumpkin off your own statement smashing and what have you taken the pumpkin back to your shop so that you can fix the candle and bring it back here Cindy Lu\nI don't think he's a reference ... probably not but I mean how's it going to do Christmas this is this give ... give me a headache I've got a complex [laughter]\nSanta ...\nYour ... but it it [noise]\nI'm really getting a headache trying to think about this because\nA Thirteen year old trick or treating with their younger sibling is okay but there are more focused on the ones that are going to grab the pumpkins and the decorations and smash them in the street\nThen then how about you just be vigilant on vandalism\nWho cares about trigger trees but this is coming from Virginia Beach Virginia Beach it's a five hundred dollar fine if you costs on the boardwalk\nI look at stuff like this and I just I Wonder we are we are just in this country way over regulated [noise]\nThis this

I mean if I'm drinking raises coffee apparently so it\n[noise]\nAsteroid cannot come soon and um but then it's kind of speak back to the comments\nSuch as what Clinton made the other day about no longer being civil to people because of their political leanings\nYou know I I don't care if you're a Democrat if you're\nA staunch socialist communist liberal if you will can't we all agree that that's asinine\nI came but the problem is you can't have an argument but I don't wanna say argument you can't have a a debate or discussion with anybody on the left like I said I I don't consider all Democrats left is just like I don't consider all Republicans conservative\nBut nowadays you can't have a conversation or a a grownup debate without somebody bringing emotion into it mhm\nNo ... what's your side of things this that and the other what's your side of things this that and the other okay well these ideas clash why do they clash no you've got somebody always wants to end up screaming I'm throwing something on the picket San dressing up like a handmade and doing something and cousin people out on Twitter\nAttack and children attacking sick people attacking the elderly it leaves those are the building\nBut don't people realized that whatever this goal as whatever this this uh ultimate agenda is of some kind of societal parity is a non attainable goal\n... you know we have differences of opinion we have differences in viewpoints we have differences and desires we have differences and that's that's you know we were made that way\nThat is that as a construct of the creator\nAyers we have differences and that's that's you know we were made that way\nThat is that as a construct of the creator\nTo be that way we all have certain rules that we fulfill me personally I like to run my mouth and write and use words DC as an engineer by trade I Can't vote a towel right in her viewpoint sometimes I think she ever reaction of dishwasher hasn't been run when there's a you know too many dishes I mean you know but the point is\nWe all have you ... things from from a different perspective\nAnd you know men and women black white young oh it doesn't matter you cannot eradicate\nThe differences and that and and it's certainly cannot do it by force and that's exactly what seems to be happening in the political structure and I'm gonna go one step further Harold telling a break\nThese kids like did you rent reference only MSNBC video I'm not going to vote I don't pay any attention uh I don't know what's going on in the world around they might be on to something\nTurn it off I mean you know it goes back to um Dr psycho that we have the other day I Can't get over that your ... me but you know there are so many people that are so engrossed with this stuff\nI don't really care what most people think I'm not that guy that when I go out and but I don't care that I'm wearing red cowboy boots at a red shirt I Am too old for that crap\nFor them to do their concern myself with what you think\nAnd I wish more people were that way so now we've got you know you've got\nThe er Eric Holder out their kick Republicans Hillary Clinton's time for the stability to stop Virginia is now restricting Thirteen year old I mean what happens if your birthday\nIs that particular day the thirty first of October I mean how how highly regulated that we're trying to become is absolutely asked in a mine sticker our come right back\nWhen he enters the room Nick Saban even stands up\nIt's the Michael ...
