Ten Commandments in there so that's why it's called the ten commandments amendment 'cause it's in commandments really have nothing to do with the\nOther legal sets in there so we're talking about that right now that's my opinion\nIf you disagree with me if you agree with me eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three is the number to join the conversation again that's eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three or you can reach out on Facebook B. A. Y. L. O. R. C. O. okay again that's Baylor cook on the first thing that pops up Facebook Twitter Instagram I Do read your messages\nSo answer me this so if you do you believe that evolution should be able to be taught in schools\nWell you know what I Know this much\nI I have I have more faith in Patrick Kennedy the fact that this this country was founded on religion it was founded on Christianity and that gives any other everybody else the ability to practice whatever they want and to ah teach whatever they want so if we're going to go ahead Patrick ...\nAs long as we have the Bible first human at any other science you walk in fact in fact Baylor I'd love pure science pure science ballot dates every word of God every word of God is valid but to get\nHim in ... they couldn't be here Henry stick with me or I Need you need you to give me a simple answer do you think that Darwinism that what's being taught that the the evolution should be able to be taught in schools\nYeah we can teach it I I mean I don't I don't disagree with throwing Nazi poop everywhere\nSo do you agree that Tennessee's law was wrong the butler act that said we can't teach evolution in school we can only teach creation as a method the butler act said\nNot for the community the community should have been allowed to make their own decisions and if you didn't like being taught but you were taught to go to another one like everybody\nTo me that he did make this decision the state of Tennessee made the decision we don't know the latest republic it's represented by a republic yeah but so is the United states\nBut those people and she wanted that taught in school if they there was a single individual as usual a single person changes to order everything but now we're going to stop allowing that\nIt's very simple person hits a single person taking a stand for president in ... makes it to the Supreme Court I Know that that ...\nThat's how we got rovers weight and she overturned around decision\nIt's that's not how we got rover roe versus Wade was foundation only placed by on another ... on another taste that was like that\nIt was a bad law it was a religious law in Connecticut it's based on Griswold v Connecticut where we got right to privacy and in Connecticut they had a law that said ... married couples could not use contraception in the home\nThat's based on the Catholic beliefs that you can't use contraception that's a silly law you cannot put your religion on the people but nevertheless it with ...\nWith that as common sense grows within a community and you're you have less people teaching stupidly you know ... ... look look how bad the Bible is taught today\nI mean people don't even know what what who they are what they are where they go in there that they don't know that they don't even know the ten commandments ask somebody a ... ... ... the separation of powers\nMy point is my point is your argument is predicated on the fact that the scopes trial was decided against one hundred pages of precedent if the scopes trial\nIs your argument is predicated on the fact that the scopes trial\nWas decided against one hundred pages of precedent if the scopes trial\nMade it ... was dealing with a law that made it illegal to teach evolution is it not the right precedent that if you agree that it like you said you're okay with putting\nThe ten commandments up against all of the theological sets in the school because you said the ten commandments is the only one that will stand isn't it right then that if you're willing to put the ten commandments up in the school you should be able to show the other side of the aisle\nThe argument that isn't creationism the argument that is yeah ... Darwinism yeah I I don't care\nI mean do that rather than it was the right precedent the Supreme Court made the right rolling 'cause that's what they said they said they\nDid it as long as long as they instead restricted Christianity\nBecause I don't think I I don't think I don't think they restricted Christianity because I'm On now is that when\nYou listen listen you're wrong then Congress shall make no laws respecting the establishment of a religion\nRight they all the Supreme Court said was you have to do the secular teaching in school science it's considered the secular teaching it is considered free of religious principle\nThat's what the scopes trial enshrined because it will it ruled straight from the first amendment because it says Congress shall not establish a religion when you teach creationism and school you're not necessarily establishing a religion you can teach the fundamentals of the creation as\nIdeology in school what you cannot teach is specifically a Christian mindset specifically a Jewish mindset you can teach them what Chris what creationism is you can't teach them Christianity you can't work as an Judaism I don't use the money why ...\nWhy are we are paying tax dollars right now to fund a planet rooms with prayer rugs and put washing for patients to wash your feet\nWhere that Enron or we paying for all that are we doing that\nWhich are like ... and private institutions at a public institution you don't know ... somebody was bought a cage a while back and gosh if we go there I'm going to end up in which I don't remember all I wasn't ready to speak about these cases but they have been a hearing some of these in the lower courts\nWill see I don't know I don't know anything about these either um how about we do we both do a little research on that 'cause I've never heard of that and if I've got to say I do not think tax dollars should I don't think tax dollars of any shorts sort should go to a religious institution whether it be Christian or Islam so\nRemember the private even what a private corporation like an airport ... put it in there there's subsidized by the government yes or no matter what you're saying as you know you don't have Christians are have a special preferences in a airport\nThat's in fact that's incorrect Henry\nWell literally I was walking through the uh\nThe Atlanta no no no I was walking through an airport in uh where was the San Francisco yes and no no no no no no no what's right below San Francisco um Sacramento I was walking through an airport in Sacramento, California in almost every airport you can find a chapel chapels are commonplace\nIn airports that's a Christian tenet\nI'd love to continue this conversation but we got around to break sarin reprise you age you love ya let's talk about that other topic maybe tomorrow or another day I got to do more research on that 'cause I don't want to give you an unfounded opinion appreciate your brother eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three\nWere about to head on at the break we'll get to all your calls after this eight six six by five one Ninety nine thirty three let's talk about\nIt don't go anywhere in the wake up call your listening\nThree were about to head on out to break we'll get to all your calls after this eight six six by five one Ninety nine thirty three let's talk about it don't go anywhere in the wake up call\nYou're listening to the wake up call\nHave you ever made the wrong higher for your organization do you have employee retention problems or maybe had a team members it wasn't a culture fit\nIt sounds like you have people profit fire seeds helps organizations growing scale their business through recruiting the right type of leaders for your organization\nFire she's fine top cheerleaders that are qualified for the role but more importantly fit your culture and add to your bottom line visit fire seats dot com forward slash yellow hammer today for special offer on your recruiting strategy [noise]\nCan you sacrifice a day of your life to change someone else's life forever sign up to volunteer with the cage and maybe at certain points dot com and eat or Q.

gentlemen thank you for joining us whereabouts adding to the next break because that discussion went uh ten minutes over when our normal breaks I was so we're headed into the next big literally and about thirty seconds there will be back after another round the commercials and we continue this conversation eight six six five five one\nNinety nine thirty three is the number to join the conversation eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three I'll always throw up the back timer\nFor good conversation but before I go let me tell you about my friends over meal fit dot co\nWWW dot meals that dot co is the place to go I haven't been able to pick up my male ... have been so busy this week I'm actually going to a day usually pick it up on Mondays yes I Know I didn't do it well but I'm Still going to go pick it up today I'm really really excited Thomas Cox has a great thing going on over there\nHere's the thing with ... you you take this our comes razor approach where you look for the simple if and when you look for the simplest you think the simple is\nNot everything in this life it's simple and it's a stupid way to look at things when you were talking about the separation of church and state it don't try to back me into this corner the separation of church and state of two things it's a separation of church and state says there shouldn't be a theocracy I Do not think the church in real estate I Do not think the church should make laws\nThat being said it is impossible for a religious person to advocate their religion when making law it is impossible like this misconception that we can remove all bias from our thinking when writing a journalistic piece it's even possible\nLook you can do your best to do it but your morals and fates that if you're ... your morals and virtues that if you're a religious person come from\nYour religion so don't sit here and say it's entirely possible separate the two it's not and I'm trying to back me into a false corner and bring some false overly simplistic argument if you want to do an overly simplistic terms then go back to\nRight that too it's not and I'm trying to back me into a false corner and bring some false overly simplistic argument if you want to do an overly simplistic terms then go back to high school where they are going to have overly simplistic argument if you want to have an adult conversation then we'll have an adult conversation eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three Michael what do you think about that question it is it\nI'm not even sure what the question was okay the as I got I must I must have got a little heated there are so the question was\nIs it entire is it I'm trying to remember the phraseology\nI I think I Know where you're going this Baylor and and the bottom line is is it is it possible for for example a legislate or to remove his Christian beliefs or is Jewish beliefs or whatever believes\nFrom his uh his discernment from decisions no it's not possible but you've got to look at you know I think sometimes we can we fail to realize that when we say government we're not necessarily talking about the men themselves were talking about the structure of government and you know people often times you don't talk about the separation of church and say okay\nThis is this the separation of church and state appear in the constitution no no okay does it and the reason for not a simple\n... percent in particular but also Adam speak suicide at Madison so to Washington for that matter\nThat it was acceptable in that time and even today for religious entities for the church to know that government existed mhm but they did not want government to know that the church existed they saw government as a structure we today see government as a body of people\nAnd they are two entirely different things and that's one of the dichotomy is a lot of people simply can't get their head around is that you know we're told me this wall of separation between church and state\nJefferson didn't think they that they that the federal government should even acknowledge the existence of religion for the purposes of keeping the two separate that's why when he wrote the lord of the Denver and that wasn't even a reference to the U.S constitution he was talking about the composition of the state of Connecticut yeah\nAnd so you know and and they were having a lot of discussions about what was going on at that point in time but see for me this argument\nIs a nonstarter ... because when it appears in the amendment about not making that there should be you know no no religion yeah ...\n... and at that point it in the whole argument ends right there and and there's no reason to continue on whether or not there should be you know uh the the uh Ten Commandments and the state house or whatever the case may be something that's got to bear in mind\nAnd this this is gonna sound kind of dicey to some people the ten commandments\nThey are a co opted Christian symbol\n... you know most this was not a Christian for that matter Jesus was not a Christian ... you know that was a construct came along you know during the time of Paul yeah\nAnd you know when when the church was being expanded in creative and and so you know we have to enter and because if you really want to be ... about it the ten commandments were more of a Jewish symbol of anything else and somebody assume mired down in his constitutional aspect and I was thinking about this the other day 'cause you know I've been writing this block posing ready for this pot gases coming up\nPeople don't have a clue\nWhat the constitution means ... and they they come at it as though they've got it all figured out you know somebody I think earlier today said all because something was written by man doesn't make it constitutional who the heck he wrote the constitution in particular that particular guy and you know looking at things like ah you know when they said we take these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal and\nThey knew what they were saying they weren't say that there was no inequality in the world they were saying they were saying that there was those slavery in the world yeah they were projecting forward yeah and then people are so their history so skewed\nThey had no idea what they're talking about so in love with people use the word constitutionality or the non constitutionality of it that's a precursor to ... to admit him I ain't got a clue what I'm Talking about\nAnd see that I agree with you because a lot of times when Christian conserve it\nA petition out of the constitutionality of it that's a precursor to ... to admitting I ain't got a clue what I'm Talking about\nAnd see that I agree with you because a lot of times when Christian conservatives right myself being that but a lot of times when mainstream Christian conservatives what they do is they point to the scopes trial\nScopes versus the U.S in which they basically taught evolution in school and they took it all the way because there was a long time to see that said you couldn't teach evolution school right you had to teach the Christian\n... and ... you know it was a mock trial you know there was no that was you know it was it was put on to make a point yeah there was no defend it in that case no\nAnd there is no there is no viable defense because what you're doing when you're allowing a public institution\nTo teach a religious principle is your establishment the religion that's asserting that every kid in that class is that religion and therefore we're going to teach it which may be very very well may be the case every kid in that class could have been Christian Christian Christianity I Believe is still the predominant religion in the U.S\n[noise] however\nIt's not ... you cannot establish a religion in the United states\nAnd I just say that you\nWant to go in and ... anything like you can teach creationism which can't teach Christianity there's a big difference creationism is believed to tell by many faiths that's at the world was created by a deity of some sort you can teach that but you can't teach a specific religion it's so clear when it says Congress shall make no law respecting the\nEstablishment of religion right or the free exercise their right\nIt was designed for Christians and Jews and ... drew woods and Muslims and whoever the heck out so you don't happen to be here at that point in time they understood the dangers of it because King George use the Anglican Church as a weapon against his own people that was a primary reason for that\nIt wasn't just a matter of this hierarchy of belief that you know everybody can do whatever they want you to worship was a sofa if you want to they understood the threat\nThat when government is armed with the emotional attachment to face that many people have and it is an emotional attachment to adopt how do you how can you prove the existence of God I don't have to prove it I feel my heart yeah you know that's all that I Need for me\nBut you know they understood that needed to be completely separate it to the point where government should not even acknowledge its existence\nAnd and why did that come about what were they fleeing again\nOh all kinds of persecution but religious persecution\nYeah OK it took six five five one Ninety nine thirty

going to get outta here a little bit early today as I have a a doctor's appointment to grandma eyeballs\nChecked again and so a Baylor's hanging out with us James is running up and down the hallway a Dylan's answering\nYour phone calls at eight six six five five one nine nine three three and I'm just sitting here reading stuff ...\nAnd so uh we got another bomb\nThe arrow yeah yeah well you said the millennial and he came back sorry him that's all right we love having you we love having these debates these conversations and discussions about the constitution what's\nGoing on in the country around us the caravan are there are there a terrorist into migrant ranks are they're not what's Trump been trading you know the drill hole all\nSo here's the real question when are we going to get to know what's up with the Michael our podcasts you've been teasing that a lot and I feel like you've got to tell us what's going on\nI don't know what's going on it's one of those things where you know eventually the destination point we'll be\nMichael heart show dot com and it was gonna be a podcast that were the constitution and primary the name of the podcast she'll be going to be unknown America and we're going to be at a second and Charles is upcoming Saturday from eleven to one with copies of the books it's a great place to come out and not just check out that book but uh\nThey got an amazing amazing assortment of gifts and things of that nature right there and you come out of your ... your Christmas shopping violates Robert in Alabama but we've been talking about\nYou know just the unknown history but people don't know about this country and most people don't know not just history Baylor just you know the founding of the country and have a name to be and you know a few moments ago you and I were talking about church and state and religion and what the founding fathers thought and\nWas America founded as a Christian nation and all the other you know and sundry questions that seemed to go along with that\nAnd the the reality of it is is that you know most people try to get inside the heads of the founding fathers by way of the constitution you know you can't really speak to the constitution unless you've read\nThe federalist papers unless you have read the writings of Washington and Jefferson Adams a lot of people don't realize the very first rule regulation those pass and the first time that Congress was that they would open knowing meetings without first having a prayer but what in prayer looked like one thing one thing that I think a lot of Christian suffer from\nIs this belief that well we we use the word religion and somehow we are being synonymous with the word Christianity mhm and we I think sometimes we failed to realize that there are\nChristian Americans Jewish Americans atheist Americans agnostic Americans driven Americans\nSketch from uh from two thousand and twelve and the biology hasn't changed but somebody made a joke about a man dressing as a woman or something like that and it was funny it was one of the top comedies sketches of the day I mean\nYou look at stuff that George Carlin said this stuff was funny was voter yeah funny but now here we are and we're in twenty Eighteen and it's incredible because you say some of this stuff\nBecause it's free wandering we've had we've wandered over into this area where that is uncalled for that is bigoted you say that they're literally going to take you up and hanging from across outside the state capital not literally but you know what I mean you're going your whole life\nIs going to be ruined and it's just insane\nJust wandering when one comes next because we're just ping pong and all of a different subject right now we're in over political correctness\nDoes is this bombing showing that we're just going to go to a time where it's just where it's just all violence and yelling because I think that's what we're doing we went to over ... everybody's overly nice\nLittle brother let me slap you on the back and we're not going to have real conversation but we're going to have this fake conversation which we go behind closed doors and disagree with each other now it looks like we're going to a term where it's like we're just going to yell at each other and we're going to tell you exactly what we think about you even if it's not found in our deepest darkest hatred are going to come out and hatred spread out of ignorance our deepest darkest ignorance as are going to come out as well\nAnd so in essence we are in fact in a state of wandering mhm yeah my heart show come right back\nMichael heart show [noise]\nSuper station and a little one\n\nHoney that's a beautiful picture but\nDo you make the risky different colors of model oh\nWait what have you ever notice as ugly black streets coloration on your roof what you're actually seen\nWait what have you\nEver notice as ugly black streets in this coloration on your roof what

following it does not necessarily reflect the opinions or views of Robert broadcasting its employees affiliates or advertisers mob room\nThat was on the line and this year's elections this is just a Tom Parker you also have the leftist mob strive to tear down just as Kevin all they want me to be next\nObserved for Thirteen Years on the Alabama Supreme Court has a strong independent conservative voice I've taken on in the Southern Poverty Law Center and been outspoken that roe v Wade in bergenfield were wrongly decided\nAnd I'm a strong supporter of President Trump and his efforts to put more conservatives on our federal courts the leftist mob doesn't like that they want judges who will overturn our laws and look the other way when the leftist mob tries to destroy our society\nThis is just as Tom Parker Republican for chief justice I'm asking for your vote to keep Alabama's gorgeous place for the rule of law was respected and not where the mob rules\nFor my Tom Parkinson chief justice mock celebrity get me to Montgomery three six one one one\nThat's super ... we care about the hard work you vote in your lives that's why our advertising partners are people we take the time do you do when you go to the white lie and check out our partners you can trust that you're doing business with a white people you can do that if there's somebody you don't see the widely snow\nAnd we'll start the hunt for the\nCity seven nine three three to four we do business the way that superstition will will do what do you want to be [noise]\nYou know your own garden countries to\nBoy and opposition uh [noise] yeah [noise] yeah [noise]\n... it's it's a valid concept and do and brought it up there was this idea that people don't really know what they want anymore they just opposing the other side just for the Sam hell of a kid I didn't hear that I\nCan I just say something in fact right now and it's going to be rude yeah well if your show so head but why are you asking me that much and then there's that you know\nPeople are particularly in this day and time yeah very stupid man I mean I may not in the most white says they're just ignorant now think of it this way you're a young guy but the guys are young and you're not married you don't have kids or to my knowledge\nMaybe couple\nI when when I was a young family hush when the young family has a child\n[noise] maybe couple\nYeah when I when when a when a young family hushed when a young family has a child you know the child it obviously has its I'll use the word disruptive but in in a in a good sense yeah but you have that young child you buy the child toys and you know you play with a kid what not and then you pop out another one\nAnd maybe there are two three years old and you got the L we've gotten when you've got little Dylan and you got little Baylor and they're playing and and and little Dylan's you know he's playing with his toy and little bail is paying with his toy\nAnd there's another toy over here nobody's plane west and then little deal and decides he wants to play with the uh the Penn that's over here and so little Dylan picks up\nThe pan and starts playing with the pan ... now what does little Baylor do little Baylor does and then give them\nThat goes with a pen that little Baylor didn't give a darn about the pan ... until Dylan picked up the Penn that's true that's the way we are politically and this guy I don't want the oh you've got it I Want that\nYeah or they're or or or\nOr you know uh you know it's it's so funny because all of a sudden you've got this antithetical relationship that is in the most basic terms first off ... ... because the you know little little Baylor doesn't even know why he wants to pay him he just doesn't want little village to have the patio\nAnd while our politicians are so consumed with that I'm not saying one leader in particular I'm not saying one politician in particular but why politicians are both doing that right\nWhere's our country and our country our country is burning were falling into more and more chaos I mean it literally like the phrase in this is not directed at Trump please don't call and say ... or ... directed other Trump ... near a ... round burn the U.S government is settling all the countries burning\nI don't think they know what to do I mean that you know I really don't not sure\nThey know how to fill the they desperately don't know how to settle\nThat's different though but they do know how to bring the firewood or Ayman ... and there was on his mind hello Henry how are you\nOh I'm delighted good I I I tell you what you got lost you there is just killed it I\nDon't recall [laughter] um\nI like to an allergy to the example of the wilderness thing that we're going through I just let me add on to what you were just talking about ah we're not really\nWe don't really care about the pet into a a wants to Penn but at the end\nIt then you're wondering why does nobody wanted to play which may know more and you hear that now you know Clinton was saying oh we all have to get along yeah as long as it's around her and that ... that that was always play this I mean\nYeah exactly but er you know as far as the forty a wandering and they didn't make it to the promised land al ... a little bit and\nGeneration didn't end this generation might not either\nExactly but what did they do to to lose that they they tempted God ten times and drivers or that and Caleb and Josh what are the only two that made it into the promised land of milk and honey because why because they trusted in the lord\nSo what should we learn from that because you know what is it a shot in the New Testament about all this news and samples examples of a show it we're going to use this example shouldn't the the the ... that we get through this is supposed to end the lord\nI already do trust in the ... yeah I Know but he does have my yoga is easy my burden is light love God and let other people that uh\nI already do trust in the ...\nYou know but he does lead my yolk is easy my burden is light love God and love other people that is the way that I understand what Hitler Henry's go\nThere's a problem Henry is that in this secular society that we live in today you know folks bottom line here you know we're not we're not going to flip this country into that that line of thinking\nOkay but like I mean not in math\nOkay but I got a question that goes back to that it encompasses a lot of what you're saying you guys just one and that is let me ask you this Michael and they all do you think this country\nWould districts that are meant to be able to come to pass it without Christianity as you look at every country ... ... like a like Saudi Arabia and Iran and look at the instructors and people are wanting to come here\nFor audience your participants and many you make a statement and they applaud maybe if you're fortunate they give you a standing ovation that said that that you know they're giving you accolades and other giving you acceptance and approval for your position\nA person who's on stage doing that lived ... well typically take that\nAs enthusiasm and momentum and doubled down on hey if I said that er work watches is you know you go to a concert and every single concert it's so stupid because\nThey've gotten a bad leaves the stage and then you've got you know the the they return for the little encore or whatever and then people keep chanting and chanting it typically there's not going to be another encore but if the audience gets loud enough sometimes the ban will come back out and\nYou see the same kinds of things in political rallies where if they feel like what they're saying is expressive enough they'll double down on it tripled out on it because as you see Maxine Waters in particular every time she speaks\nThe rhetoric becomes more extreme ... and the chance get louder and louder as she feels off of that which gives us more extreme and I'm gonna tell you something Donald Trump is also falling victim to that I've seen it firsthand\nI don't think it's victimization I think they know exactly what they're doing I think what you just described in essence is populism and populism is fine when it comes to entertainment like save it appeals to the masses do it appeals the masses how you make your buck like if you're an entertainer I don't mind that if you're a politician and you fall prey fall victim I don't think it's a victimization thing but if you fall\nVictim in in the negative sense but did you mean let's let's use the word beneficiary if\nYou will yeah if you are a ... that's yeah yeah I agree with that if you're a politician and you are a beneficiary of populism if you use populism and make your point I don't want you an office this is not something where you're supposed to get the greatest her raw this is something where you're supposed to be the person that's in the best place to lead the country\nAnd when are when our elections right turn into\nNot a disagreement and ideas and how we're going to approach governmental aspects\nAnd instead turn into a popularity contest I Do not care if you're going to the Supreme Court on state\nRight I'm just going to call out the ad I don't care if you're going to the Supreme Court other state\nAnd we see this in Alabama and you're a conservative that's not what you're supposed to be on the Supreme Court quit telling me that tell me what you do judicial philosophy is if you're going to stump which is exactly what it is on those populist concepts I don't want you in office [noise]\nWell you know we saw the same thing when Obama was running and how many people out there ran on a platform of all let me you know I'm going to overthrow Obamacare\nEvery lead and even with Rocco bomber ran on he ran on the platform of\nHey I have these ideas and I'm a black guy Hillary Clinton ran on the ideas of hey I have these ideas and I'm a woman I don't give a damn what race color or sex you are nobody should vote for somebody based on that vote for them based on their idea is not the color of their skin or what sex organs they've got who cares\nYou know that's the way it's supposed to work but unfortunately it does not go back to the phones all start where oh hey how are you my friend\n... good morning Michael and this is the news cycle day as a couple of days\nIt's been whack\nYou know ... you know I've been talking I don't think it's ever been this crazy really really do um\nYou know sort of what we're seeing in the news but you know another one this whole bomb scare thing um you know you have to sort of lean if it's real or not but man\nNumber one this whole a bomb scare thing um you know you have to sort of lean if it's real or not but man\nI got more question marks in my head than anything I'm On this and uh you know I'm usually a skeptic when it comes to things but you know either we got the worst bomber ever like this guy really socks and making bombs and not having one go off\nMaybe are not wanting to kill anybody believes one going off um is crazy where you have the leader of the swap\nMr John Brennan coming out and attacking Trump on this as a huge sign or something is happening and uh you know you just ask just put that question mark in your head you know when you got the leader the swamp\nThe leader of this whole fake FBI investigation things\nThat we found out is not freaking real that's hidden in the news cycle nobody wants to talk about that\nI'm Bad press on the caravan for the dams it's seems like the the polls are hurting them again these are all question marks\nYesterday Mayer call coming out saying\nHe received a bomb when he never did okay\nLook that one out and tell me what you think um and then you know I don't know if it makes sense to put a return addresses of your own address that's a little weird I'm so to me I keep hearing well these are not really\nWell put together bombs and you know I I think you know someone is trying to\nTo turn the tables on on truck and make it look like it's a radical right\nDoing this when I might think gosh when the tables are not going your way you got it you got to divert you got a um you have to make it look like something else is going on I Know there's a rule of a Lenski in there somewhere\nCreating chaos distraction et cetera so anyway skeptics that I Am\nThought I'd share my thoughts with the Michael\nRather always ... for him All right ... thank you\nKnow the euro and let's get the cork hey mark how're you\nDoing I'm doing great Michael how are you oh just marvelous okay\nSo just very briefly I got cut off yesterday at the bright when we were discussing the lottery the only thing I'm going to say there is it's been about fifty years since I saw the movie Pinocchio\nBut I remember a park where a Fox in some other animal talked up no geo and sending to this wonderful law one was like an amusement parks and everybody there ended up growing ears and pulling a cart\nWhen you're buying into this lottery thing you're headed for ... years and you're in a cart where'd you soon\nWe'll let the you know on the bomb\nThing you think the male model last mayor Cuomo's bomb in the mail and it hadn't arrived yeah\nWell you know there's also some as soon as soon as the ... most of this did not go through the u._s. mail although it was spent most of these things are actually delivered by courier\nOkay now I got to wonder is this all just a big misunderstanding did clock Mitt want his heroes to have some personal Tom devices\nDid who ... you broke up on me\nCockpit your call him what does that have been about\nHave some personal Tom devices\nDid who ... you broke up on me clock bed your call him what does that been about four or five years ago the wonderful child\nOh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\nI think he's going back to putting together timing devices [laughter] he just wanted his heroes on the left have personalized timing devices that he's in them\nYeah who is he referring on the child to the child that made a clause in a a in a science fair yeah and then it was called a racist because of his race that's disgusting don't call and clock that he's got a name and that that's awful\nOh you should like go back in time and pay more attention to the station you're on partner\nOr not and I'm Talking about what I'm saying now what you're saying now let's not talk about the past let's talk about the facts and the situation the fact that a boy built the clock for a science fair and just because he is of Islamic dissent you're calling him clock Mendez racist and bigoted\nHe built it looked like a bomb\nTo create he'll eat the kid like building a clock\nOkay alright foreigners again we're\nGoing All right partner like when people say when they don't want a valid argument\nI'm just gonna sit here and was one yeah keep a comment well this is why he lost a lottery to bang yesterday [laughter] yeah\n[laughter] do you cut me off on the lottery they cut off now\nNow you're on the air go ahead with a critic I'm getting paid on time\nSo the lottery thing what I was going to tell you about forcing the merchants to sell them you know if you don't sell them to somebody else you lose ...\nYeah but you can make the same argument about beer Clarke I mean that was the whole point yesterday\nOh yeah yeah you're right about that you are well look Michael if this is what we need to do and if we need the lottery for the children then let's just have to stay open up brothels\n... you know I got lucky like a brother but you know the argument that we were having yesterday it wasn't about what's best for the state what it was a matter of do we have a right to spend our money on the lottery that's the only point we were making\nWell yeah but Michael people have a right to see what their finger stick it in the light socket\nYeah they do and the problem is is they want us to the taxpayer to take care of them after they do it well\nWe're not taking care of people that lost you know fifty thousand dollars because they were stupid and bought a lottery tickets but if somebody wants to drive the Georgians were two dollars ... potential waiting you know I just I think just like anything else you know that's a right to people how do enjoy it it's a decision that can make their own choice\nThat side of the matter is we're going to end up with a lottery there is too much money is not being collected and you know like everything else they will keep on keep on and they'll have more and more people that buy into their argument", "show_name": "The Guys", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "25"}
