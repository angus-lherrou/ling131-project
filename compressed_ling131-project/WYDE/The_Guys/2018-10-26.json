[noise] and [noise] are you really doing the best for you\nAnd I was saying it's not selfish some of your your opinion [noise] eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three are supposed to Derrick online one Derek how you doing\nA good morning Baylor um I just want to say that uh ... uh like show thank you uh you're probably the wider young man I've ever ...\nThank you there that's a huge compliment\nWell I mean I'm fifty something and uh [laughter] I\nI just probably ten Fifteen Years ago started realizing how hot it yeah well I was your age I was like time I got you know I'll never having to or never have too much of that yeah\nI'm so I'm just curious how you there's something you read it through the way you were raised their lead you to value that an earlier age\nYeah and yeah I can I can definitely speak to that or do you want me to let you go you want to stay on the line either way I'm good with\nUs ally okay cool I'm driving\nAll right so essentially what led me to that thought process you know there's never like\nI don't really believe in like these light bulb moments right I feel like there are a lot of things that Komen ate over a period of time that lead to the way you think you know sometimes some information is taught through a singular source but I ... a lot of times that's not how I get information unfortunately I'm kind of hard headed so information as to be\nHit over my head a couple of times before it gets in but I think it's a the way it's raised and I think there was a ironically I was sitting in a macro economics class and I heard this idea of opportunity cost and one of the examples had to do again with time\nAnd I started thinking about what am I spending my time on\nAnd then I had the idea kind of went away again in are sitting in astronomy class some truth be told like a strong these really important I Know some people love it but I hate it I feel like it's the biggest waste of my time that I could be doing when I could be and not because I just want to be sleeping right I Want to be bettering myself and other areas and it really got me thinking about\nHow much how valuable that our is that I'm never going to get that our back and how if you look over the course of the year if I did that three hours a week for fifty two weeks a year I mean do the math on that bill and what's the map 'em at fifty two times three\nI'm terrible man\nI'm asking bill and bill is a map to one fifty six yes that's a hundred and fifty six hours if I Do that for one year straight that I'm just flat out wasting and that's a conservative estimate and so it's I I don't know that that's kind of what went into my thought process\nI I have to use like a at least an hour and a half almost one way every day and um I read just believe that the average person's tens of uh like Seventy five years and years in a vehicle\nWow and they're just trying to do something else you know\nOr at least if you are to continue that commute 'cause you know everybody like we all like well my point was very idealistic but you know you you still got to work right there are some people that need to work and not as strong in the field\nBut all I Need to work [noise] yeah [noise]\nAh but you could I mean there are so many ways you can change your perspective on that I mean you could download the podcast you can listen to this show we're really think\nBut you could I mean there are so many ways you can\nChange your perspective on that I mean you could download the podcast you could listen to this show we're really thankful that you listen to this show you could listen to things that you know are going to teach you a new things because then that way you know your bettering your ... yourself you're spending your time wisely it may not be optimal like exactly what you want to do but\nYou're taking a step to better yourself other than you know just listening to Tim McGraw over and over again not to say ... you know what I'm saying\nOh I agree uh well that's a very optimistic outlook and I really appreciate that which is probably why it is\nYeah well we absolutely love you're listening Derrick and I appreciate your brother or a you have a great day\nAll right eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three is a number to join the conversation Dylan what do you think about this idea\nAbout the idea of opportunity cost and how you spend your time because you're again we talked about this on the show were both very busy people I think I think most working people are very busy people I also think busy as a mindset but that's a completely different topic altogether but\nWhat do you think about this idea of it's\nReally important on how you spend your time because you are somebody that delves your time out between a lot of different things and I've seen you make a concerted effort\nTo um get together with a a group of friends that you have and you really invest in that which I don't see a lot of people doing you know ... especially when they get out into the working world it's like family works sleep repeat there is not a lotta time allocated regularly\nTo getting together with friends and really cultivating those relationships so how do you see this concept in your life do you do you think it holds any way you think I'm a little off what\nSo I've realized over the past several years that my mental health is incredibly important to my functionality in every other aspect of my life yeah\nUh I suffer from\nSeasonal depression I think is the most accurate term ... basically a\nComes and goes for a season or two at a time yeah uh and it's not a consistent thing it's just whatever happens to be a me at the time no one can bring it out and I really have a two groups of friends now one that I've uh been around for several years uh\nMet kind of threw a hodgepodge of rain of different events depending on which one of which individual in that group you're referring to yeah and then I've got another group that I've met through college and that's the group that I played the Indy with most of the time\n... a\nN E each one of them it's\nKind of a feeling of acceptance of like people actually wanting me around ... ... ... being near that helps a lot ... a and being an introvert I Need time to myself yeah until I kind of recharge ... however\nToo much time to myself leads to more thoughts and feelings with depression so it just figuring out where to put that balance\nBuild my life up better what am I allocating my life he there's going to make my life better and\nA lot of people\nYou know good things come together right\nIf you're meant to build their life up and they're meant to build your life up you're going to come together and it's going to click like that\nBut if you're having a force that odds are it's just not worth either of your time\nIs just horses that sounds\nIt's just honestly how I feel it's not worth your time if you're having a force it why would you be in something that's not comfortable for you\nKnow not say stand your comfort zone your whole life absolutely not but I'm saying it over a long period of time she's not working\nYou really don't need it eight six six by by one Ninety nine thirty three of the top of these phone again that's eight six six by by one Ninety nine thirty three let's go to skip duck on line one skipped on how you doing\n[noise] hey good morning gentlemen yeah that was an interesting macro economics class she had I guess in a moment of honesty he talked about opportunity cost\nAn anarchist I'm In favor of that that's really one of the Lynch pins of a free market um the are the folks on the other side of the state controlled economies think that there are unlimited resources and and natural things can happen if he just\nSome of the other side of the state controlled economies think that there are unlimited resources and and magical things can happen if he just force people to do things with the right regulations but Sam ... at the opportunity cost to historically going back to a Frederick bashed yeah\n... ah in them and they in Eighteen forties and he didn't actually call opportunity costs we talked about this uh this is a at issue called the broken window fallacy and basically he was saying that I'm\nA government sent and a socialist and that people don't understand a comic feel that if if something a wrong goes ... or ... something wrong happens that somehow resources can come together to fix this problem mhm\nUh and there's no consequences that the all the consequences are positive there were no negative consequences are under this um\nExample of broken window fallacy now between World War one and World War two\nThe Austrian ... economists ... uh most singularly\nA moot point knees is actually put the name for this opportunity cost and if you hit the nail on the hit this visual feely where people should be thinking about their lives how do I\nDirect my ... my time is limited time lines you my limited resources and all my skills harnessed them towards might\nTowards my goal and my values and you know my values being just simply just simply liberty and reason as I was listening to your bumper music I thought about economic costs imagine that\nA bailout yeah I was thinking well how can we use this time differently how could this\nVery important limited time you have to be directed towards advancing a family used for those in Ninety seconds now I'm not a ... year time ah that's your that's your that's your choice but make no mistake audience every single second of every minute every hour of every day the\nConstantly confines of a choice they may not realize it or you may not decide to do anything but that is a choice and resources time and and a property are being directed whether they realize it or not so they have to\nBe more thoughtful and aware and vigilant and um they have to realize that uh there are consequences and um\nSo I I don't know if that's helpful if that would that if you want to pursue this further if you want to go on a different topic but I thought it was great you brought up in price discovery opportunity cost those are the two pillars of a free market and that\nI Want to thank you as an anarchist atheist I Want a really celebrate this commemorate this and congratulate you for bringing this up\nThey skipped duck always appreciate you yeah All right you have a great day listen jerk and I've been talking for those thirty sixty seconds yeah\nBut see my choices leap rice is really good for my mood so I'm going to play labor I leave rise makes me happy the song drinking glass makes me happy because I think that's a lot of us out there right myself included I think that you know I never want to be a part of this like\nElitist society where it's a everything's all ... you know I'm very comfortable where I Am right now I'm very comfortable being a part of the drinking class the people that are up early in the morning when the rooster crows clock in when the whistle blows I'm very comfortable being part of that generation being a part of that\nSocioeconomic class what whatever you want to call it that that's where I find\nI'm very comfortable being a part of that generation being a part of that socioeconomic class but whatever you want to call it that that's where I find comfort in so I I absolutely love that song um so that's where I Choose to spend my time but skip the app does bring up a good point is that\nAgain you really have to think about the values that you're working towards and so this is another topic that's a little bit you know it's really easy to illustrate\nThe opportunity costs when it comes to relationships or when it comes to something having to do with specifically career but when\nYou talk about something having to do with values it's a lot harder to look at that on an opportunity cost basis values and virtues what what you spend your time on it's a really difficult topic so\nYou know I really don't know even where to begin with that discussion Dylan you got any advice on that\nHold on got to do a quick calculation because I don't remember the exact number off the top of my head to the exact number of what okay so you oh here comes the story here we go you're basically given eighty six thousand four hundred seconds in a day yeah\nOK to put that in ... and another way\nYou're given eighty six thousand four hundred dollars in a bank account every day now I've heard this analogy of the hour and ...\nI'm sure a lot of people have so I'm not going to go all the way through it also I don't remember and off the top of my head\nA but I guess the greatest analogy that I've ever heard for how you spend your time\nYou mind if I break it down because I Love the analogy and I remember all of it I don't mind saying go for it okay so what's the number eighty six thousand\nEighty six thousand four hundred so you have eighty six thousand four hundred dollars in a bank account just think about that visualize this with me I was about to say close your eyes but you're driving please don't close your eyes you wreck but you have eighty six thousand four hundred dollars in the bank account you get that every single day deposited into your bank account but at the end of the day it goes away\nYou can't carry any of that balance into the next day\nRight what are you going to do with that eighty six thousand four hundred dollars\nYou're going to spend it right you're going to maximize that you're going to use it to the best of your abilities whether that means you know making like staying we're going to make your life the best it can be listed five eighty six thousand four hundred dollars every single day\nI'm going to the nicest hotel [laughter] I'm checking in I'm checking into the penthouse in my bud is never leaving because I can make up and I'm doing one night stays\nAnd I can make that payment every single day on the day right\nThat and I would ... it doesn't seem material things don't necessarily make you feel better\nRight now I think it'd be kinda cool\nTo live in a penthouse you know I feel like there's some things like that inspires success and it's just life is not all about also work and necessarily like what is the most humble benefit for you you know there's a reason you can enjoy things where there's a reason that sometimes momentary pleasures are enjoyable\nThey're not a negative thing every time I hear like momentary pleasure brought up it's always brought up in a conversation where it's bad there are some connotations or you give into it right\nAnd you know you shouldn't get you're given a momentary pleasure and that's bad but there are some times were momentary pleasures are good there's a recent that you can feel that but so you have eighty six thousand four hundred dollars in a bank account each day how would you spend it\nYou'd maximize that you'd spend as much but as you could and you make the most out of each and every dollar you're given every single day right we use eighty six\nDid you spend it you'd maximize you'd spend as much but as you could and you make the most out of each and every dollar you're given every single day right we use the eighty six thousand four hundred seconds\nEvery single day how are you spending those are you sleeping 'til noon\nAre you spending a lot of your time just watching TV shows for hours and hours on end\nOr are you doing things that not only will make you better but that you enjoy don't\nGet me wrong when somebody told me this you know uh I was uh when I first saw this analogy of sitting in a class and there were these kids that were like um they were like oh yeah we're not going to or watch television anymore\nAnd it was like well that's stupid\n[laughter] ... that's that's exactly what I told him and they said well why is that stupid I'm like do you enjoy it I brought up the scenario football and like listen you can make the same argument with Alabama football could you be learning something while you're watching an album football game\nYes do you enjoy watching Alabama football yes so why don't you watch a football\n... it's not talking about and I think that's where people misconstrue these scenarios and they want to take just the literal list of you if you have to be doing something to better yourself every eighty six thousand four hundred seconds listen I have some really bad news ladies and gentlemen we're all gonna die\nAnd I wanted you know do my own business as a as a crew but yeah you know I Would probably do that but my life is consumed which much clothes I must have [noise] I don't want to be\nNaked and the attorneys and the eternity and the only way you can be addressed and it turned out he is good works only thing we can take that sure as good works as what ten seconds later I got to cut\nYou off sorry\nY'all have a good one and a U.S all the modern\nThat sound sent us

weekend plans because we got by weeks it while you're arguing beef and you'll have about a week do you\nKnow we had our ... I think it was weeks three amount of and wait\nFor it right uh I Know we are I Believe is twenty force right over all now a rank above Auburn which yeah right that's right\nAudience just having a bad season I'm honestly ... sorry for y'all yeah well we're not going to lose tomorrow\nYeah than theirs but but you know\nI've been an Auburn fan for the better part of fifty years now you win some you lose\nA yeah there's always next year or get rid of miles on we love our tigers anyway yeah ... I was given a great deal of our our dogs but anyway\nUh you know you can't you just like you know my Christian conservative viewpoints you're never going to get me off voters and you're never gonna flip me on the ... so then there's\nNothing wrong with that no no no no\nUh it it is kinda dreary outside the weather's going to clear up a little bit later today it is the twenty sixth day of October and before we go any further a big shout out\nTo a number two daughter is today is her twenty first birthday I Know she's not hearing these words because undoubtedly she too light Baylor is still in the sack\nBut nonetheless if there is anybody out there that there was my daughter and listen to the program that and say hey your dad said happy birthday to you should have gotten yourself out of bed at a decent hour but they are the big Twenty one\nYeah\nOh wow it's wise I don't know that sounds trite but it's absolutely true Megan bar it's going to join us a little bit later today we had to move or off of yesterday simply because of a well how do you do have my eyeballs looked at Joe lock it'll be popping by a little bit\n[noise] I don't watch a lot of Fox News I share that with the guys in the past or wherever I couldn't find the a team or the Princess Bride or the godfather on last night and saw the faulted the Fox news\nBecause I just couldn't find a two by four and a hit myself in the head with either\nBut look you know looking at\nA Tucker Carlson who I have grown to appreciate as much as Laura Ingraham and much more than Sean Hannity you know he made some interesting observations last night just about the discourse in politics in America today now obviously he is referring to the vitriolic rhetoric\nBetween the left in the right\nBut he he kind of he kind of elaborate a past that\nEven to what we're seeing some of these campaigns and I do find it very interesting and you hear it right here on superstation one oh one is well some of the campaign ads that are out there that are promoting ideas leveling accusations\nDeclaring positions\nThat don't matter don't count\nShouldn't have any appeal to anybody and at the end of the day mean nothing we were kind of making fun of this\nDuring one of our previous elections where you had people right here in the state of Alabama going back the primary season people I hear the state of Alabama that were running for example\nFor state auditor or county coroner or a host of others that were running on a platform\n... Christian I'm a conservative I support the second amendment are running for record or for a walk county and I'm going to reverse of Obamacare\nI don't get it and I think it really speaks to the infant tie on nature of the of the political discourse in this country today and this is one of the reasons and I stole this from from from Neil bortz night Mitt that that you know\nOf course in this country today and this is one of the reasons and I stole this from from from Neil bortz night Mitt that\nThat you know abortion was always very fond of saying don't believe anything that I have to say do your own research do your own due diligence because you're not going to get the information that you want off of these campaign ads\nNow in the case in McCaskill she's coming out she's saying I'm not one of the crazies because she's realizing that was an interesting thing is taking place and we got into this conversation a couple of days ago about how in in in the discourse a lot of people are moving towards the heart laughed and a lot of moving towards the hard right but what we had to discuss that those that are not\nAre moving towards the middle\nAnd there does not seem to be any centrist candidates out there that are worth mentioning at least not at the national level\nAnd so I think McCaskill's began to realize that you are going to have a greater possibility of winning if you appeal more to the center because a lot of Americans in this condition that we're in right now are simply zoning out there are tuning out now although Fox News's numbers\nContinue to skyrocket you've got to bear in mind that there are skyrocketing compared\nTo MSNBC or CNN it does not necessarily mean that the raw numbers are increasing because I Believe and another doing talk radio and how long I've been doing this for ten years now a lot of guys and gals that listen to the talk radio every day\nThey I think sometimes labor falsely maybe not you guys because you're pretty sharp but a lot of people Labour falsely into believing that everybody is paying attention that everybody's listening to talk radio no the majority of people were voted out\nAnd that's why some of these political ads on radio stations across the country have become so unbelievably\nI'll just say trite without import without import and without importance so do you are due diligence as we are just what ten days away from what I believed to be the most significant mid term in modern history and\nWe we already know by by way of early polling and early voting where the states that allow that that the turnout appears to be significantly higher\nThan in previous midterms which frankly politically speaking and have been a snooze fast in this country for decades it does not seem to be shaping up that way\nBut I Want to caution everybody that when you're looking at the news just you're you're seen things on Twitter you are doing things on Facebook and we see the balls who's up in this state whose waiting over here\nThe polls from my perspective and what I Know and but I see are beyond worthless because it's very very very difficult number one to identify who they refer to commonly as likely voters\nAnd number two for these polling organizations to pull out of the center\nSo although we've got all the noise you know how how a lot of times you talking about special interest groups\nIf you will and I don't mean that in a in a racial sense I mean minorities such as you know the algae beat team movement or any one of a number out there feminist movement if you will\nHow it seems like you know they they they are creating so much noise despite the fact that there are relative minority related to the majority of the country the same thing is happening on the right and the left and it creates this illusion as though this massive\nSwath of America is extreme left and\nIt was happening on the right in the left and it creates this illusion as though this massive swath of America is extreme left and this massive swath of America is extreme right because they tend to be the noisiest they're the ones getting out in ... and all the havoc at the rallies when in fact most of the country\nIs center left or center right and as McCaskill seems to fake and I agree with her many many many people are dead pan in the center it's going to be very hard to figure out until we get the Tuesday\nWait for Mr D Day and we see what the turnout is going to be we see how people are going to pull the lever hanging chads or whatever the case may be but with that sad as you are going through your decision making process and I still think\nYou should\nIt's important that you do your due diligence on each individual candidate and this is the position and it does not apply this early you know it it applies more\nIn in a a presidential elections but it's going to play a role this time around as well this notion of just straight party vote and it drives me nuts now I vote for Republicans Ninety eight point seven four or five six percent of the time\nBut I also think that it's sometimes alleviates people from the responsibility\nOf well frankly educating themselves on each individual office because as we stayed on this program before it is the down tickets it's the judge ships\nAt sea board of education it's the county commissions these are the people that are going to have the greatest impact on your life and here in the state of Alabama almost every single constitutional officers up for grabs\nSo let's make absolutely certain we do our due diligence to get the right people in office eight six six five five one nine nine three three flushing out a Claire McCaskill take it a lot of heat from her own party and we have gotten to a place in this country views of the pipe bombs and the rhetoric et cetera where it is gone completely\nOff the rails now why don't you think is going to happen next Wednesday\nPardon me we're going to see\nA wholesale unraveling or people emotionally or\nIt's going to look like it was post Kavanaugh and what I mean by that is it happens the vote happens the elections are over and all of a sudden the rhetoric is tamped down that as my ardent home\nNow I have my doubts I have my concerns but I'm hoping that the better angels of our nature to channel Lincoln for a moment that the better angels of our nature will take over and that common sense and civility we'll win the day\nBecause it's interesting to note what's going on between the lap the Clintons of the world and Donald Trump in the world and I've said this before and I mean it and it's going to sound as though and pandering but I've traveled all across this country\nAnd I've been in other countries as well and when people find out that I'm from Alabama I get some of the most bizarre looks some of the most bizarre comments\nAnd I told the story one time of flying to ah Las Vegas some years ago for a seminar that I'm doing sitting next to a nice young couple on my honeymoon coming from Virginia\nAnd um the movie crazy in Alabama was on the ah was on the screen that was the movie for the flight after it was all over with the young ladies I can help it alive and you know three seats seventies whatever\nShe's sitting right to my life does she looks at me and she goes where are you from Michael and I said I'm from Alabama and it was like an old if hut\nAnd commercial everybody in the plane\nThe right to my wife she works for me and she goes where are you from going up and I'm from Alabama and it was like an old ...\nAnd commercial everybody in the plane turns around and looks at me as though I'm you know\nHe's he's he's one of those rednecks you know he's ... a good football team withdrawal red necked but you know why we have that that reputation\nAnd it goes there you\nGo to the U.S you know over what is it because of him\nPeople outside the state of Alabama draw inclusions Robert ... because the lack of our politicians\nAnd some of the same thing they do the corruption the gambling between coming into water bottle\nWith your mother or your\nSibling is happening nationally isn't it interesting that the majority of the political discourse as either occurring the national political level or if your by it that's why it's ... it's on us voters to shape\nAny documentation whatsoever\nAny documentation whatsoever some will return home some already have\nBut at the end of the day you know we cannot we cannot allow ourselves\nTo respond to the immediate humanitarian crisis that this is because it is a humanitarian crisis but it's one in my opinion I won't say it's fabricated but it was definitely encouraged\n\nAnd I have talked to several people in recent weeks primarily of Latino descent that are citizens of this country that were naturalized to become citizens of this country and they are hot\n\nAt the end of the day if we're not going to protect the sovereignty of this nation and I know I get the argument\nAbout well we're a melting pot yeah we're all immigrants my family is immigrants\n\nBut it would be unbelievably irresponsible to allow this group to come in completely unchecked for security reasons alone\n\nWe don't even know who's sending pipe bombs to Biden and deniro and Clinton and sorrows and people are screaming about how it's a hoax some people have a suggested that maybe it's the Democrats doing it to themselves for the purposes of Janine ... support none of these things what surprised\nMe for a matter of fact for the first time in my broadcast career nothing is surprising me there was a time when I couldn't believe that we would go there\nBut here we are\nAnd I don't want to like in this to to the civil war because it's not one not yet anyway but this idea that it can't happen in America that we would never do that in America is farcical\nYou know there was a time in this country hundred and fifty years ago if you\nWere forty thousand men walked out on a on a field and level to each other with fifty five caliber slugs or whatever they were\nIt is not beyond the pale and does not beyond the possibility\n\nBut we have got to get to a place in this country where law and order the rule of law pardon the expression Trump's emotion\nAnd I've said this before I'll say it every single day that I have this microphone I Am not a big fan of a lot of the rhetoric that comes out of the White House it seems to be responsive to a lot of the rhetoric coming from the left\n\nBut at the end of the day we have got to get our minds\nAround whether we're going to build a wall if we're going to be sovereign and what this nation looks like\n\nNobody in their right mind would think for a moment that we shouldn't have immigration\nI Know some out there and particularly the area and sat would disagree with that statement\n\nI Know some out there protesting the area and sat would disagree with that statement\n\nBut it cannot be unchecked it cannot be unwieldy\nIf you're not be a situation where it's more difficult to get into a college football stadium than it is the United states of America\n\nPeople particularly on the left screaming at the United states cannot afford to be\nThe world's police officer\nBut somehow seem to to lose their sensibilities when they feel as though that she should be the world's guardian\nBenefactor protector\nI was in a conversation a couple of days ago with a cousin of mine lives in New York Robert nearly we don't see eye to eye politically but she's quite respectful and I respect that but I made the comment\nTo her via or Facebook masses that little little thread she and I got into privately speaking\nThere'll be ... we cannot adopt the world Fox\n\nIs their pain and despair in Honduras Nicaragua Guatemala of course there is but you know what ... what about what about the veterans sleeping under a bridge right now what about those young children going to school right now in clothing that is\nTattered Hungary\nWe've got so many problems right here that we cannot even be given to deal with them what about the crime in our inner city what about our Chicago's running a Troy are East St Louis says\n\nIt's gotten so far afield now we've even got families there are several Republican candidates for office who are now on the receiving end of threats from their own blood relatives\nI've even got this in my family now\nQuite truthfully my family has been a family or professional argue worse for my entire\nLife we get together the holidays and wages go at each other\n\nI Know that's not necessarily real Christian but then again where a bunch of well you know Yankee Catholics from the north\n\nBut we simply cannot clean up the mess is worldwide it's an impossibility and you know you're\nAll well aware that this is caravan number two actually this particular event has two waves in it but I was speaking in terms of generalities\nBut what do we do about Sierra Leone\nAnd chat and parts of South Africa we knew about the Kurds\nI mean you can keep this up all day long\nBut when it's all said and done making the world is sweeter time blur gentler place and you know what else is really interesting is that a lot of the people that want to come to this country for whatever the reason\nThey don't even share the values of the left\nI find it to be so interests\nUse of the left\n\nI find it to be so interesting that so many people the policies of the world screaming about allowing these folks in and they would find many of the beliefs of the Democratic left to be abhorrent to their own personal view points of belief systems\nSo it's obvious for what it is\n\nMany times people have asked me as I completed his work on the book\nBecause of all the historical visions that I reveal in it\nAnd so much of the history 'cause you know there's a lot of history in the past\nHow I decided to stop\n'cause I'm telling you I pretty much up and everything you know about American\nHistory and a lot of it you'll find much more fascinating\nBut an interview after interview after interview I've said in my my response is always been the same\nI just stopped I had to stop\nThe books about a hundred and eighty five pages long it could have easily been Eighteen hundred pages long because there is a lot of history and the pat matter of fact the second edition of the book which I'm writing right now a lab writes on everything and the first edition\nBecause there's just that much out there but I cannot write a comprehensive book on all of the anomalies I'm American history and expect anybody to be able to pick it up off the table at some point in time you have to say enough is enough and I did on page number one hundred and eighty four\nBut the same thing holds true for the immigration issue because if there's a second care of and the mayor is there'll be a third and fourth and fifth because the precedent is that\nWhere does it end how does it in and who wins it will be right back\nWhen are you in the room ... it's the Michael ... show\nThey're seen here in the water oh you don't drink tap water too much of a chemical taste for you you ... what you
