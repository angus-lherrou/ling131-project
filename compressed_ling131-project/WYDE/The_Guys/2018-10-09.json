those are the people that just made Birmingham Birmingham, Alabama and the middle of one of the redder states in the union a sanctuary city\nSome people like to complain about a lot of stuff that don't like to get involved don't like to really take an in depth look at that and it's I see it specifically in the millennial generation\nAnd it's something that's really disheartening because I'm like look I'm really concerned with how these people are going to make decisions for me whether it's on the local level like we just mentioned or the state level you know however my taxes going to look is alcohol going to be sold on Sundays just basic issues like that\nWhy are we not paying attention to state and then on a federal level these are people that are deciding big things taxes

that translates into how you for your time [noise] and [noise] are you\nReally viewing what's best for you [noise]\nAnd I was saying it's not selfish but I Love your your opinion [noise] eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three of us go to Derrick online one Derek how you doing\nMore to Baylor um I just want to say that there are ... like show thank you uh you're probably the wider young man I've ever listen to your\nBank you Derek that's a huge compliment\nWell I mean I'm fifty something and uh [laughter] I I just probably ten Fifteen Years ago started realizing how they are yeah when I was your age I was like time I got you know I'll never having to or never have too much of that yeah\nI'm so I'm just curious how you there's something you read it through the way you were raised their lead you to value that an earlier age\nYeah and yeah I can I can definitely speak to that or do you want me to let you go you want to stay on the line either way I'm good with\nUs ally okay cool I'm driving\nAll right so essentially what led me to that thought process you know there's never like\nI don't really believe in like these light bulb moments right I feel like there are a lot of things that Komen ate over a period of time that lead to the way you think you know sometimes some information is taught through a singular source but I ... a lot of times that's not how I get information unfortunately I'm kind of hard headed so information has to be\nHit over my head a couple of times before it gets in but I think it's a the way it's raised and I think there was a ironically I was sitting in a macro economics class and I heard this idea of opportunity cost and one of the examples had do again with time\nAnd I started thinking about what am I spending my time on\nAnd then I got the idea of kind of went away again in are sitting in astronomy class and truth be told like a strong these really important I Know some people love it but I hate it I feel like it's the biggest waste of my time that I could be doing when I could be and not because I just want to be sleeping right I Want to be bettering myself and other areas and it really got me thinking about\nHow much how valuable that our is that I'm never going to get that our back and how you look over the course of a year if I did that three hours a week for fifty two weeks a year I mean do the math on that bill and what's the math on that fifty two times three\nI'm terrible man\nOh I'm asking bill and bill at the map to one fifty six yes that's a hundred and fifty six hours if I Do that for one year straight that I'm just flat out wasting and that's a conservative estimate\nSo it ... I don't know that that's kind of what went into my thought process\nI have to use like a at least an hour and a half way every day and um I read just believe that the average person spends the next five years and years in a vehicle\nWow and marriage is a big guy to do something else\nHere's an Chevy years wow and they're just a straight guy to do something else you know\nOr at least if you are to continue that commute 'cause you know everybody like we all like well my point was very idealistic but you know you still got to work right there are some people that need to work and not a strong in the field but\nWhen you work\n[noise] yeah [noise] but er but you could I mean there are so many ways you can\nChange your perspective on that I mean you could download the podcast you can listen to this show we're really thankful that you listen to this show you could listen to things that you know are going to teach you a new things because in that way you know your bettering your ... yourself you're spending your time wisely it may not be optimal like exactly what you want to do but\nYou're taking a step to better yourself other than you know just listening to Tim McGraw over and over again not said timber girls that you know what I'm saying\nOh I agree uh well that's a very optimistic outlook I really appreciate that which is probably why it is\nYeah well we absolutely love you're listening Derrick and I appreciate rather [noise] All right you have a great day\nAll right eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three is the number to join the conversation\nDylan what do you think about this idea about the idea of opportunity cost and how you spend your time because you're again we talked about this on the show were both very busy people I think I think most working people are very busy people I also think busy as a mindset but that's a completely different topic altogether but\nWhat do you think about this idea of\nIt's really important on how you spend your time because you are somebody that delves your time out between a lot of different things and I've seen you make a concerted effort\nTo um get together with a group of friends that you have and you really invest in that which I don't see a lot of people doing you know ... especially when they get out into the working world it's like family works sleep repeat there is not a lot of time allocated regularly\nTo getting together with the friends and really cultivating those relationships so how do you see this concept in your life do you do you think it holds any way you think I'm a little off what\n\nSo I've realized over the past several years that my mental health is incredibly important to my functionality in every other aspect of my life\nYeah uh\nI suffer from seasonal depression I think is the most accurate term ... basically a comes and goes for a season or two at a time yeah uh and it's not a consistent thing it's just whatever happens to be ailing me at the time no one can bring it out\nAnd I really have a two groups of friends now one that I've uh been around for several years uh\nMet kind of threw a hodgepodge of rain of different events depending on which one of which individual in that group you you're referring to yeah and then I've got another group that I've met through college and that's the group that I played the Indy with most of the time\n... A N e each one of them it's\nKind of a feeling of acceptance of like people actually wanting me around ... being near that helps a lot ... a and being an introvert I Need time to myself until I kind of recharge ... however\nToo much time to myself leads to more thoughts and feelings with depression so it just figuring out where to put that balance\nKnow I'm not saying stand your comfort zone your whole life absolutely not but I'm saying it over a long period of time it's just not working\nYou really don't need it eight six six by by one Ninety nine thirty three let's talk about these phone again that's eight six six by by one Ninety nine thirty three let's go to get back on line one skipped on how you doing\n[noise] hey good morning gentleman that was an interesting macro economics class she had I guess in a moment of honesty he talked about opportunity cost\nAn anarchist I'm fully in favor of that that's really one of the Lynch pins of a free market um the are the folks on the other\nSide of the state controlled economies think that there are unlimited resources and and magical things can happen if he just force people to do things with the right regulations but at the opportunity costs a historically you went back to a Frederick bashed yeah\nMm uh no ... in Eighteen forty and he didn't\nThe opportunity cost to historically going back to a Frederick fast yeah\nI Know and they in Eighteen forties and he didn't actually call opportunity costs we've talked about this uh\nThis is a at issue called the\nBroken window fallacy and basically he was saying that I'm a government send a socialist a and that people don't understand a comic feel that if if something a wrong goes ... or ... something wrong happens that somehow resources\nCan come together to fix this problem mhm\nUh and there's no consequences that the all the consequences are positive there were no negative consequences are under this um example of broken window fallacy now between World War one and World War two\nThe Austrian ... economists ... uh most singularly\nA loop they find new uses actually put the name for this opportunity cost and if you hit the nail on the hit this visual feely where people should be thinking about their lives how do I\nDirect my my time is limited time minds you my limited resources and all my skills hardest them towards might\nTowards my goal and my values and you know my values being just simply just simply liberty and reason as I was listening to your bumper music I thought about economic costs imagine that a Baylor yeah I was thinking well how could we use this time differently how could this\nVery important limited time you have to be directed towards advancing a family used for those Ninety seconds now I'm not a ... year time ah that's your that's your that's your choice but\nMake no mistake your audience every single second of every minute of every hour of every day the constantly confines of a choice they may not realize it or you may not decide to do anything but\nThat is a choice and resources timing and property are being directed whether they realize it or not so you have to\nBe more thoughtful and aware and vigilant and um they have to realize that uh there are consequences and um\nSo I I don't know if that help for that but if you want to pursue this further if you want to go on a different topic but I thought it was great you brought up in price discovery opportunity cost those are the two pillars of a free market and uh\nI Want to thank you as an ... an atheist I Want a really celebrate this commemorate this and congratulate you for bringing this up\nBaylor thank you skip duck I always appreciate you yeah All right you have a great day listen sure can I've been talking for those thirty sixty seconds yeah\nBut see my choices leap rice is a really good for my mood so I'm going to play labor I leave rise makes me happy the song drinking glass makes me happy because I think that's a lot of us out they write myself included I think that you know I never want to be a part of this like\nElitist society where it's a everything's all\n... you know I'm very comfortable where I Am right now I'm very comfortable being a part of the drinking class the people that are up early in the morning up when the rooster crows clock in when the whistle blows I'm very comfortable being a part of that generation being a part of that\nSocioeconomic class ... whatever you want to call it that that's where I find comfort and so I I absolutely love that song are so\nThat's where I Choose to spend my time but it does bring up a good point is that again you really have to think about\nUm so that's where I Choose to spend my time but skip that does bring up a good point is that again you really have to think about the values that you're working towards\nAnd so this is another topic that's a little bit you know it's really easy to illustrate the opportunity\nCosts when it comes to relationships or when it comes to something having to do with specifically career but when\nYou talk about something having to do with values it's a lot harder to look at that on an opportunity cost basis values and virtues what what you spend your time on that's a really difficult topic so\nYou know I really don't know even where to begin with that discussion Dylan you got any advice on that\nHold on got to do a quick calculation because I don't remember the exact number off the top of my head the exact number of what okay so you oh here comes the story here we go so you're basically given\nEighty six thousand four hundred second and a day yeah OK to put that in ... in another way\nYou're given eighty six thousand four hundred dollars in a bank account every day I've heard this analogy of the hour and ...\nI'm sure a lot of people have so I'm not going to go all the way through it also I don't remember it off the top of my head a\nBut I guess the greatest analogy that I've ever heard for how you spend your time\nDo you mind if I break it down because I Love the analogy and I remember all of it I don't mind saying go for it okay so what's the number eighty six thousand\nEighty six thousand four hundred so you have eighty six thousand four hundred dollars in the bank account just think about that visualize this with me I was about to say close your eyes but you're driving please don't close your eyes you wreck but you've eighty six thousand four hundred dollars in the bank account you get that every single day deposited into your bank account but at the end of the day it goes away\nYou can't carry any of that balance into the next day\nRight what are you going to do with that eighty six thousand four hundred dollars\nYou're going to spend it right you're going to maximize that you're going to use it\nTo the best of your abilities whether that means you know making like staying like you're going to make your life the best it can be listen to five eighty six thousand four hundred dollars every single day I'm going to the nicest hotel [laughter] I'm checking in I'm checking into the penthouse in my bud is never leaving because I can make up and I'm doing one night stays\nAnd I can make that payment every single day on the day\nRight that and I would ...\nIt doesn't seem material things don't necessarily make you feel better right\nNow I think it'd be kinda cool\nTo live in a pet in the house you know I feel like some things like that inspires success and it's just life is not all about also work and necessarily like what is the most humble benefit for you you know there's a reason you can enjoy things like there's a reason that sometimes momentary pleasures are enjoyable\nThey're not a negative thing every time I hear like momentary pleasure brought up it's always brought up in a conversation where it's bad there are some connotations or you give into it right and you know you shouldn't get you given them a momentary pleasure and that's bad but there are some times were momentary pleasures are good there's a recent\nThat you can feel that but so you have eighty six thousand four hundred dollars in a bank account each day how would you spend it\nCued maximize that you'd spend as much but as you could and you make the most out of each and every dollar you're given every single day right\nWe use eighty six thousand four hundred seconds\nEvery single day how are you spending those are sleeping 'til noon are you spending it\nHow are you spending those are sleeping 'til noon\nAre you spending a lot of your time just watching TV shows for hours and hours on end or are you doing things that not only will make you better but that you enjoy\nDon't get me wrong when somebody told me this you know uh I was uh when I first saw this analogy of sitting in a class and there were these kids that were like um there were like oh yeah we're not going to or watch television anymore\nAnd it was like well that's stupid [laughter] that's that's exactly what I told them and they said well why is that stupid I'm like do you enjoy it I brought up the scenario football and like listen you can make the same argument with Alabama football could you be learning something while you're watching you know than football game\nYes do you enjoy watching Alabama football yes so why don't you watch football\n... it's not talking about and I think that's where people misconstrue these scenarios and they want to take just literally list view if you have to be doing something to better yourself every eighty six thousand four hundred seconds listen I have some really bad news ladies and gentlemen we're all gonna die\nWe're going to get to some point in our life or God says you know this is where you're checking out and you're going to check out at that point so it's not how much knowledge can you accrue during that life stance right during that whole life cycle\nIt's how you live it not how much you can bring in not how good you can make yourself that how you live your life how you treat those around you the end of the day material possessions don't really matter\nBut I spent some of that eighty six thousand four hundred dollars to live in a house yeah what I buy every single friend I have over up to that ... and would we have parties and enjoy it and stuff like that\n[noise] I don't want to be a nation in the turn in the eternity and the only way you can be addressed and it turned out he is good work only thing we can assure those good works as what's in seconds later in order to cut\nYou off sorry\nY'all have a good one and I saw him on\nA cell phone to die for the call and we'll talk about it tomorrow I appreciate your hundred I'll ride ladies and gentlemen Michael heart is coming up next a free she's spending the day from you are with

upgraded to a category three\nDo not know what it will be when it makes landfall right now the area between Destin and again Appalachian coal a port saint Joe a St George island is ... what is commonly referred to as the forgotten coast is directly in the path of this storm\nAnd us St George island very low in terms of sea level it's only two or three feet above sea level and so\nIt can be underwater\nBut the good news for us next week ... are dipping into the forties yeah in the ... are going to be\nIt's already feeling a little fall like out there were Seventy three of my drive in this morning and when I was getting dressed I actually did a outspoken with ... evening joined a had a great time talked about of course politics and racism and bigotry and\nWe talked about it you know the limousine crash and just in the aftermath of all that the fallout\nBut uh I got home last night and I put out a short sleeved shirts and I was going to wear this morning and I thought\nI I don't know what to read a little warm it up a little bit later on but first thing today ... probably a little bit too nippy for that but I Am all about the ...\nYeah I'll liberate German right there ever a barbecue pit pad or protested outside bay area whole foods and other supermarkets to raise awareness about alleged ... missiles their words animal welfare violations\nWhole foods a main suppliers have ah been targeted the group claimed that it witness animal abuse\n\nKnow Harvey Weinstein was found but it is animal abuse\nAfter visiting dozens of the suppliers farms this according to the guardian they restraining order was filed at the end of the week in which the group had hosted a banner outside this particular store which red occupy whole foods\nUh-huh uh-huh\nMembers of the ah of the group have repeatedly entered stores and property to conduct demonstrations that disrupt customers and team members by blocking access to our aisles\n\nAs well as cash registers and other departments\nInterfering with our business and putting the safety of both customers and team members at risk that is according to your representatives\nOf whole foods this particular group think all kind of go bank if you will is known for their over the top acts of protest at supermarkets and restaurants\nEarlier this year one of the group's members covered himself\nIn the same animal poop\nOutside aid Trader Joe's in San Francisco and an apparent protest of the conditions on the farms that supply eggs to the supermarket\nUnfortunately he didn't\nSan Francisco and an apparent protest of the conditions of the farms that supply eggs to the supermarket\nUnfortunately he didn't contract talks ...\nThat's just stupid yeah\nAh the guns you won't cover yourself an animal ... mhm yeah the protests\nAnd apparently folks have something to say about it because the phones are ringing so uh we'll get to your calls here and are just a bit we're going to have a conversation with Dr John ... here in a few minutes as well to find out about the radicalized occupy whole foods groups\n[noise]\n\nWhen I was talking to lock it about this last night I Am so unbelievably over protest rallies\nBanners signs\nAnd funny little offensive hats we are so overwhelmingly are oppressed and this nation\nThat now we can't even go out and have a decent steak on a weekend\nAs we prepare to watch our football team do everything in its power to botch I'm Sorry about kind of went off on rent there but either way this group has been hitting the supermarkets all across San Francisco all across California\nNow you've got a a cease and desist level by whole foods against this particular group which ah apparently is quite well funded at the same time the group has stated that it will continue the protests despite the a legal wrangling by whole foods and\nSome other supermarket chain spokes men have a pretty much made it clear that that's going to come from them as well so everybody grabbed a sign everybody get a hat\nEverybody called a door because we got this protest and y'all eight six six five five one nine nine three three drawn cause I'm like I Can't even see my screen\nYeah you got Dave on a lot to okay I'm Sorry hello Dave how are you\nAll been on it I don't know if how are you\nPretty good which started you take the sixth avenue south the exit apparently off the\n... yeah did you go to al ... cemetery you turn around and\nAh no actually I was able to go straight through town and pick up the exit just a little south of third avenue\nOh okay ah where are you headed north than now is that in the south in that case oh you're has out okay well they got a new route and we got rid of center everybody gets to ramp\nWell out one of the ticket in ... Seventeen straight or exit and it's coming off a sixty five south of uh the the old malfunction junction and it'll row you all all ... all the way in the downtown Birmingham\nYeah there's one coming from the south as well right now the reason why I called as a day or Fox News did a um a\nAn article about this ah ads run Norman and uh she was a former writer for one of those one of the magazines from Washington ah anyway she she has followed the money and of course George dollars in spending all this stuff and and the thing with Kavanaugh\nAnd the and the and the clawing other day for the legal building um like she said that uh uh the money has flowed into the group and she found it through the Cash Cab resistance\nBut the lady that uh that that confronted flake on the uh on the elevator ... he was one she was one of the captains\nAnd she works resource\nYeah and she makes a hundred and fifty thousand a year yeah so there you know this thing\nMy my thing is that course ah I I took a tour of duty this weekend\nAnd she makes a hundred and fifty thousand a year yeah so there you know this is my\nNow my my thing is that course ah I I took a tour of duty this weekend through a um what is it a ... and on cue and on and um they uh are talking about when the uh when when the martial law hits\nA and here's the thing to look at is that a a it could be a lot worse as martial law yeah hit\nAnd Hillary were and we'd be in a whole bunch of the you know what but uh this one is or if you're flying American flag proposition live side he's not going to come in and take your guns\nAnd all that kind of stuff but what is going to happen or the indictment after this election indictments are going to come out and uh it's not going to be pretty and then that includes even for the Bush folks\nSo I'm a in this thing is a racketeering you name it there's all kinds of stuff I I Am amazed at the amount of um a of law suits that are county and these people already know the economy and the ones that that are that are a ... on the documents they know they're coming and um but the number\nHas stolen from forty five hundred to some to the tune of like fifty thousand yeah we we've heard that's that's yeah that's what I hear too so but we don't know the bottom line but with a\nQ A non is ahead as analyze all of a Trump's tweets and he said that they say they're very organized in some of the cryptic\nNets messages in there and it's probably lose some of the folks and the government yeah they are very ... very much yeah how did you too\n[laughter] it's like it's like that cryptic presidential alert yeah oh the the national\nNetflix until message or yeah yeah uh uh is that everyone thinks Donald Trump can access there the nine one one card in ...\nHa ha yeah yeah yeah that's OK let's do some other calls\nAnd stuff All right hey Josh how are you\nHey I'm great how are you very good thank you\nI uh so these are vague and protesting at whole foods other crochet stores you don't see us carnivores are protesting they're feeding habits so Alan thing that's fair but then there will be protests that car or habits\nI agree but they are going to be out there to secure the rights of animals well far and wide\nEyed by leave a husband trading with a design so we can gather the animals for food and not necessarily just gather 'em as pets\nYeah I hear you have a blessed\nThe YouTube Josh thanks so much but you always got to try to amend your current Evers habits are times you can make it nearly Seventy\nDays that you know what you know what that is that there has paradise take a cheeseburger [laughter] hello Mike\nI get more than a gentleman how're y'all good how are you\nI Am good I monitor I talked to this morning you sign a squirrel you started talking about the hurricane and the shrimp and there's going to say something happened and then boom you went to another set\nYeah I I Do that sometimes 'cause I I sometimes feel\nIran coming on then I might not be able to you about properly manage this was a bit of that\nI understand that anyway you all have a a great day in Georgia\nMike appreciate it so very much you know sometimes ... as you get older your the least theoretically your filter becomes a little more Tony ... served on Kim well yeah I was going to say you kind of get you get\nRhetoric your filter becomes a little more or served on Kim Wells yeah I'll just say you kind of get you to understand where you're about to go to a nearby and you know that you're about to take a trip and never leave the farm\nAnd every once in awhile I forget that was one of the problems that I had\nLast night when I was on the air with a lock it because you're doing TV and there's not a microphone in front of you you got what's called a ... year Mike on\nAnd sometimes the way he has set is formulated that set up you're not looking at the camera you're looking at walk it and it's easy to lose sight of the fact that you're on TV and so I have to constantly check back\nSo I almost went to a couple of ways is yesterday but I probably was going to regret going but ah yeah we um we always rejected Mike and maybe we'll bring it back out we're not in the car pool harm\nYour brain diverts blood flow from your frontal lobe where your executive process season it is where you think rationally and diverts a two year limbic system which is we're all your emotions are and then then they've got a little atomic ... will do whatever they want you to do and it's pretty disgusting\nYeah it it's interesting and it's hard for me to to explain this to you sir I'm going to do with his gingerly as I can but uh you know you're not the first psychologist or psychiatrist and we've spoken to her over the years and I talked to one I don't know it's been seven or eight years ago\nAnd he wrote a book and I can't even tell you the name of the book but I'll Try to apply to a kind of give me an idea it started with the letter F F feelings and he was kind of making\nThe same point that you are that where you know we're we're we're getting so much so wrapped up in the emotional aspect of this and what's so fascinating to me\nIs that you know I understand the debate about roe versus Wade and you know we'll Brett Kavanaugh overthrow America and and the concerns about that there's no reason to believe the Supreme Court's gonna bring up roe versus Wade anywhere in the near future\nBut it's got like ... yeah it it it it's just so interesting to see these people just completely unraveled over things that when you really get down to the nitty gritty it's probably never going to affect any of their lives\nAnd you know and and Brett Kavanaugh can be on the Supreme Court for for Twenty years and the majority of Americans outside of the things like health care will never really noticed a difference if there even is one\nExactly and and but they're programmed and trained by this twenty four hour a day seven days a week cycle of of rhetoric I mean I I don't even want to call it news 'cause it's not really news it's a it's headlines with no content\nAnd and these individuals are triggered by that you know they they use all these trigger words and they say oh you can't say this you can't\nSay that I I taught at the university for Twenty one years\nAnd the last four it was all about oh you got to be careful a trigger words you gotta be careful of trigger words and I'm like I have a lecture to do I'm content I have to cover or my students aren't going to walk out of there knowing what they need to know you guys can get upset about trigger wars but I'm not [laughter]\nUh you know that's just the way it was I got tired of all the the the politics in education that there is today so I stepped away from that and you know it's\nIt's really sad to say that we've got a a country right now that of World War two was starting a I I don't know if we would be able to you know pull it together like we did in World War two\n[noise] so what do you think is going to tape because I I understand you know that there is kind of a sense of you know going to what you're speaking to you know the the collective this of the nation coming together during times of tragedy or disaster or whatever the case may be\nAnd you know and I'm a I'm a very voracious reader and I I did a lot of reading lately on you know things like a\nCommunal living and you know societies and things of that nature and how in years past\nYou know the society you know as America you know we slow they don't realize we've had our differences I'm not going to apply that we have not\nWet but they always seem to be this sense of ah togetherness or collective ... if you will during these times of strife and you're you're absolutely correct it really as concerned me so much so that you know you've got people out there screaming protect for you know posed cabin all ...\nAims of strife and you're you're absolutely correct is really as concerned me so much so that you know you've got people out there screaming protect for you know posed Kavanaugh's confirmation there were headed for a new civil war which I find to be offensive because\nYou know we're not going to engage in anything like we did in the Eighteen hundreds but you know what ... what is the endgame for these people what are they trying to convey what is what is the agenda here are they just people that are spouting off at the mouth because there are so overwhelmed with reality\nI I I say the last thing he just said is probably the closest thing to truth I mean\nYou know historically we have been a country that that steps up and helps itself helps our own people helps our neighbors and you know we didn't need a centralized government to tell us we need to help the family next door to us not starve to death\nAnd we're getting to the point where people just are not thinking there so\nI you know I don't know what to do so many needs to tell me what to do and uh it it's a sad state I mean we we had issues back you know with with the the\nDust bowl our when we when we lost all food production and everything was destitute but we still had the average you know Ninety five percent of our citizens were connected to somebody\nWho produced food and so people survive\nToday less than three percent of our society is connected with people who make food I think you said it at the beginning you know you needed to get out into the country\nYou know we're losing that contact with with what really matters in this world and and that connected in this\nAnd that ability to be independent and be out in the country and I I think it behooves us to take our children fishing and hunting and camping and get them out there and start realizing\nThat there were some significant adverse of these that\nUh we overcame in this country and uh it is magical to think you know how we went from landing a Plymouth Rock which I Know that's not historically exactly what happened but it's a good story line um\nTo to being the most dominant most\nA powerful country in the world and ah there's some responsibility with that and if we just passed the buck and and fall into all I hurt my feelings about now you're talking to a psychologist I'd\nDo deal with therapy and with with feelings of all the time and as an individual they are important\nBut as a society we have to be able to step up and perform and just let let our politicians do their job let the justices do their job let our our governors do their job and step back in ... giving them more power than than they are entitled to\nSo are we we saying here it sounds to me like you are that there's a kind of a measure of\nOf intention here and and what I mean by that is from in front of coming from the politicians\nYou know this whole thing with that with Kavanaugh I mean do you remember I don't know how old you are but I'm fifty seven I cannot remember a time in this country where probably fifty fifty five sixty percent of the nation was glued to the outcome of a Supreme Court nominee\nI mean Twenty years ago that was an absolute snooze fast now you've got people that are taking time off work to watch the vote\nAnd it's sad it really is sad and I agree with you I don't remember a time either and worry about the same age and and part of it is this whole\nBilly is sad my agree with you I don't remember a time either and worry about the same age and and part of it is this whole that that that dog and pony Pavlov\nMechanism who we were talking about the very beginning and they're they've trained people to respond to their trigger words that they want you to respond to that get you wrapped up emotionally and you stop thinking rationally I mean there's this man had been through six\nSix previous background checks deep I mean where they talk to elementary school teachers\nIf there was a problem there with him being you know sexually violent it would have come out and the the media did not let it go they had to sit back and say oh there's a reason why and the reason why they don't want him there is because they don't want to conservative majority you know if we had a ... a a\nA liberal mental majority they would have been happy and crazy and and on and on about this whole thing and it wouldn't have been a big deal and they would have been swept under the rug but\nThat wasn't what the the liberal media which is primary mainstream media to in this country we're we're looking for and you know we have\nTo stand up for the principles that this country was founded on line and one of them is you're innocent until proven guilty and and as he had you know that situation at that young lady was violated by him\nShe should have gone to the court system and I know but he goes oh but it was so traumatic and well\nYeah it may have been traumatic but it was so traumatic even our best friend didn't know about it so I and and I have\nMet you with that being a psychologist working with patients and people talk people people talk to the people closest to that so\nWas she violated I'm sure she was was with him I I don't know I don't believe it was but um I don't have proof that fact I Can't prove a negative\nSo it it's a it's an easy ... scheme to go after somebody and say there's something evil when there's no way to prove a negative and it's disturbing that would have gotten to that\nIn this country so so your prescription doctor is for people to disengage as much as they can unfortunately I'm almost no time and I got an answer this question\nThere are a lot of people in our ... news cycles I get that but a lot of them seem to be coming from social media Facebook Twitter et cetera those people out there that have this you know they almost addictive behavior and I I'm starting to think some of the addiction might even be learned\nBut you know how to how\nHow do you recommend that people unplug or disengaged because there are people out there
