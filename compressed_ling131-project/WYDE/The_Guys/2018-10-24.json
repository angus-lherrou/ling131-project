Mayflower Compact read it in school the magma card or read it in school Dakota Justinian read it in school and the U.S constitution read it in school here's the thing\nThe Mayflower compact we all know what that is the magnet Carter\nIs a legal document it comes from it comes from England it's the foundation of some English common law precepts the code of Justinian\nRoman law the foundation of Roman law and the justifications their end and the U.S constitution I think at this point everybody knows what the U.S Constitution as\nEvery single one of those except for the ten commandments are already allowed in schools and they're already taught in school\nThat's why it's called the ten commandments amendment and its uh specifically to place the ten commandments they're using the terminology\nAllow which I feel like is a big strong man because when they say allow they're saying that these documents should be allowed in the school I'm with ya like you go ahead allow the ten commandments in school but take it a step further don't establish\nOne religion because if you're going to allow the ten commandments in school now this is going to just ... this is going to be this is going to rocks and people's\nIdeology but if you're going to allow the ten commandments in schools you should allow surreal law in school is not the implementation of it but you should allow children to read the ... act\nRight\nHave freedom of religion in this country for a reason no religion Shelby establish this is a well set precedent well defended by the Supreme Court if you're going to allow for one thing that you say is the foundation for legal codes which there are many Christian legal\nOr if you're going to allow for one thing that you say is the foundation for legal codes which there are many Christian legal scholars that dispute this claim up and down I got an article pulled up that we can talk about that says to the ten commandments is not\nThe basis for American law and this claim is fundamentally unsound as from a Christian law professor\nA Christian law professor said that\nYou should allow for other religious legal codes 'cause that's what it is like as a devout Christian who believes the ten commandments and who tries to follow them every day it's a religious legal code there's nothing in the United states legal code that says put no God before you're\nRight\nThere's nothing in the ... there is nothing in the United States Constitution there's nothing in the law that says that now are there things that were carried over into American law that were in the ten commandments yeah\nThat was found not guilty perfect Dow show not steal perfect ... there\nAre there are moral laws yes yes are the ones that are carrying it rains that don't necessitate religion it it's a virtue in value set so to say that this is allowing the ten commandments in schools is not ... it's a straw man\nRight what it's saying is that we're going to place the ten commandments in schools and public buildings\nAnd if you're going to place the ten commandments in schools and public buildings than you should allow for eb ... religious legal code I should be allowed to be shown in public buildings because we do not establish a religion in the United states think about it this way\nSo let's literally take a synonymous example using another religion and let's place it in the place of this amendment let's say it's amendments six are or what what amendment was it let's say the amendment that you are going to vote on\nRight this amendment that you're going to vote on had what's called the sharia law amendment\nLet's say that and it said to allow the showing of sharia law in courtrooms and US public schools across the state of Alabama how would you vote on that I have a feeling a lot of people would vote no right\nI think a lot of us can agree a lot a lot a lot a lot a lot of us can agree Sheree a law has bad bad pretense isn't it I don't know if you read ... I Hope\nI've read the legal code it says some things in it that are very ... that are things that do not aligned with a modern society\nThe thing is people make the claim that the ten commandments\nAre the basis for American law so let's read from Marci Hamilton who Marci Hamilton is let me pull for bio she is the Paul are very ... chair in public law at the Benjamin N Cardozo School of law at yeshiva university\nAnd her columns on church and state issues can be found in numerous places\nThis is ignorant and I'll tell you why I'm not going to tell you it's ignorant without telling you are\nThomas Jefferson in on January first eight you know to wrote a letter to the damn very Baptist association in Connecticut this letter is what contains these the idea of separation of church and state\nAnd you know that everybody just stops there nobody says what Jefferson said here's what Jefferson said and it goes entirely contradictory\nTo this idea of this Christian empire the young is talking about let me make this perfectly clear\nDean young is ignorant to history and doesn't know what the hell are you talking about if you're going to vote for this fine do your research that's perfectly acceptable we all have our own decisions and I I Know our listeners are incredibly smart and I respect your ability to make your own decision and I respect your vote\nBut don't listen to somebody who doesn't know what they're talking about because Jefferson wrote in the in his letter to the ... Baptist association\nHe said quote believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God\nThat he owes account to no none other for his faith or his worship that legitimate powers of government reach actions only and not opinions I contemplate was sovereign reference that the act of whole\nThat legitimate powers of government reach actions only and not opinions\nI contemplate was sovereign reference that the act of whole American people which declared that their legislatures should quote make no laws respecting an establishment of religion or for hitting the free exercise of\nDust building a wall separate a building a wall of separation between church and state and hearing to this expression of the Supreme will of the nation and be half of the right of conscience I shall see with sincere satisfaction\nThe progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights\nCan ... convinced he has no natural right in opposition\nOf his social duty so I Do want to talk about that first part one more time believing with you that\nReligion is a matter which lies slowly between man and God\nMan in his God\nAnd that he owes account to none other for his faith\nOr his worship\nThis speaks directly contradictory\nTo this idea of a Christian empire\nThis speaks directly contradictory to this idea that Christianity should be enshrined in our nation coming from a Christian who thinks Christian values are incredibly incredibly good incredibly beneficial and incredibly good for each person who takes up that oath with his God\nTakes up that believe with his God and goes forward and uses those values sets somebody like dean young that comes out and says\nThat we're taking away from the establishment of the Christian religion\nHe's ignorant to history and ignorant to what one of the founders of this country one of our greatest American thinkers what Jefferson came when he and said when he wrote to the ... association and commit in Connecticut on January first\nEighteen oh too because directory ... directly contradictory\nSo I get it you would like the ten commandments to be shown in places of where the government is you'd like to it to be shown in school you would like for it to be shown every in any where the government is I understand that you're right to want that you're right to vote for it go for it\nBut listen to what Jefferson said\nJefferson a devout Christian said believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God lies solely between\nMan and his God that he owes account to none other for his fate or his worship that legitimate powers of government reach actions only and not opinions from the devout Christian and one of the greatest thinkers\nIn our nation's history Thomas Jefferson the foundation of the idea of separation of church and state boat however you want but when you vote think about those words that Jefferson said\nAnd think is this something that will enshrine religion is this something that will make religion a government action\nRight will this take your religion and make it a government action which we've had another case where this has taken religion and making a making the government action right\nEverybody gets so worked up government took marriage right marriage was a religious institution government took it government said this is now a state institution\nAnd then because of the state is\nGovernment took it government said this is now a state institution\n\nAnd then because it's a state institution and we have freedom of religion in this country what was it open up to ...\nIt was opened up the gay marriage a lot of Christians don't like that a lot of Christians complain about that yet you want to give government another practice of your real religion\nTo me it doesn't make any sense but I like to hear your opinion on what it does make sense eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three but if you're a Christian that doesn't like the fact that marriage is now an institution where eight now a state institution that gay people can use\nAsk yourself what happened last time your religious institution\nWas made a state institution what happened as Jefferson would say the last time your religious institution was made a government action\nAnd not your opinion not your ideology not your faith not a practice of your fate eight six six\nFive five one Ninety nine thirty three is a number of join the conversation going it's eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three let's get Jerry on line one Gerry how're you doing\nGuys I Do like good how 'bout yourself\nAre doing just great I wanted to speak to a couple of things on what was the ... show when was the gambling do ... and uh we have to understand what gambling is trying to take advantage of other people's losses\nAnd a and it appeals to flash in the flesh nature\nA lesson but does the government have the right to tell the people where they can and can't spend their money no why can't you gamble\nWell you can if it's like\nThat's what I'm saying why isn't illegal if the government doesn't have the right to tell you where you can and can't spend your money why should gambling be illegal for moral reasons isn't that the government telling you this is immoral and therefore you shouldn't do it\nWell that's what it is it is a moral issue because it brings about so much corruption in\n... where are your morals founded where are your morals found the\nJudeo Christian ethic and the rule of law\nThere you go that now separate those two there for me because we just talk about how the Judeo Christian values that that is founded in the ten commandments and the laws of Moses are separate historically from American law\nNow if you're leaving a Judeo Christian values that's then that's taking your morals morals that I agree with and saying that this is the way it should be right\nGovernment had no right to tell you what you can and can't do what is the government took something that originated from Islamic value sets and said this is what you should do would you like that\nThen why should you be able to assert that on to other people\nWell you know is is is a government just for the ... of the good of the people and um and and if we don't keep our moral values in chick do right it it does bring about the opposite effect\nNow let me let me ask you so I agree with like theft and murder we can agree those are bad but with moral stature such as what is gambling is gambling moral or immoral\nIs that not entirely subjective or there's some cultures that let's say gambling's good some value sense that would say gambling that that not entirely subjective and based on your ideology\nYes that's true though they're watching the committed on the people\nWe have this thing called freedom of choice\nThere you go yeah we do and that's why you should be able to choose where you spend your money\nAnd that's what\nAnd the people but we have this thing called freedom of choice\nThere you go yeah we do and that's why you should be able to choose where you spend your money\nAnd that's what led me that they give you my point through they won't connect gambling with the ten commandments\nAt La Crosse Calgary and then you can see what I'm Talking about you know I said earlier that gambling is taking advantage of other people's losses and there's also an activity that took place at the cross\nOr they gamble for his garments remember cast pots yep either take advantage of his law he lost his garments\nBe redound across naked before a million because he knew that man was go stand before him naked in judgment mhm so he took the judgment for our sins mhm so the ... so if it gambling is right or wrong well it is Raul\nIs so it but it will have people that but a lot of people at me finish a lot of people will make that choice because it'll pills to flash and flashes into the towards God\nBut what are you talking about winter run or are you talking about your religion a religion that I agree with entirely and do I agree with your stance on gambling the morality\nAspect of it potentially but what are you driving your whole thought process from\nOkay the ten commandments was given to show us are seeing a rebate and if you ever tried to keep the ... the ten commandments to be right\nOh sure murder\nYeah yeah\nThat's\nCorrect but the government should not tell him should not tell every body where they should and shouldn't spend their money he has the right to not spend his money on the lottery he believes the immoral suggest what\nHis values that are values that I agree with ... doesn't dictate where other people spend their money the

R. D. E. dot com find this on Facebook followers on Twitter so many ways interact with the program\nAnd others say good morning to the man has been here for the last couple of hours just hanging out gingerly in Studio where this how are you my brother um doing very good how 'bout yourself pretty good listen to a person's have your program coming in today lively conversation\nThat you we uh we went all over the board we started with the Titanic cause you heard that seems like that is just some that seems like there's some bad karma going out and twenty twenty two you take the Titanic to al ... and the first time around that and go so a lot better if I Want to take that and\nThen uh the lottery off of that but what would you do with a one point six billion dollars ... that's ... that's what I was thinking during the whole conversation is what would Michael heart with one point six billion\nBy a bigger but by the funny thing is about the lottery is that and he's seen our talked about this a couple of days ago 'cause we drove to Georgia epidemic of a lottery tickets just for fun it wouldn't really fundamentally change our lives I mean you know we would have\nBigger newer of what we already have ... and in that sense it doesn't make that much of an impact you know if we were to to you know hit it big like that one does the lottery or just I don't know some of the kind of great fortune\nWould come our way it'd be more of a matter of how can we impact the most people's lives I mean the first thing I Would do was be set up some kind of a tries to some kind of a foundation because you know the idea of you know a hundred dollars here at a hundred dollars there can be a significant life changed for some people do yeah so that's what I'd probably focus on how about you\n[noise] ah well I was a bit more selfish obviously I Do ah the typical things you know buy them on the house by the house by this that and the other but I think it'd be really cool to ah I'd I hired James uh because here's my thing is\nI heard that statistic I don't know if it's true I may have heard y'all talking about it actually when I was dying laughing when you were talking about

he can do\nIs an economic gamble and in that regard right there you know I have to kind of temper with that thought so again for me it's a matter of is this something which is just absolutely abominable to the lord or\nIs it something which is something that can be managed it's moderate it's temporary it's in frequent and it's something that's done purely for fun if you're playing the lottery for economic gain\nYou're ignorant you're ignorant but if you're playing the lottery be spending two dollars so that you can have the what if conversation\nAs opposed to dropping nine dollars at the McDonalds or wherever so that you can raise your cholesterol right without also another form of a risk [laughter] see I mean it all comes to my it's a matter of degree are you taking food out of your children's mouth to play the lottery that's ignorant and I think that's a portable lord however you got to two dollars a tragedy sofa\nWho cares you know that's my personal opinion\nBut even not taking it from an ethical perspective which I think ethics do have a lot to do with it but what do you think about this idea that because our ethics dictate this we're going to say that our state government is telling the people that because of the eight a subset a large subset group of people right of the Christian population Alabama a lot of people say it's a moral\nTherefore the government of Alabama should tell you not to do that is that in and of itself wrong because isn't that almost establishing a religion in that regard\nGovernment should never tell you to do anything no I agree I mean you know and and I know that sounds very libertarian on my part or perhaps it is you know you know Neil bortz used to say ... years ago that he was a little L libertarian so I guess to a degree we are as well the government doesn't really have the right to tell you to do anything but the funny thing is\nThe justification for Alabama economically speaking not having a lottery years ago was that if you had the Alabama lottery you have that opinion or people coming from\nYes the justification for Alabama economically speaking not having a lottery years ago\nWas that if you had the Alabama lottery you habit of penned or people coming from\n... Alabama and Georgia Mississippi in Tennessee to play in the lottery people aren't even Georgia playing the lottery in Alabama because they have their own lottery but that has changed with Powerball mega millions because those monies are dispersed across all the participating states\nSo now all of a sudden Alabama because it becomes a viable player you know because it doesn't matter what's bought in Alabama it's why it matters what's bought in the game that all the different states share mhm now with that said it also raises the issue of can we trust the politicians in the state of Alabama\nTo say that money wisely can I hold different conversation can you ever trust politicians in general absolutely not I just I ... I Know there's some good ones out there I have the greatest respect for Gary Palmer and several others as well but as the whole the chances of having a good\nHonest solid trustworthy politician the odds of that are exactly in my opinion the same I Would at one point six billion dollars in today's lottery drawing\nYou don't have to agree with Michael heart you can choose to be wrong if you were to its might go ...\nThursday here have this glass of water oh you don't drink tap water too much of a chemical taste for you you cook well thank you bathe in it but you don't drink it because of that

time do you do have to when you go to the Y. and check out our partners you can trust that you're doing business with a right to be people you can come if there's somebody you read that you don't see

[noise]\nSuperficial will want somebody why [noise]\nNow to me\nOr in a lot and no no and working for me\nI Wish I had a ... now and now a lot more um [noise] I Know about the\nIt can have [noise]\nSo we ask that question again because I think it's I think it's really valuable what people you know you understand\nYou know in in terms of a terms of entertainment 'cause you know what I told you you're during the break we were talking about\nReally valuable what people you know you understand you know in terms of a\nTerms of entertainment 'cause you know what I told you you know during the right we're talking about you know exactly we're talking on the air\nAnd you know she and I drove over and you know we we ate out a while we ate the car you know the dog is where the guys that were thrown out lottery tickets and we're watching this carnival of chaos go a little watching alone all are ... and we're driving back from Georgia and you know invest in three or four hours and this and\nYou know we're driving back and she looks at me 'cause that was just a lot of fun and I'm thinking you know something we just drop I don't know thirty forty dollars we ate out which we were going to do any way we spent Fifteen dollars on gas who cares you know but we were together we had so far and we did the ... thing\nAnd I'm thinking to myself okay we're probably not going to win you know what we just did is all we are going to get out of this\nAnd I could and I told you this you know there's a a local\nIndoor driving range here in Birmingham that will remain nameless 'cause I don't want to get in trouble\nThe last time I was there not only been once or twice with her we ate we had a couple a couple of beers with quite a little round a golfer and that cost me four or five times ... when I spent driving the Georgian back\nYou up you know so I mean I understand if somebody has you know a a moral opposition to it don't play it but you know that don't play it\nYou know and it doesn't deserve to be on the ballot probably ... or you know but that's just because if people want the opportunity to do it you have a right to drink you have a right to smoke you have a right to drive too fast you have a right to be stupid in America that's what the constitution does more than anything it protects our rights to be a bunch of da's if we want\nTo see that's what I was saying like that's what I was waiting to do you have the right to go to McDonalds eat McDonald's three times a day balloon up two or three hundred pounds and die of cardiac arrest\nYeah you got that right you have that freedom in America the government doesn't tell you you can't do that so why should the government tell you you have this money you can't spend it here but we're also listening to these politicians Alabama State legislatures that came and spoke\nAt my school they shall remain nameless because they're seeking reelection and they're probably going to get it\nBut this one guy who I didn't really like most of what he said it was a Republican or state congressman not a center and he came up and he said um he said so he talked about Medicare right I'm not saying I'm In favor of expanding Medicare\nBut he talked about how Medicare and what Walt Maddox is proposing is the great evil blah blah blah blah blah\nMedicare cost in his own estimate one hundred to a hundred and fifty million dollars\nAnd then he comes over here and he says oh now let's talk about the lottery the lottery is not good for the state of Alabama because you know we're not going to make that much with the lottery where only gonna make two hundred million dollars and I'm sitting there going congressman\nYou're saying we don't have enough money to fund a program that costs one hundred two hundred and fifty million dollars the first year expected returns from the lottery\nExpected ... not just rent revenue but profit from the lottery that the state could use two hundred million\nYou're telling me that two hundred million can't pay for a one hundred million dollar program I'm not good at math but I'm pretty sure two hundred million is more than a hundred million and asking that and he's like I Do not the same I was like okay that's\nYeah and then you start getting any of these idiotic debates about well you know if it's a vital artery it's it's a form of a you know socialize income redistribution\n[laughter] you know she has you know on top of\nAgain going back to the ... if you go and you buy your Big Mac guess what you've just engaged in income redistribution because you know the the redistribution of funds in that regard\nOf the cat was model a is what makes capitalism work you know it's it's not the redistribution it's the capture that's the issue\nBut you know when politicians come out the first thing they're going to say to an electorate if especially if there's a Republican electorate\nIt's not the redistribution it's the capture that's the issue\nBut you know when politicians come out the first thing they're going to say to an electorate if especially for the Republican electorate if they don't agree with it\nIs they're going to say that exactly what you said but they're going to phrase it went by saying is this redistribution because the electorate that's not going to look past their claims especially if you trust the politician was just gonna go at dam socialism and I don't agree with it and\nThe conversation's over yeah point you're not going to progress past that whereas if he said\nThe same it's a choice of like your economic choice to go and invest your money because you want the Big Mac you give your money you get the Big Mac and economics works or basic free market principles but nevertheless you hear redistribution and you're like some damn socialist again we're we're we're not going to have this\n... and ... and James when I've talked about that I talked about whatever critters I've ever had the whole world record producers but I think about it is it around is that there's this this thing in America as a ... and it's gotten particularly worse in recent years where we redefine words too many people do not know what the word socialism really ...\nThe server isn't the issue it's worth the servers being used for and that's the issue\nOn a on a AOL\nDot com that she has a private server\nWhether the server isn't the issue it's worth the servers being used for and that's the issue and and the case if you're speaking of Clinton she was transmitted ... sensitive data on a private server that's a whole lot different than communicating with bare [laughter] ...\nWell that well I Would like to see you know like she's a public official today oh let's see let's go now to make sure it is to make sure that she is a open and honest about\nIt but she has a plan for what you do for the state because she's sure and she's with\nUs well now that I Can't really argue with Rodney King and I read what they called so very much that's got to Brad ... Brett how are you\nDoing in Morrow ah from what I heard earlier you guys are saying that you believe that with a ... to make our own ... pretty much so that then you would agree with a legalizing all drugs\nThere's you know a lot of aspects you know it depends on the drugs themselves I'm not opposed legalizing marijuana me either\nYeah they have this is a solution to our border but we've been fighting this war on drugs or forty seven years have you seen the level of drug use go down in America\nI'm not an expert on drugs statistics or do you have a statistic you're going to point to is this like abate in question\nNo no I'm not trying to bite you got a pretty obvious we still have a major problem in America\nWell you know and it was kind of stop you there but you know it it kind of goes back to the gun debate you know the the guns themselves you know they're they're innocuous it's a matter of having a cultural breakdown for me\nThe whole drug abuse thing as a matter of a breakdown in culture to break down and they you know religious believes that the breakdown and civility it's a breakdown in common sense it's a breakdown in self awareness and self actual invasion\nMy moral code et cetera you know the drugs themselves you know they are they they serve a purpose in the case of pharmaceuticals for example\nBut it's the breakdown in society that I think is the larger issue in the case of guns you know it's a breakdown in the moral code that would prevent people from acting out in such a horrific way and so those are the issues that we don't ever seem to contend with I'm going to bring you a pope and Michael is where\nI think the the common sense ... politicians are just off road so\nWell you know it's just like Nancy Reagan war on drugs is a dismal failure [laughter]\nYeah it's a failure if it's like twenty billion dollars go to the theater every year twenty billion right and the fact that you know the drug cartel makes a hundred billion a year\nWell there's a big difference though that you know between the the debate about recreational use of some form of drugs and the distribution of pharmaceuticals and that's where we are going to part ways because you know you do have too many communities where that's introduced to those communities\nYou know oftentimes it's given out for free for the purposes of getting people hooked in addicted you know so the drug debate you can't you cannot compartmentalize into one particular issue it's a very broad and unwieldy debate\nAnd so when you start talking about distribution and the infiltration of drugs into certain communities for the purposes of profit that's a whole different ballgame\nMayer says yes bears says yes bread I appreciate the call so very much and so you can't you can't you can't have this you know this this blanket response to everything yeah and like in the case of pharmaceuticals if somebody has got some Xanax over there that are prescribed for them and I'm selling them to you know no no no no you don't I don't have that right you don't have that\nWell that's something ... and that's the same thing that happened on my program I was basically called ...\nEver there that are prescribed for them and I saw it on to you know in a ... you know I don't have that right you don't have that right well that's something ... that's\nThe same thing that happened on my program I was basically called a hypocrite because he said so you you believe that you should be able to do whatever you want\nBut when it comes a lottery I'm like I Believe you should be able to invest your money based off of capitalistic principles free market principles where you please that's my stance I don't think you should be able to do whatever you want that to an artist I Believe that you ... you have the right to choose where you invest your money right you have certain liberties that are that cannot be taken from you\nAnd he said so you think people have the right to kill other people I'm like that's the biggest\n... is also the lid on already I've ever heard yeah it's a complete non argument and and and and you know you you look at the founding the founding of America\nYeah when you spend two dollars in a lottery ticket ... you are risking what two dollars two dollars ... what can you buy with two dollar win a lottery ticket when John Hancock put paper to pen where did he risk like life you know\nAnd if people think for one moment that the signs of that document\nThat's one of the reasons in an unknown America I just explode the myth of all the guys getting together in one big room with her powdered wigs for the purposes assigning the declaration of independence yeah\nIf that had been announced and the town square that was about to go down every one of them would have been slaughtered in that room ... there's a reason the weeks and months perhaps the sign that document 'cause it was real cloak and dagger stuff because they were signing\nThey weren't gambling all their lives in them\nAnd not only that there was heated and it's what a lot of people don't understand they think like people just came together the constitution was written yeah we're all rallying around it like you said it was cloak and dagger there were also people that didn't agree there were a lot of ... percent of the nation yeah and there were a lot of founding fathers that said we don't need to put the bill of rights in the constitution it does not need to be in the ...\nOriginally it wasn't they are exactly\nAnd so when it was proposed a lot of people were saying it doesn't need to be there and there was a large faction that was saying we don't need it thank God we have it now who knows where we'd be if we didn't have that but nevertheless it never is this happy go lucky let stand around in a in a circle right and let's let's all just sing kumbaya on signed the document and\nWell you know even it goes back to the federalist papers now we know the three guys all through the federalist papers but how do they sign them\nWhen they were originally published how are they sign ... why because they were going to die if they got caught yep yep and I just don't think enough\nPeople really realize that the whole concept behind the origins of America was a massive gamble mhm they gamble do they could beat the red coach they gamble the X amount of Americans would come to their side thirty percent of the of the the college thirty percent\nWere behind the country mhm thirty percent were loyalist to the crown\nAnd the Romanian people were you know the lack of noodles out there that they got a clue in the world because they have their own idiots back on that day and time to that we're going to wait and see what fly there we're going to salute based upon who want\nIt's funny because conservatives say they cling to the values that are in the constitution but a lot of and and I think they do a lot of times but then you have some conservatives especially and we're going to bring this full circle at the lottery that says the lottery shouldn't be a thing because my religious moral principles right and then you look back at those days why did they come here\nThey were fleeing religious persecution they were fleeing a ... they had a moral obligation to come over here and say look we think everybody should make their own choices\nWe don't think we should be required to follow a certain religion that is being dictated us through the church of England so we are going to come over here and that was one of the main reasons they came to this country nevertheless we are now saying our religion should decide what you do which is completely contradictory to the founding fathers argument well I heard you\nThe main reasons they came to this country nevertheless we are now saying our religion should decide what you do which is completely contradictory to the founding fathers argument\nWell I heard you and the way and this morning talking about the damn Barry Baptist yeah at ... and coined the term wall of separation yeah\nWhen he was speaking about this wall of separation he wasn't saying the government shouldn't form religion he was saying government shouldn't even acknowledge yup that it had that that government as an entity ... that the main function of it was to protect the functionality\nOf the nation you know here in ... and a big part of it was to keep the columnist from killing each other over commerce yup\nAnd I think it is just enshrined because everybody points to what you're saying where it says ahead you were a wall of separation between the garden of church in the wilderness of the world\nThat's the phraseology that you're pointing to but I think everybody overlooks part and I think it's summed up so eloquently by Jefferson when he says believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God\nThat he owes account to none other for his fate or his worship that legitimate powers of government reach actions only and not opinions I think he sums it up perfectly in eloquently there\nIs an action that protects the people in certain respects but it should not touch your opinion\nThis this sounds like just kind of a grammatical wordplay significant and historian Shelby Foote pointed this out some years ago prior to the civil war it was grammatically correct to say ... the United states are\nYeah it was after the civil war that it became the United states is well it's because we were multiple segment we were amalgamation of different communities and it wasn't always design that we would be in a ... of community and they give us as being very tribal yeah in terms of our individual holidays and our states\nAnd the federal government's role was it in nothing more than the Cape foreign desk bits from attacking the land and again keeping a columnist from killing each other primarily over trade outside of that the government serve no real purpose most specially in the formation of any kind of religious thought we'll be right back\nSaving this tribute Michael has his doodles it's a good day on superficial one oh one WIP\nThe following it does not necessarily reflect
