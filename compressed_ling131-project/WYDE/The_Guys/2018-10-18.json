it's racist\nBut if we agree with this idea do you agree with the idea that we're all part of the human race in this difference of melanin levels whole heartedly boulders several years now he okay I

gotta let it go I I just can't I mean I must\nI must stay about stupidity wherever I see it [noise]\nOkay um well go back to a more modern movies princes broad yeah good point Wesley yeah true love true love and that kept him alive the whole time even\nThrough the end of this ah he's mostly debt that's right ... to ... you know who's means to block to block\nAre you a miracle next I don't know do you mind [laughter] but uh but\nWhen he finally gets in the castle and she sees them she starts kissing them and all that hold true love gifts and all that right in his legs start work and of course you know the magical pills right max probably helped a little mutt well let's go to a chocolate well yeah 'cause it goes down that's right yeah yeah\nThis this is what people in this country are worried about today mhm and they I've seen them you know you've got delta and Lincoln\nNot to be confused with the cousins continental in America yeah that distant cousin ... but um you know you look at this ... and you take what what are you planting and the heads of these young girls\n[noise] [noise] I don't know I I I really don't I mean 'cause we\nI mean what's your plan is to be suspicious of every young man\nYeah it is and we told the kid when we lived in Alaska you know don't take any cramped from anybody right ... you know it's a stand up for yourself and stuff like that and she did one day and we were very proud of her even though we got called the school about but\nTeacher daughters to stay in the ... teacher taught us how to protect themselves and stuff like that but\nAre proud of her even though we get called at school about my\nTeacher daughters to stay in a ... teacher taught us how to protect themselves and stuff like that but if every little boy out there it's taught ... you're not allowed to go on for the kids are not allowed to kiss on gee you're not allowed to kiss on the ham there can be some sand people around yeah 'cause no one's going to know what to do\nNo ... they're rewriting the rule book\nBut then again today that politically speaking to them but if this trend keeps up in a generation from now we're going around people\nWell if the the feminist who don't need no man that's right and if everyone can pick their own gender which means there's nobody getting married for procreation use then hey wipe the slate clean their wanna uh-huh want to let the animals\nThat go well you know last night 'cause I was bored beyond tears I watch for the four hundred and Seventy of time kings of the secret service races oh it is a great movie and you know the whole pretense of it is is that you know the the earth has a virus and we have to call the population and by taking out those that are not contributing to society\n\nI'm starting to get down with that I realized the movie was kind of tongue in cheek\nYeah but you know you you look at stuff like this and you just starting to say wow there really aren't that many people out there to the point where we are taking some of the most in the system and Dylan as a valid point some of these things they have some adult innuendo woven into them very often times that was the animators and the creators way of being a little\nYou know ... and trying to make some kind of a political point but at the end of the day\nFor the most part most of these ah you know these animated features protect me from Disney were quite quite charming but now if you go through some of them all through I mean every single one of them and you really begin to to to be able to tear some of these things down and they're fundamental\nTo some of the you know the growth and the growing and the learning experience as so many of these young kids so over here we've got it it's it's abhorrent for the the prince ticket Snow White but over here\nLet's go trick or treating and accept that apple from somebody we should make seven an apple from dressed as a sexy none\nWhat message are we sending to these young people\nAnd they wonder why so many people are on mood disorder drugs\nYeah yeah so I maybe it's a conspiracy for the manufacturers of I don't know Prozac or ... or Xanax or whatever\nIt's a societal in K. ultra experiment oh yeah there you go All right let's just get out of the phones I'm tired of talking about Hey Mike what's up\nMore than ... born in\nA mock at ya a video and messenger a lot about this shift job may have seen it but there's this guy going around on the Internet\nHe's on the left talking about it and it's got a pitcher of Maxine Waters on the right and he's just basically saying you know look I don't know how I got there I\nDon't know who took me I'm not sure what your was but it was about twenty five years ago I was the last ... water rally and I was ... years old and she and the kids on the cheap you you are and how did you ever from issue\nAnd I think there needs to be an FBI investigation he's trying to do and all that stuff that's hilarious\nWell I have a little Facebook right in the last day or so but I'll I'll definitely check it out because it really it it's gotten into me just remarkably silly and I don't understand what the motivation of it is any longer I'm just fed up with it\nOh I Am\nGotten into me just remarkably silly and I don't understand what the motivation of it is any longer I'm just fed up with it\nOh I Am and it's not going to quit any uh but no it's not you know they get what they want to know\nAnd I have no idea what they want and quite frankly Mike I don't think they have any idea what they want\nRight now but I think they just drive on the drama and just open it hit somewhere\nYeah yeah no I think you're on to something I Do I like to go\nNext to Mike operation which also very much and let's get dusted in here hey Dustin how are you\nI'm good how are you good so it's no wide okay or not okay but the isn't there a movie like print that's on the frog or something where the girl kisses a frog\nIn turn into a prayer yeah good point yeah okay\nSo it's not okay for God to get the girl hoping to save her life but it cold just to go out and start kissing all frogs\nYeah but see that in in defense of that though from the perspective of the left there's a lot of women out there and you know this is true dust and there's a lot of women out there that they they get attached to a man they start a relationship because they're just they're positive as you just by the fact he's got some issues I can change him\nAnd so you have this underlying cultural message for women they go out and find yourself an old jalopy of a male and just rebuild even from the ground up\nYeah but they all that and I know figured this out that it doesn't work well in that have been trying to do that for\nAny woman is married has figured that out [laughter]\nIt takes longer than the first year 'cause I think my wife is still get it and at the college try\nIt will never end Dustin it'd be delusional\nBanks like bank you'd have some yeah don't get me started on that that's a good point bringing up that movie\nNo it is it is and and you can you can slice and dice almost every single movie that's out there because you know something else and and this is going to sound kind of weird\nMembers had said anyway I don't think a lot of people understand that I talked about this briefly in the past about when a man and we kinda lost isn't in recent years but that that that very first time\nThat any man calls that girl because you just used to be a total recall and asked for a date the trepidation the trepidation of dialing the phone the trepidation of when you dial the phone she answers and you hang up or worse that answers and you hang up the trepidation of do like his or do I not kiss or you know just that that that\nI just I don't want to go off and was love on you but you kinda lose that thing and and it's a coming of age thing and it's you know where people find their their social or their relationship footing and it also teaches women in my opinion\nTo set their boundaries and to you know to to to telegraph properly what their intentions are although going back to death since ... we never figure it out either\nBut at the end of the day why does everything have to have some kind of you know cultural reference or our cultural backlash why why are we why are we so\nInsistence insistent upon just stripping away all of his innocence\nWell then you look at it she's bringing up Snow White and stories like that will ... has she brought up the Little Mermaid to them 'cause ... she goes and finds it for all intents and purposes a plastic surgeon to change her appearance so Eric will like or\nWhat about the fact that she was living with seven all white guys\nWith the exception of Dumbo who was you know he was the token liberal uh dopey dopey I'm Sorry what is it W. an elephant SARS in general you know number one but yeah you're right so you're not thinking about you know she's she's there in the little the little\nDoping arms or whatever the w._b. dolphins or in general you know number one but yeah you're right so you're not thinking about you know she's she's there in the little the little you know communal living yeah yeah the little token you know inspired little hobbit ... lived there him all\nHanging out together ... ... dogs and cats living together you know\n[noise]\nI've been when there's ... and a half hours just ruining every Disney film for every body I'm all for it I mean but will it\n[noise] you know\nOh I don't get me started on those stores are [noise]\nYeah I mean you're my o Marta Josh ... she came out washers free throw mhm\nI like where\nYou're just ... yeah and while we're talking about ... I mean what what about what about ... um you know dressing up Barbara eating and the genie costume where she was she saw him in the Bible am or his ... asked to do his bidding [noise]\nBeaver that you know\nThat you know cleaver that is clarify that but you know I I just I Can't help but wonder what it is a you know that people are thinking in situations like this and if you've got a problem with Snow White didn't just don't read the story\nBut don't use it as some kind of a cultural experiment with\nLincoln and delta\nDoes she ever heard the song delta dawn [laughter] hello [laughter]\nWhat a delta applying for ... uh was in a Coca Cola ... neither\nGood grief and it's good to I hid will have on line for here at a baby it's a boy so hey Adam baby what's up\n\n[noise] you there\nOkay we'll get rid of him and go to Derrick however Derek how are you\nA good lawyer Michael Moore them or is it fair to say that we've\nGot a a population that ... lining now\nIt's been going on in a while but it's definitely raised a fever pitch\nAs well so\nIt's going to get where boys can even look at girls the wrong way and you don't want to reproduce they do it I mean I don't understand what the problem is if I hadn't had just gone in for that first guest I wouldn't be married to my wife now\nHello that's kind of the way it's worked for millennia\nYeah I mean it does a little a little liquor and that first kiss and there you go [laughter]\n[laughter] I give her Dagan they're there [laughter]\n[noise] oh yeah I hear your bedroom ever in a ... by by my gosh [noise]\nInstead of every ... every marriage begins with ... liquor\nWell let's let's talk about getting on your knee let's talk let's talk about you know courting women let's talk about all the things that we have as men done you know we want to teach young boys to be gentleman obviously\nBut you know on the other hand\nA kiss is you know I don't know it's one of the most innocent expressions between two people\nBut then again I Do remember back when I was young or when I'm typing or off that back when I was young I had one of my uh ministers of music do a seminar sermon if your way out to a group of ... of students at the church about\nHand holding on and and it was like a gateway and I'm Serious about this and I'm going really\nI ride the bus I mean what are you talking about [laughter]\n[noise]\nWell look at it uh what was it um back and the\nEighteenth century binding the practice of binding the girl what's been the ... yeah or the boy would spend the night over here and they stitch I'm up in a sack mhm and hopefully you could so very well to keep them in the sec yep so to speak yeah\nSometimes they put a bundling board between them now is a form of courting yes it was yes it was on the idea was that young man and one one\nSometimes they put a bundling board between them now is a form of courting yes it was yes it was on the idea was that young man and one one up for me young men and young women woman would spend the night together in a bad in a non physical sense\nFor the purposes of getting to know one another typically this took place in the home of the young lady\nIt was an experiment that was not necessarily successful depending on your point of view as in colonial times up to thirty percent of young girls that got married\n... brewer or with child at the altar\nBut at least you know\nThey were trying to be a\nCordial about it and I'll just be polite and leaving there\nBut this this this situation where you know I won't say that I've gotten a little bit uneasy about being around women but it's definitely something to kind of think lingers in some people's minds now\nBecause I started because you know whenever I Walk into the building asking you do the same thing if there happens to be a woman in your basic um in your trail so to speak walking behind you\nYou and I both until it probably does it to we our door openers I've always been that way I Will not walk a heck I'll do it for a man from for that matter but typically well I'll do it for you you've done it for me\nIt's just manners but are we not gonna have to be even suspicious of that where the the most innocent of gesture is now met with contempt curiosity and the potential for guilt\n\nWhat would that how would they spin the door opening I don't know\nI guess the only I guess we're going to have to have a new law in America we're all doors are revolving\nWell and I know because then somebody would end up blocking one side and you know doing assassination\nYeah ah yeah you're right I think we got out of baby after baby back from a wine is good it was called with like a real quick break I add a baby what's up\nHey I'm On the Christian Bale thing it's not about my line Scott than herself as a man to legally get in the army and then make in the general make the boasting\nOh and then there's that no she can't be upset 'cause that's just a woman using her proud to get ahead from a I'm a male dominated culture\nYeah but now she's sitting there making that guy like I almost sexual wander around have feelings or this yeah well that fits right oh what a general\nThank goodness was like oh\nYeah a good point I Am taking you to think of it for him\n[noise] I Know yeah\nBut these are the kind of girls delta and Lincoln that are going to grow up Twenty years from now and parade through
