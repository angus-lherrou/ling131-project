[laughter]\n[laughter] and then ah you know I I never talk to to their or at them\nI talk about things that we have to do together and ah you know if I don't understand something that you know maybe a if it's black guy on and tell them to slow down the bar that's a that's a joke I was just kidding but uh [laughter] and uh you know he tells me I'll stop talking about cracker but\nYeah we get pretty ah\nAh not means the playful when you're out in the middle of the water for you know you're three hundred miles out and ain't nothing but you know I I I in fact I got a decade managed twenty something that can and they brought some new stuff to the ship\nLifetime how I'm going to be these fire walls into the company's computers and I'm getting a lot more information\nAnd being able to get on the Internet a lot more I don't have to go to the library so often but I he I think I'm going to keep him for a little while\nHe's my favorite little debt can I anyway the um when you brought that up to ... those people that think that way they're very limited and scope\nOf outside relationships of their own race of their own people\nYou know even even when you have somebody on family that's married to another race it's uh it can be difficult but you do not handled them as a generality\nSo to speak specifically\nKicked card to easy easy for playing easy and Nineteen or twenty twenty eight so maybe you know that's what he's looking for trying to keep himself marketed and that's what he's doing when I first saw I'm wrong come off of a a SNL\nHe was saying and ... and they were picking on me they were getting on me about my ... and I'm Wondering what is he doing is trying to just you know make sure he's not going to go back over again to be there because of the ... the people behind them seemed a little on edge mhm and they may have a you know give them in a hard time\nTo be there because of the ... the people behind them seemed a little on edge mhm and they may have a you know give them in a hard time a liking trumping all then all of a sudden a later in the day\nWhat you're talking about right now is brought up and I got the second obviously what he was doing during a SNL get\nThat wasn't played on the original he what he was doing was lining up with some sympathy he wanted to be in that mode so that when he did project and marketing can ... campaign this idea of the thirteenth amendment\nHe wouldn't be assaulted as and really by anyone who is gauging with him ... and uh you know of course when they were questioning or my ... I only caught part of it was on the news\nAnd of course you know we get digital out here so\nI got part of the news and he said a ... well but you know after he was confronted let's just to have a conversation about it ... well ... ... if you want to have a conversation\nWell informed about that conversation so it doesn't end on a one sentence and then all of a sudden you have to think up something else that you need to market yourself with and that's what he's doing ... he's basically self promoting\nAnd self marketing himself\nAnd ah and also the family is married to get a little bit of extra on it to they're going to go there what's your old man saying about\nAll this and uh but I I don't find him or anything but\nSelf promoting self ran dies in a narcissistic and or if you ah ever want a movie about Democrats and that's what he is he's he's he's\nReally just a Democrat 'cause he still thinks like one but the ... you ever see a movie called the mission adventures of that doesn't go ahead no yeah if you ... it's not easy to find to be on the Internet I I mean\nBut a a big ... big stars are in it but you've got to watch it you'll never want to come back to reality\nNow when and\nWhen you're talking about\nEasy in the way he produced this and it was produced ... he he ... he had it well thought out until people actually started asking them questions about it and that's when they came up with let's just start the conversation which tells me\nEvery time somebody starts conversation orange joins in the conversation it's about ... easy [laughter]\nI was eating this conversation going for the next thirty minutes if he'll just say easy every thirty second century [laughter]\n'cause it's all the whole thing is about him\nAnd uh you know in Alabama here it was I was ten twelve years ago we dealt with this there came the amendment through the ACLU we were having the chain gangs and we were ah they were working the highways and everything and then uh it all broke out we weren't supposed to be working them use the thirteenth amendment we got all that cleared up and\nUh now it's just a voluntary and of course uh you get paid\nIn some circumstances so and I don't know a whole lot about it so I don't know is that part I'm just\nI you know it hurts me to the quick really Baylor\nI agree and brother were about the run up on out of here I appreciate you Henry\nOh well I guess I'd better go to our\nYou have to look at the facts and situation you have to educate yourself on the situation because if you don't then again you're just you're falling prey to people who want to see you remain ignorant\nIt it it's true because when you remain ignorant it's easier it's a lot easier for politicians to be able to get that vote right that's what they're going for it they want your boats and it's a lot easier for politicians to get your vote when\nYou remain in that same mindset you weren't before but I Do want to bring up a point that Henry talked about and I know this is going to get this may get Dylan riled up I don't know 'cause there are certain things that get Dylan upset and I feel like this is definitely one of them um because it just seems rather silly to me\nBut ah ah William brought up this idea of affirmative action [noise]\nMan affirmative action is essentially you know there aren't enough the government dictates there aren't enough minorities in this job or a business or a business group dictates there's not enough minorities in this job whether that be a a minority I'm having to do with race or whether it's\nBarbara business or a business group dictates there's not enough minorities in his job whether that be a a minority I'm having to do with race or whether it's having to do with gender but I'm just a little confused because I thought the left the gender was on the spectrum so gender is on the spectrum how can you then have\nA mine ... somebody that's disenfranchised there especially if it's on the spectrum and it's fluid and a state where I can change back and forth so if I Want a job can I apply as a woman if I Would like to get that affirmative action\nAs a man it's just it it's a very confusing process but nevertheless is this idea that if you're a minority sometimes you will be put into this job if they if the government dictator if a business group dictates they need more minorities in that field to to make it quote unquote equal\nUm I don't think that's how hiring supposed to work in a private business I think in a private business you're supposed to hire people based on their qualifications\nNow if they have the same qualifications and I mean the argument can be made and I can see the argument um\nBut nevertheless I think that it has gone above and beyond that simple practice and it's been simply inserting people into positions um where sometimes there are people that are more qualified for that position that just don't fit the description of the skin color that the government is looking for which is just\nAbhorrent like I like I could get on board if you were saying look there's some here's somebody from a lower income community\nAnd it it has nothing to do with the race but they come from a lower socioeconomic background and they didn't have as much opportunity right they didn't have the ability for their parents send them to an Ivy League school or something like that we would like to give them the opportunity to work here\nAnd that's something I could potentially go for it but just saying\nHey you're white you get this job or hey you're black so you get this job\nIs that really what you want to be defined by\nLike if somebody said look you've got this job because you were white I'd be sitting there going what the I don't I don't want it then\nI I Want to be hired based on me I Want to I mean it goes back to the community discussion we had earlier I don't want to be judged based on it was something that is quite literally skin deep I Want to be judged on my self I Want to be judged on the way I act the way I carry myself my qualifications but\nI'm not and so there's this idea of affirmative action this all takes place in the United states so here's what's going to get Dylan round up as\nThis is breaking news I'm In this came out of California came out of California yesterday at the beginning of the week and it said breaking\nCalifornia has become the first US state to require publicly traded companies to include at least one woman on their boards of directors according to the LA Times so this is government specifically\nGoing into private businesses and saying look private businesses doesn't matter how your board is structured now\nDoesn't matter if you're hiring doesn't matter if somebody else as it is more qualified for this position you've got to have a woman on your board no ... oh I'm Sorry what was that very that's nonsense Oh thank you very so doing\nWhat do you think about this because this seems like I I can usually tell when something's going to get you riled up and I feel like this could be something potentially what do you think I'm just I'm honestly curious\nIt's dumb [laughter] corporations\nShould not have a ham and government government shouldn't control corporations to that level yeah I ... as far as preventing them from becoming a monopoly I wholeheartedly agree I agree with that I agree too because that's bad for the consumer\nCorrect [noise] those are bad for the economy or that too\nAgree with that I agree too because that's bad for the consumer correct [noise] those are bad for the economy or that too\nBut I [noise] I'm just kind of glossed over that because of something else that I found out about yesterday that's going on elsewhere in the country okay All right oh hit me with it we're going somewhere else tell me\nA New Hampshire\nA law that got sign in the past so God stuff happens in New Hampshire or I'm guessing you didn't see the video that I shared yesterday uh no I did not I was on social media much yesterday I did not stop yesterday to jobs Eighteen hours classes\nGotcha a that's a video that I found from now that is that it's actually just saying what happened in this one\nDidn't of course now this not putting out a political video I'm shocked bald obviously there is some political opinion and that but it's not like the ... super wing that they'd have become lately the Democratic socialists\nYeah I'm basically it was it started out with this one guy interviewing the governor about a bill that was going through the house at the time\nAnd that would require\nOuter state college students to pay a large amount of money to be able to vote\nOkay that seems like a poll tax bad\nA very large for anyone who was not born in the state basically uh the governor said that he is totally against that there is no way that he would ever vote for it well come to find out it pass the house and he signed it into law\nSo now there's a giant poll tax which is illegal [laughter] in the state of New Hampshire that law get struck down so quick it'll go to the courts the course of rectify it I I I'm not worried about that\nIs disgusting absolutely the fact that look I get it somebody comes in to your state and you're not wanting them to play a role in the political process because they weren't born there that like I can see the argument to be made there but listen I'm not from the state\nI've come in they should I not be able to vote in the state of Alabama\nHonestly I Would ... I Am one hundred percent certain\nThat I Know far more about Alabama politics than half of the people\nAt Stanford University I'm One hundred percent confident I can even boost that number up to Seventy potentially Ninety percent I'm saying I Know more about Alabama politics in the inner workings there and then I I'd say probably Ninety percent of the population at Stanford University should I not be able to vote should there be a poll tax on me\nJust because the fact that I was born in the state of Tennessee even though I'm now lives in Alabama for three years\nIt just it it's it's an asinine asinine proposal that has no basis whatsoever\nAnd it's honestly just disgusting like\nAllow people if you're a United States citizen and you're living in an area and you're able to educate yourself on the issues\nYou should be allowed to vote there let me let me make this ... you should have to have an id from that area right so if I Want to vote in the state of Alabama I Do think I should have to have an Alabama driver's license or something like that\nWe are at least be able to show that you've lived here for a I think it's a minimum and six months\nCorrect and see that is not a poll tax specifically in the state of Alabama\nBecause you can get free identification anywhere in the state of Alabama it was just it it's a new thing that was just ...\nThat is not a poll tax specifically in the state of Alabama because you can get free identification anywhere in the state of Alabama it was just it it's a new thing that was just passed because\nIf you want to require voter ID laws the main argument against voter ID laws is there discriminatory why people say it's a poll tax and people have lower income communities that they won't pay and therefore people lower income communities won't get out and vote\nJust it's an argument that makes sense that thing about it you have to have an id to vote\nIf that law let's just say that's why you have to have an id to vote\nYou tell somebody in a poor community um that they have to go pay ten dollars for an ID\nTo go vote and they're thinking I could spend this ten dollars an identification card that I'm only going to use this one time to go vote or I'm going to spend this ten dollars on food and accommodations for my children\nYou're going to choose the food and accommodations for the children every single time so it's going to the the idea was that was going to disenfranchise in this incentivize\nPeople at a lower income communities to vote and that's a hundred percent correct\nBut when you take away that idea right when you take away the fact that IDs cost\nAnd not only can you get them in a physical location but you can get them online for free it's no longer a poll tax\nIs this really goes the issue of voter ID laws more than anything I think\nAnd I think we're seeing a big trend because I'm I'm so glad we've gotten to this point in this country honestly like I Know we we we say we have a lot of qualms with this this is a big deal because not only will just cut down on illegal immigrants voting right\nHe's a democratic socialist so unfortunately it wasn't meant to be and I let her Down Easy with a few kind words and an economics textbooks [noise]\nWe've gentleman those joke drawl where a lot of on this morning ... he'll have a great show coming up or well I don't know I haven't seen it but ... says always been more was [noise]\n\nA reward ... do we want to hear your mom and [noise] do you do ...

with George step on the populous\nAnd he was gone through a whole list of what he's fixing to do the Trump along now that he said that it already sued\nA Jew under Democrats and he joined in a lawsuit to to get Trump on that deal ... get making fun money you know all that I forgot the fancy name for ... and then uh he's going to add that the Republicans have held no\nInvestigations and you got to listen to it it's not very long you've got to listen to that you have to step out\nFrom reality just for a minute Michael dude me this small favor\nJust a small bit Michael\nBut you will find it in treating to no end\nOf the mindset or it is you know I I ... when you talk with me I'm generalizing the Democrat Party ... that no Democrat has the same as another Sunday we all have they all have different\nAttitudes and and so and so so you know I gave it that but now I was the point where you know if your sports Democrats you're supporting that's out of\nReality business which have it on and everything that's come before and surely that will come after the ... and I was thinking again sadly under par for the you\nKnow we are living in a time that is reminiscent so the Democrats ... ... did not care about destroying legislation\nTo keep slavery remember that I mean not remember you know from history that they fought to and created a civil war just keep slavery they were the party of slavery and the Eighteenth for the for the Republican Party was born to\nBe the anti slavery party and that's where less than ten years we end up with you know a war\nAnd now we're finding it and they're treating a Trump like they treated Abraham Lincoln\nAnd there's so many qualities in the history that all so intuitive ... of what we're going through today even you couldn't even say in the Eighteen sixties the fight was ... there was this fight cultural fight to keep slavery and then you know do a you got\nEven you couldn't even say in the Eighteen sixties the fight was there was this fight cultural fight to keep slavery and then you know to uh you go to the Nineteen sixties and there was another cultural site\nTo deal with a war that didn't want to fight against like minded people know that's what it was about or the sixties they didn't want to destroy communism\n'cause that's what they are ... they're the progressive than the progressive agenda is all that matters so have you gotten even caught me out there and all these other people that are stepping outside and speaking on her own but they're not\nA wanted do not enter the tax food being or having a different message other than the Democrats message\nAnd that is big government ... basically and power to ... to have it to consume and use it against the people Dodgers runner and they would be a ... that that was from Sunday with with a drug step on the populous\nAnd you'd be surprised he I think he gave a couple of little secrets away Michael that you would be interested in\nAnd uh if you get to listen to it I\nShould amend re I've been I've been following the Democratic party for two decades now I mean I Am written about and I've done op dads about it and blog posts about it I mean I'm not arguing with you about it but you know we we've known what their stick was for the last hundred years\nYeah right I mean Nineteen what twenty four they brought back the KKK and there were much draw the first movie ever play in Washington\nWasn't money for it was it was much older than that but either way\nYeah well I I was gonna say with Woodrow Wilson in there it was a lot better uh it was a lot more managed for the\nThe ... plan to be in there anyway would you mind watching that then 'cause I think you're going to find out something that you haven't heard before and I should have wrote it down but my memory until I could rely on it well you know how that goes\nWhen I Do in reality she had to go\nTo the wonderful day\nDue to let's get William quick hello William how are you\nGood morning God treachery where I'm at Athens, Georgia\nThere you go hey baby there you go\nHey hey we were driving for mammals going for a man we're going to be a rematch I feel I feel like we're thinking all the way\nHey here's ... one Brett Kavanaugh sounds like it sounds like a choir boy parents from our forefathers like Franklin and some of those guys like you've you've talked about on your on your show they're probably budget tracked into ... standing around writing right up to ... you\nKnow oh yeah\nYou know say I you know bringing stuff like that Thirty years old\nIt's a they got nothing else on this guy and and they're just looking for anything and everything to you brought up I had read I recently read this thing about you you brought up this morning by Dianne Feinstein possibly looking at charge what kinda what charges are earning ... movements office or\nOr is it most likely if anything are just if anything came down at all against\nHer would probably be along the lines of some kind of censorship from the Senate themselves what'd you know what what uh sensual and possibly even removal from the committee you're not talking about being ousted from the Senate that's just not going to happen\nOkay I I was hoping she might be facing criminal charges you know Mike they they need to make an example some people\nSt James does this in the military sent back you have to make an example of somebody there to get ranked guys back in back in the white space in the military ...\nHe's actually in the process of being busy oh okay well\nThank God\nHe's actually in the process of being busy\nOh okay well you know somebody and and I understood it will charge or you\nKnow we ... we would have to do you know a much more of an investigation to determine whether or not she changed evidence did you pay for the attorneys for this Christine Ford did for the you know receive you know um undo coaching ... in a legal sense ... by the attorneys would not be unusual\nBut you know the the issue is how much of a how much did the fines dean's office ... office actually know whipping up into this and what role do they play in terms of paying off the attorneys the progress to did she tampered with evidence that's the only potential criminality here\nCan we not look at that and say hey you know he is obviously struck a nerve he is obviously struck a chord he is obviously up ended the system he's obviously frightened people so why again what do we expect anything differently\n\nIf you think about it from that perspective for just a moment he is being successful in the swamp draining\n\nBecause that's exactly how you would expect this pack of animals as you point out to act under this set of circumstances\n\nAnd we're going to get deeper and deeper into this you know something else is interesting and we ... we touched on this briefly yesterday but this Christine Ford no matter\nHow this ends her life is ruined\nShe has no idea what Pandora's box she has opened here now this is completely one hundred percent unsubstantiated but there have been some media reports out there\nThat have claimed in scouting Ford's previous Facebook post that during the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch\nShe suggested on Facebook that somebody should come out and claim sexual assault against Gorsuch not that she would do it but that quote somebody\nShould do it now many posts from the past have been eliminated from Facebook pages and the fish were paid itself no longer exists now in the previous four\nSo is it possible for us to ah substantiate the veracity of that claim but you know from a forensic perspective\nIf that could be discovered wow mhm mhm and then yesterday Megan\nStep mom Jody surprised us what's it called prize disgraced us for the call\nShe understands the forensic aspect of this year was a crime scene investigator she herself would be the kind of person that is Mitchell was\nRaising the question of why Christine Ford would not want to have a testified in front of her or assaulted her her tormentor\n\nKavanaugh was all about the testifying in front of a in front of Ford and confronting her on the allegations which would have taken place in a court of law and people say well this is not a court of law but then again by extension what to legislate tours do\nMake law make law so it is a law crafting body so why in the world would we think they would be any less up to speed\nOn the protocol\nWell some of them do need to know what the definition of is is as well you got that\nYeah\nWell you know we keep hearing about this blue wave about how the Democrats are a common what else from history was blue\nNever mind some just enough [laughter] [noise]\n[noise] ah\nYeah [laughter]\n...\nAnd I want to go home and watching it [laughter] was Porky's too [laughter]\nUh\nAnd I don't want to go home and watching it [laughter] while Porky's too [laughter] oh yeah yeah\nI've seen at the end of Porky's one in the school bus where what was the character's name Pete we yeah that was Brett Kavanaugh for me\n\nAs he as he as he grabs the young lady by the back of the blouse and polls are down past the window\nNow he'd be the one given the the Pearl Harbor speech you had a house in ... is our yeah a\nTrump fired back at a several specific Democrats on the Senate Judiciary committee who aggressively question Kavanaugh have took aim at a Senator Richard Blumenthal who battled accusations during his two thousand and ten Senate race that he falsely claimed to have served in\nVietnam you wanted to call one of his witnesses but no one could locate Forrest Gump at the time\nTrump right on the ad and now is that they're talking like he's holier than thou\n\nDrop also singled out or Cory Booker who once wrote a newspaper column admitting to a groping a friend or without her consent in high school\n... then referred to those statements about what Booker was doing in school saying I took a look at Cory Booker and now he's talking about time at all\n[noise] bookers office uh recently push tobacco and criticism ever that column noting that it was meant to condemn a culture that encourages young men to take advantage of women\n\nThat's like you know you see these ah TV things every once in a while but like they are the CIA or the FBI or law enforcement will hire a pick pocket to teach them how pick pockets operate\nOr how slim plan man operate con men so that Cory Booker is writing op dead about groping women from the perspective of somebody that groups of women\nGod I Love politics\nYou must really I mean you know we've talked often times about people that need a you know the the re introduction of literacy test for voting in this country which I'm opposed to\nBut I'm starting to think there should be a literacy tests where people running for office\nBecause it seems like you really need to be quite ignorant because on top of that and people say well these books you know they're not stupid\nThey just have an agenda if your agenda is the throw yourself on the sort of a lack of credibility than you are an idiot\nAnd I know I'm being serious about that you can laugh all you want\nBut if you're willing to you sir your own reputation for the advancement indoor achievement of a political agenda which is defined as common sense and the ... the best interest of those that you are sworn to serve\nA bone head but then again\nYou'll see some of these people on Facebook you hear some of these people called talk radio programs\nAnd they really aren't that divorced from reality\n'cause I Know\nIn most people's basements there's a lack of a light maybe there's some\nDown there you know you get some mode and mildew they don't mess with your brain it'll kill brain cells\nTalk of a light maybe there's some mold down there you know you get some mode and mildew it'll mess with your brain it'll kill brain cells and those that are still living her mom's basement that certainly seems to be the case\n\nTake her to Korea spend more than a dollar on a lobster dinner\n\nIf you don't know the men and black reference [laughter] it's like\nA stone building that if I were ever to be nominated for anything\nBy any president I had to go in front of a committee\nI Would respond and nothing but song titles yeah\nAnd if I was Brett Kavanaugh I would've showed up because he obviously knew they were going to question his college life and all that I Would have showed up in the\nJohn Belushi are Yeah John Belushi sweatshirt that just said ... yeah and just have a bottle of Jack filled with sweet tea and before they started just shut the whole thing and just throw the bottle Adam uh-huh [laughter]\nThat's what I Would have done a ... he he already knew they were going to blow his life up\nYeah go ahead no just have fun with absolutely no for high school that's what I Would do get can use the\nKavanaugh at all ... all of his supporters and his his sick fans that his staff in the\nBack of the really good job go go go out to be your boss [laughter]\n[laughter]\nFor income and we'll and then again he does a keg stand right there [laughter] ah yeah you're out order this flat beers out of order\nBut you know the graduates of Farber they're voting\nOr in its cage they're running for office mapping land the land the land those [laughter] excuse army have another\n\n... Democrats I mean really that was the boat here if you can't see what's going on around you then just give me a favor called a show eight six six five five one nine nine three three and regalia lives whether you're ignorance you're listening to them like a hard job stick around recover right back\nYou don't have to agree with Michael heart you can choose to be wrong if you do it's not my goal her show oh\nHoney that's a beautiful picture but\nDid you make the risky different colors are is not ... Oh yes [noise]\nWay what have you ever notice as ugly\nBlack streets in this coloration on your roof what you're actually seen algae gross\nA roof that has lots of algae indicate significant aging degradation mixing it susceptible to other types of problems when storms come through your", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Guys", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "02"}
