unbelievers face gone [noise]\nThe good news is because of guns grace you don't have to endure eternity alienated from him [noise]\nWe conclude our series how to choose or a city with a message titled the final judgment\nThis message deals with the most tense feel\nFearful moments in all of human history\nAnd the title of the messages the final judgment of God\nThat some of you are not going to be in that judgment\nBut some of your going to be that is those of you who have refused the claims that the Lord Jesus Christ as Lawrence your life\nThose of you who have rejected the Lord Jesus Christ and the forgiveness of your sins those of you who have decided to do your own thing\nTo live your life as you please put also one of these days that you're going to do better\nAll of you who died without the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal savior\nYou who have rejected his blood\nYou who have shown his book\nYou who have shown the offer of salvation\nAnd turned away your friends who've offered you the opportunity of being say you my friends who die without the Lord Jesus Christ will stand in the most tents feel fearful moments in human history when before a righteous holy God you listen to him hand down the verdict\nThe area of ... an eternal verdict concerning your future judgment and your eternity the Bible says it is a part of the demand wants to die and after this the judgment\nAnd so you're going to spend eternity somewhere\nAnd if you did not receive the Lord Jesus Christ is your personal savior if you do not accept him and the forgiveness of your sins you've gone to stand in this judgment that we're about to read about\nYou're gonna have to give an account for every sin that you've ever committed\nAnd then you are going to be cast the Bible says into a place called the lake of fire where you're going to spend eternity\nThe passages in revelation chapter twenty it is almost at the end of this book of revelation which God gave to the apostle John's\nOn the island ...\nThey give him the revelation of things that will come to pass and the future and part of that is described in the turn of the chapter the book of revelations as he describes the future of judgment and he calls it the great white thrown judgment beginning if you will in verse eleven\nAnd I saw a great white thrown and him who set upon it\nFrom whose presence\nAnd no place was found to them\nAnd I saw the dead the great in the small standing before the throng\nAnd the books were open\nAnd another book was open which is the book of life\nAnd the dead wood judge from those things which were written the books according to their deeds\nAnd another book was open which is the book of life\nAnd the dead wood judge from those things which were written the books according to their deeds and the sea gave up the dead which were in it\nIn Haiti's or torment gave us a day which were in them and they were judged every one of them according to their deeds\nIn Haiti's or torment were thrown into the lake of fire\nThis is the second death\nThe lake of fire and if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life he was thrown into the lake of fire in God's calendar of events according to the scriptures this is the way it eventually gonna transpire\nYou and I will be here in life just as we are today certainly the Bible says with the show the bar so the arcane she'll go trumpet of God the Lord Jesus Christ is coming from heaven\nAnd the moment that happens the Bible says that all the graves\nOf all of those who have trust that Jesus as they say if you're going to open and the bodies of believers all levels of world out of the seas out of the graves are coming up out of the graves\nThey're going to be transformed in the twinkling of an I liken and fashion liking the body of the Lord Jesus Christ we've which are alive at that time shell likewise be transformed and caught up together with them and the clouds to meet the lord of the air and the Bible says so shall we ever be with the lord\nBeginning there after it will come the judgments seat of the relievers Jesus Christ rewards those believers at the same time down here on earth there will be a period of seven years of which the Bible cause a seven year period of great tribulation\nThe Bible says like the world has never known before they ever show no at the end of that time\nThe Lord Jesus Christ is coming back this time not as he came from the church\nBut you'll notice this time the Bible says in revelation chapter one gr seven behold he is coming\nWith the clouds and every every I Will see him that's not true when he comes only for his church every I Will see him even those who appears to 'em and all the tribes of the earth will mourn over him\nSo the coming of Jesus Christ at the end of the tribulation period will be a time of destruction\nFor those who have gone to the tribulation and denied God immediately following that\nOutlawed cleansing this earth\nWill set up with a viable calls a millennial period at the end of that time Satan is loose for a brief moment in time which God judges him in the Bible says inverse tended to a new chapter and the devil who deceived them\nWas thrown into the lake of fire and brim stone whether the beast and the false prophet are also and they will be twelve minutes a day and night forever and ever now following the end of the millennial reign of the Lord Jesus Christ\nGod then fine LA sums up all of life in the great white thrown judgment as his describe beginning in verse eleven\nSo when it's going to take place is that the guy's entire program for the earth is finally completed at the end of his millennial reign when Satan is release for a brief moment of time and we don't know how long that it is and then fine they cast into the lake of fire with the beast and the false profits\nThen comes the great white thrown judgment now the question what is going to take place in this judgment well he tells us beginning in ...\nI saw the dead the greater the smaller standing before the lord before the throne and the books were open and another book was open which is the book of life now\nOh I saw the the greater the smaller standing before the lord but poker thrown and the books were open and another book was open which is the book of life now what are these books that two sets of books one of them is the books containing the works of the unjust the other book is the book of life\nOftentimes called the lamb's book of life and even in this book oftentimes he speaks to the lamb's book of life in the last verse of the twenty first chapter of revelation turnover that just one chapter\nHe says speaking of heaven and nothing unclean no one who practice is abomination lying show ever come into it that isn't to heaven but only those whose names are written in the lamb's book of light so there will be no one's standing in his judgment\nName is hurting the rams book of life you civil why did he say inverse Fifteen and if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life he was thrown to the lake of fire here's why I Believe that because God and all of his perfect fairness and justice when he looks at the works for the unbelievers it's as if God says one more time\nTo confirm so that there's absolutely no question forever and ever and ever\nIn the lamb's book of life where it is described the name of every single believer in the lamb's book of life when it comes to your name and my friends there may be many people made by your name but God Knows your name when he sees it because he is on this you and your name is not their gods one last\nOf divine grace listen\nNot to save you but to show you my friend and perfect fairness and justice that nowhere in time and he turned it it was your name ever inscribed in the lamb's book of life therefore the judgment that verdict is about the game be given is it ... it can never be change\nIf I can scare you under heaven rather old thank God wouldn't do it I Would do it I'm just telling you the truth just like God says I Want to ask you a question\nYou're going to do well two things about it\nYou're gonna have to

R. D. E. it's a great Sunday\nMorning here on our power bloc coming up right now music from Jeremy Camp it's a song called overcome your WXXI J. C.\nL.\nOr\nThrown in the ...\nThe desk and a\n... ... ...\n... ... ... ... jobs only weighs a\nCurb their hands on the school on\n\nThe you\n\nWe\nWe\n\nOn and you\nNa\nAnd that's where you need to be looking all the time or the fault tendency is to trust in ourselves and lean on her own understanding going to get a witness when we encounter a problem it's bigger than our ability to handle that's when we learn that our own resources are an adequate and then we can truly rely on Jesus\nTill we stop trying to rely on ourselves\nGod uses problems to deepen your faith and the deep in my face life's most challenging and fearful situations can be our best opportunities to realize or weakness and gun string ideally we reach out to Jesus as a first resort not the last\nWhat do you do when problems come if you're like all of us you probably said lord God and make this go away\nOr maybe beginning introspective\nResort not the last what do you do and problems come if you're like all of us have probably said lord God and make this go away\nOr maybe beginning introspective and we say lord God why\nBut I'll give you a new ... lord God what\nWhat are you trying to teach me through all these things that I'm experiencing right now when you use that in Iraq and then God can go to work and your life and stretch your faith and grow your faith and guess what\nWhen God carries you through a problem and you look back on it it gives you the muscles to believe him the next time you go through some problem because you know he was way back then and he's going to be with you in the future so we can grow our faith through preaching we grow our face through problems\nWe grow our face for the people we need people\nWe're exploring pause command overcome fear by taking the shield the faith with which you will be able to withstand the darts of the evil one\nToo often as Christians we think we take up that shield on our own let me tell you something about the Roman army\nThe Roman shield was carried by an individual soldier but it was the most effective when it was combined with the shields of other soldiers\nOne of the Roman military innovations was called the tortoise or the ... formation the soldiers marched forward in a tight organized cluster overlapping and interlocking their shields so that nothing could get through between them\nSo you see the critical point here this is the shield the faith which by design is enter luck with the soldier who's next to you and this is the shield the fate utilized in community the community of faith in our spiritual battles men and women\nAs it is true in any combat environment there is no room for a long rangers the Christian life was not meant to be done in isolation if you expect to be protected you got to stick with a group you got to march or the unit and you've got to live like a family or you're gonna\nBe a victim and not a Victor I Know a lot of people say I don't need community I got God that's all I Need well\nYeah\nBut God expresses himself best through others doesn't he God works through other people in our church we're not a church with small groups but we're a church of small groups\nAnd the healthy people in a church find a way to get in community with other believers so they can help each other so they can challenge each other so they can hold each other accountable so they don't go to battle by themselves and got on earth that we grow our faith through people\nSometimes God's strengthens us when we're all alone in quiet but mostly he strengthens our faith through the words and patience of other people\nSo don't neglect the benefit of being in a community you want to grow your faith let me tell you something faith grows better and community than it does by itself we grow better together a man\nThat's what the church is all about that is what groups are all about that is what ministries teams are all about don't be an isolated person don't put yourself in a position where you only have you put yourself in a position where you have others and the others have you as well to grow our faith we need purpose\nGod often gives us a purpose that requires us to trust him in special ways that's one reason why Jesus loved to get his disciples tasks and challenges to\nTheir fate he always did that he would take them out in the middle of a storm and go to sleep in the boat [noise]\nTypos tasks and challenges to build their fate you always did that he would take them out in the middle of the storm and go to sleep and about\nWhat was he doing he was teaching them fade where they're going to worry about the storm even if they had the creator of the universe in their boat\nYeah they did and he told them they didn't have much faith and that was true\nHe sent them out to buy two to preach and cast out demons and heal the sick on one occasion he commanded them to be five thousand people with only five loaves of bread and to fish\nAnd another to do the same with four thousand at seven lobes and a few small fish and then at the end of his earthly ministry he sent them ahead of Jerusalem and told him to white 'cause the Holy Spirit was going to come\nGod gives us a sense of purpose as his way of stretching and strengthening our faith muscles\nWhat I mean people across the country who know what we do and radio and television and then our church one of the questions they often asked me did you envision this when you first started and I sort of smile at that because you know I started in a mobile home church with thirty five people\nCould I have seen what God was going to do now absolutely not\nBut all along the way God kept putting things in front of me that I couldn't in my own mind and heart believe but that I knew God wanted me to do it was built this building\nGrab a hold of this station take this expect and every time I took a step of Faye almighty God showed me\nThat's what he was teaching me we learned faith by stretching or face muscles if we're only going to trust God for what we already have we cannot grow our fate we need projects we need problems we need challenges to trust God for what we cannot see ourselves capable of doing and then watching God do\nMany of you know that turning point is on the trivia broadcasting network we've been on for many years but I remember when we first went on that network and we were told how much it was going to cost to be on that network and I knew God wants to be on the network I just didn't know where the money was [noise]\nHe hadn't told me that yet [noise] interesting thing happened during that time I wrote a book on the book of queasy asked to use the book of al ... has a lot of principles for businessmen there's one little section is just amazing I remember when I first saw it I thought man this should be in a business book someplace in the store\nWell I'm trying to figure out what to do with TBN this book comes out one day I get a call from a guy up in the north county\nHe says can I come down and talk with you you said I got something I Want to tell you so we made an apartment he came down to a turning point headquarters came in and sat down and he told me what he did and the vast array of businesses that he owned hospitals and all kinds of stuff he said\nDr Jeremiah we're having\nA lot of problems in our business and I don't know what to do and so many gimme your book and all these business principals or in this book so he said we just went on a retreat with all of our executives and we stayed in this hotel and every morning we get up and we'd read your book\nThen we go in the afternoon and we talk about what we read and how to apply to our business he said we came back two weeks later and all of our business problems have been solved and I just wanted to come out here and thank you well I'm thinking about the fact that God has called us to be on TV on and I'm not sure how this is supposed to be associated [noise]\nSo you wanted to come down here and tell me thank you for what we did for you and I bet you want to know what you can do to help us down\nHere [noise]\nI'll never forget this he said he absolutely what do you need Dr germ I [noise]\nI said well I'm trying to put this thing\n[noise] and I'll never forget this\nHe said he absolutely what do you need ...\nI said well I'm trying to put this thing together with TBN and I'll tell you what I Know this is what God wants us to do but I just don't\nSee our way to do it I've been through everything we're doing a cut everything that I don't think so effective and we still have quite a gap\nBetween where we are and where we need to be he said well how much does the gap I said well it's a quarter of a million dollars he said OK I'll get back to the next day he wired me a quarter of a million dollars\n[noise] I don't even\nWhat he was saying on behalf of God is if we take a step of faith and we believe God he will show him so strong in our rehab and guess what\nThose kinds of things have happened a lot since then it's never easy when you have to trust God for what you can't personally physically see but it gets a little bit easier when you can look back and see what God has done in the past man\nWhen you get a little bit fake experience in your own\nYou can see that God is\nUp to something and you can trust him\nTo grow our faith we need preaching and to grow our faith we need problems and the girl our faith we need people and the girl our faith we need purpose and perspective what perspective do we need the disciples asked Jesus to increase their\nFaith and Jesus to them if you're a phase is as small as the mustard seed you can up fruit and testimony very tree into the seat now I've heard that preach dawn and miss applied many times\nIn other words Jesus was saying this it's not the size of your faith Ed Towns it's the size of your God that counts [noise] Jesus disciples needed the proper perspective in order to grow their faith I get an object lesson on perspective whenever I drive my car\nWell no it's an article for Dr germ I get the details when you contact doesn't David Jeremiah dot org slash radio to be here next weekend

between go online and go like this is Sunday so this was a day at work and that's some big church houses that's been built for what I call these pseudo worship services now is that what I call the

him to do was simply is response to God's presence we as to why\nBut what you're trusting him to do worship simply is our response to God's presence we read and burgers to wall baby minister due to the lord wow\nMiddle string to the lord that's a phrase that means we're wiping worshipping the lord while they were mental strength to the law now I Know you heard\nMe but I don't know if you heard me\nTo discover that yesterday and we're going to show you about yours\nTo discover it watch this while\nNew to the lord\nBecause most people come to charge for the law to minister to them\nHas to say to them what God's gonna do for them how God is going to bless them\nBy the ministry of God to them\nBy the ministry to God\nGod is the audience and you and I are the performers when you go to a restaurant the waiter or waitress\nMinisters to you\nOr they sent you a they want to know what you'd like to drink or they want to know a\nA here's the menu do you have any questions or are they want to ah serve the food on\nThe tip becomes your response to them in the street of you and if they feel well\nYou are responding to that\nSo my question is as you came to the restaurant today\nDid you come to find out what\nHe can and will do for you\nEver done anything for him\nAre just looking for you're blessed to\nSee that's what the script has been slipped in far too many religious environment the church has become a place\nWho are not that concerned about ministry to God it's like saying\nBless America when America doesn't want to bless God\nGod we want to leave you are but we want our blessing\nNotice it was why\nTo the last three we're going to get the what happened but it came in the context of their worship response to God's presence so you have to picture it this way but before you into the building God is sitting here waiting\nOn your wife bowl and see what you're going to do when you get here and if you feel\nBecause warship if men of string to the law\nThe law minister the you\nKnow there are\nChristians\nChristians who show up for the show they want the event they want to hear the choir thing they want to hear the preacher preach they want to see what's going on they show up for the event\nAnd they will come to prevent this Sunday and show up for a new event next Sunday it's like the F the game who watched\nThis Sunday and show up for a new event next Sunday it's like the F the game who watch the game and go to the game this Sunday don't care anything about sports until the new games next Sunday so they are\nThe problem is if you are an event\nChristian you hear from a show for the Sunday Sunday then\nThat means that the seven day gap\nBut it's a seven day gap\nBetween events and it's a it's a seven day gap\nBetween events you only get one free event worship\nTo be an event whether if we can go by most folk today are probably going to have a pretty good Sunday afternoon\nMeal Sunday usually it's a big meal even a big meal is cooked or you go out
