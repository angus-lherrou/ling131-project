sorrow only pure joy that's true but what are we going to be doing for eternity we'd be working where we visit with our loved ones what will our life be like [noise]\nStay with us for part to return all in our continuing series how to choose your destiny\nWell a wise person always repairs of what he or she knows is inevitable\nAnd the Bible says is one of these days all of us will die\nAnd when we do we're going to spend the attorney in one of two places now the question is are you making in preparation for where you're going to spend eternity\nThere are only two places one of them is called the lake of fire\nAnd so the preparation for that is to do nothing that is you don't have to do anything at all they end up there\nBut my friend if you're planning on going to have one there are some steps the preparation you say well I think I'm going well the question is what have you done to prepare the spend eternity with God and all other believers in heaven\nAnd that is the theme of this entire message and that is preparing for heaven and I won't if you will to turn to revelation chapter Twenty one\nAnd the oldest to read the first six versus of this chapter and this is the ... the John who is writing about what he saw concerning heaven\nBeginning in the first verse of the twenty first chapter the revelation he says and I saw a new heaven and a new or for the first one and the first earth\nPassed away and there is no longer in his seat\nAnd I saw the whole listed in Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God made ready as a broader dawn for her husband and I heard a loud voice from the throne saying\nBeholder Tabernacle of God is among men and he showed well among them and they should be his people and got himself Shelby among them and he ... from their eyes and their she'll no longer being to death their she'll no longer be in the morning are crying or pain the first things have passed away\nAnd he who sits on the throne said behold I'm making all things new and he said to write these words are faithful in through\nAnd he said to me it is done I Am the ... and the omega though beginning in the end I Will give to the one who first from the spring\nOf the water of life without cost\nNow when John writes the revelation what he's writing is what he has what he is in the process of sea\nNobody can fully understand all that heaven has the simple reason that I find like minds are confined to some degree the earthly understanding\nI'm not going to spend time trying to describe to you what happens is going to be like but rather how to prepare to get there now the first question I Want to ask is what are we going to do when we get there\nA lot of people have a lot of conjecture about that but they're all very specific things the Bible says that you and I are going to do when we get to heaven and sovereign us to look at them and then I Want us to look at this matter of how do we prepare\nBut but they're all very specific things the Bible says that you and I are going to do when we get to heaven and solve with us to look at them and then I Want us to look at this matter\nOf how do we prepare so in order to talk about how we prepare and why we should talk about that let's ask the question what are we going to do this so therefore things that I Want you to take note up in the book of revelation go back to chapter for for a moment\nOne of the things we're going to do when we get to heaven as we're going to praise God and worship him\nAnd throughout the book of the revelation that describes future things there are number of passages not versus but sections versus that describe this look if you will in versus nine of the fall chapter\nAnd window living creatures give blower and honoring thanks to him who sits on the throne to him who lives forever and ever\nAnd the twenty four elders will fall down before him who sits on the throne animal worship him who lives forever and ever and were cast that crowns before the throne saying listen we're the art bell our lord and our God to receive blower and honoring power without its create all things and because of that will\nThey existed and were created\nThan for example the next chapter notice what he says\nAnd I looked and I heard the voice of many angels around the thrown to the living creatures and The Elders and the number of them was ... and thousands of thousands\nSaying with a loud voice worthy is the land that was playing the receive power enriches in wisdom and might in honoring glory and blessing and every created thing which is in heaven and all of the earth and under the earth and all of the sea and all things in them I heard saying to him to sit still not thrown to the land the blessing and honoring plural dominion forever and ever\nAnd the ... just kept saying amen and they'll those fell down and worship\nWell these are just two examples of scripture up the scripture in the book of revelations that describe what's going on in heaven that has praised the God and worship\nPraise and worship involves personal involvement and what is going on\nIt is a God directed the than we're thinking about him and praising him an adoring him and loving him and if you and I go into having my friend and spend the rest of eternity praising and worshipping God we need to learn how while we're down here and get started with getting on to worship\nThe living holy God who has become ...\nHe says we're going to be praising him in the heavens the angels everyone is praising the Lord Jesus Christ and magnifying him for his great work of redemption\nUh second thing he says we're going to do he says we're going to shine for him or the world does that mean go back if you will to Matthew chapter Thirteen\nAnd the thirteenth chapter Matthew the passage deals with the judgment that is the final separation of the righteous and the un righteous\nAnd listen to what he says beginning in the for the first verse the son of men will send both his angels and they will gather out of his kingdom all stumbling blocks and those who commit lawlessness and will cast them into the furniture so far and that place now she'll be weeping and gnashing of teeth then then the righteous\nThose have received the Lord Jesus Christ as their save you then the righteous we shine falls as the sun in the kingdom of their father he who has ears let him hear now what does he referring to here simply this\nThat when you and I received the Lord Jesus Christ as their saved the Bible says\nThat the Lord Jesus Christ became our life the Holy Spirit came to enjoy all your life in my life God says one of the reasons he saved us is in order to you and I may draw refined him that we might reflect him that are countless may show for the presence of the living\nHey does is in order to you and I may drool refined him that we might reflect him that are countenance may show for the president said the living God within us he did not save us to keep us out of time and he said this to glorify himself he said this to magnify himself\nHe said this because he loves us because he wants to give himself to laws live himself through was Shon both his glory in his own us so that\nWhen you and I get to heaven for all of eternity we're going to shine both with all the ratings in building during that just the of the living God forever and ever and ever and hindered now that's what we're going to do for all eternity we need to get busy down here\nReflecting the Lord Jesus Christ both in a character our conversation on our conduct and our lifestyle they ought to be enough of the Lord Jesus Christ coming through us that those who lead us no they met us but somebody on the inside for and more important than we\nThen the third thing he says we're going to be doing in heaven and that is to some people's right dismay for you who think well I'm going to retire and finally go to heaven room and rest and relax forever I Want you to turn the revelation chapter twenty two\nFor he says as he describes again heaven here let's start with\nThe first one I've chopped the twenty two and he showed me a river of the water of life clearance crystal coming from the throne of God and other lamb in the middle of its streets and on either side of the river was the tree of life bearing twelve kinds of fruit yielding it's fruit every month and the leaves of the tree where the healing of the nations and their show no longer be any\nNot flesh and blood but the girl that fried transforms bodies he says in Philippines like and into the body of the Lord Jesus Christ he says that by this will be transformed and\nFor ever and ever and ever we she'll be with the law in the headlines with God with the father was the spirit with this whole the angels and with all the saints now with all of that let me just say one last thing if you don't take step number one\nYou're not going there's no way it's impossible eat\nListen even if you're a rationally minded person you think a lot to rationalize everything I rationalize it all out work it all up my mind that my friend you cannot rationalize this out your spirit without Christ is dead to the things have gone\nAnd before you can communicate to him that's got to be a new birth cake guinea and you'll never get into heaven until you have been born again\nBy the grace of God and I totally with you and Jesus name to make that decision right now\nYou ask him to forgive you send your knowledge that you've been living independently of God you tell them that you're placing your trust in the death of Jesus Christ of calvary all

na\nWe have no way of knowing whether pilots question was a serious question or just sarcastic but we do know that minutes later he turned Jesus over to an angry crowd to be crucified isn't it interesting\nJudged the truth the sentence the truth he skirted the truth he mocked lived through the crucified the truth when he asked Jesus what is true truth was standing right in front of him [noise]\nJesus Christ was the through\nThe irony is at the very moment he asked this question he was staring at the pure incarnation of true\nThe one who is the truth and just said to him everyone who hears me he is of the truth and you know whatever sense pilot asked that question what is truth everybody's been asked that question having that what is true and today truth\nIs up for grabs according to us again is truth in any objective or absolute sense truth that is independent of the mind of the no or no longer exists a simple way to illustrate what's happened the truth lies\nThe objective or absolute sense truth that is independent of the mind of the new or no longer exists\nA simple way to illustrate what's happened the truth lies in the story I read about three baseball umpires who are debating their different style a lump hiring one of them said there's balls and strikes and I call them the way they are\nNo said the same could empire that's arrogant there's balls and strikes and I call them the way I see him that's no better said the third empire\nWhy beat around the Bush why not be realistic about what we do there's balls and strikes me nothing till we call them\nNow watch this the first empire represents the traditional view of truth\nObjective independent of the mind\nThe nor there to be discovered as it is what did he say we call balls and strikes as they are\nThe second speaks for moderate relativism truth as each person sees it hear people say well\nI don't see that is true you see it as true but I see that as fall so everybody has their own truth can I get a witness\nAnd the third umpire bluntly expresses the radical relevance to post modern position\nTruth is not to be discovered it's for each of us to create for ourselves according to the relatives position all of us we just get to create our own truth there is no such thing as objective truth what's true for you is not true for me I get to have my truth and you could have your true as if there is no real true\nThen the final analysis truth corresponds to the first umpires position to what actually is and that's why truth is found in God God is the great I Am he is the true you know in the Bible says in the beginning God that's the answer to everything [noise]\nBecause God is the ultimate reality\nThere is nothing outside of God and God was before there was anything so what is true is God is true in the beginning God was\nHe is the self existent one he's the creator of everything that exists God is true and all truth is God's truth in the Bible he is called the God of truth\nThe father the first person or the trinity is true some thirty one five says into your hand I met my spirit you have redeem me oh lord God of truth\nAnd you know Jesus Christ is the second person of the trinity\nHow should we be surprised to discover that Jesus Christ is true as well\nThe Bible says Jesus Christ is full of grace and true and because he is full of grace in truth he can say\nI Am the way the truth\nThe Bible teaches us that Jesus Christ is\nAnd was the communicator of troop\nHe's the witness to the troop he's the origin of the true he's the preacher of the truth is truth embodied truth is not some system or philosophy truth as a person if you want to know the truth of God you must come to Jesus Christ because he alone is true that is why the Bible says Jesus\nSaid I Am the way the truth and the life and no one can come to the father except through me why you can't get to the father unless you come to the truth\nNot only is God the father truth and God the sun truth don't be surprised God the Holy Spirit is truth as well [noise]\nWe read when they help or come to my show sent to you from the father the spirit of truth\nWho proceeds from the father he will testify of me\nComes to my show sent to you from the father the spirit of truth\nWho proceeds from the father he will testify of me so let me just say this again you guys\nTruth is not some nebulous idea some flexible concept some theoretical assumption\nIt is a solid clearly defined on all terrible entity is ultimate reality residing in the trial you God of the universe and it is not open for re evaluation or for a redefinition the next time somebody talk to you about their true well this is my true\nDon't get caught up in that discussion there's only one true then it's the truth of God when we get connected with God we're in his true whatever anything else we're in the air and false should there is not many divisions or versions of truth there's only one truth and God himself is not true\nSo if that's the case and we want to overcome ball so it was true how do we do that I Want to give you some thoughts about how we go about overcoming falls food with true first of all\nWe overcome balls food with truth by seeking the truth ourselves\nTo do battle with the enemy the believer needs to know the truth about God\nThe truth about Christ and the truth that is in this book we call the Bible there's two things we can take out of this that we just do first of all we need to study in the true you know what folks\nI've grown up in a culture of ministers who minimize the truth of the word of God if you can get five\nOr six sentences that come from the Bible and some of their messages you've had a lucky day [noise]\nPeople don't take their battles the church because they say oh you don't need all that Bible stuff well if you don't need all that bottles of why are you a pastor why are you a minister if you don't need the Bible what purpose do you have\nYou see the truth is so critical because we have nothing else our whole life is based upon the truth of God and it's a shame\nTo me that so many believers don't understand that\nYou come to shut them on community church going to hear a message from the Bible about a motivator I Hope I'm motivational in what I say from the Bible but I'm not a motivator so what I Do I'm not a public relations artist I'm a preacher of the word of God [noise]\n\nSo that's where the guy we need not to be ashamed that we studied the truth there is no premium on ignorance in the Christian life\nYou can't go around and brag about how much you don't know about the Bible\nAnd say well I don't need the Bible I just have spare to God and my heart let me tell you what I Know about that the spirit of God doesn't do anything without the Bible the spirit of God can't work without the Bible\nIf you don't know the truth you haven't got anything so in order to overcome false who it was true you have to study the truth\nAnd the truth is written in the scripture its system eyes true so you study the truth\nAnd not only do you study it you have to submit to the true\nLast year I have the privilege of writing the forward to a book by a friend of mine who is now the president of the Southern Baptist convention pray for this man his name as ... Greer is bright young pastor he's a good writer too and he wrote a book called not got enough\nAnd I read this whole book from cover to cover made some notes and wrote the forward for him my favorite chapter in this book had this title you don't get your own personal Jesus\nYou don't get your own personal Jesus and this is what he said in one part of that chapter he said when God appeared to Moses he declared\nI Am who I Am\nI Am who I Am it's not I am whoever you want me to be [noise]\nCan we imagine how offensive it must be to God when we attempt to reshape him according to our own preferences how would you like it if someone did that to you\nMy guess is that you'd be pretty offended if we were like someone else doing that the U.S why would we think it's okay to do that with God\nDo we think that our idea of God is better than who we actually is I mean come on and have we forgotten who are talking about\nYou say counterfeit truth is never more on display but in the way we often hear people speak of God in today's world listen to this you heard it before\nMy God wants me to be rich [noise]\nBut God I Believe in he'd never send anybody to hell\nHow dare your God claimed to be the only one in heaven\nWhen somebody says to me my God would never do that I tell them you're absolutely right because you're God doesn't exist [noise]\n[noise] we don't have a whole bunch of guys\nYou know ... years ago said we're supposed to reform ourselves and the image of God\nBut ever since he live everybody's trying to return the favor and we're trying to form God into our own image we created a little God that makes us comfortable and the way we live\nBut there aren't many guys you guys there's this one guy the God of truth\nThe ... notes an article from Dr germ I get the details when you contact us that David Jeremiah dot org slash radio than be here next weekend Dr David Jeremiah brings another message from God's word year maternity point weekend edition\n\nOne and honor it is to have Jay burning muggy back O W ...

that\nThe flaming love that you had for Christ the day you were delivered from the kingdom of darkness the burning heart\nThat you had like those on the road to a mess when the scripture and the truth dawned on you and you saw the significance of his death and resurrection\nThe day when you realize\nThat you had been delivered from the world those early days of hot hearts passionate labor devotion\nTo Christ being consumed with him with a loving him was becoming replaced by a kind of\nDue to full doctrinal coldness\nThe heat of that first love was going and they left it they left it you know it's a\nIt's a danger for all of us I think we're very much like the church it emphasis work hard persevere endure know the truth we have discernment\nWe hate sin we're capable of exposing error but the danger for us to leave first love\nThis really comes out of Jeremiah to Jeremiah says the word of the lord came to me saying go and proclaiming the ears of Jerusalem sayings that says the lord I remember concerning you the devotion of your youth the love of your troubles\nI remember that you're following after me in the wilderness through a land not sewn you would follow me anywhere I remember says God the love of your ...\nI remember that Jeremiah goes on to say your long ago left that and that is the message that the lord of the church gives to the church it emphasis the honeymoon is over ... for Christ has cooled and this is very dangerous\nThe cooling of love for Christ is the forerunner of spiritual apathy apathy is the forerunner of\nLove for something else

things are ... are they as precious to you as they once were remember how it was when you were truly\nConverted remember\nFrom where you have fallen go back and remember the glorious\nExperience that was yours when you came to Christ\nAnd then repent remember repent and then do the deed\nYou did at first you know you restore the live like going back and doing what you did at the beginning\nRemember repent of your lack of love failure to love the lord of the your heart so mine is string repetitive any cold mechanical service to Christ\nAnd then go back and do the deeds that you did at the very beginning go back and start again\nYou say well ... this this is kind of a minor defect isn't it ...\nBecause if you look at verse or five he says in the middle or else I\nAm coming to you and we'll remove your lamp stand\nOut of its place unless you were then I'm going to shut the church down can you imagine when that pastor from emphasis read that letter to that church
