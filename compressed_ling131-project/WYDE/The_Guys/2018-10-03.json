was also applauded for\nWell coming to terms with the better angels of his nature mhm\nWell like I said earlier I saw it on Twitter we know more about Brett Kavanaugh's virginity than we do about the Las Vegas shooter\nMhm yeah point\nBut you know we need to hold Supreme Court justices to a high standard and we do and that's why Ruth Bader Ginsburg during the state of the union\nTwo years ago passed out in the front row after admitting to having three glasses of wine at dinner that night\nJust it there but at least it was good wine manager of its ... yeah moving David nah\nNot for somebody named Ginsburg\nEight six six five five one nine nine three three\nHold on I'm getting a text message\nYou as you can see I'm pretty much fed up with it I mean I'm I'm there I Am at a point right now I'm just like you know it is time to just get it's time to just break that wears off of a political tree and start whacking some nut rolls\nBecause this is absolutely so ignorant it just insulting to this country\nTo the men and women that have died in defense of this country believe in these allegations that have now been so wholeheartedly disproven\nIs in our front to the memory of every young black male they ever found himself song from a tree over the allegations by some white chick that he looked at her\nMy heart is breaking for this country\nAbsolutely breaking\nAnd now I'm at a point right now where I can do almost nothing but be satirical and tongue in cheek and even a little bit perhaps offensive because it's in saying\nNot just what they're doing to Brett Kavanaugh but what they're going to do with the soon to be garbage have ah Christine Blasey Ford's life\n\nAnd the very tenants under which this nation was founded\n\nIt makes me absolutely heart sick\nBut yeah you got rock Obama being paddled on the back for town a bunch of young college students hey it's okay if you go out there and hit a ball what I did it does get over it do your schooling and move on\nOkay to drink mayors hey it's okay to drink beers in the White House and you know something it is\n\nYou know who would not pass muster using this is the pro forma do you know who never would have made it into office if what is being called upon about Brett Kavanaugh was revealed in this time Thomas Jefferson\n\nUpon about Brett Kavanaugh was revealed in this time Thomas Jefferson\n\nBen Franklin didn't want to run for office because he was too busy partying\n\nThe library of Congress the original books were purchased from Jefferson directly to help him pay his bar tab true\n\nBut now we're going to ... and then we are going to actually imply that he does not have the moxie the credibility the integrity to sit on the Supreme Court because he threw an ice cube but somebody that's where they have gone\nAnybody that falls for this nonsense is I guess for all of my mouth Venus I won't say it\nWell now you got Cory Booker saying he doesn't care Brett Kavanaugh was\nInnocent or not\nThat's what this was all about but then also you got Allison who has been exonerated from beaten up on this woman\nAnd by who uh it's a law firm that donates about five hundred thousand dollars a year to democratic candidates and then we have the uh the the learn the\nFactoid that George Soros is the one paying the protesters that story came out yesterday including the women that confront a Jeff Flake in the elevator\n[noise]\nYeah\nThat's about the phone so I'm just I'm fed up hello Phil how are you\nI'm doing fine my I had this wonderful realization this morning as I was thinking about all this data last up watching the news on TV\nA while was it Robert manual was famous for saying capitalized on chaos well yeah and that never let a crisis go to waste\nA isn't it interesting that the Democrats capitalized on chaos but they never benefit those who are in the midst of the chaos yeah\nI mean they are I mean even rama Emanuel as mayor of Chicago is doing the same thing that kept alive\nThey're capitalizing on it but they're not helping anything the Democrats are doing the same thing with the me too I mean even with the camera and hearing their capitalize on that they're not doing anything else [noise]\nAh and I think that they can vote for the whole Democratic Party say let's just make a name you know because we're cat were were were supporting them but we're not going to do anything else\nBut the promise you run into is that once the solution is fermented and applied ineffective then the crisis has ended\nThere there's there's nothing left to to room mediate if you will or to abate that crisis has got to be filled all the time that's why you have so many accusers\nIf Ford doesn't work well we'll try this one that she doesn't work then we'll move on to sweat Nick if she doesn't work then we'll move on to this one and this one in this one the problem is a further out there you go\nThe more desperate they become to find somebody in a short period of time to pay that they themselves can not vets stories out and that's why the narrative begins to just disseminate or dismantle rather\nAnd the more they cheap and those who are undergoing the crisis\nThat's right you are correct real\nThey are commodity seizing them to move and don't even realize it\nYep and yet again you've got the exploitation\nThe correct real they are commodity and don't even realize\nYou're ... and yet again you've got the exploitation of the victim class in this case to victim a victim mode of ignorance\nWell that ... ignorant or are victimizing everyone in the eye and it seems to want to be of it and I and the men do them\nWell they're definitely ignorant of gum of the fact and this particular situation and what's really heartbreaking to me is how many of them are buying into the tribal ... consider to be their leaders and their leadership and how and I said this for ten years I've been on the air it just amazes me how\nHow frequently and with how much passion we see people that constantly\nLobby for things that are counter intuitive to their own best interest\nYeah let me ... hoping hoping something on the president\nMhm it's a Fox in house thing mhm yeah\nYeah see no conflict of interest or that age a seat at all not at all that that states in good hands yeah\nWell it's tantamount to read Cabot all investigating Christine forwards allegations\n\nSo tell me how that works\n\nI'm just moving on because I cannot I cannot expand a nother\nIQ point on such low intellect reporting\n\nYeah you could yeah I you know I could but I'm just going to just let it go\nWe've got Halloween costumes of talk her out Halloween costumes sparking controversy again yeah from sexy made into a bloody trophy hunters\n\n[noise] [laughter] the Malians are you talking about The Handmaid's tale casting mess\nThat's part of it that they're wearing the protests show on women's empowerment and all this other mess which that TV show really has nothing to do with it but now they're making a quote unquote sexy version of it mhm\nMm yeah yeah yeah way then power yeah\n[noise] well Halloween is just right around the corner and some Halloween costumes that popped up in stores this year have already ah horrified at trick or treaters photos of several unfit outfits many targeted\nAt who are women yeah because um\nWe're going to talk about allegations of sexual impropriety while we dress up young girls as sexy may ... sassy nuns\nUh-huh can I just say one trick or treat or come up dress like Margaret Thatcher and just start taking everybody's candy yeah fat sugar and Reagan yeah\n[laughter] it's just have a little short junkie boy you can walk and I've just like Gorbachev and they all just getting a fistfight in my front yard I just I Want the Cold War during Halloween ...\n\nThis year as a rounds of a Halloween costumes\nHas sparked quite a bit of controversy and of course this site\nYeah Andy has doubled down on what they're putting out we also have the um Trump inspired trophy hunter\nWhere this one particular hunter is that dressed in ... wearing a Donald Trump junior cat\nHe is covered in blood but part of the costume has like a a tiger or leopards had attached to it so he's a hunter that is all bloodied up apparently from the leopard attack\n\nPita has a mock this particular one is you can roll imagine\n\nThe animal rights organization said it wanted to give the animal\nParticular one is you can roll imagine\nThe animal rights organization said it wanted to give the animal and opportunity to win the battle whatever the heck that means\n[noise]\nSo now we have the um trophy hunting dad leopard bloody Trump supporter costume\nMhm Mm\nThe group that has put this without just profits from the sale will go to supporting lifesaving work for a wild animals\n\nThey include releasing lobsters into a freshwater river yeah\n[noise]\nYeah ... yeah\nThere's also a Huffington Post article that had done an expert on paid and discovered that in the last decade or So Peter has killed twenty nine thousand four hundred and twenty six dogs cats rabbits and other domestic animals\nIn response pita called Donald Trump junior a callous creep\nSo now you've got this desktop between Trump junior the cost to manufacture and paid off over Halloween now\n\nKen came to chastise and that's just go ahead and start and just wipe the slate clean please please\nYou also got Whoopi Goldberg on the attack again I guess junior saying his kids are gonna grow to be aggressive agitated or whatever you want to call them\nAnd yeah I Know so hey mhm but during the first ones to say children are off limits\nThey can say all they want to say at the end of the day and making fun of saying it you know follow the money it's all about the dollars and now we've got the sexy handmade ...\nYeah\nIt was removed from one website for sexual ... the symbol of female oppression\nBut then again then again we're going to have these conversations about women and accusations\nA judge to dress like a flapper you better to find that\nNineteen twenties jazz flapper George dress short hair little headband right doing the Charleston walking down the sidewalk with candy bag\n\nThat's more empowering than some fictional Netflix show\nWell how do we how do we how do we have conversations in this country\nAbout believing women about believing the accusations leveled by any woman for that matter about not using women as\nSex objects or object to find them while simultaneously creating house on Halloween costumes that celebrate their femininity\nDo you want\nAnd when I say celebrate I mean exploit do do you want a a what my response of beer guess what the left response would be about both okay the ... response be well\nMen should check their aggression and their feelings and they're\nWhat my response of beer guess what the left responsibly how about both okay the ... response be well men should check their aggression and their feelings and their um [noise] uh wants and desires at the door okay right some men should control themselves you know which which is true\nMy thing is you report yourself\nAnd monitors labels whatever you want to call them stick around for a long time and if you are dressed like one you're probably gonna be labeled one mhm whether or not you'd do anything or not it happens to guys and happens to girls\nSo looking at the the ah interview with NBC way Julie\nSweat neck\nBrett Kavanaugh holding a red solo cop and standing near a punch bowl it's kind of similar to this rather you did anything or not you are guilty by proximity you're the ... next to the\nPunch bowl [noise] wow\nI mean look look at the some of the commercials now and not just for the costumes you look at it there's a a\nA clothing detergent commercial I'm not going to name the name but the dad sitting there taking the clothes out of the drier and he fills up the laundry machine which has like one of those reservoirs\nThat comes up but that said yeah it's already filled up with detergent daughter throws in what looks like a night down like a short right right now\nAnd she said good all I've got to do is wash my Halloween costume and he said I thought you're going as a koala and she holds up the headband she go sexy call a walk so now I don't know if this supposed to be a college girl but she looks like she's in high school yeah no I've seen the commercial dad standing there holding the laundry basket like confused\nNo this dead would pull that out the laundry machine and burned it right in front yeah\nYeah no I hear ya especially she's in high or you know you're not leaving this house like this well I I just\nCan't get my head around how a sexual lives Halloween the way that we have and we've done it for years we will do the entire time I've been on the air while simultaneously having these discussions about you know preserving the feminine mistake\nAnd the respect and admiration and\nThe lack of a competing so to speak\nYou got two diametrically opposed viewpoints that are knocking heads when\nWe went up to um Coleman a couple of weeks ago ... me the wife and the
