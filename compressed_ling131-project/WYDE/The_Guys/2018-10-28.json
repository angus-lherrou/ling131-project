about going to come up short with you [noise]\nYou say but if God only knew he does know [noise]\nNobody else in the world and they know what you saw [noise]\nNobody else in the world and they know what you have to face God no [noise]\nAnd because he knows he's always there as the God of all come but I'm the God of all encourage\nThem to him talk with Dr Charles family\nIs simply troubling you today [noise]\nAre you anxious and worried or afraid maybe you're unhappy or say\nNo matter what you face Jesus has the reassurance you need\nTo stay with us now to find encourage my for the trouble hard\nSomeone should ask you to describe God and single war and so I mean just the whole list of words what would be the first few words you would mention what'd you mention God is just guys love\nGuys merciful God is on missions God is on the president's what words would you use to describe God is you know and\nI Wonder in that list of who got is from your perspective I Wonder how far down the list you would go before you described as God\nI Wonder in that list of who God is from your perspective I Wonder how far down the list you would go before you describe God to\nHis mind encourage here\nEven think about God being and encourage\nYou in fact of the two words judge or encourage ya\nWhich of those two words I'm most familiar\nTo you when you think about God do you see God as one who is a loving\nEncourage yeah who is on your side\nWho wants to help you\nWho's standing by your side to encourage you to lift you or do you see him primarily as a judge\nOne who condemns sin one that makes you feel bad even when you've done your best one who gives you sort of guilt feelings just because you know he's there watching\nWhat is your concept of God because you see the way you see God is the way you're going to relate yourself doing and the way you were late yourself to God is going to influence the way you were like yourself to other people and the way you see yourself\nIt's interesting that the apostle Paul\nHad many descriptions of guy one of those which is one of the most encouraging ones is found in second origins chapter one I don't want us to look at this passage because he describes God\nIn this beginning passage in a way that I think all of us need to personally and intimately view guy beginning in verse three and reading through verse eleven of second drink this chapter one he says\nThe less it'd be the guard and fall the Lord Jesus Christ the father of nurses\nThe God of all comfort listen blessed to be the guard and found the Lord Jesus Christ the father of versus\nGod of all comfort that word ... foot is the same word for encourage her\nComfort to help her\nOut ... times who comes puts us in all our affliction so that we may be able to come for those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God\nBut just as the sufferings of Christ or hours in abundance so also our ...\nIs a bundle through crises but if we're afflicted it is for your comfort and salvation or if we're comfort it it is for your company which is effective in the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer\nAnd our hope for you is firmly grounded knowing that is yours Sharon ... suffering so also your share rows of our comfort\nThan they relate something to them he says but we do not want you to be on the Web resident ... ... which came to us in Asia that we were a burden excessively beyond their strengths so that we despair even of life\nIndeed we had the sense of death within ourselves in order that we should not trust in ourselves budding God who raises the dead\nWho delivered us from so great a pair of death\nAnd will deliver us he own home we have set our hope and he will yet deliver us you also joining in helping us through your prayers that thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf of the favor bestowed upon us through the prayers of many\nIn this passage Paul sets the tone of this whole book\nPerson's on our behalf of the favor bestowed upon us through the prayers of many in this passage Paul sets the tone of this whole book and that is strength through weakness and what he simply saying him this third versus here scribes\nThat God the father the script showing all the attribute all the God of all\nComfort and so today what I Would like to talk about and the next few moments is\nEncouraged meant for the troubled heart\nAll of us go through those times not life when our heart begins to be troubled by some things are situations of circumstances or someone\nAnd the question is where do you and I turned and went out hardest trouble and So Paul and the very beginning passage I Believe gives us a ward of encouragement that I Want you to notice\nAnd I want you to go back to reverse age if you will because what he does his he couches this and an incident\nOr maybe even a series of incidents that happened to him and Asia of which they were at least partially with a million because he doesn't go into any details at all when he mentions it here but notice what he says and I want you to notice the words that he uses he says and ... but we did not want you to be unaware brethren of our Affleck and\nNow the word affliction here which he uses is the same word he uses back over here in verse for when he says who come puts us in all our collection is the word which means pressure\nBut it means more than ... affliction crushing pressure harassing oppressive\nPressure that is we're not talking about a little too thick ear ache or little sore throat or bad cold we're talking about going through difficult trying times dark deep strenuous valleys\nOr the anxiety level is high and welfare begins to grip was red darkness seems to prevail\nAnd the intensity of the pain is indescribable and the ... is overwhelming and the truth is we don't know what to do next\nAll of us are going to face times when Satan temp system discouraged now why because the devil does one of the choices to end his tool box to work on a believer is discouragement\nHe knows that when you discouraged she won't grow very much spiritually when you discouraged is not going to be much productivity in your life when you discouraged you will be a very poor servant of God you have very difficult time worshipping God\nWhen you're down in the dumps that is your negative and you're thinking you feel overwhelmed and the intensity of the pain of your circumstance at that moment\nThat is not to belittle the pain and suffering and the saw that many people live in continuously\nBut it's interesting that poll says our God is a God of all comfort\nHe's the source of all comfort and encourage but\nHe's a source of it\nAnd that is they encourage that he gives his adequate encourage them and so he said to them these afflictions are the times periods moments seasons of pressure intense harassing overwhelming pressure\nThat is the situation became so intense it things were so fragile Paul the simplest thing I knew in those moments life laws about over and the word he uses here when he says this spared even of life\nIs a word that implies abs\nAbout over and the word he uses here when he says this spared even of life\nIs a word that implies absolute and total on a vulnerability of any route of escape whatsoever this was in no way out he failed absolutely trapped and life was about to do it in\nMy friend that feels stuck to feel trapped\nTo fill in prison than a given circumstance is is a very tall manning situation Paul all through his spiritual life suffered one since the persecution after the other one trial one hardship one heartache and so someone says well what was Paul referring to hear\nAnd the apostle Paul talking about despairing even ... this is it can't last beyond this can't take any more than this he says I understood by experience that God raises many even from the dead and my friend and I wonder if today deep and your heart in Europe\nWell isn't this yeah they says I understood by experience that God raises many even from the dad and my friend I Wonder if the day of deep and your heart and your emotions you've already died\nI Wonder if you're a circumstance where are you sitting all listening today\nI Wonder if in your emotions you've already died you've already said too late\nNobody cares nobody understands why

our power block on superstation one oh one W why D E you get so much political talk during the week we also want to grow you as a person by giving you some teaching\nThat will challenge and inspired you to be a better person so coming up next we have Dr David Jeremiah each weekday on our W ex Jaycee station\nHe has been teaching through the book of revelation and let me just tell you the listeners are loving it he's coming up next right here on superstation one oh one now why did he it's a great Sunday\nMorning here on our power bloc coming up right now [noise] music from Jeremy campus a song called overcome your own WXXI Jaycee\n\nThrown in the\nIn Destin\nFlorida Man\n\nIs a really long\n\n\n\n\n\nCity\nSaying\n...\nAre ...\nOn\nSaying\n... na\nIn asking God to provide for our needs a course we come to him with worship and of course we come to him with Thanksgiving and gratitude but friends you don't need to be bashful to ask God for what you need God tells us we have not why because we ask now\nAnd if we don't as we have no reason to believe that will receive God tells us that he has wired\nThis universe to work by prayer and prayer works when we ask\nI have to tell you that oftentimes as I stand at the front of our church on occasion and people come to talk to me they'll say passage or am I don't know what to do can you tell me and then they'll unfold their story\nAnd then I'll say to them have you asked about this and they look at me like I just ask them a question nobody should ever ask [noise]\nYou know after that's why we're asking you I said well why would you ask me when you have a nice guy\nI mean God's at the top of the list I'm way down here somewhere\nGod you can go right to the head of the class has gone and you know it's a simple thing but it's so interesting to me how many Christians there are who struggle with issues in their life and it never dawned on them that they should ask on\nThe Bible says we are to ask God for what we need some Christians think petition or a prayer is the law form of per\nOne that is sometimes necessary but really unworthy of um a tour Christian\nThey see it like it centered on self and we should never ask for something for ourselves that is crazy the New Testament encourages us to offer these prayers when Jesus taught his disciples the model prayer to pray he filled with requests\nOnly for ideals like the advancement of God's kingdom but for our daily bread and our personal needs like food and forgiveness and deliverance from evil the Bible says when you pray pray for those things\nIn the sermon on them out Jesus invites us to pray prayers without holding back any promises those prayers will be heard and answer James who was the largest brother tells us our failure to replace our need before God explains why we do not have peace in our lives you have not\nAnswer James who was the large brother tells us our failure to place or need before God explains why we do not have peace in our lives you have not because you do not ask\nI remember preaching a nephew seven weren't says ask and she'll be given to you seem like it was sort of simple the word ask\nI thought it must be some English translation of a Greek word that was much more complicated than that so I looked up that we're in all of the dictionaries I look it up and all of the translation helps that I had an you know what I found out the word ... means it means ask [noise]\nIt's a simple little word it's a simple little word that means if you need something as for\nFor what you need so the partition of the over ... prayer men that's noticed the power of it the power of the ... and the next phrase praying always with all prayer and suffocation in this spirit\nWhat power drives our prayer it is the power of the Holy Spirit who lives within us\nThe Holy Spirit wrote the word of God and it's the same Holy Spirit who lives in your heart and lives in my heart\nAnd because he's the one with the father because of this he knows your intent what'd you pray he takes your fumbling prayers and re shapes them to reveal the deepest needs that are underneath the surface of your words and presents them perfectly to the father and haven't been that incredible\nThe Bible says in Romans ... the spirit helps us in our weakness\nFor we do not know what we should pray for as we ought\nBut the spirit himself makes intercession for us with groaning which cannot be occurred now he who searches the heart knows what the mind of the spirit is because he makes intercession for the saints\nAccording to the will of God when you pray the Holy Spirit is involved and here's the beauty of prayer who is ... dress to do the father\nWho praised the prayer you do who's in your heart the Holy Spirit who in their seats for you to the father the Holy Spirit where does the ... goes next it goes to the son of God who is at the right handed the father making intercession for the believer did\nYou notice that the holy trinity is involved Everytime you break the Holy Spirit in you Jesus Christ interceding and the father on the throne\n\nWell let's talk about the precision of the\nOver ... prayer here's the next phrase I'm just teaching this verse one phrase at a time\nPraying always with all prayer and suffocation in the spirit being watch full to this and what does it mean to be watchful well maybe it means to be awake [laughter] did you ever fall asleep when you were praying [noise]\nIt's All right to be honest I'm not telling anybody [noise]\nFrom describing the Christians armor to the subject of prayer notice higher returns this military imagery he does is because we face a real enemy to be up in a way means the battle is engaged to be watchful means we got her eyes open over\n... will understand that the enemy wants to attack you with distractions and doubts and temptations so that you don't pray so guard your prime time keep your prayers constantly flowing prioritize prayer is your plan your schedule and courage everything that feeds and fosters your prior life\nKeep your prayers constantly flowing\nPrioritize prayer is your plan your schedule and courage everything that feeds and fosters your prayer life and focus your prayers as you can get a plan for your prayer don't be willy nilly at praying do just pray whenever you felt like it because I promised or you won't feel like it as much as you should\nAnd then print doesn't get done and when ... doesn't get done a lot of other things get done that shouldn't get done\nBut if you don't know exactly what to pray for doing a void prayer or hesitate to pray trust that the intention of your prayers will be heard and\nUnderstood here's what cautions for too says continue earnestly in prayer being vigilant in it with Thanksgiving what does it mean to watch and pray it means to\nTake prayer seriously don't let it be an add on to your life making important in your life watch and pray I think sometimes that also means pray and then watch for what God's gonna do when you pray\nFor a long time during my sickness years ago I was writing in my journal every day and I would write my prayers out I still do that a lot of type of been my computer which you know what happens when you do that when you write your prayers out\nAnd you go back and look at them and you watch you see what God does when you pray you see we live a fluid life we pray over here and we forget what we prayed then got answers and we don't even remember that we prayed for watching and praying is connecting the prayer what the answer\nSaying all got to ask you look what God did and you know what happens when you do that and build your faith because if you prayed here got answered here and you pray here I guess what he's going to answer here\nSo watching pray may prayer part of your daily routine make it a part of your journal and make it a part of the notes you keeping your little black book\nOr your little ... book or whatever color of your book is\nAnd then notice number six the perseverance of the over ... prayer\nPraying always with all prayers suffocation in the spirit being watched bill through this and and it says we'll all perseverance if we're not careful prayers habit we can fall into and we can fall out of it too can't way\nIf you hit us snagging you've stopped praying for a little while don't let it throw you into a tailspin it is impossible to miss the point of the scriptures and bay continued steadfast\nAnd the apostles doctrine and in fellowship and the breaking of bread and in prayers X. six for says we will give ourselves continually to prayer\nRomans twelve twelve says rejoicing and hope patient and tribulation continuing steadfastly in prayer and let me tell you what I've learned over these years about how the enemy works is over when it comes to prayer\nHe has two strategies that he uses and you will identify with me immediately as soon as I tell you what these our number one\nHe comes to you after you've experienced too good days of prayer and convinces you that your prayer will always be that powerful and clear your a natural he says he whispers in your ear and and the third and fourth day when the sparks don't ignite and your parents don't seem to get out of your room he'll come and say well now\nWe see who you really are you may as well give up there is no use trying any more Europe really sorry prayer and when you experience what feels like failure remembered that you're a momentary feelings are never a barometer of your spiritual life feelings\nAre not necessary for your spiritual life there are a blessing when they come\nLife feelings are not necessary\nFor your spiritual life there are a blessing when they come but they don't necessarily have to come if you only pray when you feel like it you won't pride\nIf you only are happy and Jesus when you feel like being happy and Jesus you gonna be happy and Jesus very much sometimes when I pray it seems like the heavens open and God's presence is right there in my room other times when I pray my words seem heavy and almost like they fall to the floor instead of going up to God\nBut those flat prayers are just as valuable as the ones when I feel like God is in the room because I'm being obedient and I'm praying and when I pray God has promised to answer and he doesn't say I'll answer only when you feel like I'm going to answer he will answer\nGod's word year month turning point weekend edition Mm\nWhat an honor it is to have Jay burning muggy back own W ...

it's really an opportunity for him to start his [noise]\nThis is the alternative with Dr Tony ...\nAuthor speaker senior pastor booklet Bible fellowship in Dallas texas president of the urban alternative [noise]\nIt often turns out that the times when we need God most are the times we trust him at least but that can change for you today as Dr Evans tells a story about a man who face the toughest challenge any parent can imagine let's join him\nThat we all have trials trials are adverse circumstances that the law allows in our lives\nTo both identify where we are spiritually and to prepare us for waste taking us that would be a general understanding of trials there's no way to escape them\nYou're even in a trial just come out of a trial are getting ready to go into a new trial\nInescapable realities of life that have\nThrough God's hands first nothing that comes our way comes your way without divine approval\nIn order for it to get a divine approval and has to have a divine reasons for coming your way and so God allows trials to come our way in order to reveal where we are all along our spiritual journey and to develop us further\nMuch like a stress test when you go to the doctor and you get on the treadmill and they put all the contraptions on you\nTo read the condition of hide it lets the doctor no way you are so they can let\nYou know the patient where we are in his or revealing aspect\nBut it reveals for the purpose of correcting whatever happens to be wrong if there is something wrong\nThat you might pass the test better next time\nI'm Talking about now not testing in general but a certain kind of test\nOut a good friend a he's a football coach for the University of Texas and as a member of a church and uh I I talked to him all the time I I was seeing that often but he calls me a\nProfusely\nAbout anything he'll call me actually used to be my friend he called me so [noise] and when when something is is is there is an issue\nYou used to be my friend he called me [noise] and when\nWhen something is is is there\nIs an issue facing them you don't get what time it is your comment one in the morning for in the morning and he will call me

[noise]\nWhen he says I'm In a trick bag what he is saying is I'm In a catch twenty two\n[noise]\nHe's not just saying I have a problem if they have a certain kind of problem the kind of problem that I have is insane to me is a catch twenty\nTwo it's a lose lose deal\nIn other words anyway are anywhere I turn on the news this is not a win win proposition if it was a clear win lose that I Know now I'm kind of clear which way I should go but what do you do when you're caught between a rock and a hard place\nThat is it's a catch twenty two it's a lose lose bill\nAnybody ever been in a lose lose there\nAny way either way you turn is a problem\nAnd you're just trying to figure out what was the least problem and what I Want to try to address is what do you do when God put you in a catch twenty two that's unique kind of trial because that kind of trial always means God is getting ready to do something special in your life\nIt's not\nThis was not the ordinary development this is accelerated activity in your life when\nGod put you in a lose lose deal where there is no clear direction you can turn without\nThere being a problem any decision is potentially the wrong one that is because God is getting ready to do\nA substantial thing in your life\nI said that this shows up all through the Bible although I didn't catch it I Would just see it as a trial as\nI was going through the Bible until I saw this pattern emerging where God would actually\nCreate contradiction in genesis chapter twenty two in the story of course of Abraham sacrifice a magic\nDaughter made a covenant with Abraham there was a gram at covenant that he was going to bless Abraham and Abraham would be a blessing this would require a miracle Abraham is are\nNow getting up in age and it would be a twenty five\nYear white from the time that the promises made and tell the promises realize that's pretty long wait\nNow it came about first one after these things that God tested Abraham and send them a brand and he said here I Am\nTake now your son your only son who you love\nIsaac and go to the land of Mariah and offer him there as a burn offering on one of the mountains which I Will tell you\nKnow that's a pretty thick request take your son only son\nOnly be got letters be gotten out of the the union with your wife\nWho you know\nOnly son only be gotten that has gotten out of the union with your wife\nWho you love and\nSacrifice him on them out now that perhaps\nThe request God is telling him to kill the promise he made him he says through you\nI'm going to make through your whole integrate nation but I think as a single late teenager if you kill him\nHe can't become a great nation because he doesn't have any children but the contradiction gets worse this this\nChild sacrifice God fair\nShall not take the life of another person\nIs your father God is contradicting God so watch us now\nHe comes to the place where God told him build an author Ursula stretched out his hand and took the life just slaying son the angel of the lord call to him and said\nBram Abraham and he said here I Am same thing he said but he left he said do not stretch out your hand against the lab and do nothing to him for now I Know that you fear me feared God sent you have not won held your son your only son\nFrom me perhaps I Know now that you're talking tall but I don't know if ... you can stay at

place is asked you for your Isaac [noise]\nWhat is your eyes the thing you love most the thing you treasure most the thing you value most or one of the things you value most that you hold dear to your heart you waited a hundred years first son you finally get want and you gotta\nGive it up especially when as a promise that still it's a rock and a hard place it's a catch twenty two now look at what happens\nEverywhere I'm raises eyes and looked at me all behind him a ramp caught in the ticket buyers on and that was a mighty choir Iran does Ramadan made a bit of noise\nHe now and seeing the promise he's been waiting for twenty five years come totally true in his life\nAnd if it becomes a powerful powerful testimony of what James is saying the New Testament Christians that one guard cause you to do our work even when that work makes absolutely no sense whatsoever\nYou're going to find out the supernatural entering into the natural turn back the Hebrew strap deliver\nThe great chapter on face\nThe reason this story keeps popping up this cause God wants to make a powerful point to us all burst Seventeen by Faye Faye brand when he was tested offered up I can we go again as genesis twenty two\nAnd he had received the promise was offering up his only be gotten son it was he to who was saying in Isaac your descendants Shelby called that the contradiction\nHe didn't set it now now we're told whatever happened was thinking when he got up that bone he considered that God is able to raise people even from the dead from which she also receive them back\nA type I Want to say two things as we bring this to a conclusion he believes something\nYou said themselves we got a little problem here God\nHas told me to kill my only be gotten son and he tells you problem inverse Eighteen

contradiction here we have something that makes absolutely no sense therefore\nCan't we have a contradiction here we have something that makes absolutely no sense therefore\nI'm going to have to obey God 'cause it's gone and told me to do it but if the contradictions that he told me to do\nSo I got a bank on guard miracle working power because he says what does he considered I mean the thinking about this thing the reason I'm going to go I'm going to obey\nHim is because he is able to raise people from the dead\nHe ended up buying on the fact that the dog who we couldn't understand have power to overrule the confusion he had the bike on the ... he had that by going out Republicans in when he didn't understand missions let me explain something by God God is the arm figure out a book on\nHis way to not always his thoughts are not are far as our dog will give you an exaggerated PM headache if you try to the game out do spend a lot of time and I don't do it when they go do and where are you gonna do it he ain't going to tell you [noise]\nHe's not going to tell you until it's time to do it and the reason why you're not going to tell you is he wants you to discover him at a whole nother level\nAnd I am it's not just a Christian Abraham is a friend of God\nHe is a God who sees the supernatural in the natural that's why is that the last sentence averse Nineteen is so powerful he said he got\nBut not just as a man\nType in the Bible or type in something physical\nThat represent something greater spiritual you know like a sacrifices or type of Christ\nThat's a representation in the Old Testament of something that's going to be spiritually provided in the New Testament he says when Abraham got Isaac\nThat was not just a physical resurrection point physical father in a physical situation he says that resurrection is a tight\nOr a representation of something that has a ritual principles that you and I learned from the scourge of principle here today it's really simple it is\nThat God is able to soup when naturally work in the contradictions of life to bring about things that are ...\nYou just have to know enough about God the no he is able to raise the debt we were caught in our church a number of years ago and a contradictory\nSituation we were told we had to move out of the school we were meeting in when we were a lot smaller\nWe had to move out of the school and ah by the school board separation of church and state will get more serious so we were meeting in school because you have to move out and um and we didn't have a place to go\nWhere no place to meet and we have a few hundred people now are so at this time and they were giving us thirty they notice or something like that and we had no place to go\nSo we were in a contradictory situation we look for a place to look for a place to look for a place we were told no no place to go so we're now down to the last week with no place for a few other people to be\nA back so against the wall with sent a letter to the school board asking for an extension we got a letter back but\nOur backs are against the wall with sent a letter to the school board asking for an extension we've gotten a letter back but says no extension possible because the majority of the school board was against it\nBut they weren't going to have another meeting one final meeting to confirm that ah the decision that preliminary had already been made and that that decision would be made prior to this last Sunday we was posed me so we pray\nAgainst the wall no place to me and we're going we're using was no longer be available to us the meeting was going to be held and we were going to go there to find that decision and me and uh\nOne of our pastors with me or the ... as they behind closed doors\nMade a decision we sat down\nIt was like\nTwo o'clock it's supposed to begin it's now three thirty\nAnd nothing's happening\nFinally one of the school board members comes out of room and they said\nWe can't quite figure this out but the two main people who are against you have not gotten to the meeting yet\nAnd that would've made like five four okay they are not here at the meeting and we can't wait any longer so we voted with the ones who are here and and uh so you have been granted joy extension for three when she goes back\nTo come on in the door [noise] huffing and puffing we're sorry when I saw ...\nThat was an accident on the highway at\nTo get off to come to the school board meeting [noise]\nThey were riding together\nThey were stuck in traffic\nFor an almost an hour and a half ago this was lay when the decision was made\nThat moment they came rushing in which would have made it\nA gangster settle for three four I Will never\nUs up between a rock and a hard place so to discover something about God that I Would never have had the opportunity to discover if I hadn't been put\nBetween a rock and a hard place in a catch twenty two\nThat was a big fight with my three [noise] what God wanted me to learn from Isaac\nIs what I experienced that day so the next time got back you up against the wall and you know between a rock and a hard place and in a catch twenty two while you may get a little panicky remember how great you got it\n'cause it's really an opportunity for him to strengthen his stuff\nOn your behalf God Bless you [noise]\nIf you're not that difficult panicky point

amount contact is a Tony Evanston or for the details or reach out to a resource center at one eight hundred eight hundred three two two two\nRight now the doctor evidence is back to wrap up our time together with a word of prayer\nEight hundred three two two two right now the ... back to wrap up our time together with a word of prayer\nFather thank you for the word of God that goes forth through this ministry ... every year the years that I pray that you will use the word in the life of each person individually so that they know that they are hearing from you and are transformed by what they hear\nI pray the vet transformation touches them at their place of me wherever they are hurting struggling wherever they're in pain or wherever they're celebrating may be the center of that and maybe they be able to say because of the word that they heard because of the true God that they're interacting with right now that you have showed up\nAnd shown off on their behalf\nDoing good by them no matter what the circumstances happen to me\nHow you're going to touch every listening today in your own special way and Jesus [noise]\nDestruction will come upon them suddenly like labor pains upon a woman with child\nDestruction will come upon them suddenly like labor pains upon a woman with child and they will not escape but you'd rather not in darkness that the day would overtake you like a thief Christ is coming\nNot as if the if the believer we welcome his coming we we opened the doors for him to come we say with John even sell come Lord Jesus\nHe's coming to us as a welcome lord and we want him to come the sooner the better\nBut you won believers this is a dire reality the dire reality\nIs coming in judgment is coming like a thief comes to kill and destroy and steal that's the picture in the New Testament\nSo the first command in as to the non believers in the congregation wake up before judgment come wake up before judgment comes\nThe second word is strength and strengthen\nThe things that remain which were about to die this would be the believers this would be to the believers\nRescue what remains rescue what is left there\nAre still some hope would say that to a person in a church like that if there's anything that hasn't died\nIf there's any truth if there's any virtue if there's any purity anywhere\nRescue that do what you can to rescue that that's the reformation that's the revival\nAnd then in verse three remember remember what you have received and heard and keep it\nAnd repent I think again this is directed at\nBelievers remember\nThe truth that you received and heard hold onto it\nAnd repent of any sin to the unbelievable wake up to the remaining believers strengthen what is still alive even if it's barely alive remember what you received and heard from the apostles of course from the lord\nHold it and repent wherever repentance\nIs near wherever it's available wherever it's possible repent turn and if you if you don't do these things I Will come to destroy\nSome of these churches have been destroyed but they still go through the motions to the dead\nWatch repent\nTo the sleeping remember repent\nTo the faithful strength and hold\nTo the truth is amazingly amazingly precise careful council\nTo people who are believers in the church and the dead people as well I find a word of council and versus inverse five actually then we'll look at Burr six he overcomes\nHere comes the primacy overcomes what what do you what do you mean he ... over comes\nJohn uses that in throughout these letters and to understand it you have to go back to his pistol first John five five\nWho is the one who overcomes the world but he believes that Jesus is the son of God so when he picks up the turnover comer he's referring to someone who believes that Jesus is\nBut he's the Jesus is the son of God so when he picks up the turnover comer he's referring to someone who believes that Jesus is the son of God\nSo to those who are believers\nThose of you who are already believers and those of you wake up and repent to those of you overcome the world you will be closed\nWhite garments what he means by that is the garments of righteousness we mentioned earlier and ultimately revelation chapter Nineteen the garments of glory in the ancient world white stood for festivity as it does even now for weddings\nIn the ancient world white stood for victory white stood for purity for all these reasons or the governments of the believer in glory will be white fine linens I read you an revelation Nineteen white as the brilliance of glory\nIf you will repent and remember\nAnd strengthen and hold fast if you will overcome by your faith in Christ you will be closed in white garments the faithful garments of eternity eternal life\nAnd then he says this and that will not a racist name from the book of life very interesting comment I Will not raise his name from the book of life that's a very important from first of all rulers of cities had\nCensus they had the name of all the citizens they kept records of the citizens even as people do today your name could be a race than it would be a race to ways basically one if you died [noise]\nYour name would be raised to if you committed some crime against the state you would lose your citizenship your name would be erased\nBut God will never erase the name of his own out of the book of life\nBeing overcome or put your trust in Christ believe in Christ Jesus as the son of God and you will be eternally clothes in white garments and even when you die your name will never be erased from the book of life\nWhich had time to trace through the Bible the the term the book of life it's in the Libyans for it appears again several times in the book of revelation it is God's book in which he keeps the record of those who have eternal life\nBack an extra thirty to thirty three just a footnote\nGod Speaks about someone being removed from the book of life but that's a completely different context that as a um\nA kind of an expression meaning an untimely death untimely death that's a different setting altogether he got is saying and exit is thirty three you could die but when it comes to that heavenly book of life\nNo one whose name is written there will ever be removed\nNo matter what crime we make committed forgiving\nAnd even when we die we enter into eternal glory under no circumstances would I raise your name\nPetty kings might do that I Would never do it revelation twenty twelve I saw the dead the great in the small standing before the throne and the books were open another book was open which is the book of life and the dead or judge from the things which are written in the books according to their deeds the dead\nOn converted are judged by books that people\nAnd for judge from the things which are written in the books according to their deeds the dead\nOn converted are judged by books that keep a record of their sin but our names are in the book of life\nOne final hopeful comment at the end averse five and I will confess his name before my father and before his angels if you will repent wakeup repent remember\nPut your trust in Christ I will close you in the white linens of eternal life\nI Will never erase your name from the book of life and I personally will confess your name before my father and before his angels Matthew ten thirty to Jesus said this whoever confessed as me before\nMen I'll confess before my father who is in heaven genuine faith in Christ means that we receive all these promises eternal life never to be removed\nTo be confessed as Christ's own before his father before the holy angels and then the final word in VR six you as an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches are you listening that's how each of these ends as you plants back you can see it\nAre you are listening if you are dead in ... wake up and repent and come to Christ if you are\nSaved but sleeping and indolent and indifferent and worldly remember and holds it fast and strengthen and if you are vibrant and alive\nCount your blessings and your eternal promises that way you so what happened in ... what was the response there was a little bit of hope\nMen name Alito\nWho was pastor there and he was a pastor several decades after this letter was delivered several decades and he was a faithful man that historically argues for the fact\nThat there may well have been a revival in ... some of those who were dead came to life some of those who were a\nLittle indifferent remembered the truth that they had heard and strengthened what remained and held fast\nTo Christ and there are those that are alive but barely\nIndifferent cold danger of leaving their first love compromising with the world
