about a couple of things going on yellow hammer news dot com go check that out right now yellow hammer new dot com talked about a couple of stories that are coming from there\nBut before we do we were having a conversation in the first hour and his first our conversation contained everything from skinny jeans too\nWhy did God allow the Holocaust happened we had a wide array of topics here but there is something that was really interesting to me and dealing talked about during one of the breaks\nThat we have not had a chance to uh that we you know just kind of lay the groundwork for conversation but I hadn't had the ability to talk about it on air as of yet because you know we always want to take your calls take your questions take your thoughts\nEight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three is number to join the conversation again that's eight six six\nFive five one Ninety nine thirty three so your\nThan I've been waiting for that I've been waiting for you to come in with its dialed time a little bit of that better says yes\nMaybe oh I'm just gonna have to wait until later that's fine I keep expecting you to play it now but so we've been talking a little bit about a little bit of everything a little bit of everything\nI Do want to bring up this idea that you were talking about doing that you had said was a theory for how God operates and without you know I Know it's early I Know it's friday but I think it's a really interesting thought process because I've never thought about it this way\nSo the question that I posed to I'm One of our regular callers who's very insightful when it comes to the Bible very well versed was a conversation that I've had with multiple people as a blade of all ages I've had it with my friends who are\nTwenty one years old and I've had it with my ah grandfather's Ninety five years old who fought in World War two and a liberated concentration camps and that is how does an all knowing and all loving God allow for something like the Holocaust\nTo happen and again I don't have the answers that's why I'm posing the question um because it is something that tripped me up honestly and I feel like you know whenever you get on radio or television or you hear somebody preaching they um a lot of the times they're supposed to be there looked up to these people that like have\nYou get on radio or television or you hear somebody preaching they um a lot of the times they're supposed to be there looked up to these people that like have the answers I don't think that's the right way to think about it at all I think uh especially when it comes to preaching\nThose people are going through the same exact struggles you are going through they can just see the biblical basis for why it's happening and where it's coming from and um\nAnd they can invoke allies it a little bit better that's why they're there that's why I got place than their God didn't place than there is somebody who can see what you're dealing with and then talk about it now he place and there is somebody that's dealing with the same things you're dealing with\nSo I Do not have the answer to this and I think the same goes for a talk show host commentators et cetera\nEven what we do here I don't have all the answers all the time that's why I really enjoy these discussions that we have with callers and what Dylan's and with gas Dylan's flirt with multiple Dylan's they cycle through and then I Would guess that we have on the program I but that is a question I've never been able to answer and that is\nWhy does God allow for terrible things to happen such as the Holocaust the murdering of six million Jews and ten million people overall so Dylan what do you ... what was the theory that you propose during the last break as to why God allows for these things to happen\nSo it really realize a lot on free will so if you don't believe in free will go ahead and tune out for the next two minutes\nHe is acutely aware of veterans of the

I. D. E. [noise]\nBack into the wakeup call ladies and gentlemen eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three is the number to join the conversation again that eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three we're talking about a really interesting topic and that is the topic of essentially\nWhy did God\n... potentially allow for the Holocaust happened right it's it's a very very\nInteresting topic one that I Do not know the answer to yeah it's uh\nBilly allow for the Holocaust happened right it's it's a very very interesting topic one that I Do not know the answer to yeah it's a ... and with James has actually just stepped\nIn I'm I'm just cover for doing for a little bit you had to step out and do some what did you just say yeah it's\nIt's a conversation topic that was brought up during the five o'clock hour\nRight and it was Henry called in and I asked him the question because it was it basically the concept we were talking about is why does God allow for bad things that happened and is there a plan and all things right and it was referring back to call in which somebody had lost a child right and that's one of the most tragic scenarios that can happen and so\nI'm a buddy of mine his brother there are two months old just passed away two days ago\nSo I'm so I'm very sorry that's so it's I mean bad things happen yeah but\nAnd so yeah the idea the concept that we're discussing that we're talking about today is and what I asked hindering is I've had a conversation with somebody that's twenty two and I've had a conversation with Ninety five and both of them asked the question you know how could it all knowing all loving God allow for a Holocaust\nTo happen and I didn't have the answer and so I asked him and he proposed a really good um scenario basically there is a reasoning for all things and free will as a factor than men do and I've had a conversation about it and the call boards lit up people in to talk about it\nSo sin is a factor so tell me what you mean by that [noise]\nWere given free will not to get into the deep theological stuff 'cause if you truly truly truly truly want to try to understand why the white guy does what he does [laughter]\nYou're going to be studying for a while [laughter] and you'll never really know but\nSome theology looks at so you got free will ... and free will is a pain in the butt to put it nicely um because you have the you can do good things you can do bad things ... you have to pay for the bad things you get praise for the good things yeah right and that's\nSecular life and religious life right [noise] um but since then\nHas an overwhelming\nEffect on everything ... and because of original sin and all that is if you dig deep enough into theology you'll see that most of a lot of people believe that the diseases\nWe have wars the fame in ... allowing quote unquote allowing this to happen\nYeah as penance it's a worldwide penance ... percent the children dying elderly dying somebody being a top their game one day and the next day they find out they have staged for terminal cancer\nAnd I can understand the pennants aspect if it was across the board right if it was across the board but I don't understand the penance factor\nIt's just centralized like because we're there more people than Jews killed during the Holocaust absolutely but it was just it was six million Jews that were killed during the Holocaust um and so it seems like\nThat penance factor I don't understand why worldwide penance would be targeted and such a way but let's get out to your phone calls eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three and it's eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three let's go to Steve on line one Steve how're you doing [noise]\nI'm doing great thanks for taking my call\nNo problem I'm Sorry it took so long we just have a lot of people that want to get a lot of opinions on it\nOut totally get it I I'm just a couple of things you're out\nYou know I Try to make a big deal about the Holocaust and rightly so you've ever been over there and seen any of this stuff that happened is it's just absolutely horrible that terrible things happen all around the world\nYou know there's been almost ten million people killed in Central Africa genocide of cleaning the last Fifteen\nTerrible things happen all around the world but\nYou know there's been almost ten million people killed in Central Africa\nGenocidal cleaning the last Fifteen Years and we don't really speak that much about it yeah yeah you go to the you know Joseph Stalin killed more people than the Holocaust killed inside the country so there's all sorts of horrible things happen to more than just the Jews but I Would disagree with the whole\nThe whole concept of original sin and then three will you start talking about the standing clock theory you can't use the standing clock theory and then come back later on and say well here's what it says in revelations coming up yeah well there's if it's free will\nThen the revelations things goes out the door you can't then say well this is what's coming up\nOkay Dylan disagrees with that done done it and this is just again a discussion not a debate so why do you not agree with that\nSaid the free standing ... model doesn't completely throughout the idea of predestination it doesn't say that God can't step in and redirected the clock to ... to the correct time to sit his plan it just it makes more sense or free\nWill than anything else I've ever heard but I understand it leaves are dominant Ruth\n... but I Would agree with that my only problem is this is why people don't come to religion because it's so dense in what we're talking\nAbout right here is a completely manmade interpretation there's nothing in any book that says anything about this yeah so we we are interpreting something to make it fit the way we want it to sit so maybe the only\nReal answer is the book or reading is it really right\nWe are trying to make something makes sense of something that does not\nAnd if it was really if we wanted to have a God wanted us to understand and and approach him silly here's a pathway for you to come close to me why do you make it so complex that nobody can understand it and we have to sit here and interpret things why not spell it out clearly what you have to do\nThat and I I tell this young child a young child would see this as they would look at you like this doesn't make any sense at all and then you wonder why there's fewer and fewer people in churches is because it doesn't make any sense\nWell in the mid ... there there is to counter so that and hey that is why faith is supposed\nTo uh step into instead of really good quote a man we'll never know the intentions of God or something like that before he stepped away\nMy that young men will never know the intention that God so that's where they stepped into play and I think that that quote the villains that is very true and also um the things that are worth it in his life I mean this is something that's true across the board of the things that are worth and it's like we're never going to come easy you know if if if\nThe so say Steve Jobs like the creation of apple we can say that's a worldly goods right that's worldly success [noise] that didn't come easy to him right he it was something that took more and more and more work now and if we're going to talk about salvation right salvation is better than any worldly access\nThat could ever happen so why do we expect for that to come easy [noise]\nTo get to work or\nNot that you have to work for it but that there's there there's foundation and there's understanding right you can be saved because he believed Jesus Christ the savior of the universe but then there's a deeper understanding of the biblical text and the how to live and I think that's normal that's with any faith set throughout history\nOr you know astrophysics as they're growing up ... ... and you know in specific terms you know what\nThe Bible speaks to that in that new Christians or young children are given the milk of God's word and you just explained it perfectly the basic tenets of what you need to believe is that Christ died on the crossing roasting a grave that's\nTeaching a child that part is very easy to do and they will accept that but as you mature as a Christian just as you mature as an adult\nYou get the meat of God's word and then you can actually start digging into much deeper theology mhm and\nYou know it there's this idea of religion is what drives people away from the church is just not an accurate statement it's\nIt's vein or religion it's overdoing it it's man coming up with his own\nTypes of religion and and over emphasizing this point to that point yes Christ even says\nThat you know I'm not here to do away with all this because there's an old religion of religion the older than the Catholic Church is a religion older than the Christian Church ...\nAnd it goes back to the beginning so religion and ended up subs not a bad thing it's it's a ritual lipstick thing it's just whether or not you make it vein out the I\nAnd it goes back to the beginning so religion and ended up itself is not a bad thing it's it's a ritual lipstick thing it's just whether or not you make it vein now\nThe idea that ah why why does God let bad things happen and James really hit the nail on the head when he said it's has to do with the original sin\nThe whole point of humanity was to bring honoring glory to Christ in light of the angels rebellion mhm so what we do in our lives should reflect crisis should bring gory to him but it\nJust said that a World War two is somehow the worst thing that ever happened in history is just not an accurate statement was it bad yes did six million Jews die yes but there was millions of Christians that died along with them yeah\nAnd I wasn't asserting but it was the worst thing that happened but it is a monumental large thing but it was very negative\nRight but we need to pull back from the microscopic viewpoint to a macro viewpoint and look at the whole entire a\nScheme of things that whole entire record of history and we see the wars have existed from\nShortly after the dawn of time certain or at least as far as recorded history goes and that's that can be made secular or religious argument yeah\nSo when we pull back and look at the overall thing evil exists because that exists God allowed it to happen because man is supposed to be finding their own way\nHopefully that way leads them to Christ but\nYou know the old adage that for an evil to persist all it takes us for good men to do nothing and that's what World War two as an example of match what the genocide in Africa as an example of that's the direction that you know possibly that Crimea was going in\nBut more often than not man will stand back and let evil happen ... rather than intervening because it comes down to sit and I I allow other people to send because I have my own sin and I'm too embarrassed to speak up about it yeah and if I challenged them on their sin and that means my son will be exposed you know\nI mean a minimum to give you a ... I mean you're a I think you hit the nail right on the morning\nAt well I mean I could go for hours on this\nYeah it's a very interesting topic I Wish we had one of those long foreign ... where you could sit and talk for four or five hours on this topic because I think people really do want this conversation I think this is something that a lot of people\nThink about it it's what has kept people up at night for years I mean look at my Ninety five year old grandfather who still thinking about this very topic\nAnd and I and I don't I don't know what that's like to have actually seen those people in the concentration camps I've seen the pictures and everything but just get them to pull back again from the older you get to the overhead you stop focusing on that which is a tough thing to do ... but we really do over complicates things\nSalvation is so simple it's not even funny you know it you know is exactly like you said it's just belief in Christ ... and that he died on the crossing roasting the grave that's not that hard to figure out now when you get into the works that come from the faith that you develop and believing that\nThat gets a little more complicated but again milk lead you into meat\nMhm amen brother I appreciate him are you sir I Want us\nAll right let's go out to see who's next up on the list is going to John online to John how you doing\nYou're Warner ... this is ... or ... that was a great record had thank you or ... I\nJust wanted to ... uh I don't really call him but\nJust really wanted to say that\nThat was a great great caller you had thank you I Want I just wanted to really ah I don't really call in but\nUh just really wanted to say that you know there's there's I think a couple of things that we can keep in mind when dealing with\nA question is larger as large as of this ... or ... and you hit it a little bit as you know his thoughts or not our thoughts his ways are not always ... um I think a lot of people that call in with a question or a lot of people that punter questions um are really\nQuestioning or are struggling with the perfect uh the idea of a perfect perfectly just perfectly um ... guide and I think a couple of things that can help us as we we have to we have to read our Bible I'm hearing a lot of\nCallers come into it and it's clear that they have a misunderstanding of original sin um predestination for it and free will but at the Holocaust one thing that we can uh realize at the end of it is that God brought about the nation of Israel that we see today\nOn a may fourteenth Nineteen forty eight which is in accordance with biblical proxy ah they recapture Jerusalem shortly thereafter in Nineteen sixty seven mhm and we can even see the world stage today or as we shift in recognizes Jerusalem\nAs the capital of Israel and God's not done with a nation of Israel and God is not a done with the church who is actively restraining evil in the world of today\nAre so really I think\nPraying for wisdom and discernment and reading a and and you're absolutely right and my my six year olds can understand that the basic fundamentals of salvation but I can also spend my lifetime or studying the Bible and and never be a never you know and never have have it all yeah that's all that\nAnd I appreciated jumping to listen to thanks for calling God Bless you All right let's head out to Fred on line for Fred how you doing\nAnd you're more in the morning been married now\nAnd then pastor I enjoy your show you got a real where there is a good topic um let me tell you sing ...

brand new eyeballs or you know I I gotta go have surgery to next we have a cataracts removed but um but I had the uh the surgery done for my torn retina\nIt allowed me to to read up close when Nazi distances so technically near sighted and are now a sudden I'm looking outside I can look out the window and see my truck and see the clouds in this guy before just making it up\nIt's not raining so must be clear\nWell you know you know it's bad when you go to McDonalds or wherever and you got to take a picture of the menu board\nWell Michael to be honest and to be completely transparent you do that here in the studio you take pictures of the TV so you can see what a ticker tape at\nThe bottom a lot because there's a TV in here [laughter] we get that I mean I think people think I'm kidding\nI'm Serious I'm driving to work it was one of them and and I you know I call her and she's like is everything okay I'm like\nYou wouldn't believe what's out here [laughter]\n'cause you don't normally you know the last few years when I drive to work in the morning I just follow the car in front of me and then there's no guard in front of a you know sometimes I get lost but I'm ... oh yeah but you know you know it's bad when you have to stop it every single traffic light and then look up and see what color it is [laughter]\n... if you all can see the expression every time so you know Michael has his own expression is but when he takes the glasses off and he's talking you know micro hard then you put the glasses back on every time he puts the glasses back on you seen the videos at the little babies who get the hearing aids\nAnd all of a sudden their eyes get big and they get the smile on their face and the whole world is open up to him that's Michael heart\nWanted to say a new law that I read\nThe UC\nYou said you know\n[noise]\nMan who\nWas the name\nIn New ... ... ... the most ... most right\nDo a very dear to my [noise]\nAnd I'm On the news and then\nTo the [noise]\nRon let's share\nNever man yeah\nI have six section five or nine nine three three and let's get it right out to the phones and I can't think of a better way to start this ...\nOr the gym there more than Jim how are you\nPretty good like I said hey let's step back you know like ... which is not Jesus Christ is the right thing or the mother said and just throwing\nThat out there a guy anyway\nThat's because the idiot in the previous program\nHer mother said and just throwing that out there\nOkay Hi anyway\nThat that's because the idiot and the previous program thinks the immaculate conception is Jesus Christ\nAnd I saw the idea I mean I've had an argument so many times over the air\nThank you might see Mike stood up for re against James James it's been after me today to I don't know what it is probably they should like\nBecause you start screaming because you're not listening to the radio what I'm saying\nNo I agree with you it's because I was calling you didn't hear you\n'cause you're a hard hitting a marine as what it is but go ahead lately ... hey I'm\nGetting on to the discussion of ah what you were ... now you threw me off a bike I got nothing\n[laughter] right that's a yeah Hi Jim I'm saving this for four days you had no idea how much of this audience appreciates this call because you've got not [laughter]\nI I I got fired up about that guy in the previous program and I wanted to clarify\nHis comment and I've drawn a line drawn a blank as soon as I hang up you know what'll happen\nYou're going to email me with what you're thinking about\n[laughter] anyway\nJust quickly did you guys see that video I sent you about that a that a sergeant major got his medal of honor\nMm I watch the Fox news clip to\nWasn't a wasn't that just wonderful it's so nice that these ... and you know I'm not a big guy I'll just look like the Vietnam veterans Vietnam was dangerous from the time you stepped off the plane in the day okay I get it but you know veterans talk about oh\nI did two tours in Vietnam\nI did six most year monitored a military guys have done four five six James I'm sure a with Eighteen airborne corps you know guys who'd done seven or eight tours okay\nA but it was really nice to see a guy from the Vietnam Era awarded the medal of honor for because or did they just weren't recognized enough and that dude was eighty years old sergeant major gun restarted thought but sergeant major\nGetting his medal of honor now before I go a\nJames verify this because I'm sure he saw a lot more of these guys when you see that\nBlue ribbon with stars regardless of the right James when you're in the commissary whatever what do you do you saloon\nYour render a hands theloop and I only saw that two or three times before the war started and there was a I'm\nAn old master sergeant that had been in Vietnam you know and uh he had his medal of honor with his Charlie's that's a khaki shirt and the green trousers and everybody was theloop name as you just walking by and that was the ... that's a penalty\nAnd so a guy came by and he said that's it you know another marine that I'd seen is saluting the are we slipping taught for and he said that Lance corporal go take a look in his room to see what you see and so you went around it but that is the only time that you're writing your hands other than what are your posting information\nBut that is the only time to render ahead salute to another uh enlisted guy but uh I just you know what I could watch every single a medal of honor ceremony regardless of the branch and just enjoy it from beginning to end\nAnyway before I start turning into Henry I'll let you guys go\nTo a gym bridges are very much [laughter] and I think we have a a perhaps counter to that is we have Baylor golf\nIs there very much [laughter]\nAnd I think we have a a perhaps counter to that is we have Baylor calling in hello Baylor how are you\nVery good Michael how are you I just think it's a funny that Jim likes to call it after the show because he doesn't have the intestinal fortitude to call it stay on a debate me on my own show so if you like you either loved him to do anything but it's not you can keep running to the teacher out for the show then that's pretty cute\nOh if I didn't have interviews Israel did I [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] they\nMail ever think Baylor and and and so Jim knows what topic didn't mean you have a conversation a short conversation right before I walked in Studio\nThat exact conversation and didn't I tell you that I was an expert but I was just trying to have a discussion on it to further my understanding and the listeners\nYep and you told me I did not know that a lot of people don't including Catholics so\nYup yup and I think it's funny last Jim won't call in anymore because last time he did I made them look like a full so I guess than there is that\nYeah you know earlier today where I'm walking down and get some coffee and James looks to me and it goes it's going to be one of those kind of days and I thought what do you mean he says I just have the sense is going to be one of those kind of days well Baylor apparently he was right\n[noise] I Love your love you guys keep up with a great show\nBags rather appreciate are very much well okay\nAnd we got Fred calling in and he was getting a piece of this as well hello Fred how are you\nFrom Marshall County I'm owning a freaky friday\nYou're reading your report okay look and are in earlier shows is always a\nCriticizing the branches of service ... Hayes I ...\nI Love the Marines I wouldn't have been in the air force I'm a Vietnam veteran that was on the ground in the air force that's what I was in jail for Marshall County I was getting airstrikes to save your ass\nGo criticizing the air force the army\nOr all the navy or anything like that because you were one of them Marine Corps Barney or being a ... a only a what's his name is\nHow I should write about that's probably what you were going to file\nHe'll make criticized for nobody out for him at rice like your but was airstrikes only go have a nice thing a\nPredator brief shaded hey yo give us a call at eight six one nine nine three three as we continue the carpet bombing of Marshall County hello Joe how are you\nI'm fine go\nYes okay hey I Want to do is just a a briefly mentions how big as a fact that you might find amazing you got a little a little more talking about Obama's golf trips and how the conservatives were raising cane about that or their arms up in the air and now the debt that the liberals are the Democrats are in their arms up in the air about Donald Trump scalp trip\nYeah I found that a couple of facts that I wanted to know about first of all Donald Trump has never never\nThe federal government or the government in general to pay for his golf trips is paid for every single dollar trip by himself with his own personal credit card that's fighting over one number two if anybody really wants to realize that these are all factual I can verify because my brother\nWell I've got a bomber as horrible racket ball in the middle of a war on terrorism\nActual longer because I'd rather go all the shows ... well that's about it in the middle of war on terrorism is Thursday executive order as president in the United states was every holy Bible removed from the White House an earthquake\nThat may sound like you're ... years ago or so I Would have thought so too but the person that gives me every bit of the nation is about whether God loving twenty three years protective detail United States are grocers\nJar we appreciate the call you obviously you know we can't verify that because you know distributed either no now but you know going back to what to bust of Winston Churchill cetera you know Obama did in fact have some curious behaviors when it came to decorating\nYeah and I was embarrassed when anybody about any of the golfing ... scream it's funny how the conservatives the main talking point once on was golfing now the weapons I mean talking point his goal right it was just wanting to go back and forth with their own talking points which are the exact same talking points were just putting a different after\nYeah you know are the people are are miracle of this country you know that's what America the root word is miracle you know we took on the revolutionary war against the British we want we weren't supposed to win that\nYou know or the civil war ... look everyone thought Trump wasn't gonna when they bet against the people in the people always rise to the occasion to defend democracy and so I Want to give you the tools to win this and the tools you're going to need his article five you can't just go to the voting booth and expect to win the war against the socialists take over\nBecause they control who's on the ballot you know they think you will vote for any career politician or any socialist\nThey put on the ballot and so you got to show them with your signature you your signatures the signature of a king you are came as a private citizen that the people who are elected there just your representatives there just your servants\nSo use your signature on the ballot use your signature on an article five amendments I plan as governor to come to every district in the state bringing my article five minutes for term limits for voter id\nFor you to sign and this is democracy this is what the founders expected us to do and we haven't been doing it because these parties have kept us from that you know Republicans and the Democrats they don't want you signing an article five minutes they want to be in charge they want to control what's in the constitution they don't want you to control it\nWe've only had twenty seven amendments you know the founders would be is founded we've only had twenty seven amendments in over two hundred years and they would be a shame you know and\nSo uh so consider me I I Know there's a lot of Republicans who just want to vote Republican and hey I'm fine with that but consider me as an exception I Am a Republican running as an independent\nOr to free the Republican Party from the socialist donor that's going to take it over and make it just like the Democrats\nSo give me a little bit of an idea out talking about uh you know the amendment some of the things that are contained in the back of the book I mean you got like these I won't call ten points if you will\nYes basically um I've got one that would create a permanent a article five constitution convention committee of the people it'll it'll work in the judiciary branch I'm Sorry the legislative branch you know you have a in the judiciary blanche you have a jury duty\nYou work in the judiciary branch where you work on jury duty well why can't we work in the other branches you know the legislator right so this will be a committee of the people they were just like jury duty be selected from your district or their sixty two districts to be fifty two people and you would go and talk to your people in your district and then you would basically\nLearn how to write an article five amendment and you present that to the committee and if there was never a two thirds vote on one of ... it would go to the state legislature that's how democracy works\nBut um you know I'm the only guy bringing that for the you know there's nobody else talking about the people in fixing the problems in this country they're they're talking about I can fix it you know I can fix a lot of things but\nYou know this isn't going to get fixed by politicians are politicians are the problem you know in my book is probably over two hundred quotes from\nDifferent politicians different presidents different founding fathers all talking about democracy all talking about the people's power and uh you know today you don't hear nobody talking about that you just hear are basically politician saying I'm the savior you know and and I believe in the party and\nYou know and um yeah I think people are catching on they're starting to see how the how bought off the media is in there all sing sing the same tune\nBecause they're reading from the same script it's George shorts a script and so if he is the enemy here and and Democrats and Republicans have to know that you know there's a lot of Democrats jumping on board with Trump because they see the socialism and the Democratic party\nAnd Democrats and Republicans have to know that you know there's a lot of Democrats jumping on board with Trump because they see the socialism and the Democratic party\nAnd it's just a matter of time before the\nRepublicans are just the same and so you know money's the enemy here George Soros has all the money in the world the way you know until we get in like all the other countries that he's tried to socialize and so now's the time to do this you know don't wait you know another four years and that they're eight years\nBecause we were just one president Hillary Clinton away from being a socialized into a transatlantic union and they got close we were to that and how would we overcome that\nOur constitutional would have changed their you know we'd have been the union with Mexico and Canada and it would just be a matter of time for our economy against so bad that we'd probably join that you you you know that store choices you drain so you know uh so uh I Do Alabama's a red state but just for this one time you know or give me\nSome consideration and the least you know investigate I mean you know Google may find out what I'm about look at my door\nYou know and and make a decision then because it's just too much at stake right now\nMichael if in fact you are to be successful and and when the governor's office here in the state of Alabama give me the top three or four issues that you would tackle first\nWell I I Want more money going per student uh for education you know a ... everyone talks about a lottery that's how we are going to fix this and usually those states that given the lotteries they don't fix the education problem were\nWere last in the state as far as the amount of money I'm Sorry last in the ... almost last in the country as far as amount of money we give students per student as far as learning and\nThere's no um ... you should be no confusion why we're almost last on average in GPA\nAnd uh you know we're almost last them salary and so I I Want to change that I don't want more money going towards the students and\nI Want to uh you know lower the corporate tax the state corporate taxes six point five at all or lower down to five because I think that's going to attract more businesses can attract more jobs high paying jobs possibly [noise] and uh you know I I don't think we need to you know pay Avi has put out I you know ads about a jobs and how you know she's brought\nShe's made a Alabama working again but\nUh you know a lot that's come from the tax cuts that the Trump gates and so I think Alabama is to hold its own way to pull its own way by lowering its own corporate state corporate tax and that's what I\nI Want to do and um [noise] you know a ... I Want to look into the department of corrections I think there's a lot of waste of money there when you have sheriff's pocketing over seven hundred thousand dollars from a from money that's supposed to be going to feed it you know inmates I think we got a problem there and I think you've got to governor who's not you know looking over\nThe money the tax money where's it going you know asking questions\nYou know I'm not saying the micro manage everything I'm just saying you know the way you know I'm a fan of a of a coach said you know I like out saving does things he he kind of does micro manage to make sure everyone's doing what they're supposed to be doing and I think we need a governor who does that you know we don't need to governor just hide out for\nWeeks on end we don't know where where they're at you know and what they're doing you know do you have to worry about that with me you know as it did you like me governor I'm going to be going out to districts I'm going to be talking to the people talking to legislators you know you can call me any time and probably get to me because you know I'm open to the people\nI Would be your service I wouldn't be your ... your Mae king as the people and so I think you know we made a change of philosophy in Washington and in the state of Alabama\nI'm you know that that's how I feel about it and that's what my books about and that's what my campaigns about\nMicro I got a few more questions for you can I add person you to hold on\nKnow that that's how I feel about it and that's what my books about and that's what my campaign\nMichael I got a few more questions for you could I oppose and you to hold on to the other side sure actually wrote a conversation with Michael Reagan these are writing candidate for governor as well as an author y'all stick around or coming right back years of experience\nAs a source of new words defeats you get to the Michael hearts show on superstation one on W.
