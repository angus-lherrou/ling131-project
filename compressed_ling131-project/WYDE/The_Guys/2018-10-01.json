[noise]\nHey Hoover thanks for listening super station one on one [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nWhat am I going to wake up call ladies and gentlemen [noise] my name is ... Baylor got [noise] um arrows today tomorrow\nFor the rest of the week for the rest of the month for the rest of the year ... we'll see eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three is they gave me around we'll see what else to do more than boys are middle fifth motivational Monday\nComing at you today so before we went to a break\nYou know we were talking about right you you know we were talking about\nDo you know we were talking about okay I'll tell you if you don't know we were talking about the bill Cosby situation because that happened last week Bill Cosby got sentenced\nAnd we were talking about what all was entail with that and excuses that people make for sexual assault and how they're just strongman arguments and all of that stuff and I'm of course my rambling starts to break because I talk too much but that's why I'm a radio host but Dylan\nHas something to say\nWhen we came back into dealing without further ado let people know air it out called me Alabama\nSo about the bill Cosby thing yeah I'm okay with the reduced sentence because it it was passed a statute of limitations all they would have to convict him on really is his admitting his confession yeah so I'm okay with the reduced Senate\nAnd then it it makes them feel more understandable because the only way you can move forward the trial\nBut in comparison to another case that happened ... years few years ago now brought Turner yeah got caught red handed in the act mhm did three months\nThe broad turned her case was one of the worst failures of our judicial system that I've ever seen I mean it was almost as bad as that ... uh believe it was a DUI thing with the ... he was driving drunk and he killed the three people\nAnd it's because he was incredibly any read it and they didn't uh eating convicted of anything or if he did he sort of\nLike a month since for three manslaughter charges like ... it was just unbelievable but that may be the only greater miscarriage of justice and what happened in the ... Turner case but you're correct abroad Turner case in comparison\nAnd now everybody tries to make that racial I don't think that's racial I think that's a bad judge and my evidence for that is the fact the judge has been recalled\nBecause of believe it happened in California and the judge has been recalled which means he's off the bench and the voters came out you had to have a vote among the general population to do that they put that on the ballot for the next election cycle following that weather recall that judge or not\nFirst came out you have to have a vote among the general population to do that they put that on the ballot for the next election cycle following that weather recall that judge or not and I think it had to get a certain number of signatures got like a hundred thousand signatures or something to get on the ballot in that county they recalled the judge she's no longer judge will never be a judge that was a horrible\nHorrible horrible ruling\nUm for a crime or rock turn or should have served should serve ten years and now the kids walking around talking about sexual assault and talking about the dangers of sexual assault and talking about all this stuff and he's writing books and stuff like that give me a break van\nGive me an absolute break like it it's just it's really sickening honestly\nBecause what what do we expect like three months is not that long and the grand scheme of things\nLike we've been doing this I think I think even in school for three months at this point it feels like I've been in school for like two weeks like ... if you permanently change I and I have said is a hundred\nThousand times and I know people are getting sick of it but I'm going to say at a hundred thousand more cars I Believe that that much if you permanently change somebody's life\nIf your actions change somebody's life forever your life should be changed forever as well\nIt's kind of like an eye for an hour philosophy which I Know we're told to not advocate for but I think it's perfectly perfectly reasonable and you are guaranteed by our constitution life liberty and property\nAnd if somebody infringes upon your life liberty or property that's the basis of criminal law that's the basis for the government comes and goes no we're going to protect everybody's ability to have life liberty and property when you violate somebody sexually you violate their life and liberty\nYour life and your liberty should be forever changed for that as well\nAm I saying you should be in prison for a life sentence no but am I saying you should get more than three months more than a year absolutely\nAlso you deserve life twenty five to life minimum students for raping someone if it can be proven yeah I Would say they would have to be proof yeah bike girl goes to the hospital gets her right get done cut out proof\nAnd he's a really interesting argument because I can see that but it would far far outweigh anything that is currently in our judicial system and I'm not talking about mandatory maximum are mandatory minimums we'll talk about mandatory maxims\nThe only maximum that's worse it's like a capital murder charge and and your ears but definitely\nI I [noise] it's a hard question because\nI think that made it the the largest amount of time you can receive for sexual assault is Twenty years I Believe and I mean there can be charged that can be placed on top of that right like aggravated battery aggravated this and so it can end up being like fifty years but\n\nI think if you've been sitting in jail for like twenty five to Thirty years ... years not months years\nI don't know\nYou have a very good point and that's the that's the stance I take him for a while because again I mean it goes straight to it if you've irrevocably change somebody's life your life should be irrevocably changed so the question\nSo Kennesaw and said as a woman and as a black woman let me tell you why I don't buy allegations that are entirely unsubstantiated and uncorroborated and why I Believe so much in the presumption of innocence\nBecause Emmett Till was killed\nHe was murdered in cold blood and burned\nBecause of an unsubstantiated uncorroborated allegation and he was just presumed guilty why is Brett Kavanaugh being presumed guilty right now because in our society he's old white heterosexual males\nThink about what else is there against him is there anything let let's just go through is there anything in his judicial record he's all white heterosexual\nThink about what else is there against him is there anything let let's just go through it is there anything in his judicial record he's all white\nHeterosexual Christian male\nYep ... and honestly is there anything in ... in his career that would say that he would do these things now is Dr Ford's testimony the same every time she's given it no it's changed every single time\nIs there any corroborating evidence for this claim no is there any testimony that validates her claim\nKnow\nYet because he's a white male and she's a woman which are just told to believe that he did it without any evidence against the Democrats have come out and they they played their hand or not I don't believe women\nWhich we've talked about why that saying just doesn't add up in any other scenario you don't just simply believe somebody you listen and then you validate or invalidate we've listened to Dr forward in her claims have been largely invalidated\nSo what changes Ellen's is saying\nIs that\nWe should learn from Emmett Till Emmett Till should never happen Emmett Till was killed because of an unsubstantiated uncorroborated allegation but yet we're not learning from it and this woman's response\nLiterally baffled me and I think it showed clearly in unequivocally how ignorant to history leftists are the radical left wing of the Democratic party because she responded to Kansas oh and saying that\nAnd she said quote well Brett Kavanaugh is not being lynched\nLet that sink in will Brett Kavanaugh as not being lynched\nThat's what she said here's the thing is Brett Kavanaugh being lynched no Kavanaugh is not being lunch I'll give her that\nBut when your response to Brett Kavanaugh being compared to Emmett Till is well Brett Kavanaugh is not being lynched it speaks volumes\nBecause you're not denying the accuracy of the allegation comparison how those allegations against him and tell and against Brett Kavanaugh or an substantially corroborated you're just talking about the punishment comparisons\nThere's a reason why Clarence Thomas when she was accused of the same thing by Anita Hill who was caught perjuring yourself five times\nSaid this is a high tech lynching\nBecause in our society right you aren't lynched\nBut when an accusation comes out against you because we do not we have thrown the judicial system out the window\nWe don't corroborate we don't validate we just listen and believe that the person that did it as a scum\nOf the earth and when we do that they lose their jobs a lot of times when they lose their jobs they lose their homes they lose their families they can never find work in their lives as Brett Kavanaugh put it\nThe times when they lose their jobs they lose their home they lose their families they can never find work in their lives as Brett Kavanaugh put their lives and their names are completely in irreparably ruined\n\nAnd you're going to tell me that the comparison you're making is well Brett Kavanaugh was not being lynched you're right he's not being lynched but his life is being ruined\nAnd you sitting here saying well you're not being lynched you're not denying the accuracy of the comparison just the severity of the unwarranted and completely unjustified punishment\n\nIt's disgusting I'm would Lindsey Graham I Hope these people never receive power because if they do it's just gonna be like Salem witch trials you throw 'em in the sink so wasn't a wedge but he's Dead Sea floats [laughter] which Gillum\nCall in largely people and that are intelligent and the Democratic party intelligent liberals intelligent moderates intelligent conservatives there\nAre there is a presumption of innocence but according to some just doesn't exist anymore\nListen you shouldn't feel bad for Brett Kavanaugh 'cause he's not being lynched that's what the left us are telling you\nNo matter that his life as being completely ruined based on unsubstantiated uncorroborated allegations are going to help out Derek on line one\nDerek how you doing or embarrassed morning or how will you only watch the mocking bird mainstream\nNews ... degree\nA steak at all yeah and you get your question I'm ... years or some kind of the drugs and you know boy uh their their

person that I've ever known to be in a psycho sexual prison Roger you\nThe only person well I'm only human\nWell that's debatable but go ahead\nYou know regarding the sexual allegations by Dr Ford against a judge Kevin or a plus yeah yeah you don't know what I'm going through or what I have been through but anyway you know I was also or in any way\nThat one question I mean I've been an

when they were in the room Kevin or mark judge\nAnd a sea Roger you're making assumptions that they are all denied even occurred\nI Know but she alleges that they asked him why Joe's yes\nShe alleges that mark judge jumped on the bed when Kavanaugh was doing whatever the sexual assault or attempted right that she thought it but she has ... he jumped on the bed why would he jumped on the bed it I mean knock them off to bed why would he jump on the bed with such force see that\nDoes well he was a raging alcoholic at that time and he has admitted to that so he was probably blackout drunk and just doing stupid stuff but we can't we can't speculate to anything without evidence\nNo but I I mean I think it was all stupid stuff but the question or whatever her name was why didn't she asked the lady why do you think he jumped on the bed\nBecause it's hearsay you can't use that in any kind of quarter investigation\nI Know but in an examining her ... and examining what her allegation was she would have to have some idea of why he jumped on the bed she saying he jumped on the bed\nThey should not have any idea why she could've said he was blackout drunk or he was trying to get in on the action or whatever they had to be some reason for him jumping on the bed or maybe maybe he rescued or you know there has to be some reason why he jumped on the bed\nYou know what I'm going we're Roger
