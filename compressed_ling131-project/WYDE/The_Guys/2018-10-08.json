W. W. dot ... dot goes a place to go\nAnd we check them out let them know the Baylor from low wakeup call sent you eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three is the number to join the conversation again that's eight six six five\nFive one Ninety nine thirty three\nSo before we went to break a I told ... and uh I was telling everybody else that you know from a legal perspective from a political perspective whenever I make an argument I like for it to not I I like to have a religious side to it right because obviously your religion influences your value set your religion influences\nAnd make an argument I like for it to not I I like to have a religious side do it right because obviously your religion influences your value set your religion influences your morals it's your ideological subset an atheist and even an atheist right they had these ideological subsets\nI mean they're not faith in a higher being but still they have these things that define how they're supposed to live as does any faith that including Christianity so I like to have an argument it's based on those states that's right I like to have that but at the same time\nI Know not everybody agrees my faith that they're for I Want to have the discussion\nFrom a non religious basis\nIs the true meaning of success serving others in making the community around you better I think it's really interesting question because my argument\nEarlier it wasn't really an argument my statement earlier my stance earlier with completely formulated around religion so if we remove religion from that\nWhat is it do eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three to join the conversation eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three to join Oregon a hop skip doc on line one skipped Doug how're you doing\nA good morning John them yeah this is these are really important uh topics on the on the matter of a serving others um\nI I Would suggest that the free market and a voluntary charities or does it does a wonderful job no matter where you are on the religious spectrum I think the markets and and charities two wonderful job um otherwise you're just sacrificing a you're you're giving up or something\nAh without much in a way of return for this world and\nAnd I wanted to talk a little bit about the um the issue of um this world this natural world\nVersus um the the supernatural world and um [noise]\nUh I I went and they can see that some you know there is a face out there that is important people are and it is in Contra distinction\nTo the real natural world there there there are side by side they really don't mix well together but uh what I Would ask is this is serious legitimate question no matter where are you on the ... or ... or religious spectrum is a very important question\nAnd it has to do a with opportunity cost we talked about this very important that are a last week it's it's very essential with our limited resources in time and the question I poses mess if you have\nThis very important value system called face\nThat resides alongside the real world how do you know when to move from one to the other how does one decide\nWhen you've prayed enough or look for enough mirror costs are spent enough time on your knees or looking and not a scientific book to deal with real physical medical problems but in the holy book and and how does one decide how to allocate their time\n[noise] um I I I think this is a it's a it's a legitimate question because\nI got an aunt or people okay great let's hear\nNot a binary everybody puts up as binary right you can either spend time in a or spend time and be the best thing I've ever heard was that I'm from a religious standpoint when you're going through your life you're supposed to be living your life in prayer and living your life in prayer me\nThis constant communication with the God you live your life with God walking among side you that's why religious people quite literally believe that God is leading you on a path\nUm uh I forget the specific birth or burst but it talks about I'm On the path that he guides me like the like that's\nLeading you on a path um uh I forget the specific birth or burst but it talks about I'm On the path that he guides me like the like that's the whole principle and that God is walking alongside you so this life isn't meant to\nBe where we put God in the box right and every like thirty minutes to an hour we look to God and then we looked at the world and we look back to God and we looked at the world we live through the lens of God with God guiding us through that\nWe go into the world that makes sense well\nA ... let me let me uh pursue this a little bit further into their ah ah you know um when you're confronted with a problem in this world yeah and you struggle\nYou have one of two choices you can I can change to pursue this in a scientific a rational fashion or do you advocate that and you can immediately look to a higher power and search for miracles\nPrayer and and that's I guess I understand that but the ... his fault but then when you pray Wendy's one decide when to give up let me ask you thinking\nAnd and and ... and ... you're valuable time and you're valuable thoughts off to the supernatural\nSo let me let me ask you a question so if somebody has cancer and they're in a cancer ward and they're being treated for cancer they're being treated by people that have read the medical textbooks are following the regiments given to them they're following the medicine but at the same time they're praying that disproves the binary you're saying because not only are they huh I'm Sorry go ahead\nSir gentleman you cannot do two things at once you cannot be thinking about doing surgery a scalpel and be imagining that the something supernatural at the same time you need to be tending to this world you cannot be distracted by something supernatural\nThe but I really I don't think it's a distraction I think the idea that you can't do two things at the same time is wrong because like we can walk and chew bubblegum at the same time you know like I I mean it just the idea that we can't be thinking about\nTwo things at once I I just think that's wrong because again when you view it through a lens right I don't view it as God's going to heal me just out of supernatural power five can survive a broken leg or I Need surgery I view it as God has blessed this person here who has the passions and have the talent and therefore has gone to medical school and has\nThis knowledge this knowledge that it's come through the world the world that God created and he threw a blessing from God is going to kill me you can look at it in the same and it's not this binary that set up to where you have to either be in God or be in the world I mean I think that bind area's really falls\nI think the dining area is essential and it really a a really a determines how this world is is going to the um pursued now um [noise] if if if the supernatural\nWay would let me let me let me ask you a question when you are so I I mean I Know we're not going to agree on this but I just want to go ahead and say that I like to hear enough I'm so\nAtheism in and of itself as a theology ... theology my apologies that was a mess that was misspoke I must be atheism in and of itself is a um it it is an idea it's an ideology right there is nothing nothing to prove\nAtheism just like there's nothing to prove religion there's nothing to disprove either so atheism in and of itself as an ideology therefore are you pursuing the world with this idea are you entering what you would call the world and this binary with the view of ideology of through your ideology\nThey prayed for that Dr right they prayed\nFor the blessing of that doctrine that Dr increased their lifespan exponentially might have also walk through with somebody who beat cancer right I've walked through the journey with them and they prayed for that Dr ... we had prayer circles where we prayed for those doctors that we're working on him\nOh we've we pray I mean you always hear whenever somebody is going into surgery we pray for the hands of the doctor to work as seamlessly as they can to work fantastic and they're there to be no mistakes et cetera you don't pray\nFor essentially just a miracle to happen and God he'll he'll young spot sometimes you do and that has happened with some people\nRight but largely enough ... it's the it's it's like the people that don't get their children vaccinated\nBecause they think God will protect them I personally think that's really stupid I think God gives us the knowledge to look and see okay this vaccination inherently helps people this vaccination that God gave somebody the mental cognition to ...\nLook and see okay this vaccination inherently helps people this vaccination that God gave somebody the mental cognition to understand and come up with this vaccination and it keeps you safer and improves your lifespan\nOne God's creations made that with the knowledge got put in his head so you should use that because scientists conclusively proven that it helps you not get sick\nRight it it's just it's it's a basic idea and so I think that binary is inherently faults and he was saying look there's scientific truth and there's and there's what religion believes and he's a two plus two equals four\nAnd I I I took some I I push back on that and then he tried to make the argument or using two plus two dozen equal for I'm not saying two plus two dozen equal for I'm seeing two plus two does equal for but two is inherently a unit of measure right we're going to have something plus two of something equals four of something\nIn that unit of measure isn't entirely\nMan made just like the construct of time but we didn't appear on this earth and then there was time like there's night and there's day that's the only time that is natural\nRight these these twenty four hour cycles we operate on I mean it has to do with the earth rotating\nRight or what we perceive it does it does have to do with the earth's rotation is not a perception of the earth's rotation it is the earth's rotation but nevertheless\nA lot of these things a lot of these contracts especially having to do with measurement are manmade\nSo Dylan you out a really good point on this was we were going to break so what do you think of that idea because ah you you took ... I saw you like pop up you're like I got this I Know the answer when he was like two plus two equals four and I was like it's actually a unit of measurement by man what do you think about that\nOkay so let's go back to the time for just a moment yeah you said that night and day is the only measure of time that we have yeah well natural measure\nI went along in that I Would even argue against that because I told me one night and day or the manmade contracts to ah\nDesignate I uh I guess would be the proper word which a side of the earth you're on that currently facing the sun or not yeah so we're just on one big ... that spinning in or orbiting a massive ball of fire\nYeah that's about where\nThe non main made a description in ... yeah\nEverything pass that that would like lead into time yeah is completely manmade night day hours minutes second ... years even that's all manmade yeah\nSo in your major I Know you do a lot having to do and you have studied this a lot a lot of having to do with numbers in calculus and things of that nature so what do you say to somebody that says like two plus two equals four obviously that's true but can you break down is that a man made measure is not a man made measure\nOkay so number systems are completely manmade there are no numbers systems out there where you can say an be valid that two plus two equals ten\nThat two plus two equals eleven mhm I think there is the only to alternate are honestly but there are alternate a number system ... number system that we currently use is known as the bass man mhm okay\nSo\nHow these work is you can look at each value as being different exponential of that base number though and depending on what you change the base to you'd have different values\nAs being different exponential of that base number though and depending on what you change the base to you'd have different values like a a\nA base to number system is all one ... zeroes ... whereas a base ten is anything from zero through nine in each place value\nAnd that makes sense because everything is alternating going\nUp by tens and I ... I really like the fact that we're able to bring that up because I think that ... and I made the claim during last conversation that a lot of atheism\nIs a faith set rise not faith and a higher power it's actually the opposite it's a faith that there is no higher power because you cannot prove God\nNor can you disapprove God just like you can't prove there is no God\nAnd you can disapprove there is no God both are\nEntirely sat around a state right you have faith that this is true and you can point to things that you say are evident cheery basis\nIs for these claims but at the end of the day to prove isn't conclusive did get thrown out in the court of law you cannot prove either beyond a reasonable doubt so the question then remains\nA ... it really strikes the heart of this binary that you can either view the world through the world through objective fact when a lot of the things we perceived to be fact art in fact man made the way that we view the world right and so this is a really really\nComplex idea but I'm Glad this conversation open up because this is something that we cannot\nOverlook\nAnd when we come back me and don't are going to try to break down the conversation of our\nOur way is service the way to success for non religious standpoint that's how we're going to close up the show we had some news to bring you but we can bring it to tomorrow I think this is a really important conversation and I want to pursue this conversation the final Fifteen\nBut we're about to get up on outta here is alive from recall chaos heating and AIR Studios Alabama license one eleven twenty this a wakeup call you're listening to the wake up call\nRaised in Alabama educated at John Carroll Sanford university you a B and Birmingham School of law you see my face off thousands of billboards but did you know that over twenty five thousand of your neighbors have trust to me when they needed help the most\nThat's what I'm thankful for I'm Alexander ...\nA man for the people I Want to be your attorney call me Alabama representations\nMaintenance quality legal services to be on your screen and that was my lawyers\nHey guys forty of 'em the Ford faction traditions of the original state expired apparel companies they offer upscale casual floating including\nShirts hats out a way of ties shores accessories was subtle stage civil West I'm guessing you probably want to represent our great yellow hammer stay real hammer supply company has a great mix of shirts jacket and even work out for the with the subtle yellow birds that we all know ah [noise]\nThey traditionally can be found at the summit in between two different Scott [noise]\nYou want to melt fat get counted and have the body you've always wanted then you need to check out science and try fitness through high intensity interval training and nutrition education I even tried to get help these trends sat and gain muscle I even tried to currently looking for forty locals who want to participate in a free six week challenge that is guaranteed to get the results [noise]\nWith that challenge you'll get accustomed meal plan personal accountability grocery list and so much more as long as you reach your weight the challenge is absolutely free contact your clothes\nThe cuts the meal plan personal accountability grocery list and so much more as long as you reach your goal wait the challenge is absolutely free contact your closest tried today to find out more spring\nThe whole family out to a Talladega super speedway for they can be I'd be a serious his twelve another tissue from a number of great options behind the scenes like guy garage tours pre race but a lot more ...\nA raid Talladega\nThose super station is coming to your home do go to one oh one W.

I cracked open on those bottles to toast\nLife fellow Irish Catholic\nBeing confirmed to the United States Supreme court I couldn't be happier for my rate I could be not I could not be happier for my

testosterone\nChanged him from being the girls said oh man\nI Am so happy with our politicians and their behavior especially college in St gram but then I I don't know what to do with myself we're not

said what are you had to say Collins where is this woman\nWhy why it didn't take long for herds don't realize that not only are true to refer to traditional Republican values and moving too old to\nMake up your tap your justice Calvin off some people might say you would be the one\nKavanaugh is going to be known for hence forward as the justice of the people and everybody's going to be happy with this guy Mike\nEverybody we're going to have somebody who actually hold up the tribes to tuition holds up the challenge to the constitutionality from wherever there's this ... for toward our founding fathers wrote down on the part summit either does or it doesn't if it does it\nIt goes back to the state and the states are going to have the power that they were intended to head they forget\nThe federal government did not make the states that states made the federal government we don't have to get back to our country was intended to be and I'm telling you sell my fellow Irish Catholic is going to be the one who ushers in\nA a golden age of the United states of America\nI could not be happier prouder\nAnd I will say this to those who have years to hear that the power of prayer is true and one of the Fifteen promises of the great glorious mother of God\nIs that you shall receive all that you ask for by praying by most holy ...\nThere were a lot is that you shall receive all that you asked for like praying most holy rosaries and as James can confirm yesterday was the defeat of the most holy rose happy the Catholic\nThank you Jim [noise]\nDumped Mariano nah I'm Sorry I Know sparkling grape juice with alcohol and I just know oh that's good\nStuff I wouldn't no no no no you know if you want to underline prompts on that and I don't know about that many bottles but\nWhen I asked D.C they asked me that's ... or ... or ... asked me to marry me that's what we had I mean it was in a park that with the ... every every anniversary ... ... ...\nNo ... no matter what it is that there was a God's outages done on the odds bottle Bush nectar neck and neck or the gods so nectar or something [noise]\nLook for somebody that drink stuff that comes in a Mason jar put a cork in it hey at least it's clear but it's clear are I just don't see just don't see Brett standing there it's clearly delicious\nYeah I hear you you know it was going on in\nThere was a a great just a great set of winter storms over the weekend one guy I forgot what his name as he is a talker on the west coast but he tweets out hey all ... breads tonight I mean it was just all stuffed those ... around out there I Know you saw some of them\nAre there's a picture of him and Grassley walking into the the Senate\nItems on fire in the ... and it made him\nA gift of I'm Brett Kavanaugh's face on stone cold Steve Austin body when he got up on the top ... beer cans together started down in ... yeah it was all Brett Kavanaugh doing it yeah oh it was good well yeah there is some goes up it was a funny weekend for means\nReally was and they're going to get better and better you know because now the Washington Post is out there screaming you know that everybody everybody is going to getting page now we're going to Pete says no page that and the integrity of the court's been called into question and\nYou know all the signs that are out there you know from from women primarily why don't you all believe anything we say blah blah blah blah blah and I just don't think people realize that you know this was not this was not you know a trial a\nFemale centered victim of salts this was a trial about the truth\nAnd you just have so many people out there they can't seem to get them through their head but then again\nYou know we're also well aware of the fact that so much of this was inspired by you know sources or ask organizations and again that's why I said I don't think that you know one of the reasons we didn't see\nMuch of the what I what I thought was going to be a bunch of writing because he's not going to put himself in that situation where he's being held responsible for the destruction of property not now he'll destroy the economy\nIt will destroy political philosophy but when it starts coming down and turn it over people's cars I think he's on a short there but ah there was enough ... you know just to kind of flavor of the weekend and there'll be more of it but you know here we are you know Kavanaugh's already been sworn in ... you know we still got roe versus Wade\nSupreme Court not to run around screaming about or\nYou know overturning that you know the court's going to do with the court's going to do because I think you know the what's interesting\nThere's this notion that every day at the time you and I get up\nThat every one of the Supreme Court justices get up at the same time they put on their robes and they go to the Supreme Court and they have their notes and their coffee and they sit around a big conference table and they just act Supreme like\nThey don't meet that frequently the majority of what they do is in the privacy of their own offices\nExtremely they don't meet that frequently the majority of what they do is in the privacy of their own officers were they write\nTheir you know dissent sort of their uh their opinion pieces then they get together and discuss them and then they discuss whether or not they need to hear him and formal proceedings you know they made on a you know most of the time they're more than twice a year sometimes only once\nAnd you know they hear the the uh the docket there's been presented before them that they've all caught the agreed upon hearing\nAnd this this whole thing about you know roe versus Wade it's extremely possible but if it was even to be brought up\nThat capital of all people might be the one to say not this time around and so you've got all these folks out there that are just screaming bloody murder as though we just ... a confirmed Donald Trump to the Supreme Court and it it's hysterical and it's ignorance\nSo anyway here we are it's relatively cool outside partly cloudy and the world goes on\nEvery single time we have had an impeachment proceeding be legitimately attempted it rips this country and that was by design the founding fathers\nYou know they knew it was an extreme measure and so just the fact that the Democrats are screaming it is an indication that they are in fact extreme and their measures because of the end of the day losing the ah\nAh the seat to Brett Kavanaugh it calls or agenda in the question because I'm a legislator perspective\nTheir policies don't make any sense and they know that they can't get them through the legislature so they have to get them through the courts and you know it's also interesting that the Democrats in the in the house in the Senate seemed to have subordinate to the Supreme Court to their own desires\nWithout realizing that that is the third branch of government is not an extension of Congress but there's a lot of Congress people out there that believe in fact\nThat the Supreme Court justices are there to represent their ideologies and nothing could be further from the truth\nThat's right that's right that's a question I asked I appreciate the engine\nYes sir thank you Don you're gay\nYou too I don't understand why so many Democrats but then again going back briefly to last week with Alexandria courthouses\nTalking about how she's going to sign a new health care legislation into law\nWell she's the ... oh wow\n... ... yeah they are like them they they are that stupid and we are that stupid for voting them into office and the first place there is no grounds for impeachment against any of these people they have to they have called for\nYou do not know how Kavanaugh is going to vote on certain pieces of legislation the majority of the legislation that they will be ruling on has not even been revealed it is all just noise\nAnd you've probably heard the phrase white noise this is black boys and it's just wild it's vicious\nAnd it's inaccurate and there's a thing they can do about it there is not a mathematical chance does not mathematically speaking zero chance of getting the super majority in the Senate because there aren't enough Senate races that are even being conducted where you have a legitimate threat\nTo a sitting Democrat or Republican\nThey can do it all day long and unfortunately the great on washed in the world are going to fall victim to this trite and it's very important to understand\nThat they are doing everything in their power to play not just the electorate but a left leaning and also very impressionable media\nHow many times and we heard stories about the media getting one pulled over their eyes because they're in the press does not make them the sharpest tools in the shed\nAnd a lot of the media and if you've ever been to these big rallies like what Trump speaking her parents or whatever you have the press pull the majority of people in these in these principles or\nTwenty five twenty six twenty eight Thirty years old and they're just banging away at the little computers sending their stories up so they can hit\nSix twenty eight Thirty years old and they're just banging away at the little computers sending their stories up so they can hit Fox dot com\nOr MSNBC or bustle or tender or wherever they might be or you know Snapchat news or whoever they're working\nFor al Jazeera you al Jazeera\nAnd so it it it's you know it's ridiculous and then you also have these these editorial board meetings that takes place on almost every newsroom in America and then they just make it come up with these narratives in these board rooms\nAnd then they dispatched these reporters with the goal of gathering information to support that viewpoint\nOver there and then they leave all these facts over here it just news reporting doesn't work that way they have completely redesigned it right before our very faces\nAnd one of the things that they are now talking about and quite loudly is the possibility of going into a a [noise] a debate over whether or not the Supreme Court the size of the Supreme Court should be increased\nFollowing the confirmation of cabinet all some Democrat activists are shifting tactics pushing for a scheme to pack or balance as they say the Supreme Court by adding to new seeds to be filled by liberal judges number one\nThat still has to be passed by Congress so all of a sudden hey we're going to get us a liberal yeah everybody's a liberal gave me a liberal hey\nHi go up there and give me a liberal it doesn't work that way either the Supreme Court expansion plot would be an acted according to their plans of Democrats retake Congress and the presidency in twenty twenty according to the plan are you kidding me\n\nWe are really going to keep this momentum which by the way was falsified up for another\nTwo years\nAnd that's the one the presumption that Trump loses out\nNow if you think that that is uh something that uh is just outlandish and farfetched\nIt was in February of Nineteen thirty seven when Franklin Roosevelt announced a plan of his own to expand the Supreme Court to Fifteen judges supposedly to make it more efficient\nCritics immediately jars that Roosevelt was trying to pack the court and us neutralize the Supreme Court justices who are hostile to his new deal folks if you don't read history\nThen what's happening today seems to be so unbelievably historically unique\nBut it's not during the previous two years\nThe high court this was his entire by the way in his time had struck down several key pieces of Roosevelt new deal legislation on the grounds that the laws or delegated an unconstitutional matter of authority to the executive branch and the federal government sound familiar\n\nThe only difference here is that Roosevelt wants to pack the court to enact legislative I'm Sorry executive policy this time around it's to support legislative ideologies if in fact the Democrats win\nHis own party denounced it\nHis own party said that it was outlandish\nBefore the bill even came to vote in Congress to the Supreme\nHe said that it was outlandish\nBefore the bill even came to vote in Congress to the Supreme Court justices came over to the other side of the liberal side and by a narrow majority up held a piece of legislation that was key to Roosevelt now despite the fact\nThat the Supreme Court and the Congress first off the Supreme Court to pitch wedded to a degree the Congress shot it down but the point was still made\nThe point was made by Roosevelt that the executive branch would be willing to attack the Supreme Court if necessary and that's why these judges began to uh give away to some of his ideologies and policies\nBut this still has to be voted on by Congress\nAnd even in that time but with the majority in the house it was shot down in flames\nBecause of the Congress understands that their relationship between the courts and the executive branch and the legislative branch there's got to be walls or if you will there are constitutional safeguards built in and we cannot allow the Supreme Court\nTo become the lap dog of either of the other two branches and especially the two combined\nSo again more political saber rattling that has its roots rooted in the past and if you are familiar with the past then the president's as I have preached for the better part of the last decade makes significantly more sense\nBecause you begin to see them dusting off the same tired old strategies that they've used in the past when they were not able to\nActually get their own ideology is passed because some of them are so outlandish ... ridiculous phones are open
