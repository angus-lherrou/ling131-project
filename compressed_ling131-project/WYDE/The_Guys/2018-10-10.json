D to forty eight\nWe're going to talk about some of the reaction that happened following the boat and some of the hysteria\nJust a blatant hysteria that happened we got a Facebook Live stream going right now if you want to check that out Baylor coach just type in the name of the first name that pops up so let's talk about this whole Brett Kavanaugh confirmation situation so Brett Kavanaugh again\nAfter a long contentious debate was confirmed with the vote of fifty two forty eight and ... Democrats handled his well did the left handled as well absolutely not absolutely not\nThey were quite literally going crazy I I don't know how to put it there are people that were scratching on the doors of the Supreme Court trying to pry them open banging on the doors and it just made no sense whatsoever\nOr the way they were acting but this is not new I I mean honestly this is what I was expecting you know what's a bold production and Hillary Clinton said or somebody in the Democratic party that's high up I and maybe it was Hillary Clinton I Can't remember said something of this in this way\nClinton said or somebody in the Democratic party that's high up I and maybe it was Hillary Clinton I Can't remember said something of this\nIn this way prior to the twenty sixteen election they said if Democrats lose than their temperament will be a lot better than Republicans right well here's the thing is Brett Kavanaugh would not have been confirmed hadn't been for a reason\nThat had a factual basis or had it been that the majority of senators didn't agree with him I don't think Republicans would have been outside the Supreme Court charging through police\nAnd scratching and banging at the walls of the Supreme Court I Do not think that would have happened I think you only see this kind of hysteria from far left leftist groups that are taking over the mainstream of the Democratic party\nSo but let's talk about it the vote was fifty to forty eight Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed he was placed on the Supreme Court as it should have been\nBut what happened there was a lot of fall out a lot of follow including yes she won't go away Hillary Clinton who came out and said quote in an interview following the whole Brett Kavanaugh confirmations scenario she came out and said quote\nYou cannot be civil with the political party that wants to destroy what you stand for\nWhat you care about and to quote let me just say this right now\nThis right here if this is the Democratic mindset nothing will be accomplished honor bipartisanship I don't think it is\nThis is a really scary precedent that's being set because it saying that any allegation of sexual assault is the same as a conviction any no no no a step further any allegation made by a woman of any kind is a conviction\nThat's what's being said when we simply say that women must be believed since when does your gender affect the validity of your opinions the validity of your claims\nHere's a spoiler alert it doesn't\nAnd this president as being set during the Kavanaugh's confirmation that we are simply to believe women instead of listening and validating\nIs one that is really frightening and when people like Hillary Clinton come out and they say quote you cannot be civil with\nThe political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's almost just as scary as the idea that we're just going to do away with this idea of the presumption of innocence\nThe fallout from Kavanaugh's confirmation has showed Democrats has caused Democrats to show their hands and if you're not terrified at the idea of them getting power and them instituting laws\nYou should be\nTaken to a local scenario and the state of Tennessee\nRight Marsha Blackburn Phil Bredesen really contentious race you even have superstars like Taylor Swift commenting on it Phil Bredesen is a moderate Democrat Phil Bredesen votes moderate a lot of things but he still supports things like single payer healthcare\nDemocratic philosophies Marsha Blackburn is you're telling the party line Republican\nRight a lot of moderates and a lot of moderate Republicans may have voted for breakfast and because people outside of Tennessee don't really understand brothers and present time when he held power in Tennessee was a good time\nIt it was very beneficial\nFor the state people like Phil Bredesen but\nNobody's going to vote for Phil Bredesen this was interesting this isn't my opinion I talked to many people from different demographics different socioeconomic levels and different age groups that fall moderate and fall Republican and the moderates that don't vote on\nPartisanship they vote on policy were reticent may have some better policies and Blackburn were saying there's\nThat don't vote on partisanship they build a policy were reticent may have some better policies and Blackburn were saying there's no way we built for Brett is\nBecause the Democrats getting power right now based off of the actions in the cabinet confirmation or terrifying\nSo if I can encourage you anything based off of what we saw in the cabinet confirmation most on the Democrats absolutely ruining somebody's life with no corroboration and no validation whatsoever\nDon't let this becomes the norm\nStand for what's right\nAnd the words of Abraham Lincoln a paraphrase those or those who are silent when they should speak make cowards out of men\nDon't be silent when you should speak stand up to the lunacy stand up to the bad precedent in say no we're not going to agree with that we're not going to stand for that\nGo vote the midterms are coming up you need\nTo vote because if you don't vote this idea that the presumption of innocence no longer matters and this idea that there's no civility in politics anymore that you must have destroy somebody who's wanting to destroy something you care about Hillary Clinton you can't work with them\nThat's what set to get in power based on historical precedent based on historical precedent there is going to be one of the houses of Congress\nFlip don't let it

I'm Sorry I'm just upset at the Supreme Court but there were also Democrats\nThat I kid you not I I I saw it coming whenever you said Baylor what's the stupidest thing somebody could said say as a result of the cabinet confirmation I thought it but I was like nobody would say anything that stupid so I'm not even going to say\nOf your day did you see the fact that they found out they saw there's actual proof of this deal and don't call me crazy now George Soros funded fusion GPS\nIs broken the Daily Caller over the weekend a spokesperson for Soros confirmed it that he funded fusion GPS and where is funded where what is fusion GPS again it is where essentially the steel die ca came from\nThat was in large part the reasoning for the size of warrants on Carter Page that caused the Russia investigation so we're going to follow it all the way back through his money convoluted waters who was working together to prompt investigation\nInto Donald Trump this investigation that yielded absolutely\nNothing George Soros in Hillary Clinton now people that claim that from the beginning ain't looking so crazy are we are we\nEight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three let's go to Derrick on line to Derek how you doing\nAre we are we\nEight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three let's go to Derrick online to Derek how you doing\nOne Baylor good morning I'm hey I I just wonder if that were in the ... where we've got to have some on the punishment for are just as effective\nIn what in what regard the protestors because Amy Schumer wasn't cops and it was a sight to see man\n[laughter] I'm thinking that the some of the people behind the protesting and uh the Dianne Feinstein who did some funny business with the leaks and [laughter]\nI'm for it all man complete complete reset um down for that literally everybody in Washington right now other than Trump and the Trump Administration let's just say let's start over maybe you can leave a couple of people like Grassley in like Lindsey Graham two point oh and a couple of other people\nBut like Ninety nine percent of them let's just go alright\nTime's up we're going to like new people I'm Down\nWell I think it has to be more than that I think it has to be more if you committed treason than you need to be charged for it\nYeah that makes sense doesn't uh Derek it's funny how that doesn't work in our society\nIt it it's extremely frustrating seeing people break the law over and over and over again or there's a funny tape about Hillary lie perjuring yourself about a is an old land deal this is years ago and there's video proof of what she said to the contrary\nWell see Derrick I I'm Sorry your mistaken but the law only applies to you if you're a Republican don't you know and the words of Sarah Palin don't\nWe make such ... makes such a lousy protests just because we always have to go to work [laughter]\nGot to pay them taxes right got to fund the Democrat somehow eight six six bought five one Ninety nine thirty three appreciate you there\nBut like All right do you like that don't go to fund them somehow\nBecause they have to be drawing unemployment but to draw unemployment isn't a requirement that you have to have been employed at some point isn't that a requirement you can't like just turned Eighteen and started drawing unemployment\nSo maybe they're not even drawing unemployment 'cause I'm not convinced some of these people would be able to get let alone hold the job\nI don't know what's going to Mars on line three mark how ya doing\nDoing All right yeah you didn't have to show proof that you were unemployed because your employer pays into unemployment insurance hats and I thought but ah\n[laughter] Alyssa mulatto by the way we got her start in a TV show called I Believe it was who's the boss with Tony dance or back\nIn the eighties [laughter] [noise] no idea\nAnd very attractive young lady she didn't really do anything else until she got into a TV show called charm that was in the mid nineties I which they're rebooting and I honestly have no care to matter of fact Rosen a gallon if you see that name she was on that show charmed as well\nOh those social justice warriors now and she's like cut off our hair or something stupid but anyway\nI'm going back to Hillary Clinton and and you know her comments that you can't work with people that want to destroy everything you believe in\nThe [noise] she is actually telegraphing it's not so much I mean she is talking to her base and she's talking to her fellow resist stores um\nBut she's if if we listen on the right if all we on the conservative side of things listen to what she's saying\nBut she's if if we listed on the right before we on the conservative side of things listen to what she's saying it explains the fact that not a single Democrat is willing to work with President Trump\nYeah I mean Joe mansion because he's trying to get reelected that's the only reason he voted in favor of capping off you know um\nBut she is absolutely without a doubt telegraphing\nThe fact that and it and the biggest thing about Brett Kavanaugh isn't so much because they know he can't he can't just turn overturn roe v Wade ... but it's what he represents and Brett Kavanaugh what do you read them or disagree and I have issues with this whole precedence thing\nEspecially when the actual written law says something different than what precedent as yet but\nHe represents the rule of law as a guy who is follows the rules as a guy who works off of what has been done before him of the examples and everything's set before him he represents order not chaos he represents the rule of law\nAnd they fear that more than anything because that's the biggest hindrance to their agenda and trying to destroy our Republican create their democracy and human and and that's that's the biggest problem and then George Soros real quick before I go yeah uh\nYou know that the issue is I mean yeah he's funding a lot most of the Democrats\nThe real story though is who are the Republicans taking money from him people like Marco Rubio John McCain John McCain we should replace Benedict Arnold with John McCain\nThe fact that he participated in the Steele dossier had literally had a hand on the pilots self made him a traitor to this country and he was on the take with a source funded groups and there are several other Republicans probably look at that gang of eight\nYou know try to stop any border progress is that's the real story because we can't rely on Democrats ran against say refuse to

All right you all stick around ... ...\nTalking about what to do with the FBI if anything we're going to be joined by expert or his name is Mike ... goes Robin nickname Thomas Paine\nWill records down with him on the other side you're listening to the my guard show so y'all sticker wrap it up as well as we continue to monitor what is going on and we're well with category for hurricane Michael that is expected to make landfall shortly after launch today\nWill be bad bet your report ... say look\nMy my family is and um because they really smear yeah I mean what happened to cab at all um is a microcosm of what happened to me and my family and um\nUh it's nothing new it's the same old tactics or the ... had been using these tactics for a long time so that's basically it I mean there's gonna be some stuff coming out in this book that's\nReally damaging to the deep state people say the deep state doesn't exist as I worked for the deep state but it's a bunch of bull crap if it does exist\nSo you are suggesting in the book then that the FBI and the department of justice are are both corrupt organizations\nWere beyond corrupt organizations that this current rate without some major\nCatalysts um the it's they're not ... terrible need to be the FBI FBI well would need to be broken up then fragment or adapt to other intel agencies if if Trump doesn't do something I think Trump is is\nTrying to trying to rein it in he's got so much on his plate or this book light helped him a what's coming out of the book the the White House was aware of was\nForwarded everything to the White House that doesn't come as a surprise because there's some pretty nasty things in there\nAnd it has to do with the state department to and and the agency is well John Brennan and all the all these players all these same guys that are popping up and hammering Trump and it's the same could\nBall Eric Holder or Brennan call me we're all in the same club and um you know\nOur expertise is uncovering things that nobody else could fly it and that's where all the stuff coming out in this book has been in the media of the stuff you see on Fox News talking about FBI corruption that's all well and good but this stuff has another level\nMight help us understand a little bit more because you know you mentioned some names you know of course holder and sat around that you know we're very well\nA familiar with you know we've been covering these guys for many many years but people banter the term\nDeep state around very frequently you just saw it means corruption in government to others that means older ... you know I mean it it seems to have so many kind of you know are just kind of on the descriptive zone but if you will can you help ... assuming that we are laypeople\nCan you further elaborate on the deep state what it means in who it is it's I Would certainly think it would have to be a matter of people that were not familiar with\nAs as well as the ones that we are\nYeah well I think that the easiest way to explain it is like anything else if you had an organization or that had a set of rules let's say our rules or the constitution and the laws of the country\nAnd there have been people in place and disorganization who have decided that they're not going to follow those rules are going to do things that are all away so there's ... ... when you use the deep state of Maine is a great point a great question because people are like deep state deep state deep state\nThe state is basically\nA road group of people who've decided to do things that are all the way and sabotage anybody else who tries to change it so it could be\nI mean you see this and other organizations you see it in clubs and and groups there's always a a couple of people who spin off and try to do things wrong way and take things over\nAnd that's pretty much what the deep state has but these folks have their hands all\nI'm all in and on\nAnd they can make your life a living hell if you try to do\nTheir hands all I'm all in and on\nIntelligence and they can make your life living hell if you try to do something or outside of their box and something that's going to embarrass them and I think that's why you're seeing a lot of people\nUm attack Trump a lot of the FBI directors the CIA directors are all combat against Trump because they have since to hide it and a guy like Trump is not really beholden to this group\nSo you're more apt to expose\nThe deep state and the deep state goes from one administration to another it doesn't\nIt's you know as you get a Republican president like under Bush but Democratic president like Obama heap steak stays the same guys are are all the all the same guys they're institutionalized and and that's what makes it dangerous they really don't\nUm they work for their own interests against the interests of America is I think that's the best way to explain\nIt I don't I don't mean to put you on the spot but since I saw this last night have you ever seen the movie a with Liam Neeson the Eighteen\nOr was he in the eight to ... while he was in the movie yeah the\nReason I'm asking that is there's a scene where the CIA is involved with the black operations group called black forest\nWhere they're trying to get these plates are\nYou know the the um I I don't know how it is but you know they're they're utilized for the purposes of our printing money and the CIA is trying to steal woman the black ops groups trying to steal 'em in the Eighteen trying to steal them declare their name and you've got all these operatives within the actual government and operatives that are contractors\nThat are you working behind the scenes in it it's a you know it's a shoot 'em up and I realize there's a lot of poetic license there\nBut when I'm hearing from you is that there is a\nKind of a a a sense of accuracy about some of the things that go on behind the scenes that there are people that we view publicly as though they are some kind of servants who America but that are working the kind of a more of a rogue sense is that what I'm gathering\nThat's true I mean\nA lot of people are familiar with fusion GPS in the last couple of years absolutely been in the nineties I created the first fusion GPS Nineteen Ninety six those my group when I left journalism we created a a a a group of\nAn ex federal agents and ex journalist\nAnd uh we were rolling into do we we couldn't turned out work was coming in so fast and we did a lot of stuff that was you look back on it and I was younger I was in my twice so the money was coming in and I'm like this is this is great\nBut you look back on it now this is Thirty years ago and I'm saying wait a minute we should that should have done a lot of there's a lot of this stuff it was borderline there's a lot of jobs or you know you called black bag ... jobs we did nasty stuff and so it exists and now\nPeople focus on fusion GPS but there are hundreds of these companies right Andre hundreds I mean I went back in the journalism and try to clean it up\nAnd tried to write some of the wrong side I did in my life and that's why this book out because I Want to be honest with you it's like\nLet's settle the score with the FBI and the O. J. that came after me and it's like okay so we're gonna come after you now that's that's one but two\nI'd like to do some good to make up for some of the things I did earlier in my career that similar to things you describe it as some of those things are shown on TV and and some of them aren't really nasty stuff that they don't go to the movies\nSo we'll get into some of that too but in in the book but\nAnd some of them are really nasty stuff to go to the so we'll get into some of that too and and the book but yeah you bring up a good point it's not\nThat far off a that was on yeah good but\nI was just saying I Am tired of the break I'm Out of time for this segment but I have several more questions for you can I oppose want you to hold on for a quick commercial yes\nX. around the conversation with a might more here is the author of how we dismantle the FBI in our pajamas stick around quick break and come right back with Amazon\nWhat are you in the room ... it's the Michael hearts show\nHey guys his age or from the lines of storm season can be inexpensive sees it that's why legacy roof contractors is here with free\nRoof inspections they should be your first call if you call your insurance company first they charge you for a claim whether or not you have roof damage causing your insurance to go a legacy will not only do it honest inspection but they are proven to help W why the listeners to get the most for their insurance claims called two oh five six eight three\nThirty three eighty three or visit legacy Ruth dot com mentioned W Whitey for free blown insulation with your new roof [noise]\nThe home places but keeping homebuyers happy says Nineteen sixty nine with quality sales and service now is the time to look for your dream home during the home places display modeled soon\nYou'll find great prices [noise] the whole place has a great selection of deer valley home deer valley and the heaviest home built buying a house is the single most important investment you'll never me to be your dream of homeownership reality\nThe whole place is committed to helping you in every way\nWhether you're a young couple just hardly got bored eat several bedrooms for the kids find more planets just write them down to the time to look for your dream home during the home places display bottles through the whole place conveniently located exit two eighty on my sixty five or your hand on his belly parkway and it's the home plate\nSince Nineteen sixty nine [noise]\n[laughter]\nAnd walk them back into the conversation where Mike More is the author of how we dismantle the FBI in our pajamas might\nIn addition to doing this radio program I Am also a a published author I I'm a historian I Believe that you can't really understand the news of the day if you don't understand that the ... the history of this country the true history of this country\nAnd water the the errors in American history that I had been most fascinated with her over the years is going back into the light Nineteen fifties and sixties specifically the Kennedy administration the assassination et cetera", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Guys", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "10"}
